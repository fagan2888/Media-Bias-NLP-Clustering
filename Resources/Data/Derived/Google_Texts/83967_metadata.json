Rand Paul has taken yet another swing at Gov. Chris Christie \u2014 this time over Obamacare.\n\nPaul, a Republican from Kentucky, was asked during an interview on CNN on Tuesday whether Christie and former Gov. Jeb Bush are conservatives. All three are possible rivals for the Republican nomination for president in 2016.\n\n\"I don't think any one person gets to decide what is or what isn't conservative,\u201d Paul told host Erin Burnett. \"On the case of the New Jersey governor, I think embracing Obamacare, expanding Medicaid in his state is very expensive and not fiscally conservative.\"\n\nChristie chose to expand the government health care program under President Obama's Affordable Care Act \u2014 making New Jersey one of the few states with a Republican governor to do so.\n\n\"Many Republican governors I would say are conservative did resist expanding and accepting Obamacare in their states,\" Paul said. \"That fact, I would say, would lead towards you making the conclusion that it is not a very conservative proposal.\"\n\nDuring his state budget address in February, Christie stressed that he is \"no fan of the Affordable Care Act\" but added that expanding Medicaid was \"the smart thing to do for our fiscal and public health.\"\n\nHe said the move is expected to save the state $227 million a year by enrolling 104,000 low-income people into Medicaid, beginning in January.\n\nChristie and Paul traded words through the media in an ongoing argument earlier this year \u2014 about government spying, federal aid, and more.\n\nPaul has stepped up his attacks since Christie was re-elected in a landslide Nov. 5, increasing speculation that the governor is a strong presidential contender. But Christie has not responded.\n\nThe two represent the increasingly divided factions of the national Republican party \u2014 Christie being more moderate and Paul leaning toward more conservative views.\n\nA spokesman for Christie's office did not respond immediately to a message seeking comment today.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Rand Paul continues his anti-Christie rampage\n\n\u2022 More Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2016-presidential-election, chris-christie, obamacare, news", "title": "Rand Paul continues to criticize Chris Christie, calls him out on Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "U.S. Sen.
