Michael Douglas believes young American actors are lacking in masculinity and are too image-obsessed to hone their craft, unlike British and Australian actors who are grabbing up the American roles.

“There’s something going on with young American actors — both men and women — because the Brits and Australians are taking many of the best American roles from them,” the 56-year-old “Wall Street” actor told The Independent.

“Clearly, it breaks down on two fronts. In Britain, they take their training seriously, while in the States, we’re going through a sort of social-media, image-conscious thing rather than formal training. Many actors are getting caught up in this image thing, which is going on to affect their range,” Mr. Douglas said.

“With the Aussies, particularly with the males, it’s the masculinity. In the U.S., we have this relatively asexual or unisex area with sensitive young men, and we don’t have many Channing Tatums or Chris Pratts, while the Aussies do,” he added. “It’s a phenomena.”

Mr. Douglas also addressed comments made by Dustin Hoffman, who said recently that the film industry is the “worst it has ever been.”

“I understand what he’s saying, but I think you have to look at the delivery system,” Mr. Douglas told The Independent. “There’s a lot of good stuff being made in the cable area, good writing there. ‘Kramer vs. Kramer,’ those great mainline films he was in aren’t being made anymore [for cinema] but are in a different delivery system.

“Most of the great screen writers have gone into the cable area because that’s where they can also produce,” he said. “The problem in making a film for cinema is the cost of distribution. People can scrape together money for a movie but not the advertising.”

Mr. Douglas stars as Dr. Hank Pym in “Ant-Man,” which hits theaters on July 17.
