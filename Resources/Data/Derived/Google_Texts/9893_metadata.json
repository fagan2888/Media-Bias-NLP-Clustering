Clearly, the elephant in the room was going to get a mention, and the dumped were going to get a lesson from a very high-profile recent dumpee.\n\nUntil quite recently, Abramson was one of the most powerful individuals in journalism. But all that changed last week when she was, as she might put it, abruptly \u201cdumped\u201d as editor of the New York Times. What followed was a media frenzy, and a barrage of speculation about what the dismissal said about sexism, women in the workplace and pay equity \u2014 and some fascinatingly self-aware dispatches from within the belly of the beast itself. But on Monday, Abramson \u2014 a woman who has been described as \u201cbrusque,\u201d \u201cstubborn\u201d and, mostly notoriously, \u201cpushy,\u201d told the new graduates of Wake Forest University what she has learned, and what she\u2019s continuing to learn in the midst of a defining moment in her career.\n\nIt was most certainly not exactly the speech she\u2019d originally envisioned when she agreed to give the commencement speech. Her original version reportedly focused more on media freedom, a topic she barely touched on in her 11-minute address. Last week, university president Nathan Hatch affirmed his support for her appearance, noting, \u201cI cannot think of a better message for the Class of 2014 than that of resilience. Jill Abramson\u2019s accomplishments speak for themselves, and I am confident she will have an inspiring and timely message for our graduates.\u201d\n\nIt was indeed timely, as she addressed a crowd facing a difficult and uncertain job market. She acknowledged, \u201cWhat\u2019s next for me? I don\u2019t know. So I\u2019m in exactly the same boat as many of you. Like you, I\u2019m a little scared, but also excited.\u201d And while she kept mostly away from the subject of the most recent turn of events in her career, she acknowledged other female leaders including Nan Robertson, Katharine Graham and Anita Hill, and admitted, \u201cSure, losing a job you love hurts.\u201d\n\nIt was a high-road performance, one in which Abramson tried to acknowledge the crowd and not the speaker, graciously stating, \u201cI think the only real news here today is your graduation from this great university.\u201d USA Today called the speech \u201ca bravura performance,\u201d but not everyone was entirely convinced. Writer and student Danielle K. Nelson, who was in attendance, wrote Monday on Twitter that she was \u201cunderwhelmed by Abramson\u2019s speech,\u201d adding, \u201cIs resilience rly the lesson to learn here? Are women supposed to be resilient in face of sexist discrim?\u201d As one who graduated a long time ago and has two daughters I will one day send into the workforce, I don\u2019t know how to reply to that except maybe, yeah. I\u2019m truly sorry, but I think it is. I wish to God that all these years later, there could be a different message to tell, but not yet. Maybe you will be a great worker or maybe you will find yourself canned one day because you suck, but the obstacles are going to be there. They will be there for everyone of every color and gender and class and orientation, but there will be many more of them along the way for some of us than others and that\u2019s just the way the deck is stacked. And the more obstacles there are in your particular path, the more resilient you are going to have to be. That\u2019s not an observation someone like Abramson makes flippantly. That\u2019s one that comes in the wake of a lot of epic disappointments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An elegant commencement speech reveals the power of defeat", "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "An elegant commencement speech reveals the power of defeat", "title": "Jill Abramson: Patron saint of the dumped", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/19/jill_abramson_patron_saint_of_the_dumped/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/jill_abramson4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An elegant commencement speech reveals the power of defeat", "creator": "@embeedub", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/jill_abramson4.jpg", "title": "Jill Abramson: Patron saint of the dumped", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Jill Abramson: Patron saint of the dumped", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, commencement speech, Jill Abramson, Journalism, Media, New York Times, wake forest university, women", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8421\"", "article_summary": "Topics: commencement speech, Jill Abramson, Journalism, Media, New York Times, wake forest university, women, Life News\u201cI\u2019m talking to anyone who has been dumped,\u201d Jill Abramson told the crowd.\nBut all that changed last week when she was, as she might put it, abruptly \u201cdumped\u201d as editor of the New York Times.\nUntil quite recently, Abramson was one of the most powerful individuals in journalism.\nClearly, the elephant in the room was going to get a mention, and the dumped were going to get a lesson from a very high-profile recent dumpee.\nAnd the more obstacles there are in your particular path, the more resilient you are going to have to be."}
