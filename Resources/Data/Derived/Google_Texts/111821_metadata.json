If Obama were really serious, they said, he would work with Republicans on workplace flexibility legislation already in Congress.\n\n\"It's unfortunate that President Obama and the Democrats see women only as an electoral opportunity,\" said Kirsten Kukowski, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.\n\nAlthough some companies offer paid family leave, the 1993 Family Medical Leave Act requires only that employers provide unpaid leave for medical and family reasons.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) have introduced legislation that would require employers to provide as much as 12 weeks of paid leave for medical and family reasons. The national program would be financed through a trust fund in the Social Security payroll deductions on employees and employers.\n\nObama has not endorsed the bill, but a spokesman for DeLauro said the lawmaker has encouraged Obama to back the proposed legislation, even though he had pledged during his 2008 campaign not to raise taxes on families making less than $250,000 a year.\n\nThe U.S. is the only developed country that doesn't offer paid maternity leave, Obama said, and he urged employers to change their policies.\n\n\"That is not the list you want to be on,\" he said.\n\nSix years ago, after taking the reins as president, Obama instituted six weeks of paid leave for his workers who have newborns or ailing family members or who are sick or injured. He doesn't have the power to extend paid leave to all federal workers without congressional approval.\n\nOn Monday, the president pledged to sign a memorandum directing federal agencies to allow workers to adjust their work schedules without fear of retaliation. Another initiative would require the Labor Department to make quality child care available to people enrolling in job-training programs.\n\nObama said he's now lucky to \"live above the store\" at the White House, enabling him to have dinner with his family most nights. He said he was lucky in his daughters' early years because he was able to take time off work to be there for \"the 2 a.m. feeding,\" just \"getting to know them and making sure they know me.\"\n\nObama took four working parents to lunch at a Chipotle restaurant before his address, and he later met with business leaders who have adopted family-friendly policies.\n\n\"Part of the purpose of this summit is to make clear you're not alone,\" Obama said, adding that these problems \"cannot just be fixed by working harder or being a better parent. All too often, they're the result of outdated policies and old ways of thinking.\"\n\nrebratek@latimes.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obama urges Congress and employers to expand benefits for families", "date": "2014-06-23", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "President Obama urged Congress and employers to broaden benefits for families, arguing that paid leave for new parents and good-quality child care are basic needs for today's workforce, not \"frills.\"", "title": "Obama urges Congress and employers to expand benefits for families", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-obama-working-families-20140624-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53a8decf/turbine/la-fi-obama-working-families-20140624", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "President Obama, family leave, child care, working families, midterm elections, Rep.
