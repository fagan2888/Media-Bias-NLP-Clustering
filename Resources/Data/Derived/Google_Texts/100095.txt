A new parody rap video released Thursday encourages individuals to enroll in President Barack Obama’s signature health care program.

The video, featuring an actor playing President Barack Obama, is a spoof of rapper Snoop Lion’s “Drop It Like It’s Hot.”

“So don’t stand and diddle,” the actor playing Obama raps in the video. “My healthcare’s the ‘shizzle.’ It’s chock full of top notch healthcare ‘provizzles.’”
