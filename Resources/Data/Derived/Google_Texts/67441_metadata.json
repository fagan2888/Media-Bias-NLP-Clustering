If your answer happens to be Europe\u2019s most powerful ultra-rightist, antisemitic party, you\u2019re right.\n\nParliamentarians from Hungary\u2019s three largest parties are in Washington, and the second largest is Jobbik, a neo-fascist party that won 20 percent of the vote in a recent national election. A shadowy lobbying group has arranged the visit, which is cloaked in mystery, but the fact alone that Jobbik is trying to build ties in Washington should be cause for alarm.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJobbik is cultivating extremism both in Hungary, where Prime Minister Victor Orban grows evermore authoritarian, and in the European Parliament, where extremist, far-right parties have formed a bloc. Across the continent, a resurgence of ultra-nationalism and neo-fascism threatens the rights and safety of ethnic, racial, and religious minorities. Along with Greece\u2019s Golden Dawn, Jobbik is the bloody tip of Europe\u2019s far-right spear.\n\nJobbik has ascended largely on the strength of its vicious anti-immigrant, anti-Roma agenda. Its leader, Gabor Vona, recently criticized Fidesz, Orban\u2019s ruling party, for ignoring the \u201cproblem\u201d of Roma living together with the mainstream population. The parliamentarian who will represent Jobbik in DC helped found the now banned Hungarian Guard, a paramilitary group that used to storm through villages inciting violence against Roma as it recruited members for Jobbik.\n\nAntisemitism is also inherent to Jobbik, which is thriving in a country where, according to a 2013 poll, 50 percent of Jews have considered emigrating because they feel unsafe. A few examples of Jobbik\u2019s anti-semitism: A Jobbik mayor claimed Jews controlled the country and called for the execution of several liberal politicians; a Jobbik parliamentarian, in the name of national security, called for the creation of a list of Jews serving in the government; the head of Jobbik\u2019s youth arm recently complained about a mandatory class on the Holocaust at a Hungarian Catholic University.\n\nDespite declaring a \u201cno tolerance\u201d policy on anti-semitism, Prime Minister Orban generally hasn\u2019t challenged the extremism of Jobbik; on the contrary, he\u2019s co-opted many components of its agenda, exploiting the very hatreds on which Jobbik subsists. The policy research outfit Political Capital compiled a list of ten Jobbik proposals that Fidesz implemented at least in part. These include efforts to whitewash Hungary\u2019s role in the Holocaust, crack down on immigrants, reinstate the death penalty, and strengthen ties to authoritarian regimes.\n\nOrban\u2019s embrace of Jobbik\u2019s policies is part of a broad increase in repression under his rule. He\u2019s changed the constitution to increase his power and restricted the ability of civil society activists and independent journalists to operate freely. He\u2019s not coy about his intentions; he\u2019s declared his desire to create an \u201cilliberal state\u201d within the Russian sphere of influence, and he\u2019s well on his way, as evidenced by Vladimir Putin\u2019s visit to Budapest earlier this year and a massive energy deal with Russia.\n\nHungary is an important ally for the United States, and in the past year senior U.S. officials from President Obama on down have expressed their concerns about Orban\u2019s leadership. They should continue to do so. They shouldn\u2019t allow a charm offensive from Hungarian politicians to soften their support for human rights and Hungarian democracy. Hungarians deserve better.\n\nAs Jobbik gains power both in Hungary and the EU, Vona has been trying to give his party a makeover, downplaying its racism in favor of an anti-corruption message. But policy makers in Washington, whose validation Jobbik seeks, shouldn\u2019t be fooled.\n\nPolicymakers shouldn\u2019t meet with a member of this extremist, antisemitic party. There\u2019s no place for antisemitism in Europe, and there\u2019s no place for it in Congress. And if they meet with the Fidesz parliamentarian, they should grill him on his party\u2019s Jobbik-lite policies. They should ask: if you rub off the ugly stain of Jobbik\u2019s blatant racism, is there a significant difference between Jobbik and Fidesz?\n\nStahnke is Human Rights First\u2019s vice president for research and analysis.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Along with Greece\u2019s Golden Dawn, Jobbik is the bloody tip of Europe\u2019s far-right spear.", "description": "Along with Greece\u2019s Golden Dawn, Jobbik is the bloody tip of Europe\u2019s far-right spear.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Along with Greece\u2019s Golden Dawn, Jobbik is the bloody tip of Europe\u2019s far-right spear.", "title": "Don\u2019t be duped by Hungarian extremists", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/247877-dont-be-duped-by-hungarian-extremists", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/247877-dont-be-duped-by-hungarian-extremists", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-14T18:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Tad Stahnke", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-14T18:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/247877-dont-be-duped-by-hungarian-extremists", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Along with Greece\u2019s Golden Dawn, Jobbik is the bloody tip of Europe\u2019s far-right spear.", "card": "summary", "title": "Don\u2019t be duped by Hungarian extremists"}, "dcterms.title": "Don\u2019t be duped by Hungarian extremists"}, "article_summary": "They shouldn\u2019t allow a charm offensive from Hungarian politicians to soften their support for human rights and Hungarian democracy.\nAcross the continent, a resurgence of ultra-nationalism and neo-fascism threatens the rights and safety of ethnic, racial, and religious minorities.\nThe policy research outfit Political Capital compiled a list of ten Jobbik proposals that Fidesz implemented at least in part.\nBut policy makers in Washington, whose validation Jobbik seeks, shouldn\u2019t be fooled.\nThey should ask: if you rub off the ugly stain of Jobbik\u2019s blatant racism, is there a significant difference between Jobbik and Fidesz?"}
