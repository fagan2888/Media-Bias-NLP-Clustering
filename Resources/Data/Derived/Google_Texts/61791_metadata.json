The Affordable Care Act was \u201cthe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back,\u201d Strong told the Associated Press.\n\nWhen implemented, the Affordable Care Act required the school district to offer an affordable insurance plan to all employees\u2014including non-certified personnel that previously didn\u2019t receive insurance.\n\nAccording to the Herald-Citizen, the school board had asked the county commission to approve a wheel tax and property tax increase in order to foot the bill for the extra funds, both of which were rejected. Another wheel tax increase has been proposed, however, a vote is not expected to take place until March.\n\nClay County reversed its decision to close the schools after a lawsuit filed by two parents, Christopher Kane and Tracy Ford, moved to a federal court. The lawsuit questions whether the students \u201cwould be denied their constitutional right to equal protection \u2026 since other school districts would continue to educate children,\u201d reports The Tennessean.\n\nDirector Strong is not optimistic about keeping the schools open. He has stressed that the district\u2019s resources will not last for long and there is still no permanent solution.\n\n\u201cIf we spend that, how are we going to put it back \u2026 are we just not kicking the can further down the road to make it more difficult later on?\u201d Strong told the Associated Press.\n\nEd Haislmaier, a senior research fellow in health policy at The Heritage Foundation, speculated as to why Strong cited Obamacare as the reason for closing the schools:\n\n\u201cCertainly there are employers, including cases of school districts, colleges, and universities that have either changed the hours and schedules of staff to accommodate the need to avoid having too many people over the 30-hour threshold.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, to the extent that the 30-hour week threshold above which you have to provide as employer benefits or below which you don\u2019t, there is a cost associated with that\u2014and so there have been people either forced to work more hours than they want or have their hours cut. And we know that\u2019s happened in educational settings as well as school districts. You think about part time staff, say substitutes\u2014or an assistant\u2014or junior faculty at community colleges. So that may be part of what is going on.\u201d\n\nStrong did not immediately return The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clay County Director of Schools Jerry Strong announced Thursday that all campuses will remain open, despite financial struggles caused by Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Clay County Director of Schools Jerry Strong announced Thursday that all campuses will remain open, despite financial struggles caused by Obamacare.", "title": "Clay County Reverses Decision to Close Schools", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151015_TennSchools_Jones.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-25T23:59:54+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GayJn1"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Clay County Director of Schools Jerry Strong announced Thursday that all campuses will remain open, despite financial struggles caused by Obamacare.", "title": "Clay County Reverses Decision to Close Schools", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151015_TennSchools_Jones.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-10-23T16:37:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-25T23:59:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Education, School, Tennessee"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd040\"", "article_summary": "Clay County Director of Schools Jerry Strong announced Thursday that all campuses will remain open, despite the school board voting to close all schools in the lower income Tennessee district.\nClay County reversed its decision to close the schools after a lawsuit filed by two parents, Christopher Kane and Tracy Ford, moved to a federal court.\nAnd we know that\u2019s happened in educational settings as well as school districts.\nThe lawsuit questions whether the students \u201cwould be denied their constitutional right to equal protection \u2026 since other school districts would continue to educate children,\u201d reports The Tennessean.\nThe issue has centered around whether the schools that are struggling with finances close or continue the school year in hopes the school board will find a way to resolve the issue later."}
