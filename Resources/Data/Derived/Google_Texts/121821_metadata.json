The judge accepted a plea of second-degree murder and 40 years in prison. She will be credited with time served.\n\nLesyshen declined to make a statement before the court.\n\n\u201cI would imagine that the punishment you experience every day pales to the punishment\u201d called for by the court, O\u2019Hara said to Lesyshen.\n\nLesyshen entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity earlier this year, court records show. Monday\u2019s guilty plea vacates that argument. Lesyshen\u2019s husband, Michael Kirlan, the boy\u2019s father, was consulted and agreed upon the sentence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relieved that we are past this,\u201d Kirlan said after the hearing. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that the community and everyone involved did not have to go through a trial. It allows myself and some others to move forward with our lives.\u201d\n\nKirlan said he is \u201csatisfied\u201d with the plea agreement, adding that he thinks about his son every day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing as well as I can, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to do things that make me happy.\u201d\n\nKirlan called law enforcement to report that the boy had been shot. When police arrived, they found the 9-year-old riddled with wounds, the Steamboat Pilot & Today reported. Deputies also found Lesyshen unconscious with a gunshot wound, a revolver lying nearby, according to court records obtained by the newspaper.\n\nThe couple had been going through a separation when the shooting occurred.\n\n\u201cThis has been one of the most tragic situations I have been involved with in my life,\u201d Lesyshen\u2019s attorney said.\n\nLesyshen was being held at the Denver County jail because of her medical needs. As she wheeled herself out of the courtroom under the watchful eyes of a Denver sheriff\u2019s deputy, Lesyshen turned to her parents and brother in the gallery behind her and mouthed, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jesseapaul\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Routt County woman pleads guilty to killing her 9-year-old son", "title": "Routt County woman pleads guilty to killing her 9-year-old son", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/18/routt-county-woman-pleads-guilty-to-killing-her-9-year-old-son/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140818__Lisa-Lesyshenp1.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140818__Lisa-Lesyshenp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-18T12:32:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:22:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2666\"", "article_summary": "A Routt County woman pleaded guilty Monday to killing her 9-year-old son last year during an attempted murder-suicide.\nMonday\u2019s guilty plea vacates that argument.\n\u201cYou understand that if the plea goes through today, there will never be a trial in this case?\u201d Judge Michael O\u2019Hara asked.\nLesyshen entered a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity earlier this year, court records show.\nWhen police arrived, they found the 9-year-old riddled with wounds, the Steamboat Pilot & Today reported."}
