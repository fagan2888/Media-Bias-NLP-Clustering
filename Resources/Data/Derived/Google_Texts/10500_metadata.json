(WPRI) \u2014 The most common complaint into the Call 12 for Action Center over the past three months has been problems with HealthSource RI \u2013 so Consumer Reporter Susan Hogan went straight to the source to try to get some answers.\n\nCustomers are getting angry with the state-run Obamacare marketplace, saying critical health decisions are being put on hold because they can\u2019t get a straight answer.\n\nBill Liebrich of Warwick is a single guy \u2013 so why would HealthSource RI sign him up for 13 insurance plans?\n\nLiebrich was shocked when he received his first bill, which he said was for nearly $2,300. Liebrich knew something wrong had happened when he signed up, but was it his fault or HealthSource\u2019s? He said he wasn\u2019t sure because no one could tell him what went wrong.\n\n\u201cThe lady on the phone seemed almost as confused as I was,\u201d he recalled.\n\nRelated: Keep HealthSource RI state-run, Paiva Weed says\n\nConfusion seems to be a recurring theme with HealthSource RI.\n\n\u201cWhen I came through the door three weeks ago, it was apparent to me right away that we had some customer service issues,\u201d said Anya Rader Wallack, who was recently appointed by Gov. Gina Raimondo as HealthSource RI\u2019s new executive director.\n\nSome of the complaints we\u2019ve heard include:\n\n\u201cThey cashed my parents\u2019 check and they still have no health insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor some reason my policy has been terminated again.\u201d\n\n\u201cPayment was made for December and January, and they are telling me they can\u2019t find the payments.\u201d\n\nWallack puts some of the blame on HealthSource RI\u2019s complex computer information system, which was built with more than $100 million in federal funding. She admits that HealthSource RI has had an alarming number of errors within their own system, and said they\u2019re conducting a full investigation with their vendor.\n\n\u201cWe have put more people in the contact center dealing with both customers who are calling in, and specifically with problem cases,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, Liebrich\u2019s problem case was pushed up to a priority in its third month, and it\u2019s still not resolved. He does have one insurance plan now, but he still doesn\u2019t have his dental card, and his account still shows he owes money from being on 13 insurance plans.\n\nHealthSource RI said as of Wednesday, a little more than 28,000 Rhode Islanders have enrolled for coverage in 2015. State leaders are now debating whether they should keep the state-run insurance marketplace \u2013 and if so, how they should pay for its budget \u2013 or instead switch Rhode Island to the federal HealthCare.gov marketplace.\n\nThis year\u2019s deadline for individuals to enroll in insurance plans through HealthSource RI is Sunday, Feb. 15.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most common complaint into the Call 12 for Action Center over the past three months has been problems with HealthSource RI, so Consumer \u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wpri", "og": {"site_name": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News", "description": "The most common complaint into the Call 12 for Action Center over the past three months has been problems with HealthSource RI, so Consumer Reporter Susan Hogan went right to the source to try to g\u2026", "title": "Customers complain of confusion in dealing with HealthSource RI", "url": "http://wpri.com/2015/02/11/customers-complain-of-confusion-in-dealing-with-healthsource-ri/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwpri.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/health.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "WPRI.com", "description": "The most common complaint into the Call 12 for Action Center over the past three months has been problems with HealthSource RI, so Consumer Reporter Susan Hogan went right to the source to try to g\u2026", "creator": "@wpri12", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwpri.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/health.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Customers complain of confusion in dealing with HealthSource RI", "site": "wpri12", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "msapplication-tooltip": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News | WPRI.com: Rhode Island news, weather, information", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488539287", "fb": {"pages": 20074438201}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WPRI 12 Eyewitness News", "google-site-verification": "UWpZtk5XlRP8hEHWWrNPNVI8BulxVr0d1aFCNQQIY9U", "keywords": "Call 12 for Action, Health, Local News, News, Providence healthsource ri Susan Hogan WPRI 12 Eyewitness News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WPRI12", "published_time": "2015-02-12T03:42:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-12T15:23:25+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wpri.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1b04de707c0e872b43e051b6f92f59c6?s=16", "news_keywords": "healthsource ri,Call 12 for Action, Health, Local News, News, Providence"}, "article_summary": "Related: Keep HealthSource RI state-run, Paiva Weed saysConfusion seems to be a recurring theme with HealthSource RI.\nBill Liebrich of Warwick is a single guy \u2013 so why would HealthSource RI sign him up for 13 insurance plans?\nThis year\u2019s deadline for individuals to enroll in insurance plans through HealthSource RI is Sunday, Feb. 15.\nHealthSource RI said as of Wednesday, a little more than 28,000 Rhode Islanders have enrolled for coverage in 2015.\nShe admits that HealthSource RI has had an alarming number of errors within their own system, and said they\u2019re conducting a full investigation with their vendor."}
