Vice President Joe Biden:\n\nBiden ran for president unsuccessfully in both 1988 and 2008. As VP, he\u2019s probably best known for his gaffes than actually influencing policy in the Obama administration. After Obama signed The Patient Affordable Care Act, Biden referred to the moment as a \u201cbig fu**** deal.\u201d\n\nWith Hillary\u2019s popularity taking a major hit recently, people close to the Vice President have reportedly been approaching donors.\n\nBiden\u2019s son, Beau, had a dying wish for his dad to make another run for the White House. GOP contender Donald Trump thinks Biden is going to enter the race, and that he\u2019ll face him in the general election.\n\n2. Al Gore:\n\nGore ran for president in 1988 and in 2000. He managed to win the popular vote, but failed to secure the electoral one. With what\u2019s turning out to be a rough campaign for Clinton, there is rumor that Gore might give things another go.\n\nAccording to BuzzFeed, Gore supporters are discussing the possibility of the former vice president running again. In 2010, the majority of Americans had an unfavorable view of him.\n\nAs of now, he hasn\u2019t shot down the suggestion to run. Maybe third time will be the charm.\n\n3. Michael Bloomberg:\n\nThe former New York City Mayor hasn\u2019t even hinted at presidential ambitions. However, some people on Wall Street want him to give it a shot. The New York Post reported that many Democrats feel Bloomberg could bridge the gap with independent voters.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say how well Bloomberg could do. When he tried to ban large sugar-filled beverages in New York City, the move was struck down by the state\u2019s courts.\n\nBut people in New York City generally viewed Bloomberg\u2019s time while mayor as a positive one. While Bloomberg has re-branded himself as an independent, the majority of his policy positions align with the Democrats\u2019 platform. Interestingly enough, he\u2019s also worth several billion dollars more than GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This could spell more trouble for Hillary.", "published_at": "2015-08-15T19:09:08+00:00", "tags": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "This could spell more trouble for Hillary.", "title": "Hillary's Credibility is in Free-Fall.
