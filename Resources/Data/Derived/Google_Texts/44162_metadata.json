Mercy Express Care opened its Fore River location last spring in Portland, the fifth Mercy-affiliated center.\n\nToday's Poll Medical care Where are you likely to go for treatment of common ailments that demand attention, such as infections, fractures and lacerations?

Derek Davis/Staff Photographer urgent care by the numbers Urgent care centers are a less costly alternative for treatment of medical conditions that need immediate attention but are not life-threatening, according to health industry experts. Many broken bones, infections or cuts can be safely treated at U.S. urgent care centers. \u2022 An emergency room visit costs an average of $583. \u2022 Urgent care costs on average of $228 per visit. \u2022 There are about 32 million non-emergency visits to hospital ERs per year. \u2022 If most of those went to urgent care instead, the savings to the U.S. health care industry would be $7 billion to $18 billion per year.

The urgent care centers are designed for people with common ailments that demand attention, such as infections, fractures and lacerations.\n\nOn Friday, ClearChoice doctors, nurses and health workers were little more than caretakers of an empty building, waiting for customers at the Payne Road location. They said they hoped the center would build its clientele to about 30 patients per day once people realized they were open.\n\n\u201cIf you came in here with a broken bone, we would put a splint on it, take X-rays, prescribe painkillers and refer you to an orthopedic surgeon, same as if you went to the ER,\u201d said ClearChoice Dr. Mark Durcan. \u201cBut if someone came in here with chest pains, we\u2019re sending them to the ER.\u201d\n\nDr. Marcus Hampers, owner of New Hampshire-based ClearChoiceMD, said the company conducted a market analysis and determined that Maine and parts of northern New England needed more urgent care centers. The Maine location will be the ninth urgent care center opened by ClearChoice \u2013 a new company \u2013 since June.\n\n\u201cEmergency departments are often overwhelmed by people who don\u2019t really need to be in the emergency room,\u201d Hampers said. \u201cForty to 50 percent of the people can be safely treated in an urgent care center. And we can get you in and out in an hour.\u201d\n\nThe Scarborough center accepts insurance and self-pay patients, with visits costing $100 to $250, depending on what needs to be done.\n\nHampers said that although the Portland area has several walk-in clinics, most are tied to a hospital, which he does not see as direct competition to his centers, because he said hospital-affiliated urgent care is more expensive than independent centers. Fourteen of the 23 urgent care centers listed on the Maine DHHS website are affiliated with a hospital.\n\n\u201cWe do not see them as a threat to us,\u201d Hampers said.\n\nBut Lisa Letourneau, executive director of Maine Quality Counts, a nonprofit health-care advocacy group, said ClearChoice\u2019s prices are comparable to most urgent care centers, even ones that are hospital-based. However, Letourneau said it is true that the hospital urgent care centers would likely be somewhat more expensive because they have costs that the independent centers do not, such as being required to accept patients without insurance who can\u2019t pay.\n\nLetourneau also said that all walk-in clinics have a much quicker turnaround for patients than emergency departments, also making them an attractive option.\n\n\u201cOur society wants immediate care and easy access, and these clinics meet that criteria,\u201d she said.\n\nLetourneau said she sees two driving forces behind the urgent care center movement \u2013 more people having insurance, and the long-term trend of deductibles being higher. For many years, companies have been reducing their health care costs in part by requiring employees to contribute more toward their insurance, which often means deductibles are higher, she said.\n\nWith a higher deductible, patients are more likely to notice how much each health-related visit costs and may look for less expensive options, such as urgent care centers rather than emergency rooms.\n\nAlso, with the Affordable Care Act reducing the ranks of the uninsured, there are more people who seek care when sick, Letourneau said.\n\nShe said a 28-year-old woman suffering pain from an infection may have shied away from going to an urgent care center when she was uninsured. But with ACA coverage she\u2019s more likely to visit a walk-in clinic for treatment, Letourneau said.\n\nStein, the health policy expert, said another factor is that the ACA discourages unnecessary emergency room visits, so more health insurance plans now require higher co-pays for such visits.\n\n\u201cIf you get a big co-pay bill from going to the ER, that\u2019s going to make you think twice,\u201d Stein said.\n\nLetourneau said that in other states, she\u2019s seen chain drugstores open walk-in clinics, which are convenient, but also make her uncomfortable if the reason for their existence is based more on retail sales than on health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another way to get people in the door to their store, so consumers need to be a bit wary,\u201d she said.\n\nJoe Lawlor can be contacted at 791-6376 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @joelawlorph", "article_metadata": {"description": "ClearChoiceMD of Scarborough, which is not hospital-affiliated, is part of a national boom offering quicker and often cheaper treatment than emergency rooms.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "ClearChoiceMD of Scarborough, which is not hospital-affiliated, is part of a national boom offering quicker and often cheaper treatment than emergency rooms.", "title": "Opening of urgent care clinic adds to Maine trend - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/561955_645287-20141226_urgent_c2.jpg", "height": 699}, "updated_time": "2014-12-29T08:40:22-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/12/29/opening-of-urgent-care-clinic-adds-to-maine-trend/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ClearChoiceMD of Scarborough, which is not hospital-affiliated, is part of a national boom offering quicker and often cheaper treatment than emergency rooms.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/561955_645287-20141226_urgent_c2.jpg", "title": "Opening of urgent care clinic adds to Maine trend - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Health care", "published_time": "2014-12-29T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-29T08:40:22-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd90a\"", "article_summary": "\u2022 If most of those went to urgent care instead, the savings to the U.S. health care industry would be $7 billion to $18 billion per year.\nThe urgent care centers are designed for people with common ailments that demand attention, such as infections, fractures and lacerations.\nMany broken bones, infections or cuts can be safely treated at U.S. urgent care centers.\nDerek Davis/Staff Photographer urgent care by the numbers Urgent care centers are a less costly alternative for treatment of medical conditions that need immediate attention but are not life-threatening, according to health industry experts.\nFourteen of the 23 urgent care centers listed on the Maine DHHS website are affiliated with a hospital."}
