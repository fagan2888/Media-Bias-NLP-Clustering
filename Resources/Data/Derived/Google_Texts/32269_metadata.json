For Mary Hill, a registered nurse, that extraordinary moment came when union activists began pressuring workers at her hospital to unionize.\n\nShe was ready to join the union, she tells Watchdog.org, but began to question the union\u2019s motives when leaders began injecting politics into the workplace \u2014 politics unlike her own.\n\n\u201cI was frustrated with them forcibly unionizing workers and the hospital, even targeting them. \u201cThey\u2019d go around doing vicious political campaigning about Obamacare \u2014 and that was in a hospital,\u201d she told Watchdog.org.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not against unions at all, but national unions don\u2019t have the individuals\u2019 interest in mind. They\u2019re only there to gain political support,\u201d said Hill. \u201cNurses are too busy with patients to need to have to worry about what unionization will mean for them.\u201d\n\nHill is among several former union members hoping to persuade Missouri lawmakers to override a veto by Gov. Jay Nixon on a right-to-work bill. A vote on the bill, which would end compulsory union membership in the state, could take place within days.\n\nPhill Todd, a Missouri resident and BAC union member, recalls an encounter with his leadership in 2004, when his union actively endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Richard Gephardt.\n\n\u201cI went into the union hall and they had the signs up there for Gephardt for president and McCaskill and all that kind of stuff\u2026. I was a little bit alarmed about that because there was no way that I was going to support Gephardt,\u201d Todd told Watchdog.org. \u201cNobody had ever asked us who we would prefer.\u201d\n\nHe said union leaders were handing out shirts that read \u201cGephardt for President. BAC supports Gephardt. He\u2019s ours,\u201d which Todd didn\u2019t want to wear.\n\nOther union members also say their leadership actively spends a good portion of union dues on political campaigning, almost always for Democrats.\n\n\u201cTheir money goes to Democrat candidates and Democrat issues,\u201d said Ron Staggs, also resident of Missouri, and a former member of Communications Workers of America. \u201cYou have no say on anything on how the money\u2019s spent. It\u2019s sent to the national level and it\u2019s spent at the national level,\u201d he told Watchdog.org. \u201cAnd it rolls back down from the national levels to political campaigns.\u201d\n\nTheir concerns were exactly what drew Mary Hill to start rallies promoting right-to-work in her state.\n\nThe first rally in 2013 gathered just over 100 people, says Hill, bringing together stakeholders publicly for the first time in Missouri. The next one, just a few months later, brought in over 200, including many important members of the Missouri Legislature.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019ve got the support of the lieutenant governor and former governor,\u201d she said.\n\nNicholas C.
