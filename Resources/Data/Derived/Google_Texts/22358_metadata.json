From Megyn Kelly\u2019s now infamous question to Donald Trump about women to immigration, national security and yes, even vaccines, plenty of issues were discussed.\n\nUnfortunately, however, after almost six hours of debate, there has been very little discussion of the most pressing issue of this election: how to strengthen our nation\u2019s economy and get it moving again.\n\nThe economy is barely growing, and too many men and women are still without work. All across this country, people are worried about economic uncertainty and their financial futures.\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll earlier this month, Americans\u2019 confidence in the economy remains down. Now, more than ever, we need strong, pro-growth leadership on the economy.\n\nThe good news for economic conservatives is that the GOP presidential field is one of the strongest pro-growth fields in history, which is why at this week\u2019s CNBC debate in Colorado, the candidates must step forward and tell the country how they plan to right our nation\u2019s financial ship and restore confidence in our foundering economy.\n\nOne way we can get this conversation started is for the moderators to ask each candidate the following question:\n\nWhat are two specific pro-growth policies that you will seek to enact within your first hundred days in office?\n\nFor some of the candidates, such as Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, this is a real opportunity to shine.\n\nThese candidates are truly at the forefront of the Republican presidential field when it comes to issues of economic freedom.\n\nThey have led on pro-growth issues at every opportunity in the Senate and have put forth bold tax reform plans.\n\nSome of the other candidates\u2019 records and positions, however, raise more questions and concerns about their commitment to pro-growth principles.\n\nTo that end, I hope that during the course of the debate, we get some answers to these questions:\n\n\u0095 Mr. Trump, you have a history of calling for the largest tax increase in U.S. history, of promoting higher corporate taxes to pay for government-run health care, of loudly advocating for sky-high tariffs that will act as a 25%-35% sales tax on every family budget and of using Obama-like rhetoric to claim that higher taxes should be imposed on those you deem worthy of such punishment.\n\nPlease explain how these long-held positions would spur economic growth.\n\n\u0095 Dr. Carson, many of your economic position statements are full of significant inconsistencies. You have criticized ObamaCare but promoted a de facto nationalization of private health insurers.\n\nYou have also called for needed entitlement reform and yet recommend a new, government-run catastrophic-care program.\n\nHow do you reconcile these contradictions?\n\n\u0095 Mr. Huckabee, during your time as governor of Arkansas, the overall tax burden increased by 47% and the net tax hike was $505 million.\n\nYou also raised the minimum wage in Arkansas and flip-flopped on regulatory cap and trade.\n\nWhy do you still defend raising taxes on hard-working Arkansans, and how large of a role would tax increases play in your economic policy as president?\n\n\u0095 Governor Kasich, you vetoed the Ohio legislature\u2019s effort to block Medicaid expansion under ObamaCare, and now the projected cost of this expansion is more than double what your administration projected.\n\nSince Medicaid expansion was a key component of ObamaCare, isn\u2019t it duplicitous for you to call for ObamaCare\u2019s repeal?\n\n\u0095 Governor Christie, after five years in office, New Jersey is still rated the worst business tax climate in the country.\n\nWhy have you not been able to significantly improve the business tax climate in the Garden State?\n\nThis election is going to give economic conservatives a historic opportunity to elect a president who is committed to shrinking the size and scope of government, to cutting taxes and spending, and to reducing the regulatory burden on small businesses and families.\n\nThe candidates who stand for these principles must remind voters of their strong record and plans.\n\nFor candidates who don\u2019t, it is an opportunity to either change course or further regress. Either way, GOP primary voters deserve answers.\n\n\u0095 McIntosh is President of the Club for Growth and a former Congressman from Indiana.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A record 20 million-plus watched each of the first two Republican debates.
