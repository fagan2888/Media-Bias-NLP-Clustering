(AP) \u2014 Republicans in Congress on Tuesday called for an overhaul to the Endangered Species Act to curtail environmentalists\u2019 lawsuits and give more power to states, but experts say broad changes to one of the nation\u2019s cornerstone environmental laws are unlikely given the pervasive partisan divide in Washington, D.C.\n\nA group of 13 GOP lawmakers representing states across the U.S. released a report proposing \u201ctargeted reforms\u201d for the 40-year-old federal law, which protects imperiled plants and animals.\n\nProponents credit the law with staving off extinction for hundreds of species \u2014 from the bald eagle and American alligator to the gray whale. But critics contend the law has been abused by environmental groups seeking to restrict development in the name of species protection.\n\nLed by Rep. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Rep. Doc Hastings of Washington state, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, the Republicans want to amend the law to limit litigation from wildlife advocates that has resulted in protections for some species. And they want to give states more authority over imperiled species that fall within their borders.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nAlso among the recommendations from the group are increased scientific transparency, more accurate economic impact studies and safeguards for private landowners.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem is that the Endangered Species Act is not recovering species,\u201d said Hastings. \u201cThe way the act was written, there is more of an effort to list (species as endangered or threatened) than to delist.\u201d\n\nSigned into law by President Richard Nixon in December 1973, the act has resulted in additional protections for more than 1,500 plants, insects, mammals, birds, reptiles and other creatures, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nRepublicans have seized on the fact that only 2 percent of protected species have been declared recovered \u2014 despite billions of dollars in federal and state spending.\n\nNoah Greenwald, a wildlife advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity, disputed the 2 percent figure as a \u201cgross manipulation of facts\u201d that ignores the hundreds of protected species now on the path to recovery.\n\nThe political hurdles for an overhaul of the law are considerable. The Endangered Species Act enjoys fervent support among many environmentalists, whose Democratic allies on Capitol Hill have thwarted past proposals for change.\n\nOregon Rep. Peter DeFazio, the ranking Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee, suggested Tuesday that Republicans appeared intent on gutting the law. He predicted the changes being sought would go nowhere in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThere is no appetite to overturn the (Endangered Species Act),\u201d DeFazio said.\n\nFederal wildlife officials said they would not comment on Tuesday\u2019s report until they have a chance to review it.\n\nThroughout its history, the law has faced criticism from business interests, Republicans and others. They argue actions taken to shield at-risk species such as the northern spotted owl have severely hampered logging and other economic development.\n\nThose complaints grew louder in recent months after federal wildlife officials agreed to consider protections for more than 250 additional species under settlement terms in lawsuits brought by environmental groups.\n\nIncluded in the settlement was the greater sage grouse, a chicken-sized bird that has been in decline across large portions of its 11-state Western range. A final decision on whether to protect sage grouse is due next year and could result in wide-ranging restrictions on oil and gas development, agriculture and other economic activity.\n\nThe endangered act was last amended in the 1980s. Given the current level of rancor between Democrats and Republicans, academics who track the law were skeptical that the latest calls for change would succeed.\n\n\u201cBoth sides have enough power to prevent something happening that they don\u2019t like. But nobody has enough power to pass anything,\u201d said Dale Goble, an expert on the act who works as a law professor at the University of Idaho.\n\nGoble added that the main reason some species linger for decades on the endangered list is a shortage of federal money to help pay for their recovery.\n\nVanderbilt Law School professor J.B. Ruhl said previous attempts to reform the Endangered Species Act in the 1990s and again last decade failed. Regardless of the merits of the latest proposal, Ruhl said the topic remains a \u201cthird rail\u201d many politicians are unwilling to touch.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans in Congress on Tuesday called for an overhaul to the Endangered Species Act to curtail environmentalists' lawsuits and give more power to states, but experts say broad changes to one of the nation's cornerstone environmental laws are unlikely given the pervasive partisan divide in Washington, D.C.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "AP", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Republicans in Congress on Tuesday called for an overhaul to the Endangered Species Act to curtail environmentalists' lawsuits and give more power to states, but experts say broad changes to one of the nation's cornerstone environmental laws are unlikely given the pervasive partisan divide in Washington, D.C.", "title": "Lawmakers Seek Endangered Species Act Overhaul", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/lawmakers-seek-endangered-species-act-overhaul/178909/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ENDANGERED-SPECIES_Mill.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-06T07:22:53-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans in Congress on Tuesday called for an overhaul to the Endangered Species Act to curtail environmentalists' lawsuits and give more power to states, but experts say broad changes to one of the nation's cornerstone environmental laws are unlikely given the pervasive partisan divide in Washington, D.C.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ENDANGERED-SPECIES_Mill.jpg", "title": "Lawmakers Seek Endangered Species Act Overhaul", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: Health & Lifestyle", "tag": "Republicans", "published_time": "2014-02-05T08:15:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-06T07:22:53-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe biggest problem is that the Endangered Species Act is not recovering species,\u201d said Hastings.\nThe Endangered Species Act enjoys fervent support among many environmentalists, whose Democratic allies on Capitol Hill have thwarted past proposals for change.\n\u201cThere is no appetite to overturn the (Endangered Species Act),\u201d DeFazio said.\nVanderbilt Law School professor J.B.
