Conan and Billy Eichner use a Cher and Liza Minnelli-decorated van to pick up guys they met on Grindr

Conan O’Brien had so much fun on the dating app Tinder that he figured he should give another one a try.

Teaming up with Billy Eichner, Conan decided to create a profile on Grindr, an app for gay hookups.

Much to Eichner’s surprise, Conan’s profile as a “ginger sugar daddy” generated a lot of attention and soon the two were out on the streets in a Cher and Liza Minnelli-decorated van to meet some of their potential “dates.”

Sadly Conan didn’t quite hit it off with the guy he met up with in a supermarket parking lot, but we think that makes it a little truer to the dating app experience.
