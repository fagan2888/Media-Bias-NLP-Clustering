(AP / Claudio Bresciani)\n\nDespite a human rights record that could put the Islamic State group to shame, Saudi Arabia became virtually untouchable in the 20th century thanks to the world\u2019s increasing need for oil and\u2014as the filmmaker Adam Curtis highlights in his recent documentary, \u201cBitter Lake\u201d\u2014unfailing support from American presidents dating back to Franklin D. Roosevelt. According to Curtis, the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d that emerged from a meeting between King Abdulaziz and Roosevelt in 1945 has shielded the brutal Saudi regime from Western criticism for 70 years.\n\nThe newly minted Swedish foreign minister, Margot Wallstr\u00f6m, has changed all that. Wallstr\u00f6m took office last October and is a member of the Social Democrats, which leads the country\u2019s current minority government in coalition with the Greens. Since then, she has kept to her word to make feminism and human rights essential parts of her nation\u2019s foreign policy. And it didn\u2019t take long for Wallstr\u00f6m to show her determination. In her first month in office, Sweden recognized the state of Palestine, with Wallstr\u00f6m declaring: \u201cThe government considers that international law criteria for recognition of a Palestinian state have been fulfilled.\u201d\n\nIsrael was angry and immediately recalled its ambassador to Sweden.\n\nThen in January, Wallstr\u00f6m denounced the Saudi regime\u2019s flogging of the blogger Raif Badawi, calling it \u201cmedieval\u201d and tweeting:\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide Blogger Raif Badawi was flogged today in Saudi Arabia. This cruel attempt to silence modern forms of expression has to be stopped. \u2014 Margot Wallstr\u00f6m (@margotwallstrom) January 9, 2015\n\nWallstr\u00f6m has also criticized the Middle Eastern country\u2019s denial of women\u2019s rights. The Spectator reported:\n\nThe Swedish foreign minister denounced the subjugation of women in Saudi Arabia. As the theocratic kingdom prevents women from travelling, conducting official business or marrying without the permission of male guardians, and as girls can be forced into child marriages where they are effectively raped by old men, she was telling no more than the truth.\n\nWallstr\u00f6m\u2019s comments were unwelcome in Riyadh, with Saudi leaders\u2019 blocking her from speaking before the Arab League in Cairo early last month.\n\nTheir decision came just as the Swedish parliament was mulling over the renewal of a 2005 arms deal with the Arab country. While Saudi Arabia\u2019s cancellation of \u2018her speech might be viewed as a veiled threat, the decision seems to have backfired. The Swedish Green Party\u2019s Carl Schlyter said the cancellation \u201cproves that those who argue that a military agreement with Saudi will help human rights have been completely wrong.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the Swedish government appeared to agree with Schlyter because the arms deal\u2014up for renewal every five years\u2014was called off by a majority vote.\n\nSweden was recently ranked as the 12th-largest arms dealer in the world, but the economic ramifications of the Swedish parliament\u2019s vote go far beyond the weapons industry.\n\n\u201cBig Swedish firms do more than \u00a31bn ($1.68 bn) in business with Saudi Arabia every year. Ikea, H&M, Ericsson, Volvo, Scania and Electrolux all sell civilian goods; LKAB, the state-owned mining firm which provides much of the employment above the Arctic Circle, ships 30% of its output to Saudi Arabia. Saab exports military equipment and would like to sell more.\u201d\n\nAs Sweden put its money where Wallstr\u00f6m\u2019s mouth is, the real backlash began. Saudi Arabia also pulled its ambassador to Sweden; began to rile up the rest of the Arab world against Wallstr\u00f6m and the entire Scandinavian country; revoked business visas for Swedes; and took the pettiness to a new level when it turned away \u201cfour tiny Amazonian monkeys from a Swedish zoo because of ... [the] diplomatic row.\u201d (I mean, really, what do minuscule monkeys have to do with any of this?)\n\nRiyadh seems to have bullied other Islamic countries into following in its footsteps, with the UAE withdrawing its ambassador to Sweden and the entire Gulf Cooperation Council calling the Swedish foreign minister\u2019s statements as \u201cblatant interference in internal affairs,\u201d after making it seem as though Wallstr\u00f6m\u2019s words were an attack on Islam. Wallstr\u00f6m\u2019s gender has certainly played a role in the saga as well, as the deeply misogynist regime doesn\u2019t seem to have taken well to being criticized by a woman.\n\nBut as both applause and criticism poured in from all angles, the Swedish foreign minister stood valiantly by her condemnations. \u201cI won\u2019t back down over my statements on women\u2019s rights, democracy and that one shouldn\u2019t flog bloggers,\u201d Wallstr\u00f6m said. \u201cI have nothing to be ashamed of.\u201d\n\nThroughout the controversy, Wallstr\u00f6m has had the approval of a large part of the Swedish public, but there has been a glaring lack of support from other Western countries. Yet in the end, it seems the \u201cmagnificently undiplomatic foreign minister,\u201d as The Guardian calls her, may have come out on top. Saudi Arabia said it would send its ambassador back to Stockholm in late March after a somewhat embellished announcement regarding Sweden\u2019s \u201capology.\u201d\n\nWhile King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden did send a former foreign defense minister to appease King Salman, in no way has Wallstr\u00f6m backtracked, nor, does it seem, will she. Instead, she has handled concerns about her comments with grace, declaring in a speech before Sweden\u2019s parliament: \u201cWe have the greatest respect for Islam as a world religion and for its contributions to our common civilization.\u201d Her comment was surely not only intended for the Arab countries attempting to punish Sweden, but also for the Muslim population living in the Nordic country.\n\nThe Guardian notes that \u201cher words will have done nothing to stop Swedish companies strengthening the Saudi regime as much as they can,\u201d but one can hope that her comments have marked the beginning of a shift in the Western tendency toward turning the other way from allies\u2019 atrocities, even when it means losing quite a bit of moola, or riyals, in this case. Wallstr\u00f6m\u2019s actions also go to show that not every politician has a price tag attached and that sometimes when leaders stick to their guns (so to speak) on matters that are as worthwhile as human rights, some progress can be made.\n\nFor her feminist, humanist and, above all, legitimate comments against a regime that deserves its fair share of comeuppance, for staying firm in the face of Saudi Arabia\u2019s reprisals and for the bold courage she\u2019s displayed throughout the diplomatic affair, Margot Wallstr\u00f6m is our Truthdigger of the Week.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "adam curtis, arab league, bitter lake, fdr, feminism, islam, king salman, margot wallstrom, margot wallstrom feminist, margot wallstrom saudi arabia, middle east, muslim countries, politics, raif badawi, riyadh, saudi arabia, saudi arabia womens rights, sweden, sweden business, sweden saudi arabia, swedish economy, womens rights", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "Sweden\u2019s foreign minister has done what few Western officials have been willing to: denounce Saudi Arabia for its appalling human rights record.
