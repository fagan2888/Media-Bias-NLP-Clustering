Tax dollars arent free



Rising federal debt is a major threat to our country.



Congress and the president recently reached a compromise on more spending and suspended the debt ceiling. Our federal budget is $4 trillion, debt passed $19 trillion and unfunded entitlements are over $200 trillion. Politicians from both parties share in fueling this fiscal crisis.



Democrats think higher taxes on the rich will solve everything. Republicans think relying on cuts to discretionary programs is the panacea. Both fall short of dealing with this fiscal crisis and, left unchecked, increase our probability of default.



Seventy percent of all federal spending goes to entitlements which are growing. Over 50 percent of the population receive some form of government benefit (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare) and reforming these mandatory programs is political suicide because people now expect it.



Senator Lankford, R-Okla., published Federal Fumbles which exposes wasteful discretionary spending that Congress can control.



For example, The Department of Defense (DOD) spent $43 million building a compressed natural gas station in Afghanistan thats rarely used. The DOD spent $48 million on military supplies for Yemen that never made it out of the Virginia warehouse. The National Park Service spent $65,000 to demonstrate what happens to bugs when the lights go out.



Tax dollars arent free dollars. Congress must pass a constitutional amendment to limit spending to essential services and protection. Our financial crisis is too serious a matter to be left to irresponsible politicians who lack Profiles in Courage to do the right thing.



You get what you accept.
