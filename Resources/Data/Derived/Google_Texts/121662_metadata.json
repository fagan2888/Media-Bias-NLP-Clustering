This editorial policy came directly from Andrew Breitbart himself. However, given the enormity of today\u2019s primaries, the intensity of the internal debate raging within the Republican party, and the stature of Brent Bozell in the conservative movement, we have decided to make an exception in this instance.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n*****\n\nI\u2019ve endorsed Ted Cruz. I was a contributor to National Review\u2019s Against Trump symposium at the beginning of the year.\n\nSarah Palin, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee and Phyllis Schlafly\u2014you are friends and allies, serious men and women for whom I have great respect. You and other conservatives disagreed.\n\nI pen this open letter to you.\n\nEven those of us who oppose Trump understand that he\u2019s tapping into something that has exploded onto the national scene: disenchantment, even white-hot rage among the Republican base with the party\u2019s establishment and the Washington status quo. You and I understand this because we were taking on the weak-kneed GOP leadership many, many years ago, back when Donald Trump was donating to Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nIs Donald Trump the answer? That question\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind. But there needs to be another question answered first: Does Donald Trump mean a word he says? Are conservative leaders supporting Trump prepared to live with the consequences if he doesn\u2019t?\n\nMany critics have outlined the innumerable left-wing positions and candidates Trump championed before he got in this race. It\u2019s worth recalling some of them now: Trump not only supported but bankrolled amnesty. He supported taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood. He supported not just abortion but partial-birth abortion. He was open to gay marriage. He supported government-funded universal healthcare.\n\nHe supported eminent domain for (his) private gain. He supported the Wall Street bailout. He supported \u201cassault weapons\u201d bans. He applauded President Obama for doing a \u201cgreat job.\u201d He congratulated Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for doing a \u201cgood job.\u201d He financially helped the Democrats pass Obamacare. Trump was a registered Democrat when that party was being led by the likes of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, donating heavily during President Obama\u2019s tenure. He\u2019s bankrolled Democrats like Jimmy Carter, Rahm Emmanuel, Anthony Weiner, Terry McAuliffe, Chuck Schumer, Charlie Rangel, Ted Kennedy and John Kerry, to name a few.\n\nBut Trump said he\u2019s changed. On everything. Overnight. Just in time for the GOP nomination fight.\n\nReally?\n\nLet\u2019s look at Mr. Trump\u2019s record during this campaign. He\u2019s declared his support for single-payer healthcare. That puts him to the left of Obamacare. He\u2019s re-declared his support for Planned Parenthood. He\u2019s re-supporting tax increases. He\u2019s supported crony capitalism. He\u2019s endorsed \u201ctouchback\u201d amnesty. He wants the U.S. to break the Geneva Convention. He\u2019s \u201cneutral\u201d on Israel and Palestine. He wants South Korea and Japan to have nuclear arsenals.\n\nPaul Krugman loves Trump\u2019s big government economic plan for the simple reason that big government will remain under President Trump.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Mr. Trump took the left\u2019s side in the North Carolina transgender bathroom controversy.\n\nLast week Mr. Trump announced\u2014guess what?\u2014he\u2019s not just pro-abortion, he wants the pro-life plank in the GOP platform removed, thus divorcing the Republican Party from the pro-life movement. Sarah, Ben, Mike, Phyllis: How can you still support this man? He has now thrown you under the bus, embracing an agenda you\u2019ve spent your entire career opposing. Can you accept that betrayal?\n\nWhat will you tell your supporters when the man you endorsed enacts an agenda that horrifies them?\n\nAs the Republican primaries draw to some sort of conclusion, right now Trump is surrounding himself with GOP establishment types, trying to assure them he doesn\u2019t really mean many of the things he\u2019s said, claiming that much of his campaign is just posturing.\n\nPosturing to whom?\n\nTop Trump aide Paul Manafort is telling GOP establishment bosses behind closed doors that his boss is \u201ca real different guy.\u201d His campaign openly touts his chameleon-like character as some sort of general election advantage.\n\nIs someone with no discernible principles the candidate you want leading the Republican Party and taking on the Democrats in 2016?\n\nIs someone who consistently lies about principles and positions he doesn\u2019t hold worthy of your support?\n\nIf Trump becomes the nominee, and enacts the policies he\u2019s now championing, will conservatives who chose to aid and abet Mr. Trump be able to live with their decision?\n\nWhen it comes time to nominate a new Supreme Court Justice, and President Trump names his radically pro-abortion sister, as he\u2019s suggested he would, or some other radically pro-abortion pro- Planned Parenthood jurist, as we know he will, will you accept that you helped him do that?\n\nWhen President Trump shocks the civilized world by killing the children of terrorists, arming nations with nuclear weapons (you don\u2019t think Russia won\u2019t do likewise with its allies?) and breaking the Geneva Convention (God help our men and women captured by our enemies who will do the same) will you live with that?\n\nWhen Big Government, crony capitalism \u2014 the corruption of government that triggered his movement \u2014 continue unabated for the simple reason he\u2019s offered no plan to stop it, will you accept the blame for having supported it?\n\nThis isn\u2019t about purity. It\u2019s about basic sanity.\n\nDo the most courageous thing you\u2019ve ever done, in a lifetime of bravery.
