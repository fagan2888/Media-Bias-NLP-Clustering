Why? Because most U.S. and European underwriters have tightened their guidelines concerning the yacht\u2019s time spent in and out of U.S. waters.\n\nMost underwriters globally now require that yachts spend at least six months outside U.S. waters per year, or they will not provide insurance quotes and coverage for crew. It doesn\u2019t matter that a yacht is registered outside the U.S. and has to adhere to the laws of that flag state, nor does it matter that the crew are all non-U.S. citizens.\n\nSome European underwriters will not provide coverage for U.S. citizens at all anymore, or they will limit the amount of coverage available inside the U.S., with the reasoning that U.S. crew will have coverage under the ACA.\n\nThere is a first-rate crew medical policy available, where the time restriction for U.S. citizens is three month\u2019s outside the U.S. in a 12-month period. However, this plan is not compliant with the ACA so crew members may still be subject to paying a tax penalty.\n\nBut for many internationally traveling U.S. crew, this may still be the best insurance solution, both in terms of coverage and cost. The premiums are much less than a U.S. domestic individual policy, even when adding the possible tax penalty into the calculation.\n\nI have dealt with a couple of difficult cases lately, one involving a large U.S.-registered yacht with about 10 U.S. crew. The yacht doesn\u2019t leave the U.S. much so the crew do not qualify for an international group policy.\n\nOne U.S. insurance company declined to provide a group quote based on the fact that there were too many crew members from a different state than the owner\u2019s company. It\u2019s also imperative that the crew members\u2019 paychecks are issued from the same address and state as the owner\u2019s (employer\u2019s) office.\n\nIn the end, we found an insurance carrier that was willing to offer the crew a reasonable group package. Nonetheless, it\u2019s imperative to keep in mind that a U.S. domestic policy may not provide coverage outside the U.S. for incidental trips.\n\nApplying for individual U.S. domestic plans can also be bothersome, as the quotes are based on a residential zip code, which yacht crew typically don\u2019t have. And the U.S. networks of doctors and hospitals are shrinking; many insurance plans don\u2019t even offer out-of-network benefits anymore. This is a disadvantage for traveling yacht crew who may have signed up in Florida and need care in New England.\n\nAnother challenging case involves a Cayman Islands-flagged yacht with a crew of mixed nationalities. Since the yacht will remain in the U.S. the majority of the time, the crew will not be eligible for either an international group policy not international individual policies.\n\nThe most viable solution for this yacht is to offer U.S. domestic individual policies to the U.S. crew, and an international individual policies to the non-U.S. crew.\n\nOne more example involves a former stew who decided to leave yachting to be land-based. As a U.S. citizen, monthly premiums for an individual policy were more than $300 for a bronze plan with a $5,000 annual deductible and a 50% co-insurance. She is 21 years old. She was almost in tears when I told her.\n\nShe is, however, newly engaged a foreign national and since they signed the lease on an apartment together and have been a couple for five years, we were able to add her to his international policy as a \u201cdomestic partner\u201d. Her premium is now $150 per month for an outstanding policy that works in the majority of the U.S. and overseas.\n\nIt\u2019s still easier to arrange coverage for non-U.S. crew, but to meet eligibility for most group policies, the yacht must be outside the U.S. for six months.\n\nMaria Karlsson is president of Superyacht Insurance Group (SYIG) and provides insurance solutions for crew members (individuals and group) and yachts (Hull, P&I).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.the-triton.com/2015/03/obamacare-affects-all-of-yachting/", "site_name": "The Triton", "type": "article", "description": "Obamacare doesn\u2019t only affect U.S. crew members, but the entire global yachting industry, including non-U.S. crew.
