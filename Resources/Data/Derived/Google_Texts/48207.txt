On Sunday’s episode of “Last Week Tonight,” John Oliver made a 13-minute-long impassioned speech about net neutrality. At its close Oliver urged Internet users, who excel at commenting, to file a public comment on the Federal Communications Commission website, demanding the continuation of a free and open internet.

The following day, the FCC’s commenting system went down for several hours due to “unusually heavy traffic,” FCC Press Secretary Kim Hart told Mashable. The FCC also tweeted the following on Monday:

We’re still experiencing technical difficulties with our comment system. Thanks for your patience as we work to resolve the issues. — The FCC (@FCC) June 2, 2014

We’ve been experiencing technical difficulties with our comment system due to heavy traffic. We’re working to resolve these issues quickly. — The FCC (@FCC) June 2, 2014

No direct causation can be made between Oliver’s rant and the spike in comments. What is known is that in the two days following the speech, the system received 22,257 comments, according to Mashable. Prior to this weekend the site had 25,000 comments. The FCC comments section for “Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet” currently has 45,193 total comments from the last 30 days.
