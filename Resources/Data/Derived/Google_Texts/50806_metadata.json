As penalties and sanctions involving a lack of Stark Law compliance threaten hospitals' ability to remain open, what\u2019s next on the healthcare horizon?\n\nThe Stark Law \u2013 a strict liability statute prohibiting physicians from making referrals for designated health services payable by Medicare if a financial relationship exists, without a matched exception \u2013 has been a recent focus within the healthcare spectrum.\n\nKristen A. Larremore, a Stark Law expert at Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis, LLP, recently chatted with RevCycleIntelligence.com about CMS\u2019s recently proposed Stark Law changes and the technical violation relief such revisions are expected to bring physicians and healthcare providers.\n\nHealthcare providers face financial penalities\n\nLarremore says there has been a proliferation of private whistleblower suits alleging Stark Law violations and of self-reporting of Stark Law violations, especially related to technical compliance violations as a result of the implementation of the Stark Law self-referral disclosure protocol under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\n\u201cBecause of its strict liability, regardless of intent, if there's a technical violation of the Stark Law, there can be significant repercussions for providers resulting in financial penalties,\u201d says Larremore. \u201cIt also prohibits specifically the entity from filing claims for reimbursement for services provided as a result of the physician's referral. That requirement places compliance with the Stark Law as a precondition to reimbursement of claims submitted to Medicare,\u201d she adds.\n\nHealthcare providers face a variety of challenges related to issues of non-compliance, says Larremore. \u201cThe best way to address challenges is the self-disclosure protocol, required under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) where if alleged potential Stark Law violations are identified, they can be voluntarily reported and they'll be considered for a lower imposed penalty based upon voluntary disclosure of potential issues,\u201d she states.\n\nRegulatory changes stretch CMS too thinly\n\nNonetheless, CMS is experiencing a hearty backlog while attempting to process technical violations under the law. \u201cAs of mid-January 2015, there were 529 disclosures that had been recorded, only 128 of which had been resolved,\u201d says Larremore regarding the quantifiable extent of CMS\u2019s backlog.\n\nThe backlog and its aftermath pose significant challenges. \u201cBacklog processing issues often come up in a context of a transaction where the provider is wanting to sell to another entity. They'd like to get those things resolved,\u201d Larremore says. \u201cBecause of the backlog, that's generally not possible. Even if you self-disclose, it's generally going to be quite a few years before things are resolved and finalized through CMS.\u201d\n\nAlthough CMS\u2019s proposed changes to the Stark Law address some of these issues, Larremore says that the technical nuances of Stark Law compliance and the need to self-report technical violations that pose little threat of program abuse are a heavy drain upon CMS\u2019s and healthcare providers\u2019 time, energy, and resources. CMS\u2019s resources continue to be stretched thinly as a variety of regulatory changes and reporting and disclosure changes are implemented, maintains Larremore.\n\nPhysicians also face a variety of financial implications under the Stark Law, regardless of whether all of CMS\u2019s proposed changes go into effect. Alleged Stark Law violations and compliance issues have the potential to put hospitals and other healthcare providers out of business, says Larremore.\n\n\u201cThe implications can be very significant for providers when they don't have compliance across the board. There are a lot of instances where there can be non-compliance that are not even identified for some period of time,\u201d says Larremore. \u201cBecause penalties are assessed on a per-claim basis, that can lead to significant damages going along with the non-compliance,\u201d she adds, noting that under the False Claims Act, healthcare providers can be liable for up to triple the amount of fraud claimed against the government. This liability excludes a substantial civil penalty for each individual claim submitted in violation of the law.\n\n\u201cBecause it's per claim, if the contract has been going on for some period of time, that can really build up to a large amount of claims submitted under the same arrangement, which if determined to be non-Stark compliant, can be extremely significant,\u201d Larremore states.\n\nPhysicians reconsidering billing matters\n\nLarremore predicts the proposal contained in the draft update to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for 2016 regarding \u201cincident to\u201d billing changes, if implemented, means physicians will face hiccups related to efficiency, billing and scheduling issues. Under the proposal, the treating physician must directly supervise all \u201cincident to\u201d services billed for his or her patients. This could dramatically change the way physicians are currently seeing and treating their patients under a patient\u2019s care plan.\n\nFor example, if an oncologist/treating physician sees patients at two different locations, while another oncologist in the same group practice supervises the treating physician\u2019s patients, sometimes at one location or the other when the treating physician\u2019s patient receives treatment under a plan of care \u2013 but the treating physician is not physically present \u2013 this would no longer be permitted under the proposed \u201cincident to\u201d changes.\n\nPhysicians will not be able to see as many patients as a result, nor will they be able to serve as many locations, she says. This may result in significant monetary implications if physicians are required to restructure the manner in which they see and treat patients and if the physician must be personally present each time a patient is receiving services under the patient\u2019s plan of care in order to continue to bill at the \u201cincident to\u201d billing rate of the physician, she states.\n\nLarremore confirms there are two newly proposed exceptions under Stark Law proposals for time shares and physician extender recruitment. \u201cBoth intend to expand access to needed healthcare services, particularly in rural areas, and ease some of the regulatory burdens to allow for arrangements that particularly benefit providers in areas where there's a lack of manpower,\u201d she says.\n\nThe physician extender recruitment allows primary care physicians to receive subsidies from hospitals, rural health clinics, and federally qualified health centers to recruit non-physician practitioners to provide primary care services, states Larremore.\n\n\u201cThat could definitely have a positive impact on financial and healthcare access aspects in rural areas. The only downside of that is it's still only proposed to be permitted for a two-year period so at that point in time, the money still has to come from somewhere to pay for the practitioner,\u201d she confirms, adding the steps being taken are indeed steps in the right direction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As financial winds between healthcare providers and physicians shift direction and penalties and sanctions for lack of Stark Law compliance settle, what\u2019s next?", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/will-cms-proposed-stark-law-revisions-bring-doctors-relief", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Kristin_Larramore_180.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Will CMS Proposed Stark Law Revisions Bring Doctors Relief?"}, "twitter": {"description": "As financial winds between healthcare providers and physicians shift direction and penalties and sanctions for lack of Stark Law compliance settle, what\u2019s next?", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Kristin_Larramore_180.jpg"}, "title": "Will CMS Proposed Stark Law Revisions Bring Doctors Relief?", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Kristen A.
