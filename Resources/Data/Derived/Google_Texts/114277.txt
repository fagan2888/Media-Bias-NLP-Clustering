In an order issued today, the state Supreme Court has expedited its reconsideration of the redistricting case, Dickson v. Rucho, in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s April 20 remand.

That order from the nation’s highest court came on the heels of its decision in a similar case, Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, in which the justices ruled 5-4 that the Voting Rights Act did not require states to use mechanical formulas or quotas when drawing voting lines.

In the North Carolina case, briefing is now scheduled through July with oral argument to take place on August 31, 2015.

In today’s order, the state justices limited briefing and argument to “the applicability of” the ruling in the Alabama case to Dickson, leaving open the question of finality of any ruling following argument in August. The court could conceivably send the case back to the three-judge redistricting panel for further findings.

The order is here:
