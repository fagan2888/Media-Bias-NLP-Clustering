Like many citizens, he also had a hard time getting through to the troubled site before he was finally able to set up an account.\n\nObamacare, a.k.a. the Affordable Care Act, requires many lawmakers and their Capitol Hill staffs to leave the Federal Employees Heath Benefit program for insurance obtained on the exchange.\n\nMillions of Americans who buy insurance on the individual market have been booted off their plans because they don\u2019t comply with Obamacare regulations. When the postponed employer mandate begins in 2015, millions of additional consumers will see big changes in their employer-provided health insurance.\n\nBoehner has represented Ohio\u2019s 8th Congressional District since 1991 and became Speaker in 2011. He used to pay $433 a month ($700 deductible) for health insurance for he and his wife. According to Politico, \u201cTo keep a similar plan, the Boehners would have to pay $802 per month in premiums, with a deductible of $2,000\u201d under Obamacare.\n\nBoehner makes over 200 grand a year as Speaker \u2014 the official who controls the gavel in the GOP-controlled House \u2014 so he\u2019s in a much better position to absorb increased healthcare fees than the vast majority of Americans. Since his wife Debbie is already 65, however, she\u2019s separately signing up for Medicare. \u201cThe speaker, who is 64, chose to sign up for an individual plan with benefits similar to those he receives under FEHB. That will cost him $449 per month in premiums, and the policy carries a $1,000 deductible. So, he\u2019ll pay more next year for himself than he paid this year for both himself and his wife \u2014 and, together, the Boehners will still pay roughly $800 per month in premiums with deductibles in the $2,000 range.\u201d\n\nHis spokesman note that \u201cThe Boehners are fortunate enough to be able to afford higher costs. But many Americans seeing their costs go up are not. It\u2019s because of them that this law needs to go.\u201d\n\nBefore the details of Boehner\u2019s new coverage became public, the Los Angeles Times insisted that Obamacare was a good deal for the Speaker because he was eligible for a so-called bronze plan.\n\nJohn Boehner and every other Republican in both the House and Senate voted against Obamacare. It passed on a strict party-line vote when the Democrats controlled both chambers.\n\nSeparately, Democrat staffers in Congress reportedly have expressed shock about how much Obamacare is going to cost them and want the president to give them a bailout. As alluded to above, many (but not all) staffers on Capitol Hill are now required by law to obtain insurance from the DC healthcare exchange rather than continue under the generously subsidized federal employee program. Many of these staffers likely helped Obamacare become law during the contentious debate in Congress.\n\nIn what has developed into a major controversy, President Obama repeatedly declared that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan\u201d when he was selling healthcare reform via the Affordable Care Act to the American people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you've had your health insurance cancelled because of Obamacare, John Boehner feels your pain, to some degree anyway.
