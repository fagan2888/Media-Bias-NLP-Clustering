The money is meant to expand primary health care services as part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The clinic also operates public medical and dental clinics in Salisbury and Marceline.\n\nAnnual funding will be $650,000 starting next year.\n\nThe Family Health Center was one of five Missouri community health centers among 164 in the country that shared $101 million in this round of funding. Centers in Ava, Kirksville, Clinton and Sedalia also received money.\n\nThe Family Health Center serves a 10-county area in Central Missouri. Administrators have not selected a location for the new Columbia site, Crull said Thursday morning, although her administrative team was reviewing possible buildings for lease or purchase.\n\nThe new site will operate just like the facility at 1001 W. Worley St., Crull said. It will target \u201cmedically underserved people\u201d \u2014 those without insurance or who are under-insured \u2014 but will provide care to anyone, she said.\n\nThe center will provide primary medical, dental and mental health services. Crull, director of the multicounty health center since 1995, said the new center will have seven employees, including one physician and a nurse practitioner.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expected to be operational by Sept. 6,\u201d she said, adding that the center has a good history of being able to start new sites and meet operational goals.\n\n\u201cWe essentially told\u201d Health and Human Services \u201cwe\u2019d be able to pull it off,\u201d Crull said, noting that more than 500 centers applied for funding.\n\nThe Family Health Center used a $2.6 million federal grant in 2012 for renovation and construction of the 8,800-square-foot health and dental clinic in Marceline. The center used a $250,000 federal grant last year to renovate its Columbia clinic to increase patient privacy and improve coordination of patient care.\n\nU.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said Wednesday in a news release that the latest grant awards were proof that that Affordable Care Act is providing more access to health care.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is working, and these additional resources for local health services in Columbia are part of that story,\u201d McCaskill said in the news release.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said the 164 new health centers are projected to increase access for nearly 650,000 patients to needed primary care services.\n\nSome 550 new health centers already have opened since passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCrull said the annual funding for the new Columbia site will help offset subsidized care provided to patients who are uninsured or under-insured. Patients have to provide income documentation to show they are at less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level to receive a discount.\n\nBut because Missouri has not expanded the Medicaid program, many low-income individuals and families do not qualify for federal subsidies for insurance exchange plans or for Medicaid and are still mostly uninsured, she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"description": "The Family Health Center of Boone County will open a second site on Columbia\u2019s east side by Sept. 6.", "creator": "@JJacksonJr", "site": "@columbiatribune", "card": "summary", "title": "Family Health Center plans second site in Columbia"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "og": {"url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/local/family-health-center-plans-second-site-in-columbia/article_a2b30f2f-ff89-5de5-b753-6ba4dc6a7c52.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "description": "The Family Health Center of Boone County will open a second site on Columbia\u2019s east side by Sept. 6.", "title": "Family Health Center plans second site in Columbia"}, "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "health insurance,health care,gloria crull,family health center,medicaid,boone county,department of health and human services", "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The Family Health Center of Boone County will open a second site on Columbia\u2019s east side by Sept. 6."}, "article_summary": "The Family Health Center of Boone County will open a second site on Columbia\u2019s east side by Sept. 6.\nThe Family Health Center was one of five Missouri community health centers among 164 in the country that shared $101 million in this round of funding.\nThe money is meant to expand primary health care services as part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\nThe Family Health Center serves a 10-county area in Central Missouri.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services gave the federally funded health center $549,000 for the new site."}
