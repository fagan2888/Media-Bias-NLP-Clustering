And yet they wanted out.\n\n\u201cWe were debt free and had a company we could sell,\u201d Joe continues. \u201cWe said, \u2018Let\u2019s just freaking do it!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe \u201cit\u201d was launching a company built around a shared passion dating back to their childhoods: saltwater fishing.\n\nThe duo, originally from Florida, ignored the early-morning meeting they\u2019d flown into town for and bought a domain name that very night.\n\nThey sat on it for a year, waiting until they were able to sell their marketing company, and then put the money from the sale toward their new venture.\n\nThey dubbed the business\u2013a subscription-based instructional saltwater fishing website heavy on video content\u2013Salt Strong. They officially launched on January 1st of this year, with older brother Joe and his family relocating from Atlanta to Tampa for the business.\n\n\u201cI look at my memories and experiences growing up,\u201d Joe says. \u201cAnd whether it was spending summers in Daytona Beach and bass fishing or being out on the water with my grandparents, fishing tied our family together. It had a huge impact on our lives.\u201d\n\nThe brothers want to bring those same experiences to kids and adults, and hope that by living their mantra (\u201cteaching the world how to fish\u201d) they can create bonds and memories for other families.\n\nThey also want to help remedy everything from childhood obesity to depression by getting people outside. They have taken disabled veterans, as well as children with cancer and cerebral palsy (Joe and Luke\u2019s youngest brother has the disorder), out on complimentary fishing trips.\n\nJoe and Luke create all the video content for Salt Strong themselves, filming one- to five-minute-long segments in Tampa, Boca Grande, and Marco Island, Fla., among other locations. Many of their videos have been viewed thousands of times since launch, and one, \u201cThe Best Fishing Knot for Braided Line Ever,\u201d was watched over 125,000 times in just over three months.\n\nThe brothers are quick to clarify that despite the instructional nature of some of their videos, and their desire to connect fishing guides with clients, they\u2019re not looking to teach people to be professional fishers\u2013or to themselves be fishing guides.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more just about getting the world to fish, getting families and kids excited about fishing, sharing cool experiences and cool videos,\u201d Joe says. \u201cEver since I quit my 9-to-5 job, I\u2019m a happier person, living the dream. I want to change other people\u2019s lives, too.\u201d\n\nOriginally published by America Within.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe said, \u2018Let\u2019s just freaking do it!\u2019\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe said, \u2018Let\u2019s just freaking do it!\u2019\u201d", "title": "Why Two Brothers Sold Their Business to Become Fishermen", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/fishing1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-04T13:19:23+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1N3liWl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe said, \u2018Let\u2019s just freaking do it!\u2019\u201d", "title": "Why Two Brothers Sold Their Business to Become Fishermen", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/fishing1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "American Dream", "published_time": "2015-09-05T03:01:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-04T13:19:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "fishing,american dream,entrepreneur,economy,business"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcded6\"", "article_summary": "In the middle of a cold Chicago night in November 2013, brothers Joe and Luke Simonds sat awake in their hotel room, talking animatedly and tossing around ideas for a new business.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more just about getting the world to fish, getting families and kids excited about fishing, sharing cool experiences and cool videos,\u201d Joe says.\nThe two had, by that point, founded a successful adviser marketing company and fulfilled a lifelong dream of working together.\nThey officially launched on January 1st of this year, with older brother Joe and his family relocating from Atlanta to Tampa for the business.\n\u201cWe said, \u2018Let\u2019s just freaking do it!\u2019\u201dThe \u201cit\u201d was launching a company built around a shared passion dating back to their childhoods: saltwater fishing."}
