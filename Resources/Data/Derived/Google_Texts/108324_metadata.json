A neglected aspect of that discussion, however, is the degree to which access to health coverage is a part of the problem facing lower-income and middle-class Americans today. Medicaid is a basketcase of a program that leaves poor people no healthier than they were before \u2014 though it spends trillions on their behalf. And, thanks to Obamacare, one of the biggest economic challenges facing the middle class \u2014 the rising cost of health insurance \u2014 is getting significantly worse.\n\nWhile \u201crepealing and replacing\u201d Obamacare is one way to address this problem, its political viability in 2017 \u2014 when tens of millions of Americans will be on Obamacare-sponsored coverage \u2014 is far from guaranteed. What will repealers-and-replacers say to Americans who like their Obamacare plans, and want to keep them?\n\nThe good news is there is an alternative approach, one that would achieve similar \u2013 if not better \u2013 fiscal results to repeal-and-replace, but with less disruption to existing coverage arrangements. I\u2019ve discussed that approach previously in these pages, and I have a new article discussing the idea today in the Washington Examiner.\n\nTo summarize, it would nearly fully privatize Medicare and Medicaid; reform the employer-sponsored insurance market in a market-oriented direction; and deregulate Obamacare\u2019s exchanges so that individuals could enjoy a broader choice of plans at lower cost.\n\nIn today\u2019s piece, I argue that no Republican health-reform plan will get anywhere until Republicans come to agree that it\u2019s a legitimate goal of public policy to ensure that all Americans have access to quality health care, just as we agree that all Americans should have access to a quality education:\n\nTo credibly advance this approach, conservatives must make one change to their stance: They have to agree that universal coverage is a morally worthy goal. No conservative politicians oppose universal public education; instead, we champion reforms that improve the quality of public education that poor Americans receive. Ensuring that every American has access to quality health coverage is a legitimate goal of public policy, and it can be done in a way that expands freedom and reduces the burden on American taxpayers. The Left believes that the only way to expand opportunity is to expand the scope and scale of government. Our broken patchwork of health care entitlements gives us the opportunity to prove otherwise. And we can do so while bequeathing to our children and grandchildren something that is almost impossible to imagine: a fiscally sound country.\n\nIt has always been a mistake to cede this moral ground to the Left, and not only because it has resulted in the mess of a system we have today. Take the example of a pregnant woman whose baby has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. More than 80 percent of all prenatal diagnoses of Down syndrome end in abortion. If we want to address this problem, one route is of course to abolish abortion. But another \u2013 complementary \u2014 one is to ensure that these expectant mothers don\u2019t face penury for bringing a child with Down syndrome into the world.\n\nUPDATE: I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of the conservatives who most passionately object to universal coverage are less aware of the fact that the scope of U.S. government health care already far exceeds that of most European countries, as described in the chart below.
