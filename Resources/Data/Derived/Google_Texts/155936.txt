Forest Park Medical Center is now seeing Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas members at each of its operating hospitals in Dallas, Frisco, and South Lake.

Forest Park officials announced the agreement on Thursday. BCBSTX sold the most plans through the federal marketplace exchanges during the Affordable Care Act’s open enrollment period, accounting for 55 percent of all new plans.

Forest Park, the physician-owned luxury hospital system, was previously only seeing BCBSTX members at its Dallas location.

“Forest Park is a rapidly growing hospital system focused on providing patient care of unparalleled quality,” said Forest Park Managing Partner Mac Burt. “As we continue to enhance our status as a leader in the health care industry, we are pleased with our work with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas to formalize a managed care agreement that provides members access to our state-of-the-art hospitals, physicians and staff.”

Aetna, Cigna, United, and BCBSTX are now accepted at the Frisco and Dallas locations. The Southlake hospital now accepts Aetna, Cigna, and BCBSTX.

The system will open additional hospitals in Fort Worth and San Antonio later this year. An Austin location will begin seeing patients in 2015. Robert Wyatt, one of the founding physicians of Forest Park and the system’s chief medical officer, said discussions are in place to have BCBSTX plans accepted at the new hospitals by the time they open.
