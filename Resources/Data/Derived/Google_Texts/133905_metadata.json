Scott Walker in Iowa last month. (Jim Young/Reuters)\n\nDANA POINT, Calif. \u2014 Scott Walker denied Saturday that he has moved to the right to win the Republican nomination for president, saying that his positions have been \u201cfairly consistent\u201d on every issue but immigration.\n\n\u201cMy positions are the same positions I\u2019ve had for the last two decades,\u201d the Wisconsin governor told hundreds of mega donors at the Koch donor network retreat here.\n\nWalker insisted that he has not quite flip-flopped on immigration so much as fleshed out his position.\n\n\u201cThis is one where I acknowledge that I didn\u2019t really have a position before because as a governor you\u2019re not involved in that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is one where I actually listened to the American people, looked at the facts, and made a decision in that regard. But for others, I\u2019ve been fairly consistent.\u201d\n\nWalker also defended his support for a deal that will put up $250 million in taxpayer money to finance a new stadium for the Milwaukee Bucks. Politico\u2019s Mike Allen pressed him on the subsidy during a half-hour question-and-answer session underneath a stand of palm trees in view of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\u201cWhat a number of your fellow small-government conservatives are saying to me is,\u201d Allen said, \u201chow in the hell could you support using taxpayer money for a stadium for an NBA team co-owned by a billionaire raising money for Hillary\u201d Clinton?\n\nWalker responded that Wisconsin gets $6.5 million in tax revenue from the team every year.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a business owner and you\u2019ve got a business and one of your biggest customers says you\u2019ve got to upgrade your facility or I\u2019m going to take my business somewhere else, anybody who is smart in business is going to make sure they keep that business,\u201d he said.\n\nSome social conservatives have complained about an advertisement Walker ran last fall during a tough reelection fight in his blue state. Responding to a commercial from the Democratic group EMILY\u2019S List, Walker ran an ad defending a law he signed that mandates women get ultrasounds before they can get an abortion. In the ad, Walker said his bill \u201cleaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor.\u201d\n\nAllen asked how that squares with his opposition to abortion.\n\n\u201cRight, that\u2019s not what I said my position on abortion is. I said it\u2019s what the bill does,\u201d Walker responded. \u201cIt\u2019s not an extreme position.\u201d\n\nHe noted that he was \u201cahead of the curve\u201d and that the state defunded Planned Parenthood four years ago.\n\nWalker said that Donald Trump is tapping into frustration among conservatives that Republicans won control of the Senate last year but have not passed big-ticket bills like repealing Obamacare to send to President Obama\u2019s desk.\n\nThe governor, leading in early polls of Iowa caucus-goers, touted his record of conservative achievements in the Badger State, from taking on unions to teacher tenure reform, welfare reform, property tax cuts and voter ID law. He also touted the right-to-work bill he signed earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m about as anti-Washington as you can get,\u201d he said.\n\nWalker dressed casually, wearing khakis and an open-collared blue dress shirt. The Washington Post is one of nine news organizations allowed in to cover the traditionally private Koch network donor meeting, on the condition that the donors present not be named without their permission.\n\nAllen, from Politico, moderating the Q&A discussion, asked Walker whether Jeb Bush\u2019s super PAC raising more than $100 million intimidates him.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Walker. \u201cHe\u2019s done a good job with connections to the family. And that\u2019s great.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the end, money doesn\u2019t win elections,\u201d he added. \u201cIdeas do.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Bush leans too much on family, Walker demurred.\n\n\u201cI like his brother,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he did a lot of good things, particularly to bring this country together after 9/11.\u201d\n\nWalker covered a range of other issues.\n\nHe said his sons\u2019 support for gay marriage does not change his opposition to it.\n\nThe Eagle Scout said he opposed the Boy Scouts of America allowing openly gay leaders when he was involved. But, he added: \u201cIt is already done. That\u2019s a decision left up to the Boy Scouts.\u201d\n\nHe said that he does not care whether he would face Hillary Rodham Clinton or Vice President Biden, who reports suggest is considering a bid for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cEither way, bring it on,\u201d he said. \u201cBiden ran the first time for president when I was still in college.\u201d\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Scott Walker answered some quick questions at a forum in late July, reiterating his position that he does not know if President Obama is a Christian. (Freedom)\n\nWalker said he wears a FitBit bracelet to help himself stay in shape by tracking how much exercise get gets. He said he sleeps between six hours to seven hours per night on average. He set a goal of walking 10,000 steps a day. Allen asked him to check what he was at so far on Saturday. Walker looked, and it was 9,128.\n\nAsked why Mitt Romney lost in 2012, Walker said it was because \u201che just ran a referendum on Barack Obama.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cMy positions are the same positions I\u2019ve had for the last two decades,\u201d the Wisconsin governor told hundreds of mega donors at the Koch donor network retreat.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jhohmann", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "\u201cMy positions are the same positions I\u2019ve had for the last two decades,\u201d the Wisconsin governor told hundreds of mega donors at the Koch donor network retreat.", "title": "Scott Walker denies flip-flopping, says he\u2019s been \u2018fairly consistent\u2019 on the issues", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/08/01/scott-walker-denies-flip-flopping-says-hes-been-fairly-consistent-on-the-issues/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/07/19/Production/WashingtonPost/Images/2015-07-19T030130Z_01_JEY54_RTRIDSP_3_USA-ELECTION-REPUBLICANS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JamesHohmann"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "kock brothers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jhohmann"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "kock brothers"}, "article_summary": "Some social conservatives have complained about an advertisement Walker ran last fall during a tough reelection fight in his blue state.\nI said it\u2019s what the bill does,\u201d Walker responded.\nResponding to a commercial from the Democratic group EMILY\u2019S List, Walker ran an ad defending a law he signed that mandates women get ultrasounds before they can get an abortion.\nAsked why Mitt Romney lost in 2012, Walker said it was because \u201che just ran a referendum on Barack Obama.\u201d\nWalker insisted that he has not quite flip-flopped on immigration so much as fleshed out his position."}
