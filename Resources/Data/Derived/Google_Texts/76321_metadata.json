But the clinic staff, who have been asking the health department for an exemption to this new requirement for more than a year, doubt they\u2019ll ever be able to get a transfer agreement. Now, they\u2019re worried about an impending showdown with state officials.\n\nClinics across the state are struggling to obtain transfer agreements with private hospitals \u2014 an unnecessary bureaucratic policy that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with patient safety \u2014 because most of those institutions are religiously-affiliated and don\u2019t want to partner with abortion clinics. The new requirements, which were attached to a budget law approved by Gov. John Kasich (R) in 2013, have already forced several other clinics to close.\n\nThe other abortion clinic that used to operate in Cincinnati, Women\u2019s Med, battled with the health department for months before finally giving up at the end of August. It officially closed last month. \u201cAbortion access is now severely endangered for Cincinnati area women with only one provider remaining,\u201d Val Haskell, one of Women\u2019s Med\u2019s owners, said in a statement at the time. \u201cThis sole provider is also soon to be closed if Governor Kasich has his way.\u201d\n\nHaskell\u2019s prediction is starting to come true. Although the notice from the health department is just the first step in what could be a protracted legal battle, which ensures the Planned Parenthood clinic won\u2019t immediately have to close its doors, reproductive rights advocates in the state believe the health department is abusing its regulatory authority to target abortion providers one by one. And the last clinic in Cincinnati is probably next on its list.\n\n\u201cThis is part of a national trend being seen in many states,\u201d Rick Pender, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio, told the Columbus Dispatch. Indeed, Ohio\u2019s new law fits into the larger strategy known as the \u201cTargeted Regulation of Abortion Providers,\u201d or TRAP. Over the past several years, TRAP laws have swept the nation and put dozens of clinics out of business.\n\nThe consequences of TRAP are on full display in the South, where abortion access is hanging in the balance. In Texas, for instance, where harsh TRAP regulations have shuttered nearly all of the state\u2019s clinics, low-income and rural areas are losing access to reproductive health services altogether. Large cities are the most likely to retain access to providers as abortion rights become more dependent on women\u2019s zip code; Ohio, however, proves that the women living in metropolitan areas can\u2019t necessarily count on that.\n\nIt\u2019s a new reality that the anti-abortion groups in the state \u2014 who lauded the passage of the latest abortion restrictions as \u201chistoric\u201d \u2014 are all too happy about. \u201cWith each passing month, we are seeing Ohio\u2019s abortion industry crumble because of their own inability to comply with the law,\u201d Stephanie Ranade Krider, the executive director of Ohio Right to Life, said in a statement this week. And that\u2019s exactly how the law was designed.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Ohio officials are getting closer to their goal of shutting down all of the state's clinics.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Ohio officials are getting closer to their goal of shutting down all of the state's clinics.", "title": "Cincinnati Poised To Become Largest Metropolitan Area Without Any Abortion Clinics", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/24/3584360/cincinnati-abortion-clinics/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_139263098-e1382473775762.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ohio officials are getting closer to their goal of shutting down all of the state's clinics.", "title": "Cincinnati Poised To Become Largest Metropolitan Area Without Any Abortion Clinics", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_139263098-e1382473775762-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_139263098-e1382473775762.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutterstock_139263098-e1382473775762.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-24T14:50:32+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf749\"", "article_summary": "Health Cincinnati Poised To Become Largest Metropolitan Area Without Any Abortion Clinics CREDIT: ShutterstockHealth officials in Ohio have taken the first step toward closing the last abortion clinic in Cincinnati, a move that threatens to make the Ohio city the largest metropolitan area in the country without a single abortion provider.\nThe other abortion clinic that used to operate in Cincinnati, Women\u2019s Med, battled with the health department for months before finally giving up at the end of August.\nIndeed, Ohio\u2019s new law fits into the larger strategy known as the \u201cTargeted Regulation of Abortion Providers,\u201d or TRAP.\nClinics across the state are struggling to obtain transfer agreements with private hospitals \u2014 an unnecessary bureaucratic policy that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with patient safety \u2014 because most of those institutions are religiously-affiliated and don\u2019t want to partner with abortion clinics.\n\u201cAbortion access is now severely endangered for Cincinnati area women with only one provider remaining,\u201d Val Haskell, one of Women\u2019s Med\u2019s owners, said in a statement at the time."}
