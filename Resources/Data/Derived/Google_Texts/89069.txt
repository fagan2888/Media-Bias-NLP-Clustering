Sioux Falls, SD

Travelers flying out of Sioux Falls Regional Airport will soon have a place to stay before or during their trip. The $5 million AeroStay is nearing completion.

Convenience is the name of the game at the AeroStay. Connected to the airport, the soon-to-open hotel will make things easy for travelers.

"Winter, you don't even have to go outside. You get up in the morning, you're down a hallway and you're on your plane. I think people are going to love it and I'm excited to get started," Kary said.

Levi Kary will be the General Manager once it opens. The hotel boasts 76 rooms that range from big with king size beds to eco-efficient getaways.

"Extremely luxurious and upscale finishes. While it's a smaller room, it's a very comfortable and a very nice room that we think people are going to really like," Kary said.

The construction company plans on handing the hotel over to the management company by the end of the month. The hotel will open around June 1.

"I think the place is cool. A lot of these finishes we've never put in hotels before like the sliding bathroom door, the Euro cabinets and stuff like that, and wood floors in some of these guest rooms is also new for us," Dave Potratz with Beck & Hofer Construction said.

The AeroStay will be run by the same management group that takes care of the Ramkota and ClubHouse Suites. The proximity between hotels allows the group to pool resources.

"We'll just shuttle that back and forth every day and it's a five-minute drive away. We'll cross train people. It will really help our operations I think," Kary said.
