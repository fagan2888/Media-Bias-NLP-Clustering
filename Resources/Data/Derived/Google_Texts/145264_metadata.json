Kit Bond to the program for an in-depth look at his career and legacy.\n\nBond\u2019s political career spanned nearly four decades. A Republican, he won seven statewide elections, including serving two non-consecutive terms as governor and four terms as a U.S. senator. The Mid-Missouri native was an instrumental force in making Republicans competitive in a state that for decades had been dominated by Democrats.\n\nSince he retired from public service in 2011, Bond became a partner with the Thompson Coburn law firm. He also started Kit Bond Strategies, a business development and lobbying firm. And he\u2019s developed a passion for growing chestnuts on his homestead in Mexico, Mo.\n\nDuring the nearly hour-long show, Bond delved into a number of topics, including:\n\nHow a fascination with politics led him to pursuing public office \u2013 and the lessons he learned from victory and defeat, including keeping focused on your jobs, not the campaigns of others.\n\nHow he dealt with a solidly Democratic legislature while he was governor \u2013 and how he forged personal relationships with lawmakers to get things done.\n\nWhether his views became more conservative over time.\n\nHis transition into the U.S. Senate and how the institution has changed over time.\n\nHow, in his view, it was a mistake for Republicans lawmakers to oppose earmarks, which effectively allow members of Congress to direct federal money to particular projects.\n\nHis motivations for voting to authorize the Iraq War in the early 2000s. Bond\u2019s son, Sam, joined the Marines in 2003 and served two tours of duty in the conflict.\n\nHis unsuccessful bid to get Republican lawmakers in the Missouri General Assembly to accept Medicaid expansion under the auspices of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhom he\u2019s endorsing for president and for Missouri governor next year.\n\nHow he\u2019s become one of Missouri\u2019s largest producers of chestnut crops, thanks to scores of trees planted on his farm.\n\nFollow Jason Rosenbaum on Twitter: @jrosenbaum\n\nFollow Jo Mannies on Twitter: @jmannies\n\nFollow Kit Bond on Twitter: @KitBondMO\n\nMusic: \u201cDayman\u201d by Portugal.
