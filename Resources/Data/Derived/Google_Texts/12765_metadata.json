All throughout the debate leading up to the controversial 2010 law, and up until late last year, the Obama Administration kept asserting that \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d But by last December, the fact checker PolitiFact was awarding this assurance its Lie of the Year for 2013.\n\nWhen hundreds of thousands lost plans they liked, the administration moved on to its next claim\u2013that \u201cthe new exchange plans would be better than your old plan.\u201d This new promise is already proving to be at odds with the facts.\n\nA February 23, 2014, Wall Street Journal piece illustrates the heartbreaking consequences of being forced into an Obamacare exchange plan that will not pay for a cancer-fighting drug \u2013 a denial traceable to provisions in the law that have the effect of forcing reduction in America\u2019s health care usage.\n\nUnder the title \u201cObamacare and My Mother\u2019s Cancer Medicine\u201d, Stephen Blackwood chronicled his mother\u2019s struggle to find coverage in a post-Obamacare environment. He wrote, \u201cThe news was dumbfounding. She used to have a policy that covered the drug that kept her alive. Now she\u2019s on her own.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, at age 49, his mother was diagnosed with a rare cancer. The cancer is terminal. However, it typically responds to a drug called Sandostatin that slows growth and reduces symptoms. Blackwood wrote\n\n\u201cAnd then in November, along with millions of other Americans, she lost her health insurance. She\u2019d had a Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan for nearly 20 years. It was expensive, but given that it covered her very expensive treatment, it was a terrific plan. It gave her access to any specialist or surgeon, and to the Sandostatin and other medications that were keeping her alive.\n\n\u201cAnd then, because our lawmakers and president thought they could do better, she had nothing. Her old plan, now considered illegal under the new health law, had been canceled.\u201d\n\nHis mother, a former medical-office manager, no stranger to navigating insurers, was unable to use the Virginia exchange, and called around to individual exchange insurers. After she spent days and weeks of searching, no one could tell her for sure if her drug was covered.\n\nFinally a representative for one plan, Humana, told her that her drug would probably be covered. Unbelievably, this was the closest to a firm commitment she could get from any insurer. According to Blackwood,\n\n\u201cWith no other options, she bought the plan and was approved on Nov. 22. \u2026Then on Feb. 12, just before going into (yet another) surgery, she was informed by Humana that it would not, in fact, cover her Sandostatin, or other cancer-related medications. The cost of the Sandostatin alone, since Jan. 1, was $14,000, and the company was refusing to pay.\n\n\u201cThe news was dumbfounding. This is a woman who had an affordable health plan that covered her condition. Our lawmakers weren\u2019t happy with that because . . . they wanted plans that were affordable and covered her condition. So they gave her a new one. It doesn\u2019t cover her condition and it\u2019s completely unaffordable\u2026.\n\n\u201cBut there is something deeply and incontestably perverse about a law that so distorts and undermines the free activity of individuals that they can no longer buy and sell the goods and services that keep them alive. Obamacare made my mother\u2019s old plan illegal, and it forced her to buy a new plan that would accelerate her disease and death. She awaits an appeal with her insurer.\u201d\n\nWhile many are quick to blame insurance companies, the real culprit is the Obamacare provision under which exchange bureaucrats must exclude insurers who offer policies deemed to allow \u201cexcessive or unjustified\u201d health care spending by their policyholders.\n\nUnder the Federal health law, state insurance commissioners are to recommend to their state exchanges the exclusion of \u201cparticular health insurance issuers \u2026 based on a pattern or practice of excessive or unjustified premium increases.\u201d The exchanges not only exclude policies in an exchange when government authorities do not agree with their premiums, but the exchanges must even exclude insurers whose plans outside the exchange offer consumers the ability to reduce the danger of treatment denial by paying what those government authorities consider an \u201cexcessive or unjustified\u201d amount.\n\nThis means that insurers who hope to be able to gain customers within the exchanges have a strong disincentive to offer any adequately funded plans that do not drastically limit access to care . So even if you contact insurers directly, outside the exchange, as Blackwood\u2019s mother did, you will find it hard or impossible to find an adequate individual plan .(See documentation at www.nrlc.org/medethics/healthcarerationing.)\n\nWhen the government limits what can be charged for health insurance, it restricts what people are allowed to pay for medical treatment. While everyone would prefer to pay less\u2013or nothing\u2013for health care (or anything else), government price controls prevent access to lifesaving medical treatment that costs more to supply than the prices set by the government.\n\nMore on declining coverage can be found here.\n\nWhile Obamacare continues to roll out in 2014, it is important to continue to educate friends and neighbors about the dangers the law poses in restricting what Americans can spend to save their own lives and the lives of their families.
