That is, until Judge Andrew Napolitano Judge got his turn. He not only wanted to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, he argued for gutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid at the same time.\n\nNapolitano said:\n\nThe federal government should stay within the confines of the Constitution. The Constitution does not authorize the federal government to have anything whatsoever to do with health care. So Obamacare should be abolished along with Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. But the people who were on those programs should be grandfathered in because they paid money to be in there and they\u2019ve ordered their lives to stay there. The states should regulate health care because the states retained that power under the Constitution. \u2026If you want mandatory health care, go live in Massachusetts. If you want the free market and you want individual savings accounts, financial money savings accounts, go live in Texas. \u2026When the government attempts to do what only the free market can do, when the government says everybody\u2019s got to drive a Mercedes whether you can afford one or not, whether you want to drive one or not, very few people will have cars and everybody will be walking to work.\n\nJuan Williams was astounded. He asked, \u201cYou mean to say that you want to do away with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, \u201c Napolitano said. \u201cBecause the Constitution doesn\u2019t authorize it, and it would be far better administered by the states and by private enterprise.\u201d\n\nNapolitano agreed that the politics would make such a thing difficult, if not impossible right now. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it could be done with the stroke of a pen, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a consensus for it. But in my world, where the government lives within the confines of the Constitution, people are responsible for themselves.\u201d\n\nApparently, Napolitano is fine with old people eating pet food \u2013 because they\u2019ll be \u201cresponsible for themselves.\u201d And, coincidentally, he won't have to worry about any money for them coming out of his cushy, TV-talking-head earnings", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "KvXGNmHKYZA/3CsddFJZVfU2ixJ90umsAojJHIRejl8=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_s_andrew_napolitano_abolish_obamacare_social_security_medicare_and_medicaid_11222013", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Fox\u2019s Andrew Napolitano: Abolish ObamaCare, Social Security, Medicare And Medicaid!"}, "Title": "Fox\u2019s Andrew Napolitano: Abolish ObamaCare, Social Security, Medicare And Medicaid!"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9804\"", "article_summary": "He asked, \u201cYou mean to say that you want to do away with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely, \u201c Napolitano said.\nHe not only wanted to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, he argued for gutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid at the same time.\nSo Obamacare should be abolished along with Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\nThe Constitution does not authorize the federal government to have anything whatsoever to do with health care.\n\u2026If you want mandatory health care, go live in Massachusetts."}
