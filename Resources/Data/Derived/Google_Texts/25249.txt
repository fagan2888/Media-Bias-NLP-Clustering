CCPD's K9, Duke, awarded a bullet and stab protective vest

The Cañon City Police Department's K9, Duke, has been awarded a ballistic vest thanks to a nonprofit organization, Vested Interest in K9s, Inc., and the Royal Gorge Association of Realtors who provided $1,050.

Vested Interest in K9s, Inc. is a 501c (3) charity located in East Taunton, Mass., whose mission is to provide bullet and stab protective vests and other assistance to dogs of law enforcement and related agencies throughout the United States. Each vest costs $1,050 and has a five-year warranty. The nonprofit was established in 2009 to assist law enforcement agencies with this potentially lifesaving body armor for their four legged K9 Officers. Through private and corporate sponsorships, Vested Interest in K9s, Inc. provided over 1517 law enforcement dogs in 49 states with protective vests since 2009 at a cost of more than $1.4 million.

Vested Interest in K9s, Inc. announces their signature tank top is now available online for a $20 donation at www.vik9s.org. Proceeds will provide bullet and stab protective vests, for police dogs actively working without the potentially lifesaving equipment.

The organization orders the U.S. made vests exclusively from distributor Regency Police Supply in Hyannis, Mass., who also does the custom embroidery on the body armor.

New K9 graduates as well as K9's with expired vests are eligible to participate. The program is open to law enforcement dogs who are U.S. employed, certified and at least 19 months of age.
