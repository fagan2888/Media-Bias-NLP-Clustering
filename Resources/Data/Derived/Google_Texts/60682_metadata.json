Even most hospitals don\u2019t know how much a given procedure is supposed to cost, according to a 2013 study from the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nIt\u2019s gotten so bad that even health insurance executives are writing opinion pieces about ways to reduce waste on healthcare payments, which totaled $765 billion in 2009 alone.\n\nInvestors in the new $8.5 million round for Aver Informatics thinks that the company\u2019s new billing management software can provide some semblance of a solution.\n\nThe Green Bay, Wis.-based company sells software that groups treatments into what it calls \u201cepisodes of care\u201d, and then generates a bill for the entire process of treating a health condition, rather than generating a separate charge for each discrete step in the process.\n\nLaunched by Kurt Brenkus, a former auditor with a boutique claims audit firm who also worked at United Healthcare, in June 2010, Aver Informatics\u2019 approach stems from Brenkus\u2019 own knowledge of the healthcare system.\n\n\u201cThe way that the healthcare system works today is a volume-based system,\u201d says Brenkus. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a perverse incentive in a volume-based system to do more services to make more money.\u201d\n\nDespite the government\u2019s steps to curtail healthcare spending through the Affordable Care Act, healthcare spending in the U.S. is still projected to amount to one-quarter of the economy by 2022.\n\nBrenkus says that this is one instance where big data analytics can make a difference, saving millions of dollars for health insurers and patients.\n\nThe savings were apparent to Aver\u2019s customers from the very beginning. \u201cThe first client was a small insurance firm out of Madison, Wis. Within the first three months of working with them we saved them a half a million bucks,\u201d says Brenkus.\n\nAver was able to parlay its first successes into a stint with the healthcare accelerator and advisor Startup Health through its joint venture with GE Ventures \u2014 the investment arm of General Electric, one of the biggest healthcare technology companies in the world and a huge employer in the U.S.\n\nIt was GE Ventures and Drive Capital that led the Series A investment for Aver Informatics. \u201cHealthcare payment reform is one of our top themes,\u201d says Ned Schwartz, a partner with Drive Capital, who previously worked for General Atlantic and Norwest Venture Partners.\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s drawing investors and companies to the Aver service. \u201cOur analytics go over this fee-for-service data and we recreate the way that data works as events-based data. What we do is we add this element of time and we can find information that looks at the type of treatment to determine that treatments are related to either a knee replacement, or a pregnancy, or a heart attack.\u201d\n\nBy determining what are standard progressions of care with positive outcomes, Aver Informatics can create defined processes for the ideal course of treatment at the lowest cost, Schwartz says.\n\nIn some cases, it\u2019s not that the healthcare system is willfully opaque or obfuscating the cost of procedures, it\u2019s that hospitals really don\u2019t know, or are confused themselves about treatment options. \u201cThey have made the equivalent of a Rube Goldberg machine for healthcare payments,\u201d says Berkus. Reimbursement from insurers depends on a series of codes that healthcare providers have to enter and there\u2019s an almost unlimited combination of codes possible for a single treatment.\n\n\u201cThere are so many codes that happen \u2014 for a particular kind of knee surgery there\u2019s probably roughly 100 different codes that you could use depending on the type of knee surgery that you\u2019re doing. We\u2019ve made it so completely complicated,\u201d says Brenkus.\n\nIn the current system, health insurers can only determine whether claims were paid in a timely fashion or not, they have no idea how many heart attack treatments they paid for, according to Berkus.\n\nThere are already 15 customers using Aver Informatics\u2019 software, according to Brenkus, and they\u2019re saving 10% to 50% on payments for treatments across their entire patient populations. In fact, in addition to the new financing, Aver has also added two new customers \u2014 the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Molina Healthcare.\n\n\u201cWhat it comes down to is that there are these billing systems running on these green-screen systems from the 1990s [and updating them] is like trying to change a jet engine in mid-flight,\u201d says Brenkus. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all of this legacy architecture and we\u2019re literally reconfiguring this information on the fly.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, the adoption of technologies like Aver is a direct result of federal and state initiatives, according to a Molina Healthcare executive.\n\n\u201cBy leveraging technology we can align best with federal and state initiatives toward value-based payments. In Ohio, we are working in collaboration with the Ohio Department of Medicaid and the Ohio Office of Health Transformation to further the state\u2019s objective of providing value based health care by implementing a new episode-based payment model,\u201d said Martin Portillo, MD, Chief Medical Officer for Molina Healthcare of Ohio. \u201cThe goal is to develop a program that would incentivize and pay our providers while improving quality and managing costs.\u201d\n\nPhoto via Flickr user TaxRebate.org.uk", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/jonathan-shieber/\" title=\"Posts by Jonathan Shieber\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Jonathan Shieber</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jshieber\" rel=\"external\">@jshieber</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "If you\u2019ve ever been to a doctor in the U.S., you know the befuddling bundle of bills that awaits at the end of the road for your treatment.
