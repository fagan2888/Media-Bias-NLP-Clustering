That changed Friday night.\n\nKansas City clinched a playoff spot for the first time in 29 years, beating the Chicago White Sox 3-1 behind seven scoreless innings from Jeremy Guthrie.\n\nKansas City secured at least a wild card and ended the longest active postseason drought among the major North American sports leagues. The last time the Royals made it to the playoffs, they beat St. Louis in the 1985 World Series.\n\n\u201cIt feels better than expected,\u201d said Billy Butler, a 2004 draft pick and eight-year veteran. \u201cIt\u2019s a great thing. I\u2019m proud to bring this organization something they envisioned when they drafted me.\u201d\n\nSmall-market Kansas City endured more than its share of losing in recent years. But it contended into September last season and kicked down the playoff door on Friday.\n\nThe celebration started right after catcher Salvador Perez squeezed Michael Taylor\u2019s foul popup for the final out. The Royals mobbed Perez near the plate, with the dugout and bullpen quickly joining the party.\n\nA large contingent of Kansas City fans crowded near the visitors\u2019 dugout, and players tossed black and white playoff caps to them before walking off the field.\n\nThe clubhouse was as chaotic as expected, with players dousing each other with bubbly and snapping pictures, whooping it up as the franchise\u2019s years of losing gave way to pure joy.\n\nAs the scene unfolded, Brett looked on with a bottle in one hand and a cup in the other, doing his best to stay dry.\n\n\u201cI got tired of the people criticizing the players on this team because they hadn\u2019t won a World Series since 1985,\u201d he said. \u201cNinety-five percent of these \u2026 guys weren\u2019t even born in \u201885. It\u2019s not their fault. These guys played their (butts) off all year.\u201d\n\nAnd look where they are now.\n\nWith Detroit losing to Minnesota, Kansas City trails the Tigers by a game in the AL Central with two to play. If they are tied after Sunday, the teams will play game No. 163 at Detroit on Monday to determine the division winner.\n\nKansas City also maintained a one-game lead in the wild-card standings over Oakland, which won 6-2 at Texas.\n\nThe postgame celebration eventually returned to the field, where there was more spraying alcohol, more jumping up and down and more pictures, all to the delight of their supporters. Fans chanted \u201cLet\u2019s go Royals!\u201d and some derogatory comments toward Detroit.\n\nThey held up signs that read \u201cMy playoff beard starts growing today,\u201d and \u201cFinally.\u201d\n\nThat probably summed it up best for Kansas City. Yes, finally, the Royals are back.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s been emotional, not only for us but for the city itself, which has supported us all along the way,\u201d closer Greg Holland said.\n\nGuthrie (13-11) could not have been much better, pitching four-hit ball while winning his third straight start. He struck out six and walked one.\n\nThe White Sox scored in the eighth against Wade Davis.\n\nHolland worked the ninth for his 46th save in 48 chances.\n\nAlcides Escobar had two hits, including a leadoff single in Kansas City\u2019s three-run first against Hector Noesi, and the Royals won for the fifth time in six games.\n\nNoesi (8-12) allowed six hits in six innings after it looked as if he might get knocked out early.\n\nChicago\u2019s Paul Konerko began his farewell weekend by going 0 for 4. The retiring slugger, back in the lineup after sitting out Thursday\u2019s game, received loud cheers every time he stepped to the plate, starting with a standing ovation in the second inning.\n\nIn the Royals, Konerko sees some similarities to Chicago\u2019s 2005 championship team with its pitching and timely hitting.\n\n\u201cI think they have a real good shot to go a long ways,\u201d he said. \u201cGood for them. Enjoy it. I\u2019m happy for those guys.\u201d\n\nBrett, meanwhile, had a message for the Royals: \u201cIt\u2019s a good year.
