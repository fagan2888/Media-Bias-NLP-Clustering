On Wednesday, her ex-husband, Monty Brinson, posted a photo of Kim and told her that he loves her.\n\nMonty\u2019s post seems to be in response to a photo and message that Kim sent him. \u201c@kimrichards11 I love you too\u2026. #love #family #blessed#heart #thankful,\u201d he wrote. The photo shows Kim making a kissy face, with the words \u201cI Love You\u201d and a heart symbol underneath. Kim, with her hair around her face and makeup on, looks happy.\n\nIn response to someone, perhaps a viewer of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, who wrote that he/she\u2019s hoping that Kim is getting the help that she needs and that it was so obvious that she wasn\u2019t sober, Monty wrote that Kim is doing \u201cgreat\u201d and that he\u2019s \u201cso proud of her.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Monty Brinson has commented on Kim Richards. Last Wednesday, after Kim\u2019s interview with Dr. Phil aired, Monty posted a lengthy message that defended Kim.\n\n\u201cLaying by the pool in Bel-air on such a beautiful day gathering my thoughts about the Dr Phil Show interviewing @kimrichards11 of all the people in the world I probably know Kim better than anyone. Before you get my response the only thing I would like to say at this moment, Kim is the most loving caring person I\u2019ve ever met. I love her as a person, I love her as a friend. And most of all she loves her children more than anything. They are blessed to have her. drphil#belair#ca#loved#heart#love#sunshine#pool#life#family.\u201d\n\nMonty\u2019s message may have been his way of responding to Dr. Phil criticizing Kim as a mother. During the interview, which took place just days after she was arrested at the Polo Lounge in Beverly Hills after causing a drunken scene and refusing to leave, Dr. Phil chided Kim for not setting a good example for her children. Three of Kim\u2019s children, Brooke Brinson, Chad Jackson, and Kimberly Jackson, were present at the interview.\n\n\u201cYou are drunk in a bar, fighting with a cop. That is not good mothering.\u201d\n\nKim checked herself into rehab shortly after the interview. Yet, Monty and Brooke may soon be celebrating a very special event with Kim in person. On Monday, Radar Online reported that Kim will be allowed to leave the Malibu rehab facility to attend Brooke\u2019s second wedding, which will take place out of the country in a few weeks, with a chaperon from the rehab center in tow.\n\nIf Kim Richards does attend the wedding, she may have some awkward tension with her sister Kyle Richards. During The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 5 reunion show, Kyle accused Kim of not wanting to invite her to Brooke\u2019s second wedding. As previously reported by the Inquisitr, co-star Brandi Glanville implied that Kim has good reason to not invite Kyle since she did something \u201cunspeakable\u201d and \u201cunforgivable\u201d at Brooke\u2019s first wedding, a claim that Kyle later denied.\n\n[Photo by Alberto E.
