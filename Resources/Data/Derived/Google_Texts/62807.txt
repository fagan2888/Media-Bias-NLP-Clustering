A vintage World War II fighter plane built in 1944 crashed Friday morning, killing both people shortly after taking off from the Durango-La Plata County Airport, federal authorities say.

The names, gender and ages of the two crash victims have not been released.

Almost immediately after liftoff, the plane began veering to the left and crashed into County Road 309A, which is a horseshoe-shaped road around the airport, said Dan Bender, spokesman for the La Plata County Sheriff’s Office.

The plane continued for another 100 yards before it came to rest in a meadow, Bender said.

“The plane suffered catastrophic damage on impact,” Bender said.

Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board inspectors, who will determine the cause of the crash, are on their way to the scene, said Ian Gregor, FAA spokesman.

The plane is owned by a Durango business called Bridgewood Holdings, which has an office at 858 Main Ave., according to the FAA Registry.

The fixed-wing, single-engine P-51D Mustang plane had a newer “reciprocating” engine that was built in 1975, according to FAA records.

This type of airplane was used to protect U.S. bombers on raids over Germany.

It typically takes NTSB several months to determine the cause of an accident, Gregor said.
