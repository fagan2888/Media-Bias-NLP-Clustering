Oh boy

Senator Cruz was full of swagger this morning, promising to investigate Planned Parenthood, abolish Common Core, and kill the leader of Iran if he doesn’t tear up the deal.

Ted Cruz does not like the Iran deal.

That’s an understatement.

In front of a crowd of religious voters on Friday morning, Senator Ted Cruz had some pretty extreme things to say about the Iran nuclear deal, namely, he threatened to kill Iran’s leader if he didn’t give up plans for a nuclear program.

“If the ayatollah doesn’t understand that, we may have to help introduce him to the 72 virgins,” Cruz said at the annual Values Voters summit, adding that he would rip the Iran nuclear deal “to shreds” on his first day in office.

The controversial pact reached in July was conceived by the P5+1—the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, Russian and Germany—and the European Union to prevent Iran from securing nuclear weapons while allowing the country to have an exclusively peaceful nuclear program going forward.

Earlier in the speech, Cruz referred to President Obama as “the world’s most powerful communist” and that he should be incarcerated. He also suggested the Democratic debates be held at the Leavenworth prison, which has recently been scouted as a potential transfer point for those detained at Guantanamo.

“If they can project a rainbow on the White House, maybe they can put bars on the windows,” Cruz said.

Among Cruz’s other vows: rescinding whatever he considered to be illegal and unconstitutional executive actions, including a compete repeal of ObamaCare, demanding the Department of Justice investigate Planned Parenthood, and telling the Department of Education, which he says “should be abolished,” that Common Core, which details what students should know at the end of each grade, ends immediately.
