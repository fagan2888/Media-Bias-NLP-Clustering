The man survived.\n\nNeighbors in Huff's quiet Farmington Hills, Mich., subdivision expressed shock at the news.\n\n\u201cFugitive on the run for 30 years?\" Madhuri Raju told local ABC affiliate WXYZ. \"I think we\u2019ve heard stories in the past about this happening, but never in my neighborhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking now I need to be careful,\" another neighbor, Merav Hazan, told the station. \"You never know who is your neighbor. You live in a quiet neighborhood, but you never know who lives behind this door, you know?\u201d\n\nHuff's arrest closed what was the oldest open case in the Lone Star Fugitive Task Force's cold case unit, reports ABC News.\n\n\"The Lone Star Fugitive Task Force out of Texas requested that we apprehend [Huff],\" U.S. Marshals Deputy Robert Watson, of the Eastern District of Michigan, Detroit, told ABC News. \"They developed information that she was in the Farmington Hills area.\"\n\nIn an interesting twist, Huff is the sister-in-law of former University of Michigan and NBA star Jalen Rose, notes the Detroit News. Rose has since stated that he will support Huff, who is married to his brother Kevin, and will pay her legal bills.\n\nNeither Jalen Rose nor any other of Huff's friends are under investigation, Deputy U.S. Marshal Chris Bozeman told ABC News.\n\nMore: Crime News", "article_metadata": {"description": "Better late than never.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-12-22 12:51:35 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Better late than never.", "title": "WATCH: Woman Nabbed After 36 Years On The Run", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/21/kathlyn-regina-huff-arrested-after-36-years_n_4485926.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1528548/images/o-WOMAN-ON-THE-RUN-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostCrime", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1528548/images/o-WOMAN-ON-THE-RUN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "Better late than never.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "WATCH: Woman Nabbed After 36 Years On The Run"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-21 12:51:35 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4485926", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "crime", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Kathlyn Regina Huff,video,Kathlyn Regina Huff Fugitive 36 Years,Kathlyn Regina Huff Arrested,crime news,Texas Woman Arrested After 36 Years", "article": {"section": "Crime", "tag": "Kathlyn Regina Huff,video,Kathlyn Regina Huff Fugitive 36 Years,Kathlyn Regina Huff Arrested,crime news,Texas Woman Arrested After 36 Years", "published_time": "2013-12-21 12:51:35 -0500", "modified_time": "2013-12-21 13:33:19 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfa6\"", "article_summary": "Marshals Deputy Robert Watson, of the Eastern District of Michigan, Detroit, told ABC News.\n\"The Lone Star Fugitive Task Force out of Texas requested that we apprehend [Huff],\" U.S.\nMarshal Chris Bozeman told ABC News.\nIn an interesting twist, Huff is the sister-in-law of former University of Michigan and NBA star Jalen Rose, notes the Detroit News.\nKathlyn Regina Huff, who has since married and changed her name to Kathlyn Regenia Rose, had been on the run since 1977, after local law enforcement alleged she shot her common-law husband in the head, per the Press."}
