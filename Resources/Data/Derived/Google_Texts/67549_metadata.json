You should expect to be disappointed.\n\nMany will have you believe that a full repeal of ObamaCare is not possible, but, in fact, it is. Unfortunately, it may not happen.\n\nAll it would take to set the table for full repeal is Republicans growing a spine.\n\nThe trillion dollar question is whether the Senate Majority Leader and Speaker of the House will allow a Senate staffer, known as the Senate Parliamentarian, to ruin the one possible plan to send a repeal bill to the president this year.\n\nRepublicans can\u2019t use so-called \u201cregular order\u201d to pass a repeal bill because Democrats would filibuster, preventing a final vote. That is why some in the Senate have explored the possibility of using the \u201creconciliation\u201d process. Reconciliation allows Senate members to debate a bill for a certain period of time without having to filibuster and presents the only chance of having a bill reach the president\u2019s desk.\n\nThe budget resolution is supposed to be an annual process where Congress sets overall budget caps for different spending functions to make sure the annual spending bills are consistent with the caps.\n\nAlthough the president sends a budget to Congress every year, the congressionally passed budget never is sent to the president for his signature. This is important because it prevents a president from blocking a budget resolution with a veto.\n\nThe budget resolution this year can be used to set up a vote on full repeal without the possibility of a filibuster. The Obama Administration used the reconciliation process to pass a critical piece of ObamaCare. Therefore, there is a precedent for the use of reconciliation to deal with it.\n\nAlex Bolton of The Hill reports that the Republican plan to use reconciliation to repeal ObamaCare has hit a procedural speed bump:\n\nThe Senate\u2019s chief referee has dealt a significant setback to conservatives who want to send an ObamaCare repeal bill to the president\u2019s desk this year. GOP sources say Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has raised red flags in response to queries about whether it\u2019s possible to use a special budgetary procedure to repeal the controversial law \u201croot and branch,\u201d as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said.\n\nIt is true that the Senate Parliamentarian has raised red flags, but to those who understand the process, the concerns do not rise to the level of defeat.\n\nBolton reported that the Republican interpretation of the rules is not getting a favorable reception, yet there is a strong argument that Senate Republicans are right:\n\nSome conservatives argue that because ObamaCare impacts spending and revenue, 51 Senate Republicans and a majority of the House can pass a one-sentence provision. While President Obama would surely veto a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, many Republicans want to get such a measure on his desk.\n\nThe spokesman for Heritage Action for America (HAFA), Dan Holler, agreed when he argued that \u201cwe think from what we\u2019ve heard there\u2019s a really credible case to be made that the one-sentence repeal instruction for reconciliation passes all the tests.\u201d\n\nAnd the truth of the matter is that is all you need is a credible argument \u2026 in addition to that spine.\n\nOne important fact that is not reported and/or frequently confused by news outlets is that the Senate Parliamentarian is not a constitutional officer. As a result, the opinion of a mere Senate staffer is nothing more than an informed recommendation.\n\nThis is an easy call for Republicans. They need to ignore the recommendation of the Senate Parliamentarian and let the Senate vote on an interpretation of the rules and forge forward.\n\nThink about this debate in terms of the Nuclear Option. The Democrats used that ploy to destroy the idea of a filibuster of judicial nominees. They changed the rules by breaking the explicit terms in the rules that say you need 60 votes to end debate on a nominee. That was a perversion of the Senate\u2019s rules and should not stand.\n\nThis case is very different. The Senate would be dealing with an interpretation of reconciliation rules. A ruling would be a mere disagreement on the interpretation of budget rules that could go either way.\n\nIf Congressional Republicans are willing to fight, they can get this done.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Republicans end up blaming a Senate staffer for upsetting their plan to get rid of ObamaCare ,\u201croot and branch,\u201d then conservatives will confirm a persistent fear that they were never really serious about repeal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "All it would take to set the table for full repeal is Republicans growing a spine.", "title": "A plan to repeal ObamaCare \u2013 root and branch | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015_02_25_201529_2014-06-20T161948Z_1_LYNXMPEA5J0OK_RTROPTP_3_USA.JPG", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2015/02/27/a-plan-to-repeal-obamacare-root-and-branch/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "All it would take to set the table for full repeal is Republicans growing a spine.", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015_02_25_201529_2014-06-20T161948Z_1_LYNXMPEA5J0OK_RTROPTP_3_USA.JPG", "description": "All it would take to set the table for full repeal is Republicans growing a spine.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@BrianHDarling"}}, "article_summary": "Alex Bolton of The Hill reports that the Republican plan to use reconciliation to repeal ObamaCare has hit a procedural speed bump:The Senate\u2019s chief referee has dealt a significant setback to conservatives who want to send an ObamaCare repeal bill to the president\u2019s desk this year.\nRepublicans can\u2019t use so-called \u201cregular order\u201d to pass a repeal bill because Democrats would filibuster, preventing a final vote.\nMany will have you believe that a full repeal of ObamaCare is not possible, but, in fact, it is.\nA ruling would be a mere disagreement on the interpretation of budget rules that could go either way.\nOne important fact that is not reported and/or frequently confused by news outlets is that the Senate Parliamentarian is not a constitutional officer."}
