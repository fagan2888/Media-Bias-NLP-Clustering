As nearly as I can tell, there are two kinds of American women: the majority, who believe that athletic shoes go with absolutely everything; and a measly minority who would rather limp through life than wear those things on their feet. For stubborn holdouts like me, these ballet flats in candy colors are a walkable, breathable summer option. The leather-top, rubber-soled flats have what the maker calls "proprietary pluggz grounding technology," with padded memory foam arches and heels, moisture wicking, anti-microbial lining and a "trampoline heel" for extra support, stability and comfort. The company claims its technology fights inflammation by, in effect, conducting electrons from the earth to recharge your feet — instead of insulating them as other cusioned soles do. I don't know about that, but I can testify that I wore a pair comfortably from work to tai chi class, and from a morning of moving furniture to a long afternoon walk on asphalt. My finicky feet felt better than they have in anything else — even Mephistos. And maybe there's something to that conductivity claim: When you drive a car in these flats, you become aware of feeling the engine's vibation, in a pleasant, massage-like way. Nine colors, $129.
