Bell and his wife got their son into counseling, and Jadin appeared to be doing well.\n\nThen he hanged himself.\n\nRacked with guilt, Bell chided himself over scolding Jadin for smoking a few days before the hanging. The Oregon man worried that he couldn\u2019t survive this grief.\n\nBell knew he had to do something. Then it came to him: He\u2019d walk across the country, sharing Jadin\u2019s story.\n\nAt any given time, as many as 20 people are attempting to cross the United States on foot, Nate Damm figures. The website he started following his own transcontinental trek has become a must-read for walkers, full of advice, tracking information and a running debate on the \u201cwhy\u201d of such journeys.\n\nThat last part can get complicated.\n\nMany walk for a cause. Some do it, well, just because.\n\nTwo years after his own walk, Damm still can\u2019t put into words just why he did it. His Delaware-to-California hike over eight months in 2011 grew from \u201can idea that I had that just kind of wouldn\u2019t leave me alone,\u201d says the 25-year-old Maine native, who\u2019s currently tracking about a half dozen walkers. \u201cAnd I thought about it for a couple of years and I would go, \u2018Oh, it\u2019ll pass. It\u2019s a phase.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut it didn\u2019t pass \u2014 for him, or for others.\n\nEven for those who articulate a cause \u2014 something they\u2019re raising awareness of, or money for \u2014 there\u2019s often more behind these grueling undertakings.\n\nJonathon Stalls walked under the auspices of Kiva, a group that helps connect small investors with entrepreneurs in developing countries. In the end, though, he says he was simply answering a \u201cpersonal call to engage in quieter, slower, and more intentional experiences with less.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our most inherent form of transportation. It\u2019s our most basic form. It\u2019s our first form,\u201d says the 31-year-old Denver man, who walked sea-to-sea in 2010.\n\nFor Matt Green, it was as if he were being urged on by some instinctual, irrepressible need from a collective past to challenge himself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like in the American DNA,\u201d says the 33-year-old New Yorker, who quit an engineering job at the height of the \u201cGreat Recession\u201d and walked to the Oregon coast in 2010. \u201cWe have this kind of romance of the pioneers heading west.\u201d\n\nAlong his route, Green confronted the same persistent question \u2014 people asking for some easily identified reason. He couldn\u2019t really give one.\n\nNear the end of his journey, though, someone visiting his website posted a quotation from philosopher and civil rights leader Howard Thurman: \u201cDon\u2019t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.\u201d\n\nThose words have become his motto.\n\nUltimately, the reasons for walking are deeply personal. As Joe Bell put it to one newspaper reporter he met along his route, \u201cIt was either lie in bed like I was and die, or fight back.\u201d\n\nAnd so he set out, traveling the land, talking about Jadin, and hoping it might save lives \u2014 maybe even his own.\n\n***\n\nWalkers often set out on what they think is a solitary journey, and yet few really do it completely alone.\n\nWhen Mike Ross told his grandmother that he and high school buddy George Crawford were hiking to California, she had just one question: What cause are you walking for?\n\nTruth is, the 19-year-old Manchester, Conn., men were just out for one last big adventure before heading to Marine boot camp.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to get out of there,\u201d Ross said while waiting out a recent snowstorm in a donated Colorado motel room. \u201cI figured it would be a great way to get in shape, a great way to see our country.\u201d\n\nBut over time, Ross and Crawford decided their trek did need some higher purpose. Both men\u2019s families had been touched by cancer. They decided to walk for the Livestrong Foundation, with a goal of raising $20,000 toward finding a cure.\n\nSome cross-country trekkers carry everything on their backs; most push carts. Steve Wescott has a goat with canvas saddlebags.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to be a gimmick,\u201d the Seattle man said as he struggled to keep LeeRoy Brown from straying onto busy U.S. 40 outside Kansas City, Kan., on a recent blustery afternoon. \u201cHe was just going to help carry the load, and now he is the reason why people talk to me.\u201d\n\nWith their matching chin whiskers, Wescott and LeeRoy make quite the pair. Wearing a reflective vest over his red fleece jacket, Wescott flashes the \u201cPeace\u201d sign at passing vehicles as LeeRoy trots along beside him, a red bandanna tied around his neck.\n\nThe 34-year-old rock guitarist had already been thinking of walking the country when his bandmates voted him out of the group. He and LeeRoy have been walking since May 2, 2012, to raise money for an orphanage in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya. Their goal is New York City\u2019s Times Square.\n\nHe knows there are easier ways to raise money. But this way, he gets \u201cto see the kindness of America.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want 5,000 people to give $5,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to get to New York and say, \u2018Look what WE built.\u2019\u201d\n\nOstensibly, Malene Comes\u2019 \u201cConversation with America\u201d walk is about raising awareness of obesity \u2014 a condition with which she\u2019s struggled her entire adult life. But it\u2019s much more than that.\n\nUnemployed and awaiting the formal dissolution of her 13-year marriage, Comes had \u201clost every sense of myself and the world I was in as anything other than a hostile place and a scary place.\u201d\n\nAfter two suicide attempts in three months, the 41-year-old Eldridge, Calif., woman sold her belongings, put her three cherished cats in foster care and lit out, pushing a modified baby stroller.\n\nOn a recent evening, the headlight of a passing freight train was all that illuminated the pitch blackness as Comes put the finishing touches on her simple campsite and prepared to text a nightly \u201csafety check\u201d to a friend in New York.\n\nShe had just emerged from a desolate 200-mile stretch of the Mojave Desert. No \u201ccouch-surfing\u201d opportunities here, and so she opted for a sleeping bag and blanket of stars.\n\nComes has shed more than 20 of the 289 pounds she was carrying on her 5-foot-2 frame when she left a Santa Monica beach on Aug. 29. In some ways, though, she already feels so much lighter.\n\n\u201cYeah, this is scary,\u201d she said as the train cars rumbled past. \u201cBut maybe less scary than killing myself.\u201d\n\nJoe Bell came to a similar conclusion.\n\n***\n\nOn Jan. 19, a passer-by found Jadin hanging from a piece of elementary school playground equipment in La Grande, Ore. The high school cheerleader and budding artist died on Feb. 3 without ever regaining consciousness.\n\nWhen he emerged from the fog of his own despair, Bell was seized by a desperate need to help others see what he could not.\n\nHe took a leave from his job of 17 years at a Boise Cascade plywood mill and began mapping out his route to New York City \u2014 a place Jadin had visited on an eighth-grade field trip, and where he had dreamed of someday living. Friends helped Bell launch a Facebook page.\n\nOn April 20, Bell said goodbye to his wife, Lola Lathrop, and their 13-year-old son, Joseph, and set out, pushing a loaded three-wheeled cart.\n\nWith two artificial knees, the 48-year-old\u2019s gait was brisk, but awkward. Barely a week out, angry red sores erupted on his feet; the skin beneath his toes cracked open and bled.\n\nAs he walked, Bell stopped at schools, libraries, community centers, bars \u2014 anyplace where he could share his son\u2019s story. On June 4, Bell posted a \u201cletter\u201d from Jadin.\n\n\u201cToday i\u2019m celebrating my 16th birthday in Heaven,\u201d it said. \u201cMy presents are flowers, rainbows and angel food cake. \u2026 Yes, birthdays in Heaven are wonderful and gay.\u201d\n\nBell\u2019s way was paved with a thousand kindnesses.\n\nA sporting goods store owner reading of Bell\u2019s blisters helped doctor his feet and fitted him with proper shoes. When his cart was stolen, someone replaced it with a better one. He received gifts of safety glasses, granola bars, bottled water. He even picked up a whole new support system.\n\nAmy Maple, founder of the nonprofit Excuse Me While I Change the World, had asked Bell to give a talk in Salt Lake City. Moved by his passion, she and Ann Clark, who\u2019d met Bell along the road, helped him incorporate his own group, Joe\u2019s Walk For Change, and coordinated speaking engagements for him along his route.\n\nMaple also arranged for Bell to get some training about how to help parents recognize warning signs in suicidal youths. Through it, he gradually let go of any lingering feelings of guilt over Jadin\u2019s death.\n\nBy late July, Bell had made it to Steamboat Springs, Colo., a ski resort town. He decided to stay a few days.\n\nHe needed the rest. And he wanted to give a fellow traveler who\u2019d contacted him time to catch up.\n\n___\n\nFor as long as he can remember, Australian Benjamin Lee has dreamed of visiting every country. With nearly 40 stamps in his passport by age 24, he was well on his way.\n\nIn late 2012, Lee graduated with a degree in environmental science from Melbourne\u2019s Deakin University. He knew he would soon \u201cneed to settle down and get a full-time job,\u201d but craved one more grand adventure.\n\n\u201cSomething I can tell my grandchildren about.\u201d\n\nHe knew it had to be in America.\n\nPlanning a transcontinental route that he reckoned would take eight months and 10 million steps, Lee decided to walk on behalf of Oxfam America, part of a global charity.\n\nLike others, he looked to Damm for advice \u2014 such as including bear spray in your pack and always walking \u201cso you can face the vehicles that are coming at you.\u201d\n\nLee and a Canadian woman he\u2019d met online began their trek in San Francisco on May 18.\n\nBut a month and a half into the trip, after crossing a stretch of Utah desert, his companion decided she\u2019d had enough. Overcome by loneliness, Lee tapped out a text to his family: \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I\u2019m done.\u201d But he didn\u2019t send it.\n\nAs he trudged eastward, Lee kept hearing stories about another walker who\u2019d just passed through. Google searches connected him with the man, Joe Bell, and they met in Steamboat Springs on July 31. Despite the age difference, they hit it off immediately and agreed to travel together as far as Boulder.\n\nOn Aug. 2, they hiked 22 miles to the top of Rabbit Ears Pass, straddling the Continental Divide at 9,426 feet above sea level. Bell took to calling his sprightly companion \u201cYoung Buck.\u201d\n\n\u201cHurry up, old man,\u201d Lee would tease, though, in these high elevations, the Aussie was happy for an excuse to slacken the pace a bit.\n\n\u201cI really admire this young man,\u201d Bell wrote of Lee on his blog.\n\nOver the next three weeks, Bell posted many photos of Lee: Standing along the banks of the Colorado River; trying on a Smokey Bear hat in a mountain gift shop. When they went to the movies, Bell would place a piece of Red Vines licorice on the seat beside him, in remembrance of the son with whom he used to share the candy.\n\nOn Aug. 18, they gathered with friends and family at a Boulder brewery for a farewell dinner. Bell\u2019s wife and younger son were there, as were Damm and Stalls. As a gay man, Stalls had followed news of Jadin Bell\u2019s suicide. When he learned of the father\u2019s walk, he embraced and encouraged it.\n\nThe group of transcontinental walkers swapped stories of near misses and of vehicles swerving to give them a scare. When Bell said he preferred walking after sunset, Stalls was taken aback.\n\n\u201cOh, man,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to stop walking at night. Especially when you get into these flatter, high-traffic states.\u201d\n\nWhen dinner was over, the group posed for a photo. Lee posted it on his Facebook page.\n\n\u201cit was great to share our stories because they are some of the very few people who truly know what Joe and I are experiencing,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFollowing their dinner, Stalls kept in touch with Bell. When the older man reached Kansas, Stalls planned to accompany him for several days.\n\nOn Oct. 10, Stalls logged onto Bell\u2019s website to check his progress. That\u2019s how he learned the shocking news: Bell would not finish his trek.\n\nHe was walking along two-lane U.S. 40 about 20 miles northwest of Kit Carson, Colo., around dusk on Oct. 9 when the driver of a tractor-trailer hauling Idaho potatoes to Texas apparently fell asleep at the wheel. According to the Colorado State Patrol, Bell was walking with the flow of traffic, and was struck from behind and killed.\n\nStalls was devastated. \u201cI just had a lot of really deep connections with his experience,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a much bigger space of loss than just the cross-America walk.\u201d\n\nIn a video posted the day before his death, Bell was upbeat, despite an obvious limp.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a spring chicken anymore, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said with a chuckle. Still, even though he could feel winter coming, he was undaunted.\n\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019m out here for,\u201d he said, \u201cis to make change.\u201d\n\nAlthough Bell\u2019s mission to honor one son has left another fatherless, his wife does not regret letting him go.\n\n\u201cHe needed to do this,\u201d Lathrop says. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have gone if we didn\u2019t support it.\u201d\n\nShortly before his death, Bell told Maple that he wanted to have a million followers by the time he reached New York. Now, volunteers have pledged to raise $1 million and walk a million miles in Bell\u2019s honor.\n\nAnd others are continuing Bell\u2019s trek to New York.\n\n***\n\nAs Benjamin Lee neared the end of his own journey, he certainly felt his fallen friend\u2019s presence.\n\nAround midday on Nov. 30, the Australian crested the pine-studded dunes at the upper end of Cape Henlopen State Park in Delaware and reached the Atlantic. Lee, who\u2019d celebrated his 25th birthday in September, had walked 3,432 miles.\n\nSeveral times in the days leading up to this one, Lee\u2019s eyes had welled with tears as he thought about this moment. Now, staring out into the ocean, he felt joy, but also relief.\n\nLee took off his shoes and socks, and walked into the icy surf, savoring the squish of sand between his toes. Then he reached into his bag and pulled out a package of Red Vines licorice.\n\nHe stuck two pieces into the sand \u2014 one each for Joe and Jadin.\n\nHe said a few words, just to himself, then watched until the waves carried the candy\n\nAllen G.
