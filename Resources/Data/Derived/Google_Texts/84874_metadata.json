Mayo has hospital locations in Jacksonville and Phoenix and it has concierge practices in both places.\n\nNCH became a member of the Mayo Clinic Care Network in 2012, and local doctors can communicate electronically with Mayo physicians for feedback, especially in complex cases.\n\nHaven, who has been with NCH for four years, said letters have been sent out to patients to inform them of the change and offer them the chance to sign up for the new practice.\n\nConcierge practices began springing up in the late 1990s, created by physicians who wanted to control their practices and limit the number of patients they see in order to provide more tailored primary-care services.\n\nThat includes giving patients 24/7 access using a cell phone number. Many concierge physicians also make house calls or visits to corporate executives\u2019 private offices.\n\nNaples saw its first concierge practice in 2002. There are at least 20 of these practices in the community today, not including some hybrid practices where physicians do it part time, said Dr. Ron Garry, a geriatrician whose practice is Naples Premier Concierge. He said demand is high and there\u2019s plenty of business to go around.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a smart move on (NCH\u2019s) part,\u201d Garry said. \u201cIt\u2019s a model here to stay and why not take part in it.\u201d\n\nThe NCH annual membership fee is $3,000 per patient, and the practice will accept commercial insurance and Medicare for the traditional medical care that is reimbursable by insurance plans.\n\nHaven developed an interest in a concierge practice after helping a family member through an illness.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to give that type of attention to each of my patients,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I knew that, it just became more evident to me when I was doing it (with my family member).\u201d\n\nHe will now accept 200 to 300 patients in his concierge practice, a dramatic reduction from 4,000 patients he saw in his earlier practice, with the help of a nurse practitioner.\n\nHanson also will have 200 to 300 patients in the concierge practice.\n\nGarry, of Naples Premier, said his practice is full and he recently had to turn away five people, so he isn\u2019t worried about competition from NCH.\n\nGarry said he has not heard of hospital-run concierge practices because they originated years ago out of doctors\u2019 frustrations with the traditional medical system. At the same time, there is no one way to run a concierge practice.\n\n\u201cThere is no fixed model,\u201d Garry said, adding that typical annual membership fees in Naples run between $1,500 and $10,000 a year.\n\nThe American Academy of Private Physicians, based in Virginia and started in 2003, says concierge medical practices don\u2019t focus only on the wealthy; there are practices that fit any budget, according to president Dr. Matthew Priddy. There are now more than 5,000 physicians practicing concierge medicine in the U.S.\n\nThe American Medical Association in Chicago expects increased interest in concierge services. Many patients, especially older adults, fear it will be harder to see their doctors since more people have insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe NCH concierge fee will include three months admission to NCH\u2019s wellness centers, weekly sessions with a personal trainer during those three months and five consults with a nutritionist, Haven said.\n\nThe wellness centers are in the NCH Medical Plaza next to the Downtown Naples Hospital and in the Greentree Plaza off Immokalee Road in North Naples.\n\nBesides offering primary-care services through the concierge practice, another key component will be preventive care through nutrition and fitness, according to NCH.\n\nHaven and Hanson will host an open house on Oct. 23, from 5:30 to 7 p.m. and again on Oct. 30 from 5:30 to 7 p.m. For more information about NCH Concierge Medicine or to register for the open house, call (239) 624-8200.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Doctor's \u00e2\u0080\u0098concierge' service coming to NCH", "og": {"url": "http://www.naplesnews.com/news/health/doctors-concierge-service-coming-to-nch-ep-620931745-336385461.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/stethoscope_1410534110478_7973810_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 426}, "type": "article", "description": "A doctor's concierge service where patients pay an annual fee for greater access to their doctors, is now open at NCH.", "title": "Doctor's \u00e2\u0080\u0098concierge' service coming to NCH"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/stethoscope_1410534110478_7973810_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "title": "Doctor's \u00e2\u0080\u0098concierge' service coming to NCH", "description": "A doctor's concierge service where patients pay an annual fee for greater access to their doctors, is now open at NCH.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ndn"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ndn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdebaf\"", "article_summary": "Besides offering primary-care services through the concierge practice, another key component will be preventive care through nutrition and fitness, according to NCH.\nBy Liz Freeman of the Naples Daily NewsA concierge medical practice with a twist has come to Collier County - thanks to the NCH Healthcare System.\nThe NCH Concierge Medicine Practice opened at 870 111th Ave. N. in North Naples with doctors Robert Hanson and Jesse Haven, both of whom are board-certified in family medicine.\nHaven developed an interest in a concierge practice after helping a family member through an illness.\nThe NCH concierge fee will include three months admission to NCH\u2019s wellness centers, weekly sessions with a personal trainer during those three months and five consults with a nutritionist, Haven said."}
