Call it the Obamacare donut hole after the famous Medicare prescription drug coverage gap.\n\nOr, perhaps more accurately, call it the Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley donut hole.\n\nWhatever you call it, Liz Conway is in it.\n\nThe soon-to-be-uninsured 62-year-old Lillian woman is one of hundreds of thousands in Alabama -- one of millions across the nation -- who don't make enough money to qualify for help with her health insurance payments under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOpen enrollment for Jan. 1 insurance coverage begins Oct. 1.\n\nThat's right. It's not that she makes too much money. She doesn't make enough to get financial help with her insurance.\n\n\"It's crazy that I'm too poor for Obamacare,\" Conway said.\n\n\n\n\n\nConway, a breast cancer survivor, is too young for Medicare. She is currently on COBRA, an expensive and temporary health insurance plan available after leaving a job. The Affordable Care Act -- dubbed Obamacare -- was supposed to be a godsend, she thought, when she first started exploring it months ago.\n\nBut what Conway learned is that she doesn't qualify for help yet someone making four times her annual income does.\n\nAn estimated 300,000 others in Alabama and nearly 6 million nationwide are in the same boat because Alabama and 21 other states have declined federal assistance to expand Medicaid.\n\nHere's how that works:\n\nOn Oct. 1, enrollment will begin in the state, and nationwide, in what the government calls the \"Health Care Marketplace.\"\n\nPrivate company insurance plans will be offered for selection and people can compare them and buy them.\n\nSubsidies in the form of direct tax credits will be offered on a sliding scale to those earning between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nFor example, a 50-year-old making 100 percent of the poverty level or $11,490 per year would only have to pay $230 per year on an $4,528 premium -- that's 95 percent paid for by the government. However, if you make anything less than that, even one dollar less -- $11,489 -- you don't get any subsidy and would have to pay the entire premium should you want that coverage.\n\nEven if that 50-year-old individual makes four times or 400 percent of poverty level, $45,960, he or she would still get some help, however small, to the tune of $162 annually on a $4,528 plan.\n\nThese figures come from a Kaiser Family Foundation calculator, available online, linked and recommended for consumers by the U.S. Health and Human Services website, the agency in charge of implementing Obamacare. It is only meant to give an estimate of possible subsidies until enrollment starts on Oct. 1. More specific pricing on premiums in Alabama were released today. For example the lowest cost medium range plan in Alabama averages $303 per month or $3,636 per year.\n\nOfficials stressed that every individual and family case could be different depending on other variables. But the gap or hole is acknowledged. There's even a webpage on the healthcare.gov website devoted to the question: \"What if my state is not expanding Medicaid?\"\n\n\"The problem is that because of a lack of expansion of Medicaid, there is going to be this significant group of people who won't qualify for Medicaid,\" said HHS spokesman Deric Gilliard. \"There's this hole under 100 percent.\"\n\nWhen the bill was written, that hole was accounted for under the assumption that all 50 states would be required to expand Medicaid using federal subsidies to include everyone under 133 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court ruled June 28, 2012, that states don't have to take that offer and can opt out of the Medicaid expansion. Alabama is currently one of 22 states that has so far turned down the federal offer. Three other states are still debating it and 26 are taking the offer, according to Kaiser.\n\nThe number of those in Alabama that the expansion would cover is about 300,000 and generate nearly $1 billion in new state tax revenue, according to a University of Alabama at Birmingham study by economists David Becker and Michael Morrisey released last year. These 300,000 Alabamians, like Liz Conway, are the people in the gap or hole.\n\n\"The same story will apply across all the non-expansion states,\" Morrisey said.\n\nIndeed, the policy think tank Urban Institute estimates there will be 5.8 million people ineligible for health care through expanded Medicaid because they live in one of the 22 states declining the federal help.\n\nAlabama Gov. Robert Bentley has repeatedly stressed his opposition to accepting the Medicaid expansion, recently saying it is part of a \"long-term goal ... to resist the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\n\"For adults without a disability it is extremely difficult in Alabama to qualify for Medicaid,\" said Jim Carnes, communications director of Alabama Arise, a nonprofit helping to inform people about the health reform. \"If you're an adult without children, you can just about forget it. If you're a parent in a family of four, the income limit for you is $194 per month. If you make $200 a month you don't qualify for Medicaid.\"\n\nConway said she doesn't qualify for Medicaid and is looking at selling some stock she's held for decades to boost her income level to the point she can get a subsidy. Others don't have that luxury.\n\n\n\nTheresa Gilliland, 43, of Adamsville, was hoping the Affordable Care Act would help her. But based on her $19,000 annual income for a family of four, it doesn't appear she will qualify for a subsidy. Using the Kaiser calculator, Gillilland would receive $0 to go toward a health plan estimated at $7,585 per year.\n\n\"I've applied for Medicaid before and been turned down,\" she said.\n\nGilliland said she has a health condition and likely needs surgery, something beyond what she can get at her primary care provider Hope Health Center, a faith-based clinic serving the poor in Fairfield. She works at a small hot dog restaurant which offers no insurance.\n\n\"I'm not really sure what to do,\" Gilliland said.\n\nLike Conway, if Gilliland had made more money, $23,550 to $94,200 for a family of four, she would qualify for a subsidy. But because she falls under the $23,550 level, she gets no help with a premium.\n\nSuzanne Kimbrell, 50, of Helena, worked 28 years as a dental technician before she could no longer physically do the job, she said.\n\n\"I have nerve damage in my right hand,\" she said. \"It's real delicate work and I can't hold on to the brushes and equipment.\"\n\nKimbrell has pursued other jobs, and has waited tables at a restaurant for a while, but is currently unemployed and without insurance. She receives primary care at Community of Hope, a Shelby County faith-based clinic, but had no insurance for an emergency room visit recently when she fell and broke three ribs.\n\nHer mother is helping with some expenses, she said.\n\n\"We need to have something for people who are out of work and can't afford COBRA,\" Kimbrell said. \"I've worked a long time and put into the system. Now I feel like I'm not getting anything back. Anything would be better than nothing.\"\n\nOne Birmingham woman, who asked not to be identified by name, said she has been out of work six months after being laid off in a reduction in workforce. She has insurance but it has a $2,000 deductible on a plan costing $440 per month, and she has medical issues that she can't afford to pay for. She said the only way she is getting by now is through the help of her church.\n\nThe 63-year-old woman hopes to somehow piece it together until she qualifies for Medicare at 65.\n\n\"What does someone like me do on Oct. 1, 2013?\" she asked.\n\nHHS and outreach organizations are urging anyone needing insurance to enroll.\n\n\"We are encouraging people to go ahead and apply,\" said M.J. Ellington, policy analyst with Alabama Arise\n\nIf someone applies, it at least gets them into the system. If they don't qualify for coverage, they would be directed to resources such as community health centers for care, she said.\n\nThose with children may still qualify for All Kids (CHIP) which would get coverage for children -- but only the children, said Doug Hoffman, volunteer coordinator with AIDS Alabama, which received federal grant money to help people navigate the new health reform.\n\n\"By applying through the federal marketplace, we will be able to inform them of anything they may qualify for such as All Kids,\" Hoffman said.\n\nAdam, a small businessman in the Birmingham area, said his three children qualify for health care under All Kids, but that he is unable to provide insurance for his four employees or himself and his wife. His income fluctuates around $24,000 and some months he qualifies for food stamps, other months he doesn't.\n\nHis income level is too low to qualify for an Obamacare subsidy on the exchange.\n\n\"I'm just not making enough money for extra things like health insurance or steaks on Friday night,\" said Adam, who asked that his last name not be used. \"It's an ongoing battle to have the basic things. When I put food on the table, it often might be ramen noodles.\"\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, news", "title": "Obamacare in Alabama has a hole in it (video)", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare in Alabama has a hole in it (video)\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/09/obamacare_in_alabama_has_a_hol.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/wire/photo/13470307-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11308749\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-25T16:44:27Z\", \"author\": \"Mike Oliver | moliver@al.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\",\"Affordable Care Act\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/wire/photo/13470307-standard.jpg", "creator": "@MikeOliverAL", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Call it the gap.
