And while it\u2019s hardly fair to directly compare the two issuers \u2014 Anthem has a presence in all 19 of Covered California\u2019s regions, whereas Valley is only offering plans in Santa Clara County \u2014 the contrast is eye-catching.\n\nIt\u2019s also telling. The biggest players, so far, are getting enormous market share from Covered California\u2019s customers. The smaller plans are seeing a trickle.\n\nSo Far, Exchange Strengthens Market Position of Large Plans\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance exchanges were supposed to open up the market \u2014 \u201cmore choices, greater competition,\u201d trumpets a 2010 White House fact sheet. They were a rare Obamacare idea that\u2019s enjoyed consistent Republican support. And several experts told \u201cRoad to Reform\u201d in July that Valley and other small health plans were the ones to watch in California\u2019s exchange.\n\nBut what if the exchanges are leading to market consolidation, not competition? It seems premature to ask, but here\u2019s a picture of\n\nthe Covered California market from October:\n\n28% of customers picked Anthem plans;\n\n26% picked Kaiser Permanente plans;\n\n26% picked Blue Shield of California plans; and\n\n16% picked Health Net plans.\n\nThat means that fewer than 4% of customers were divvied up between the other seven plans currently available on the exchange.\n\nIt\u2019s worth repeating: Unlike smaller plans like Valley, Sharp and a few others that only focused on a slice of California\u2019s population, the \u201cbig four\u201d issuers chose to offer plans across the state. Their broader presence helped goose their enrollment numbers.\n\nBut that alone can\u2019t explain customers\u2019 shopping patterns, because similar proportions show up when drilling down into individual regions.\n\nIn October, Valley captured about 2% of new Covered California customers in Santa Clara County; the other 98% were split between the big four.\n\nContra Costa Health Plan got about 4% of the new customers in its county; the rest went with the big four.\n\nWestern Health Advantage saw fewer than 2% of new customers in the North Bay and Sacramento Valley regions, while the remainder were split between Anthem, Kaiser and Blue Shield. (Health Net isn\u2019t offering plans in those regions).\n\nThree Drivers of Customer Behavior\n\nSo why the market dominance by the large issuers? Experts suggest a few factors.\n\nThe power of name recognition: The big four plans presently command more than 80% of the individual insurance market in California. \u201cOne might expect [the large plans] to have an even bigger advantage early on due to their recognized brands and marketing muscle,\u201d Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Larry Levitt told California Healthline via email.\n\nThe power of being an ex-customer: Some new plan members are very recent old members; officials at several plans suggested that more than 10% of new enrollees were former customers. So while most of the sign-ups may be with the major plans like Anthem and Kaiser, most of the plan cancellations have been with them, too.\n\nChallenges with the website: The lack of plan quality ratings and provider directories may have hindered head-to-head comparisons \u2014 even as cautious insurers delayed their marketing campaigns \u2014 again leading customers to stick with names that may have been familiar.\n\nMeanwhile, price was expected to be a lever for consumer choice \u2014 that was the case in Massachusetts, at least. But so far, it\u2019s unclear whether it\u2019s being weighted as heavily in California. In several regions, there didn\u2019t appear to be much correlation between plan prices and sign-ups.\n\nStill, it\u2019s \u201cway too early to read too much into the early enrollment numbers,\u201d Micah Weinberg of the Bay Area Council told \u201cRoad to Reform.\u201d\n\nThe October sign-ups weren\u2019t representative of Covered California\u2019s expected, and eventual, pool of customers, Weinberg pointed out. Look at the huge percentage of non-subsidized customers, who out-numbered subsidized customers by about five-to-one, he noted. Or the lack of Spanish-speaking customers, who made up just 3% of enrollees in October but represent 60% of the state\u2019s uninsured population, Anna Gorman reports at Kaiser Health News.\n\n\u201cThe population that\u2019s enrolled to date, as far as we understand, is a population with greater health care needs,\u201d Weinberg added.\n\n\u201cSo they may be more likely to go with what they know, or go with the sort of well-known needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019ll know a lot more later on,\u201d Weinberg predicted.\n\nWill Small Plans Stick it Out?\n\nWeinberg and others also raise the question of whether more plans are necessarily better for consumers. Some studies have suggested that just three-to-four insurers are enough to make a region competitive, although exchange rates significantly fall as the number of competitors rises.\n\nWould the smaller plans drop out if they don\u2019t get enough customers? That\u2019s unlikely, experts and historical evidence suggest.\n\n\u201cI suspect there is a volume level at which a plan would decide it\u2019s not worth the administrative expense associated with participating,\u201d Kaiser\u2019s Levitt muses, \u201cbut I imagine that\u2019s pretty low. Probably the bigger issue is in putting together a provider network \u2026 [with] a whole-new provider network, the economics may not work at low volumes.\u201d\n\nAnd exchanges can lead to disproportionate enrollment gains for their smaller plans \u2014 eventually. In Massachusetts, Neighborhood Health Plan saw its enrollment nearly double to about 230,000 between 2006 and 2011, largely attributable to the state\u2019s new mandate and insurance exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts \u2014 the state\u2019s largest insurer by number of members \u2014 saw the biggest decline in market share across that period, losing about 175,000 enrollees even as other plans added more than 500,000.\n\n\u201cOverall, the Health Connector has spurred competition and created an efficient distribution model for smaller plans and new offerings,\u201d according to David Williams, president of the Massachusetts-based Health Business Group. \u201cAnd new plans are [still] signing up,\u201d he added, noting that two more issuers are joining the state\u2019s exchange in 2013 and 2014.\n\nSigns of Success\n\nThere has been some attrition. Two smaller plans that were initially accepted into Covered California \u2014 Ventura County and Alameda Alliance \u2014 ended up not participating in the exchange\u2019s first year.\n\nBut for at least one local insurer, there are signs of success.\n\nThe Chinese Community Health Plan, which is offering plans in the San Francisco and San Mateo regions, had targeted 4,950 new members by the end of March 2014 open enrollment, spokesperson YoungSoo Cho told California Healthline. (The plan had a total of 15,363 members before Covered California opened for business.)\n\nIn October, the plan signed up 216 customers through Covered California \u2014 roughly 12% of all new enrollees in the two regions it serves \u2014 using a strategy that combines raising awareness, a targeted enrollment push, and five in-person enrollment centers, Cho says.\n\nAnd the pace is picking up; sign-ups for the Chinese Community Health Plan nearly quadrupled in November.\n\n\u201cAs of this week, we have exceeded the 1,000 new members through the exchange and we are confident we will hit our goals\u201d by the end of the open enrollment period, Cho added.\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what else is making news as the nation continues to race down the road to reform.\n\nAre White House-led health reforms always doomed to fail? Writing at The Health Care Blog, the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s David Blumenthal explores \u201cthe presidential health care curse.\u201d\n\nMore doctors will take Medicaid patients than you might think. From their perch at The Incidental Economist, Adrianna McIntyre and Austin Frakt look at the \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d around Medicaid, and how some surveys on doctor access can be misleading.\n\nHealthcare.gov isn\u2019t Amazon.com \u2014 but that\u2019s the wrong comparison. The New Republic\u2018s Jonathan Cohn says that it\u2019s valid to contrast the sites (given that President Obama has done it all the time), but the real comparison is to look at the process of purchasing health insurance before and after the website\u2019s launch.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Early data suggest that customers are using the new health insurance exchange to pick plans from large, familiar companies like Anthem and Kaiser, even if plans from smaller companies are comparable in price.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Early data suggest that customers are using the new health insurance exchange to pick plans from large, familiar companies like Anthem and Kaiser, even if plans from smaller companies are comparabl\u2026", "title": "96% of Californians Picked Just Four Health Plans Through Covered California.
