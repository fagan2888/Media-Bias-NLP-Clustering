They feel my story doesn\u2019t fit with what their bosses are telling them.\n\n\n\n\u201cI find it interesting that this article was published right on the heals of he hospital informing their employees that will not receive raises or bonuses again this year; citing profitability and uncertainty,\u201d wrote one of the 15 commenters that responded angrily to the article.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not privy to those conversations. And I didn't interview any St. Vincent execs before writing my article--I just summarized their annual financial report, which can be read here.\n\nIf St. Vincent execs have claimed that slower growth in reimbursements from Medicare and private health insurers means they\u2019re at risk of closing their doors, it wouldn\u2019t be the first time health care executives have trotted out that bit of hyperbole.\n\n\n\nBut I should point out one piece of St. Vincent\u2019s finances that I did not mention in my previous story\u2014which should give the execs a bit of vindication.\n\n\n\nSt. Vincent Health has been sending roughly $50 million to $70 million every year to its parent company, St. Louis-based Ascension Health, to support other hospitals in Ascension's 93-hospital network.\n\n\n\nFor example, in St. Vincent\u2019s most recent year, it transferred $68.8 million to Ascension, which effectively sapped 41 percent of St. Vincent\u2019s operating profit for the year. During the previous year, St. Vincent transferred $48.7 million to Ascension, which represented 24 percent of its operating profit that year.\n\n\n\nLocal St. Vincent executives have privately complained about this for years, because it ties their strategic decisions not to their own performance, but to the performance of all other Ascension hospitals, many of which are in areas that don\u2019t have nearly the level of wealth that Carmel and Indianapolis do.\n\n\n\nLocal hospital executives tell me Ascension is an extremely mission-driven organization, which is committed to keeping hospitals open in areas that need them\u2014even if those hospitals aren\u2019t self-sustaining.\n\n\n\nThat means Ascension\u2019s most profitable markets\u2014Austin, Texas, Nashville, Tenn., and Indianapolis\u2014have to support the rest.\n\n\n\nTo some extent, every local hospital system has this issue. Some of their hospitals are wildly profitable, while others are losing money or breaking even. That\u2019s even true within the St. Vincent system.\n\n\n\nAccording to St. Vincent\u2019s most recent financial report, money-losing ventures, such as St. Vincent Medical Group, St. Vincent Fishers Hospital and St. Vincent New Hope, received transfers from Ascension. St. Vincent Medical Group, the hospital system\u2019s group of 800 employed physicians, received a substantial $158.2 million transfer from Ascension.\n\n\n\nNearly every other St. Vincent facility contributed toward the overall transfer to Ascension, which more than offset the transfers from Ascension.\n\n\n\nBut neither Indiana University Health nor Community Health Network nor Franciscan Alliance have an out-of-state management team to answer to.\n\n\n\nFor the St. Vincent employees among the 865 that lost their jobs, or for the ones upset about the lack of pay raises, I feel your pain. (The newspaper industry has been suffering through similar changes for the past decade.)\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s important to remember that the cuts last year were an Ascension decision, part of 4,700 cuts nationwide.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s still true that St. Vincent has one of the best financial positions among Indiana\u2019s major hospital systems. And I'd rather be in an organization with the strongest patient mix and profit margins than in one with fewer resources with which to withstand the storm of changes in health care right now.", "article_metadata": {"description": "St. Vincent Health has been sending roughly $50 million to $70 million every year to its parent company, St. Louis-based Ascension Health, to support other hospitals in Ascension's 93-hospital network.", "csrf-token": "cnkLPoIOnPTwpErB2Sz1Lbj3XVUr1XcsMW/4bs4KnxE=", "twitter": {"description": "St. Vincent Health has been sending roughly $50 million to $70 million every year to its parent company, St. Louis-based Ascension Health, to support other hospitals in Ascension's 93-hospital network.", "card": "summary", "title": "St. Vincent hospitals not quite as rich as they seem"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/aa-stock-images/og-logo.jpg", "type": "Article", "description": "St. Vincent Health has been sending roughly $50 million to $70 million every year to its parent company, St. Louis-based Ascension Health, to support other hospitals in Ascension's 93-hospital network.", "title": "St. Vincent hospitals not quite as rich as they seem"}, "keywords": "layoffs,employees,hospitals,profit,hospital,health,executives,financial,vincent,execs,Pence,Obamacare,ascension,vincent\u2019s,st", "google-site-verification": "dEpdCgWEqtwBQ26es3xvj1hiJAdg_f1dGEb3ojELomo", "verify-v1": "g4IS1SbAtb6k021/9HzhkZ2B++kYDaZ8FN48PiruaO8=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe007f\"", "article_summary": "Apparently, copies of my story were posted in St. Vincent nurses stations and have circulated among current and former St. Vincent employees.\nAccording to St. Vincent\u2019s most recent financial report, money-losing ventures, such as St. Vincent Medical Group, St. Vincent Fishers Hospital and St. Vincent New Hope, received transfers from Ascension.\nSt. Vincent Health has been sending roughly $50 million to $70 million every year to its parent company, St. Louis-based Ascension Health, to support other hospitals in Ascension's 93-hospital network.\nThe reaction has been palpable ever since I wrote that St. Vincent Health is in solid financial shape.\nNearly every other St. Vincent facility contributed toward the overall transfer to Ascension, which more than offset the transfers from Ascension."}
