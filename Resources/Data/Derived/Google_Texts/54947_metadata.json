What was good for General Motors was also, as a whole, good for the ordinary worker.\n\nThat is no longer so true. Right and left see it. They concur that it\u2019s a huge problem. They describe it in similar ways. They just utterly disagree on what to do about it.\n\n\u201cThe basic bargain at the heart of our economy has frayed,\u201d President Barack Obama lamented last week in a major speech designed to tee up the issue for the 2014 midterm elections. He called \u201cdangerous and growing inequality and lack of upward mobility\u201d the \u201cdefining challenge of our time.\u201d\n\nHis solution, in broad terms, is to spur private sector investment and business confidence. That drew guffaws from the right, which accuses him of quashing growth through burdensome regulations and taxes.\n\n\u201cWe have to continue to relentlessly push a growth agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t tackle inequality if the economic pie is shrinking or stagnant.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Sen. Ted Cruz spoke to a ballroom filled with conservative state lawmakers from around the country. The Texas Republican covered much of the same ground.\n\n\u201cRight now, the top 1 percent in this country, the millionaires and billionaires the president demagogues so much, earn a higher share of our national income than anytime since 1928,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIf you were flying a private jet five years ago, you\u2019re still flying a private jet.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, plenty of folks are left out of the party \u2014 single mothers, young workers, black and Hispanic Americans. To Cruz, that\u2019s an opening for the GOP.\n\n\u201cGrowth yields opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery policy we think about and talk about should focus like a laser on easing the means of ascent up the economic ladder, how it impacts the least well-off among us.\u201d\n\nSurveys show that most Americans see a widening gap between rich and poor, and they\u2019re worried about the harm it may do.\n\nJust over a year ago, as a senator-elect, Cruz touched on the same themes in a post mortem on the party\u2019s disappointing 2012 election results. Mitt Romney\u2019s dismissive comment about the \u201c47 percent\u201d who don\u2019t pay income tax and probably won\u2019t vote Republican, Cruz said, was bad politics, and at odds with GOP principles.\n\n\u201cThe story we conveyed is that the 47 percent are stuck in a static world. We don\u2019t have to worry about them,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nJust how bad is the problem?\n\nResearch published two months ago by University of California at Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez found that the top 10 percent of earners (those with household income above $114,000) accounted for just over half of the nation\u2019s total income last year.\n\nThat\u2019s the biggest share since data collection began nearly a century ago.\n\nAs the economy has rebounded from the 2008 economic crisis, the trends have only gotten worse. Families with income in the top 1 percent have seen their income spike 31 percent from 2009 to 2012.\n\nThe rest of us saw income growth of just 0.4 percent.\n\nObama blamed Republican dogma, \u201ctrickle-down ideology. \u2026 Taxes were slashed for the wealthiest, while investments in things that make us all richer, like schools and infrastructure, were allowed to wither.\u201d\n\nHis solutions include boosting the minimum wage to $9 an hour. Critics warn that that would impede job growth, but backers note that it\u2019s been at $7.25 since July 2009 \u2014 to keep up with inflation, it would have to be $10.74.\n\nHe also promoted his signature health care law as a way to protect the less wealthy.\n\nConservatives say Obama\u2019s failed policies have aggravated the gap. Cruz focuses on \u201cmassive job-killing regulations,\u201d including Obamacare.\n\nThe recipe for growth, he asserted, is this: \u201cYou rein in out-of-control spending, you limit taxes, have fundamental tax reform and pull back crushing regulations that are hammering small businesses. Everytime we have done so, whether in the 1920s, the 1960s, the 1980s, the results have been incredible economic growth.\u201d\n\nGrowth. Both sides agree that\u2019s the secret sauce.\n\nAt least they\u2019re speaking the same language.\n\nFollow Washington Bureau chief Todd J.
