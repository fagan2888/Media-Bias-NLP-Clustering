Marco Rubio (R-FL) and the Marco Polo isn't really your style, you're in luck: You can now purchase a \"Ru(bae)o\" shirt from the candidate's official online store. \"Bae\" is a slang word for a sweetie, baby, or significant other that rose in popularity in 2013.\n\nThe website warns that the shirt is in \"high demand\" and may be delayed.\n\nLove it or hate it, that's one way to reach out to millennials in a humorous manner. I think it's an impressively innovative piece of campaign marketing, and it's actually a decently on-trend shirt design.
