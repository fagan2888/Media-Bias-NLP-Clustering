They have all denied wrongdoing.\n\n(Reporting by Blanca Rodriguez, writing by Paul Day; Editing by Julien Toyer and Richard Balmforth)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "\"I totally deny that I have anything to do with any company based in Panama, or any ot", "title": "Spain's industry minister denies links to Panama Papers firm", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/11/Spains-industry-minister-denies-links-Panama-Papers-firm", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/spain-politics_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/11/Spains-industry-minister-denies-links-Panama-Papers-firm", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/spain-politics_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "\"I totally deny that I have anything to do with any company based in Panama, or any ot", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The minister said he had told his lawyer to contact Panamanian authorities to determine if his name had actually appeared on the papers.\nOther public figures linked to the Panama papers by the Spanish press include FC Barcelona player Lionel Messi, Oscar-winning film director Pedro Almodovar and Literature Nobel Prize-winner Mario Vargas Llosa.\nSoria is among scores of public figures worldwide who have been linked to 11.5 million leaked documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which specializes in setting up offshore companies.\n(Reporting by Blanca Rodriguez, writing by Paul Day; Editing by Julien Toyer and Richard Balmforth)\nPoliticians from all parties, currently struggling to form a coalition to head the next government after inconclusive elections in December, have called for Soria's resignation."}
