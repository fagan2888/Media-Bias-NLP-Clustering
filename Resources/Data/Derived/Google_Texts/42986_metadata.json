Over the same period, the number of uninsured adults has decreased by approximately 152,000, and the 8.2 percent rate of uninsured adults is the lowest recorded in the survey since 2004.\n\nAccording to the report, this downward trend began in 2013, coinciding with the availability of the health insurance marketplace established as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe study outlines care-seeking habits of TennCare recipients as well. When it comes to initial care, the study shows that TennCare enrollees increasingly choose doctors\u2019 offices and clinics versus hospitals and emergency departments.\n\n\u201cAlthough TennCare enrollees are less likely than all households to seek initial care at a doctor\u2019s office or clinic, significantly more initially sought care at those providers in the current survey (94 percent) than in 2014 (90 percent),\u201d said Luna.\n\nThis year a larger share of TennCare enrollees reported receiving information from TennCare. This information includes enrollment cards, information on filing appeals, a list of rights and responsibilities, and the name of their managed care organization.\n\nThe survey, which interviewed approximately 5,000 heads of households by telephone between May and July 2015, is a regular follow-up to previous surveys conducted since 1993.\n\nCBER conducted the survey under contract with the Tennessee Department of Finance and Administration.\n\n\u2014\n\nCONTACT:\n\nLeAnn Luna (865-974-6080, leann@utk.edu)\n\nCarrie McCamey (865-974-6086, cbmccamey@utk.edu)\n\nTyra Haag (865-974-5460, tyra.haag@tennessee.edu)", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Study: TennCare Satisfaction at Record High Level while Tennessee's Uninsured Numbers Continue to Decline\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/tntoday.utk.edu\\/2015\\/10\\/14\\/study-tenncare-satisfaction-record-high-level-tennessees-uninsured-numbers-continue-decline\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-14 10:53:50\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-10-15 10:31:01\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":50568,\"author_id\":\"26\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"Karen Dunlap\",\"tags\":[\"Angela Thacker\",\"Center for Business and Economic Research\",\"Haslam College of Business\",\"LeAnn Luna\"],\"categories\":[\"Faculty &amp; Staff\",\"Headlines\",\"Press Releases\",\"Research\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/tntoday.utk.edu\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/10\\/LeAnn-Luna.gif\"}", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "HandheldFriendly": "True"}, "article_summary": "The study outlines care-seeking habits of TennCare recipients as well.\nWhen it comes to initial care, the study shows that TennCare enrollees increasingly choose doctors\u2019 offices and clinics versus hospitals and emergency departments.\nThe number of uninsured children has dropped by more than half since 2013, and 98.5 percent of children are currently insured.\nThis year a larger share of TennCare enrollees reported receiving information from TennCare.\nThe survey indicates that 95 percent of recipients report satisfaction with the TennCare program, indicating that TennCare provides medical care in a satisfactory manner and meets the expectations of those it serves."}
