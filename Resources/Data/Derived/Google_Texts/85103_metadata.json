Here's just one example from March 2013 . A new survey by PerryUndem Research for Enroll Americapolled both people who are newly insured and still uninsured, and it shows how problematic that lack of knowledge is. Most tellingly, 60 percent of those surveyed wanted to get insurance, but didn't think they could afford it. Only one in five in this group knew that they might qualify for a subsidy to help pay for the premium.\n\nThe pollster, Mike Perry, says, \"There was a disconnect for that group. [\u2026] You don't shop for insurance if you can't pay for insurance.\" So they didn't try. Meanwhile 80 percent of enrollees qualified for the subsidies. But it's not all bad news.\n\n\n\nThe next open enrollment period for Obamacare begins Nov. 15, although people whose circumstances change dramatically\u2014through marriage, job change, or birth of a child\u2014can qualify for a special window in which to enroll. The survey showed 84 percent of those who remain uninsured are open to getting coverage next time. \"Regardless of their feelings about the politics of the Affordable Care Act, they were interested. They were engaged,\" Perry said.\n\nAmong other key findings: 40 percent enrolled because of the individual mandate, though being able to see a doctor and avoiding big medical bill were the other prime motivators; 74 percent of enrollees are confident they can afford their premiums; 61 percent who didn't enroll wanted coverage, and again, 84 percent of the uninsured are likely to at least look for coverage in the next enrollment period. Just 15 percent say they don't want to get health insurance. Clearly, the efforts to educate people on the law must continue to help get those people on board.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "One of the most consistent themes in the monthly health ...", "title": "Survey: Cost, lack of knowledge, biggest barriers to Obamacare enrollment", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/5/26/1301068/-Survey-Cost-lack-of-knowledge-biggest-barriers-to-Obamacare-enrollment", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/73664/story_image/RTR3FLYR.jpg?1395180798", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the most consistent themes in the monthly health tracking poll done since the passage of the Affordable Care Act by Kaiser Family Foundation\u2014the gold standard of polling on the law\u2014has been ...", "creator": "@joanmccarter", "image": {"src": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/73664/story_image/RTR3FLYR.jpg?1395180798"}, "title": "Survey: Cost, lack of knowledge, biggest barriers to Obamacare enrollment", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5597\"", "article_summary": "Most tellingly, 60 percent of those surveyed wanted to get insurance, but didn't think they could afford it.\nA new survey by PerryUndem Research for Enroll Americapolled both people who are newly insured and still uninsured, and it shows how problematic that lack of knowledge is.\nOnly one in five in this group knew that they might qualify for a subsidy to help pay for the premium.\nThe survey showed 84 percent of those who remain uninsured are open to getting coverage next time.\nClearly, the efforts to educate people on the law must continue to help get those people on board."}
