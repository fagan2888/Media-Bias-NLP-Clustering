But they\u2019ve been increasing in intensity in recent months as we approach Oct. 1, the date the insurance exchanges will be open for business for those buying their own insurance, mainly with the help of federal subsidies.\n\nSo, more than three years after our last health-care-whoppers piece (published just before the law was signed in 2010), we\u2019re giving readers a rundown of the top claims.\n\nSome have been around for years, and others are relatively new. Most touch on three topics: jobs, premium costs and medical care. For instance:\n\nRepublicans have made the overblown claim that the law is a job-killer, but experts predict a small impact on mainly low-wage jobs. The Republican National Committee says 8.2 million part-timers can\u2019t find full-time work \u201cpartly\u201d due to the law. That\u2019s the total number of part-time workers who want full-time jobs, and there\u2019s no evidence from official jobs figures that the law has had an impact.\n\nProponents say premiums will go down, while opponents say they\u2019ll go up. In general, employer plans won\u2019t be affected much, and a price change for individuals seeking their own insurance will vary from person to person. Obama claimed that all of the uninsured would see lower premiums than what they could get now (before accounting for federal subsidies), but that\u2019s not the case.\n\nCritics continue to make scary claims about the government coming between you and your doctor, but the law doesn\u2019t set up a government-run system. If anything, the law comes between you and your insurance company, forbidding them from capping your coverage or charging you more based on health status. Meanwhile, Obama can\u2019t promise you can keep your plan. Employers are free to switch coverage, just as they were before.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more. Since 2010, we\u2019ve been debunking the persistent claim that members of Congress are somehow exempt from the law. They\u2019re not. The administration\u2019s recent decision to give exchanges leeway in how they verify suspect applications for subsidies sparked the false claim that Americans can list what they\u2019d like for their incomes and won\u2019t face verification.\n\nBeyond these more reasonable topics, we\u2019ve seen our share of far-fetched viral messages about microchips being implanted in patients and forced home inspections by the government. Rest assured. Neither is true.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe law is long, complicated and still being implemented. Many of the claims we\u2019ve seen \u2014 and expect to see for some time to come \u2014 center on the impact on employers (or employees), premium rates and medical decisions.\n\nJobs\n\nClaim: 8.2 million Americans can\u2019t find full-time work partly due to Obamacare.\n\nFactCheck.org says: False.\n\nThis assertion from the Republican National Committee echoes others conservative claims that the law is hindering part-timers from finding full-time jobs. But the RNC\u2019s 8.2 million figure was the total number in June of part-time workers in the U.S. seeking full-time work \u2014 what the Bureau of Labor Statistics calls \u201cpart-time for economic reasons\u201d \u2014 and there\u2019s no evidence from BLS numbers that the law has had an impact on such workers. There were more in this \u201cpart-time for economic reasons\u201d category in March 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law (9.1 million). The latest figure, from August, is 7.9 million.\n\nThe law requires employers with 50 or more full-time employees to provide insurance or pay a fine. (This provision was delayed until 2015.) Full-time is defined as 30 hours per week. These details have fueled Republican claims that the law will cause \u2014 or is causing \u2014 employers to reduce their employees\u2019 hours to get under the 30-hour/50-employee thresholds. It\u2019s certainly possible that some employers will try to get by with fewer workers, or fewer worker-hours. And some among millions of part-timers seeking full-time work may have had their hours cut. But we can\u2019t say how many that would be, and neither can the RNC.\n\nTo be sure, there have been plenty of news reports of employers, particularly those, like retail stores or restaurants, with low-wage employees, saying they\u2019re concerned and uncertain about the impact of the law, and they might cut hours or workers on their payrolls. We can\u2019t predict what companies might do once the employer requirements take effect.\n\nWhile the BLS numbers don\u2019t show an impact on part-time workers seeking full-time work, there is some anecdotal evidence of employers cutting the hours of part-time workers to get or keep them under a 30-hour-a-week limit. The Washington Post, for instance, wrote about the state of Virginia implementing such a cap on the hours of part-timers, like adjunct faculty at Northern Virginia Community College. And other colleges have instituted such limits, according to press reports. These employers have not indicated in the news reports whether they would be hiring additional workers, or increasing the hours of others, to fill in the gaps.\n\n\u201cObamaCare by the Numbers,\u201d Aug. 2\n\nClaim: The law is a job-killer.\n\nFactCheck.org says: Overblown.\n\nIt\u2019s true nonpartisan economic analyses have estimated a \u201csmall\u201d loss of mainly low-wage jobs because of the law. But as one expert told us, there hasn\u2019t been much analysis of this impact of the law because, he believes, economists think the impact will be minimal. Still, Republicans have continued to push the idea that the law will have a significant effect on jobs.\n\nThis claim made our \u201cWhoppers of 2011\u201d list, and it has continued to be pushed in various forms \u2014 with the latest being the claims about part-time work. Mainly, the \u201cjob-killer\u201d claims severely distort a 2010 nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office report that said the law would have a \u201csmall\u201d impact on jobs. And that\u2019s mainly from workers choosing to work less. For instance, some might work fewer hours if they receive subsidies to help them buy insurance, or those close to retirement may retire early, with some reassurance that they can buy insurance on their own.\n\nThe CBO report said this decrease in the amount of labor in the economy would amount to one-half of 1 percent, which Republicans quickly translated into a loss of actual jobs. But, as we said, CBO clearly explained this would come about \u201cprimarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply.\u201d\n\nCBO did say, however, that the employer requirements to provide insurance or pay a fine \u201cwill probably cause some employers to respond by hiring fewer low-wage workers.\u201d But they may hire more part-time or seasonal workers instead. CBO hasn\u2019t put a number on these jobs.\n\nOther experts we\u2019ve consulted have predicted a minimal impact. The Lewin Group, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group that operates independently of the company, estimated a 150,000 to 300,000 job loss of minimum wage or near minimum wage positions. Not included is an unknown increase in jobs in health care and insurance. Altogether, Lewin\u2019s then-senior vice president told us there would be a \u201csmall net job loss.\u201d\n\nIn July, claims about the law killing jobs took the form of a \u201cmis-tweet\u201d from several congressional Republicans, who wrongly tweeted \u201c74% of small businesses will fire workers, cut hours under #Obamacare.\u201d But the online, opt-in survey from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which opposes the law, found no more than 13 percent of the small businesses that responded said that. During the presidential campaign, Republican nominee Mitt Romney cited an earlier survey from the group to bolster his claims.\n\n\u201cGOP Mistweets #Obamacare Survey Results,\u201d July 25\n\n\u201cRomney, Obama Uphold Health Care Falsehoods,\u201d June 28, 2012\n\n\u201cGOP\u2019s \u2018Job-Killing\u2019 Whopper, Again,\u201d Feb. 21, 2012\n\n\u201cThe Whoppers of 2011,\u201d Dec. 20, 2011\n\nPremiums\n\nClaim: Premiums are going up because of the law. Premiums are going down because of the law.\n\nFactCheck.org says: It depends.\n\nPoliticians have been making these claims since before the law was passed \u2014 it was the first item on our list of whoppers back in 2010. Both sides have a penchant for misrepresenting studies on the matter to support their point. Our short answer \u2014 \u201cit depends\u201d \u2014 may be unsatisfactory to readers, but whether you\u2019ll pay more or less than you would have without the law depends on your circumstances.\n\nAre you uninsured and have a preexisting condition? You\u2019ll likely pay less than you would have otherwise. Are you uninsured but young and healthy? You\u2019ll likely pay more (without accounting for any subsidies you may receive). Are you insured through your employer? You likely won\u2019t see much change either way.\n\nLet\u2019s start with employer-sponsored insurance. Employer-sponsored premiums did go up slightly due to the law from 2010 to 2011 (a 1 percent to 3 percent increase, according to experts), because of added benefits, such as coverage for dependents up to age 26, free preventive care and an increase in caps on coverage. Overall, premiums for family plans jumped 9 percent that year, with the bulk of that due to higher medical costs, not, as critics claimed, the health care law. Since then, premium growth has been 4 percent on average for 2012 and 2013, modest growth rates historically.\n\nNote that premiums have been going up for years and will continue to do so \u2014 with or without the health care law. When Democrats make claims about premiums going down, they\u2019re talking about premiums growing at a lower rate than they would have otherwise.\n\nThe growth in national health spending (that\u2019s spending from the government, businesses and individuals) from 2009 to 2011 also has been at around 4 percent, the lowest level since such spending was first measured in 1960. President Obama has boasted that the ACA has helped make this happen. It could be playing some role, with an emphasis on new payment models, but experts say the cause is mainly the down economy. A Kaiser Family Foundation study said the economy was responsible for 77 percent of the slow growth rate, and that rate is expected to pick up as the economy recovers.\n\nNow, the big question mark is for those who buy their own insurance. We\u2019ll know more in October, when the state and federal exchanges have published rates and are accepting applications. But even then, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to make generalizations. Some folks will pay more, some will pay less, than what they would have otherwise. Many who had purchased on the individual market in the past will get more generous benefits \u2014 which will be good news for some and irrelevant to others. And the vast majority buying their own exchange plans \u2014 80 percent, according to the CBO \u2014 will receive subsidies that bring their total out-of-pocket costs down.\n\nThese plans sold to individuals can no longer charge more based on health status or gender, but they can vary premiums based on geography, age and tobacco use. Republicans have warned of a \u201crate shock\u201d in this market, with the young and healthy being subject to higher premiums if the market is flooded with older and less healthy policyholders. A RAND study, published in August and sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, estimated there would be \u201cno widespread trend toward sharply higher prices in the individual market,\u201d in the words of the lead author. But rates would likely vary from state to state.\n\nThe research group looked at 10 states and the U.S. overall, estimating no premium change for the U.S. at large and five states, a decline in two states, and an increase up to 43 percent in three states, not accounting for tax credits. The study, which held age, tobacco use and actuarial value (level of coverage) constant in comparisons, said average out-of-pocket costs would be unchanged or decline for all states once tax credits are factored in.\n\nBut that\u2019s one estimate from an economic model, with noted \u201climitations.\u201d Says the RAND study: \u201cCurrent data on nongroup premiums are limited, and there are many uncertainties about how individuals and insurers will respond to the complex policy changes introduced by the Affordable Care Act.\u201d It cautions against \u201csweeping statements\u201d about the impact on premiums, since rates will differ based on individual circumstances.\n\nThat brings us back to our short answer: It depends.\n\n\u201cFalse Assumptions on the Health Care Law,\u201d July 11\n\n\u201cObama Overhypes Health Savings,\u201d July 19\n\n\u201cHealth Insurance Premium Spin,\u201d April 5\n\n\u201d \u2018Obamacare\u2019 to cost $20,000 a Family?\u201d March 1\n\nClaim: All of the uninsured will pay less on the exchanges than they could now on the individual market, even without federal subsidies.\n\nFactCheck.org says: False.\n\nPresident Obama made this claim at an Aug. 9 press conference, saying that beginning Oct. 1, the 15 percent of the population that\u2019s uninsured would be able to \u201csign up for affordable quality health insurance at a significantly cheaper rate than what they can get right now on the individual market.\u201d Obama went on to emphasize that that was before including federal subsidies. \u201cAnd if even with lower premiums they still can\u2019t afford it, we\u2019re going to be able to provide them with a tax credit to help them buy it,\u201d he added.\n\nBut even Obama\u2019s secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, has acknowledged that young persons would likely pay more and older Americans would likely pay less on the insurance exchanges. As we explained, the reason is that the ACA changes how insurance companies can price these policies on the individual market \u2014 it forbids insurance companies from charging more for persons with preexisting conditions or based on gender, and limits them to charging older policyholders no more than three times what they charge to younger policyholders. Premiums can also vary based on geography and smoking \u2014 but smokers can only be charged 1.5 times the rate for nonsmokers.\n\nThere won\u2019t be any super-cheap plans for the young and healthy, nor sky-high premiums for older folks or those with health conditions. (High-deductible catastrophic plans, however, will be available to those under 30, or older Americans with hardship exemptions. They can be purchased only without federal subsidies.) Some on the exchanges will pay less; some will pay more than what they could get now. Economist Jonathan Gruber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was a paid adviser to both the Obama administration and then-Gov. Mitt Romney\u2019s administration on health care plans. Gruber told us a \u201csmall share\u201d of the uninsured would pay higher premiums on the exchanges. \u201cThe president is right for the average uninsured person, but not for all uninsured people,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s before subsidies, of course. Only 10 percent of the uninsured earn too much to qualify for federal subsidies on the exchanges, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation report. But Obama claimed they\u2019d pay less even without the federal help.\n\n\u201cObama Overpromises on Premiums,\u201d Aug. 13\n\nClaim: 8.5 million Americans will receive rebates this year averaging about $100 each because of the health care law.\n\nFactCheck.org says: Misleading.\n\nPresident Obama has stretched the facts in making this boast about the law\u2019s impact. The rebates are real, but most of them will go to companies offering insurance to their workers. Only those who buy their own insurance will get a rebate check directly. And the $100 is an average per family, not per person.\n\nThe law requires insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on health costs \u2014 as opposed to spending on administration and marketing, and, of course, profit. If companies don\u2019t meet the 80/20 ratio, they have to issue a rebate to consumers. Large group plans have to meet an 85/15 ratio. In 2012 and again in 2013 rebates were sent out, but Obama has pitched this as Americans receiving checks in the mail. This year, in a July 18 speech, he talked about \u201cmillions of Americans\u201d opening letters from their insurers and being \u201cpleasantly surprised with a check. In 2012, 13 million rebates went out, in all 50 states. Another 8.5 [million] rebates are being sent out this summer, averaging around 100 bucks each.\u201d\n\nBut most of the money went directly to employers who provided the policies to their workers. Of the 8.5 million benefiting from this provision in 2013, 2.7 million are on the individual market, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, meaning the rebate would go directly to them. In 2012, 4 million of the 13 million benefiting were on the individual market. Those with employer plans could still see a benefit, as savings are passed along in some way to them. But, as the Department of Labor, which spells out in its guidance on the matter, says, employers who pay part of the premium are entitled to part of the rebate.\n\n\u201cObama Overhypes Health Savings,\u201d July 19\n\n\u201cRomney, Obama Uphold Health Care Falsehoods,\u201d June 28, 2012\n\nMedical Care\n\nClaim: You won\u2019t be able to choose your own doctor.\n\nClaim: The government will be between you and your doctor.\n\nFactCheck.org says: False.\n\nThese claims are variations on the fear that the government will be taking over health care \u2014 choosing your doctor, telling him or her what treatment to administer, etc. But the law doesn\u2019t create a government-run system, as we\u2019ve said many times. It actually greatly expands business for private insurance, by about 12 million new customers, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. And individuals will choose their own doctors, just as they do now.\n\nThese type of fear-mongering claims appear to have quieted a bit in 2013 \u2014 along with the more extreme death-panel-type hysteria \u2014 but they\u2019re still percolating. A TV ad this summer from the conservative Americans for Prosperity featured a mom named Julie, gently asking, \u201cIf we can\u2019t pick our own doctor, how do I know my family\u2019s going to get the care they need?\u201d And: \u201cCan I really trust the folks in Washington with my family\u2019s health care?\u201d\n\nIt turns out, Julie doesn\u2019t really mean that she might not be able to select her doctor herself. Part of the group\u2019s support for the claim is the small net decline, as estimated by the CBO, in those who get insurance through their employer, a drop of 7 million people by 2018. (A total of 158 million are expected to have employer-sponsored coverage that year.) The CBO has said that those losing coverage would mainly be low-wage workers who could get subsidies to buy insurance on the exchanges. And, certainly, there\u2019s a chance the doctor a worker had been seeing won\u2019t be in the network of providers on a new plan. Some exchange policies could keep prices low by limiting those networks. But no one will choose policyholders\u2019 doctors for them. They simply won\u2019t be guaranteed that a new plan would have the same network of doctors, just as there\u2019s no guarantee of that now (more on this in a minute).\n\nAs for the government-coming-between-you-and-your-doctor claim, the law\u2019s regulatory provisions are more like putting the government between you and your insurance company \u2014 and in a way that brings added benefits to consumers. The law says insurers can\u2019t have caps on coverage, turn down customers based on preexisting conditions (or charge them more), and can\u2019t spend more than 15 percent or 20 percent on non-medical-related costs (see Obama\u2019s rebate claim above).\n\nRepublicans also have attacked the Independent Payment Advisory Board as some kind of rationing board. But the IPAB \u2014 which is made up of medical professionals, health care experts, economists and consumer representatives \u2014 is charged with slowing the rate of growth of Medicare spending, and limited in how it can go about doing that. The law says the board\u2019s proposals \u201cshall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums \u2026 increase Medicare beneficiary cost sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria.\u201d\n\n\u201cFalse Assumptions on the Health Care Law,\u201d July 11\n\n\u201cRomney, Obama Uphold Health Care Falsehoods,\u201d June 28, 2012\n\n\u201cRomney\u2019s \u2018Gross\u2019 Exaggeration on \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 \u201cMay 10, 2012\n\nClaim: If you like your plan, you can keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\n\nFactCheck.org: Misleading.\n\nObama has repeatedly made this claim, and the White House continues to use the line on its website. The law doesn\u2019t force Americans to pick new plans or new doctors, but the president simply can\u2019t make this promise to everyone. There\u2019s no guarantee that your employer won\u2019t switch plans, just as companies could have done before the law. And if you switch jobs, your new work-based coverage might not have your doctor as an in-network provider, either.\n\nAs we mentioned above, some employees won\u2019t have an offer of insurance and will look for a new plan on the exchanges. Some small businesses could drop their current plans and join the exchanges, too. Grocery store chain Trader Joe\u2019s, for instance, announced that it will direct its part-time workers (less than 30 hours per week) to the exchanges for health coverage and provide them with $500 to help purchase it, as of Jan. 1, 2014. The company, which has provided coverage to such workers, said \u201cmany crew members should be able to obtain health care coverage at very little, if any, net cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cRomney, Obama Uphold Health Care Falsehoods,\u201d June 28, 2012\n\nAnd There\u2019s More \u2026\n\nClaim: Those applying for federal subsidies can lie about their income without facing verification.\n\nFactCheck.org says: False.\n\nThe Obama administration gave the insurance exchanges some leeway in how they verify income eligibility for federal subsidies in the first year. That prompted Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt to claim that the administration had \u201cwaived the income verification requirement\u201d and that applicants can \u201csay what you think your income\u2019s going to be with no way to verify that.\u201d Not true. The exchanges will compare applications with federal information \u2014 such as previous tax returns \u2014 and ask for additional information if the person has no previous tax filings.\n\nHere\u2019s where the administration\u2019s new rule comes in: For applications in which stated income is more than 10 percent below what\u2019s listed in government data, current income information isn\u2019t available, and the additional information from the applicants is insufficient, a sample of those applications will face further requirements in 2014. Initially, all of these suspect applications were to face more scrutiny, but the exchanges will only have to verify a sample for the first year of operation.\n\nSo, if you\u2019re the gambling type, you do have better odds of lying about your income and still getting a subsidy. At least for a while. But all income claims will be checked against 2014 tax filings, and the IRS can recoup at least some of the money. There are also IRS perjury penalties, and civil monetary penalties spelled out in the Affordable Care Act for providing fraudulent information.\n\n\u201cBlunt Wrong on Income Verification,\u201d July 15\n\nClaim: Congress is exempt from the law.\n\nFactCheck.org says: False.\n\nSeveral versions of this claim have been circulating since before the Affordable Care Act was passed. But no matter how many different ways the critics spin it, Congress isn\u2019t exempt from the law. In fact, members and their staffs face additional requirements that other Americans don\u2019t. Beginning in 2014, they can no longer get insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, as they and other federal employees have done. Instead, they are required to get insurance through the insurance exchanges.\n\nThis \u201cexempt\u201d nonsense first percolated before that provision was added to the law through a Republican amendment. Before the amendment, the legislation said that Congress \u2014 as well as federal employees, employees of large companies, and those who get insurance through Medicare or Medicaid \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the exchanges, which were created by the law for those buying their own insurance and small businesses. But that certainly didn\u2019t make Congress \u201cexempt\u201d \u2014 lawmakers were treated like any other worker with employer-provided health insurance. They were required to have coverage or face a penalty.\n\nThe claim has persisted even after the provision requiring Congress to get insurance from the exchanges became part of the final law. Fast forward to spring 2013, and the assertion surfaced again when there was concern among lawmakers that the transition to exchange plans \u2014 particularly the transfer of the federal contribution toward premiums \u2014 wouldn\u2019t go very smoothly. Politico published a piece on April 24 on lawmakers talking about changing the exchange requirement because of this. The headline on the story: \u201cLawmakers, aides may get Obamacare exemption.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 7, the Office of Personnel Management, which administers the FEHB Program, issued a proposed rule saying that the federal government could continue to make contributions toward the premiums of lawmakers and their staffs on the exchanges. The federal government has long made such premium contributions, as other employers do for their employees. OPM said the contribution couldn\u2019t be more than what it is under the FEHB Program. That ruling, perhaps predictably, sparked new \u2014 and still bogus \u2014 claims from Republicans of Congress being \u201cexempt\u201d from the law.\n\n\u201cCongress Exempt from Health Bill?\u201d Jan. 20, 2010\n\n\u201cCongress and an Exemption from \u2018Obamacare\u2019?\u201d May 3, 2013\n\n\u201cNo \u2018Special Subsidy\u2019 for Congress,\u201d Aug. 30, 2013\n\nWe\u2019re happy to report that one of the most paranoid claims about the law \u2014 that all patients would be implanted with microchips \u2014 appears to have died off, judging by the viral emails our readers send to us.

That wild distortion actually refers to grants for voluntary state home-visiting programs to help expectant and new parents. Forty-six states had such programs in fiscal 2010.\n\n\u2014 by Lori Robertson", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But that certainly didn\u2019t make Congress \u201cexempt\u201d \u2014 lawmakers were treated like any other worker with employer-provided health insurance.\nInstead, they are required to get insurance through the insurance exchanges.\nWe\u2019ll know more in October, when the state and federal exchanges have published rates and are accepting applications.\n\u201cObama Overhypes Health Savings,\u201d July 19\u201cRomney, Obama Uphold Health Care Falsehoods,\u201d June 28, 2012Medical CareClaim: You won\u2019t be able to choose your own doctor.\nNote that premiums have been going up for years and will continue to do so \u2014 with or without the health care law."}
