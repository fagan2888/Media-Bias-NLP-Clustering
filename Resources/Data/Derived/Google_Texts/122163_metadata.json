A survey conducted by TNS Global on behalf of Ebates.com found that more than 52 percent of Americans \u2014 64 percent of women and 40 percent of men \u2014 engaged in what\u2019s called \"retail therapy,\"or the act of shopping and spending money in order to brighten your mood. But is retail therapy actually a thing? According to some research, it does work for a few reasons.\n\n1. Helps To Ease Transitions\n\nKit Yarrow, a professor of psychology and marketing at Golden Gate University in San Francisco, writes that buying new things helps to ease a person into a new phase of life. \u201cShopping can be a rich source of mental preparation,\u201d she writes in Psychology Today. \u201cAs people shop, they\u2019re naturally visualizing how they\u2019ll use the products [they\u2019re] considering, and in doing so they\u2019re also visualizing their new life. And as many great athletes will attest, visualization is a performance booster and anxiety reducer.\u201d Yarrow says that this is why the most intensive shopping moments of our lives are paired with big events \u2014 a marriage and a baby. They\u2019re both big transitions and shopping and visualizing are only a small part of the big allure.\n\n2. Brightens Moods\n\nAccording to a 2011 study, researchers conducted interviews by asking hundreds of shoppers to keep diaries of their moods and their behavior. The people who were in a bad mood were more likely to impulse shop. However, buying something did brighten their moods \u2014 82 percent of people who bought something didn\u2019t regret their purchase. \u201cRetail therapy purchases were overwhelmingly beneficial, leading to mood boosts and no regrets or guilt,\u201d said Selin Atalay and Margaret Meloy, the authors of the study.\n\n3. Improves Child\u2019s Development\n\nIt might be a toddler\u2019s worst nightmare, but according to a study published in April 2014, shopping can help to improve their development. According to the joint therapy by Oxford University and the Open University, shopping is another way to boost social and motor skills. \u201cShopping may be beneficial because it involves changes of scenery from shop to shop, which improves the child's motor and social skills more than a sedentary activity,\u201d the report found, according to the Daily Mail. Two lead researchers, Professor Paul Anand and Dr. Laurence Roope, also said that the more retail therapy toddlers were exposed to, the happier they were. Their everyday skills showed signs of improvement, too.\n\n4. Increases Dopamine Levels\n\nResearch shows that when you\u2019re shopping and you purchase something that you really want, your brain is filled with dopamine. \"If you look at MRI scans of shoppers,\u201d said Dr. Travis Stork, from The Doctors, \"[the] areas flooded with dopamine are the same pleasure centers [that are flooded when] you're having sex.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "retail therapy, shopping", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Retail therapy is an actual thing, and it could help to improve many aspects of your life.", "title": "4 Real Benefits Of Retail Therapy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/retail-therapy-real-thing-4-ways-shopping-can-help-boost-your-mood-290936", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/01/shutterstock99076997.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Retail therapy is an actual thing, and it could help to improve many aspects of your life.", "title": "4 Real Benefits Of Retail Therapy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/retail-therapy-real-thing-4-ways-shopping-can-help-boost-your-mood-290936", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/01/shutterstock99076997.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/01/shutterstock99076997.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-01T17:12:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-02T22:12:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Retail therapy is an actual thing, and it could help to improve many aspects of your life."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd98b\"", "article_summary": "According to the joint therapy by Oxford University and the Open University, shopping is another way to boost social and motor skills.\n\u201cAs people shop, they\u2019re naturally visualizing how they\u2019ll use the products [they\u2019re] considering, and in doing so they\u2019re also visualizing their new life.\nTwo lead researchers, Professor Paul Anand and Dr. Laurence Roope, also said that the more retail therapy toddlers were exposed to, the happier they were.\nBut is retail therapy actually a thing?\n\u201cRetail therapy purchases were overwhelmingly beneficial, leading to mood boosts and no regrets or guilt,\u201d said Selin Atalay and Margaret Meloy, the authors of the study."}
