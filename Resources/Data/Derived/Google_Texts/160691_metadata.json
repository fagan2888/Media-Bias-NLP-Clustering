There\u2019s no such thing. It\u2019s actually them giving you your money back that you just loaned them tax free.\u201d\n\nUpper-income filers are facing higher taxes this year due to taxes associated with the Affordable Care Act, but tax experts say it\u2019s common for individuals to be surprised when they have to cut the IRS a check.\n\nIf it comes down to paying your mortgage or credit card bill or the IRS, Stephen DeFilippis, an enrolled agent at DeFilippis Financial Group, recommends choosing the latter. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to have the IRS as a creditor. They have a lot of power: they can garnish wages, levy bank accounts and put liens on properties.\u201d\n\nFilers have a variety of options if they can\u2019t afford their tax bill, but experts agree the key is taking action.\n\nFile Anyway. Even if you can\u2019t afford the bill, file your tax return, advises Laura Blasberg, tax attorney and partner at Meltzer, Lippe, Goldstein & Breitstone in New York. \u201cThe penalties for not filing are 10 times as much for not paying. You can get the penalties removed pretty easily for not paying on time, but the IRS almost never removes charges for not filing on time.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nKeep in mind that if you file an extension, you will only be granted more time to file the return, not pay the bill.\n\nRe-evaluate Your Withholdings. Robbins says owing money to the IRS is normally a sign of the wrong number of withholdings on a W-4. Employers deduct taxes based on the allowances on this form; if you have too little withheld, you will most likely end up owing the IRS money.\n\nRobbins recommends reading the form\u2019s instructions carefully. \u201cMistakes on W-4s are common because employees don\u2019t get a lot of guidance from employers on how to fill them out. Use the worksheet and plug in your information to get the proper withholding exemptions to avoid tax day surprises.\u201d\n\nPay What You Can. If you can\u2019t afford the entire bill, pay what you can.\n\n\u201cEven if you make a partial payment, let\u2019s say you owe $4,000 and you pay $1,000, that will limit the interest and failure to pay penalty that you will get hit with,\u201d says DeFilippis.\n\nSell Assets. If you don\u2019t have the funds sitting in your bank account to cover your tax bill, Robbins says it\u2019s time to evaluate your discretionary assets. \u201cDo you have a boat, art, a vacation cottage, stocks or any other tangible asset that you can sell?\u201d\n\nWork with the IRS. The IRS offers repayment plans, so don\u2019t be afraid to reach out. \u201cIf you approach them, they will generally work with you, but you need to give them the chance to work with you and find the right plan,\u201d says Blasberg.\n\nThe IRS offers installment programs that allow you to set up monthly payment plans to pay down the debt. If you owe less than $50,000 you can apply online, if you owe more than that, you must submit Form 433-A. The maximum term for an installment agreement is 72 months, and there are fees for setting up the agreement.\n\nThe IRS also has Offers in Compromise plans, but DeFilippis says this option is only for extreme situations. \u201cYou must prove not only do you not have the ability to pay now, but you won\u2019t have the ability to pay in the future.\u201d There is a statute of limitations that limits the IRS from collecting owed taxes that have been outstanding for more than 10 years. \u201cThey will weigh their chances of whether they will ever be able to collect what is owed. If it looks extremely unlikely, then they will take a percentage since it\u2019s better than nothing. \u201c\n\nWhen calling the IRS, Blasberg warns to set a lot of time aside. \u201cPlan to be on the phone and on hold with the IRS for at least an hour. This isn\u2019t something you can do walking out the door.\u201d She also recommends having the appropriate financial documents including bank account statements, paycheck stubs, asset information and bills readily available.\n\nPut it on Plastic. Putting the bill on a credit card only makes sense when the interest rate on the card is lower than the IRS\u2019 penalty. \"Sometimes you can get a deal with a 0% interest rate for a set period of time, which is smaller than the interest and failure to pay penalty coming from the IRS. If you can pay off the debt in that period, it\u2019s not a bad option,\u201d says DeFilippis.\n\nHe adds that some companies do not allow users to charge their tax bill, and that you must go through one of the IRS\u2019 approved e-pay service providers.\n\nAsk Family Members for Help. If a family member is willing to loan you the money, the experts all agree to put the loan terms in writing.\n\nRobbins adds that the IRS doesn\u2019t allow loans to be made at below-market rates, a number it publishes every month. \u201cUnder normal circumstances, it\u2019s likely they won\u2019t know you got an interest-free loan, but if you get audited, it could come up and you are in more hot water.\u201d\n\nTap Your Home Equity Line. DeFilippis says if you have a home equity line of credit available, it might make financial sense to tap it. \u201cThe one benefit there is that if the amount of credit line you borrow is under $100,000, you can deduct the interest on home equity debt.\u201d\n\nConsider Borrowing from Your 401(k). If you are younger than retirement age (59 \u00bd ) any funds taken out of your 401(k) will be taxable and hit with a 10% penalty. \u201cThe interest on installment agreements could be less,\u201d says Robbins. \u201cWhen you see people rob their 401(k) for their tax situation, that often means their retirement is going to be cut short since they often don\u2019t put the money back. If you take this route, you better pay it back.\u201d\n\nBlasberg says borrowing from a 401(k) can be a much better option. \u201cIf you borrow from your account, you are paying interest to yourself and it doesn\u2019t show up on your credit report.\u201d\n\nBe Watchful of Scams. Radio and TV are filled with \u201ctax professionals\u201d claiming they can reduce the amount you owe to the IRS to pennies on the dollar, but Blasberg warns to be leery of professional making promises that sound too good to be true.\n\n\u201cPeople panic and they are just looking for any help, but you need to take a step back and do your homework and research a company and its workers before committing to work with them,\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/TAXES", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-07 11:40:47 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "If it comes down to paying your mortgage or credit card bill or the IRS, experts often recommend choosing the latter, because no one wants the agency as a creditor.
