The Dodd-Frank financial reform measures passed in the wake of the collapse on Wall Street continue to take a toll on the economy, according to a new study.

Five years after Dodd-Frank was passed, the business-friendly American Action Forum finds it has led to $24 billion in compliance costs and 61 million paperwork hours.

Financial regulators have passed 456 final rules stemming from Dodd-Frank, the study found.

But the implementation of Dodd-Frank is an on-going process. The study also found there are about $7.8 billion worth of pending rules in the regulatory pipeline that could raise the total costs.
