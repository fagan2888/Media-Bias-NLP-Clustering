We\u2019re getting skin cancer, he warned, and a lot of it. But the cases aren\u2019t created equal; men are significantly more likely to develop the illness than women, and it\u2019s a trend that has persisted since 1975 in both incidence and death rates. How come?\n\nMen, not to put too fine a point on it, are generally lousy when it comes to personal health. This isn\u2019t commentary on responsibility, but rather an examination of the data. Being male already increases a person\u2019s risk of smoking and drinking alcohol, being a heavy user of both substances, using illicit drugs, being obese, not following up on doctors\u2019 visits, and not making preventive visits to the dentist. Should it be any wonder, then, that men are notoriously bad at the simple practice of putting on sunscreen?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not using it,\u201d dermatologist Dr. Neal Schultz, also a spokesperson for The Skin Cancer Foundation, told New York Mag. \u201cThey\u2019re not using enough. And then when things get rough and things start to happen \u2026 they\u2019re clueless about the warning signs they should be looking for.\u201d\n\nAs per Lushniak\u2019s July announcement, melanomas are the most common form of cancer in the country. In 2010, the most recent year CDC data is available, 61,061 people were diagnosed with melanomas of the skin and 9,154 people died. Roughly 10,000 more men were diagnosed than women, and poor skin care is a major culprit.\n\nThe issue is partly biological. Even when scientists account for tumor location and size, they find men are 55 percent more likely to die from melanomas than women are. How they get those melanomas is where the heftier, more pervasive social aspects come in. First, the numbers are stacked against men, who are far more likely to hold jobs that require they work in the sun \u2014 long-haul truck drivers and construction workers, to name only a couple.\n\nBut even after taking those numbers into account, the gender issue heaps on an added layer of complexity. Soft, supple skin is feminine; tough, rugged skin is masculine. These divides feel natural, even if they imply a far darker outcome in terms of cancer risk. The problem is, applying a lotion of any kind is alien to most men, because the social custom neither dictates its necessity (women regularly apply makeup, and men don\u2019t) nor rewards its application (skin care is historically feminine).\n\nBasically, \u201cguys don\u2019t like applying schmear anywhere,\u201d Schultz said, \u201cbut particularly to their face.\u201d\n\nThis irrational fear of seeming wimpy is only reinforced by the fact married men, on average, live longer than single men. Presumably, it\u2019s because single men don\u2019t have a conscientious wife to pick up the pieces. A 2011 study of cardiovascular deaths, for instance, found married men were far more likely to seek preventive medical care than single men. Married women, however, didn\u2019t echo this trend, signaling to the researchers something unique in the experience of being male.\n\nAll this speculation sits beside a flat out lack of awareness. When surveyed, 79 percent of men didn\u2019t know, for instance, that the appropriate amount of sunblock to use is 1 ounce, and 61 percent believed the amount they do apply will last four hours, even though the Skin Cancer Foundation recommends people reapply every two hours. And in an even greater display of bad scientific know-how, nearly two-thirds of men believed women needed sunscreen more than they did because female skin was somehow more \u201csensitive\u201d to ultraviolet rays.\n\n\u201cThe survey results confirm what I see in my practice every day,\u201d said Dr. Joshua Zeichner, a spokesperson for The Skin Cancer Foundation and Assistant Professor of Dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center. \u201cMen just aren\u2019t incorporating sun protection into their lives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "skin, cancer, mostly, male, problem, why, getting, guys, wear, sunscreen, so, difficult", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A mix of social and biological factors put men at a far greater risk for melanomas of the skin than women.", "title": "What Does It Take To Get Men To Wear Sunscreen?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/skin-cancer-mostly-male-problem-why-getting-guys-wear-sunscreen-so-difficult-296922", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/06/sunscreen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A mix of social and biological factors put men at a far greater risk for melanomas of the skin than women.", "title": "What Does It Take To Get Men To Wear Sunscreen?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/skin-cancer-mostly-male-problem-why-getting-guys-wear-sunscreen-so-difficult-296922", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/06/sunscreen.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/06/sunscreen.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-06T17:18:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-04T15:33:37-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A mix of social and biological factors put men at a far greater risk for melanomas of the skin than women."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19e8\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019re getting skin cancer, he warned, and a lot of it.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not using it,\u201d dermatologist Dr. Neal Schultz, also a spokesperson for The Skin Cancer Foundation, told New York Mag.\nPresumably, it\u2019s because single men don\u2019t have a conscientious wife to pick up the pieces.\nA 2011 study of cardiovascular deaths, for instance, found married men were far more likely to seek preventive medical care than single men.\nBasically, \u201cguys don\u2019t like applying schmear anywhere,\u201d Schultz said, \u201cbut particularly to their face.\u201dThis irrational fear of seeming wimpy is only reinforced by the fact married men, on average, live longer than single men."}
