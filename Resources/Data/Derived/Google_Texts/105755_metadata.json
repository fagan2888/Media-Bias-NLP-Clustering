Over the following two years, visits showed a 2.2 percent increase.\n\nMuch of that was due to pent-up demand, and a perception that ER visits were efficient and available round-the-clock. But one of the biggest drivers of increased ER visits was the simple lack of other options \u2013 beginning with the availability of doctors.\n\nThe study authors noted that other states should expect to see a similar experience, especially those, like New Jersey, that have expanded their Medicaid programs.\n\n\u201cProviders of emergency care should anticipate increased demand for patients and plan accordingly,\u201d said Bruce Landon, of the Department of Health Care Policy of Harvard Medical School.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','health-news','obamacare'", "title": "NJ hospitals mull rise in ER visits seen under Romneycare", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"NJ hospitals mull rise in ER visits seen under Romneycare\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/nj_hospitals_mull_rise_in_er_visits_under_romneycare.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/03/14526461-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12474553\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-20T16:02:41Z\", \"author\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"health-news\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/03/14526461-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@OBrienLedger", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Given the surge in ER visits after Romneycare, will Jersey hospitals see something similar?"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, March 20, 2014, 12:13 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/03/erjpg-a44a63306c2ed03f.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"kobrien\", \"author_nickname\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"2434\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Given the surge in ER visits after Romneycare, will Jersey hospitals see something similar?", "title": "NJ hospitals mull rise in ER visits seen under Romneycare", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/nj_hospitals_mull_rise_in_er_visits_under_romneycare.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, March 20, 2014, 12:02 PM", "article_author": "Kathleen O'Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "Given the surge in ER visits after Romneycare, will Jersey hospitals see something similar?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20f1\"", "article_summary": "Much of that was due to pent-up demand, and a perception that ER visits were efficient and available round-the-clock.\nBut one of the biggest drivers of increased ER visits was the simple lack of other options \u2013 beginning with the availability of doctors.\n\u201cProviders of emergency care should anticipate increased demand for patients and plan accordingly,\u201d said Bruce Landon, of the Department of Health Care Policy of Harvard Medical School.\nBut a study released today out of Massachusetts shows ER visits there actually rose slightly when that state passed its first-in-the-nation mandatory health insurance law.\nThe study, published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine, showed a 1.2 percent rise in visits right after Massachusetts expanded access to health insurance."}
