Senator Rubio Give His Take

Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) said in hindsight there are always lessons to be learned and that applies in the current instance for the GOP as it moves forward from a bruising couple of weeks.

"I never was favor in of shutting government down" or defaulting on the nation's debt, Rubio said.

The senator argued that it was the White House and Democrats who allowed the government to shutdown by not agreeing to fund all parts minus the Affordable Care Act.

Rubio was among the 18 senators who voted against the deal to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling, which was brokered by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV).

But he is not among the tea party group who supports the primary challange to McConnell in Kentucky.

"I do support Senator McConnellâ€™s re-election," Rubio said, giving McConnell credit for the job he has in both keeping his caucus together and representing Kentucky.
