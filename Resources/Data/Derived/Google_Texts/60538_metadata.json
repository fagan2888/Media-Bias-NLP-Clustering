The Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nIf true, this would be the latest in a string of successful attacks and atrocities by the terrorist group in the last month. Islamic State has taken credit for the bombing of a Russian airliner over Egypt in late October, killing 224 people. An IS-linked suicide bombing in Beirut, Lebanon on Friday killed 43 and wounded 239. An IS propaganda video featured footage of its jihadists machine-gunning 200 Syrians.\n\nRhodes told Tapper that President Obama had been making \u201ca very specific point\u201d about losses in territory and leadership IS has suffered due to U.S. airstrikes and ground operations by coalition partners.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been able to do is stop that advance and reclaim territory, going on the offense with our partners on the ground,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cWe have to be one step ahead of ISIL every time, if we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne step ahead, we don\u2019t seem to be one step ahead of any terrorist group these days,\u201d Tapper said.\n\nAs the White House touts its success in containing terrorist groups like IS, its own data indicates that terrorism is on the rise. The number of deaths due to terrorism spiked by 81 percent between 2013 and 2014, according to a State Department report.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "CNN anchor Jake Tapper took issue with President Obama's claim that the Islamic State had been \u201ccontained\u201d on Sunday following\u00a0a spree of major terrorist attacks in France and the Middle East.", "title": "Jake Tapper: \u2018I Shudder to Think What ISIS Looks Like Uncontained\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/jake-tapper-i-shudder-to-think-what-isis-looks-like-uncontained/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CNN anchor Jake Tapper took issue with President Obama's claim that the Islamic State had been \u201cco", "creator": "@@BlakeSeitz", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "title": "Jake Tapper: \u2018I Shudder to Think What ISIS Looks Like Uncontained\u2019", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4e4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf this is what ISIS looks like contained, I shudder to think what ISIS looks like uncontained,\u201d Tapper said to State Department official Ben Rhodes.\nIslamic State has taken credit for the bombing of a Russian airliner over Egypt in late October, killing 224 people.\n\u201cWe have to be one step ahead of ISIL every time, if we can.\u201d\u201cOne step ahead, we don\u2019t seem to be one step ahead of any terrorist group these days,\u201d Tapper said.\nThe Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack.\nBY: Follow @@BlakeSeitzCNN anchor Jake Tapper took issue with President Obama\u2019s claim that the Islamic State had been \u201ccontained\u201d on Sunday following a spree of major terrorist attacks in France and the Middle East."}
