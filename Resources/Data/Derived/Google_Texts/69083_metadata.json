The couple plans retire to North Carolina. It took a while but they found a prospective owner, Kathy Verzillo, to carry on the business. (Photo: ANNETTE LEIN)\n\nLynn Allinger has been the person \u2014 and the spirit \u2014 behind Craft Company No. 6, a highly regarded artisanal gift store in the Neighborhood of the Arts in Rochester, for many years.\n\nBut time is the small-business customer that is never satisfied. It just keeps coming.\n\nAllinger is now 66. She and her husband Gary, also a key person in the ascent of the Craft Company during more than 30 years, have property in North Carolina where they wish to retire.\n\nIt took a while but they found a prospective owner, Kathy Verzillo, to carry on the business. Ownership is expected to transfer over in February.\n\nAllinger said she still loves the business, as does Gary, who is a woodworker and artist. But, she said, the realities of modern business are different from years ago.\n\n\u201cThe Internet. The web. We have a website but it\u2019s hard to keep up,\u201d Allinger said. \u201cThis is the electronic age.\u201d\n\nThe new owner, she said, is of boomer age but her son isn\u2019t. He will help with the web and social media, which are puzzles, she said, best solved by the young.\n\nAllinger is on the cutting edge of an emerging business trend. According to the online market analyst firm BizBuySell, 68 percent of business brokers queried said they handled more transactions in 2013 than in 2012. Half of the surveyed brokers said retiring boomers were the reason behind half of all the sales of small business in 2013.\n\nThe brokers see this trend accelerating in 2014. Eighty-three percent of them said they expect 2014 to be even more active than 2013 in terms of handling the sales of small business, specifically the buying and selling of a firm, and 76 percent of the brokers expect more boomers to retire next year than this.\n\nAge isn\u2019t the only reason there were more transactions last year, BizBuySell reported. An improving economy and expenses related to the Affordable Care Act were reasons cited by those selling businesses.\n\n\u201cOverall, brokers recognize the uncertainty of the economy, but still appear very confident that small business transactions will continue to rise in 2014,\u201d BizBuySell.com and BizQuest.com manager Curtis Kroeker said in a statement. \u201cAs more buyers and sellers, including Baby Boomers, continue to flood the market, all the pieces point to another strong year in the business-for-sale community.\u201d\n\nWhen the brokers were asked what could derail the economy and the transactions market, 35 percent said a national debt crisis could do it while 21 percent cited health-care costs.\n\nRochester\u2019s small-business environment is characterized by a large number of family-owned businesses. When one generation approaches retirement, the next one, in many cases, steps in to run the business.\n\nRichard Rowe, who will turn 65 next year, is the owner of Rowe Photo, Audio and Video, which has stores in Rochester and Webster as well as Scott\u2019s Photo by Rowe on East Avenue in the city. The business is in its third generation of Rowes, beginning in 1898.\n\n\u201cI still have the passion for the business,\u2019\u2019 Rowe said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be 75 years old and trying to come in here to work.\u201d\n\nSometimes boomers hit the end of the road before they realize the ride is over.\n\nMark Tepper, president and founder of Strategic Wealth Partners in Ohio, said proper planning is critical.\n\n\u201cIdeally, you should start planning for your exit the day you begin your business,\u201d Tepper said. \u201cIf you do that, you\u2019ll manage your business as an investment as opposed to a vehicle that supports your lifestyle.\u201d\n\nTTOBIN@DemocratandChronicle.com Twitter.com/tobin3\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1cnJsnW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Business brokers see the trend accelerating in 2014.", "og": {"site_name": "Rochester Democrat and Chronicle", "description": "Business brokers see the trend accelerating in 2014.", "title": "Boomers in small business starting to retire", "url": "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/business/2014/01/02/boomers-in-small-business-starting-to-retire/4274533/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/democratandchronicle.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Business brokers see the trend accelerating in 2014.", "title": "Boomers in small business starting to retire", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e0ef377ca7900b18a22e29e450345d8a393738f6/c=142-0-657-515&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2014/01/01/al123113craftco6a.jpg", "creator": "@DandC", "site": "@DandC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028377", "fb": {"app_id": 176958652324613}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/Gary, IN", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/Gary, IN", "title": "Boomers in small business starting to retire", "author": "Tom Tobin", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/business", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b17d00fc1cf332d0fa6385363656e9f32d303940/c=207-0-593-515/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2014/01/01/al123113craftco6a.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed22985eebbfa2ea1c9fe87c994a24991006a376/c=142-0-657-515/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2014/01/01/al123113craftco6a.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5cfaabbd446c2faf50203743d6cfa7eef267a6ea/c=58-0-743-515/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2014/01/01/al123113craftco6a.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c14e76cb4c40f053d006e445764c0b007264b11b/c=0-32-800-484&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2014/01/01/al123113craftco6a.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-01-02T00:07:58-05:00", "shorthed": "Boomers in small business starting to retire", "articleid": 4274533, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/53443e8b198f0c59b4f33c451d8f36de74fd7caa/c=0-32-800-484/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2014/01/01/al123113craftco6a.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d585309bbce1079997ab9754d7afcf73b3f7f62e/c=256-0-544-515/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2014/01/01/al123113craftco6a.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda77b\"", "article_summary": "Half of the surveyed brokers said retiring boomers were the reason behind half of all the sales of small business in 2013.\n\u201cI still have the passion for the business,\u2019\u2019 Rowe said.\nAccording to the online market analyst firm BizBuySell, 68 percent of business brokers queried said they handled more transactions in 2013 than in 2012.\n\u201cOverall, brokers recognize the uncertainty of the economy, but still appear very confident that small business transactions will continue to rise in 2014,\u201d BizBuySell.com and BizQuest.com manager Curtis Kroeker said in a statement.\nAllinger said she still loves the business, as does Gary, who is a woodworker and artist."}
