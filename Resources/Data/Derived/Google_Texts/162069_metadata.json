Kansas Ave.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is about getting people who like art and technology to meet in Topeka,\u201d said Jared Starkey, executive director of 712.\n\nThe swap meet began at 10 a.m. and was expected to end at 3 p.m., Starkey said.\n\nBooth space was available for $20, and visitors were asked to donate $5 at the door. However, everyone received a souvenir coin, which was cut on 712\u2019s laser cutter.\n\n712 Innovations includes a shared office space and a \u201cmakerspace\u201d with tools for building things with materials from wood to electronic components, according to a previous Topeka Capital-Journal article. Members receive a key fob so they can drop in whenever they want. There is a cost for membership.\n\nJared Mollenkamp, of Topeka, was on the \u201ctechnical side\u201d of the swap meet, offering up spare AV connectors, a Harmon/Kardon speaker system and a Microsoft Windows 3.1 sign from the 1990s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a social event,\u201d Mollenkamp said. \u201cIt\u2019s about meeting people and seeing new people.\u201d\n\nThere was a similar swap meet last year at Central Park Community Center to help raise funds for the makerspace, Mollenkamp said.\n\nNext to Mollenkamp\u2019s booth, Kathy Scritchfield, of Beattie, was displaying her artwork.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be here today because of the weather,\u201d Scritchfield said.\n\nBut temperatures in the 40s allowed her to make the 90-minute trip to Topeka. Her daughter, Lisa Mena, lives in the capital city. Mena was a model for some of Scritchfield\u2019s oil-on-canvas pieces.\n\nAt another booth, Shirley Darby was displaying a variety of vintage pieces \u2014 everything from 1921 through 2000 A&W Root Beer mugs to Victorian photographs and art prints.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a collector of various things for some time,\u201d Darby said. \u201cI\u2019m downsizing my collections. For me, the fun was in the chase. Finding things I liked and showing them off.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Ann Marie Bush", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Artwork, electronics, vintage photographs, computer components and more were available for swap or sale Saturday during the Art + Tech Swap Meet at 712 Innovations, 712 S.
