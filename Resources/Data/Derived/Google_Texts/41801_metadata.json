The marketplace, an online store where multiple insurance companies will bid to provide coverage, is expected to open Oct. 1, six months before the federal mandate for health insurance goes into effect April 1.\n\nThe marketplace will include information on federal subsidies for health insurance, which will apply to people making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, said Antoinette Kraus, director of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network. That\u2019s up to $45,000 for a single person and higher amounts for families.\n\nSalisbury Township lawyer Mark Aurand, who specializes in health care law, said he expects about 90 percent of people who try the Health Insurance Marketplace will qualify for a subsidy. Most of the country\u2019s uninsured are in lower-wage jobs where health insurance isn\u2019t a standard benefit, he said.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, which specializes in health care issues, has set up an online Health Insurance Marketplace estimator. The foundation\u2019s estimator predicts a family of four earning $53,000 a year would qualify for a monthly subsidy of $645 toward a $962 health care premium, making their out-of-pocket cost $317 a month, Aurand said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be far more affordable than ever before,\u201d he said.\n\nMarketplace information can be found online at healthcare.gov and certain organizations are getting set up to help people in person, including the Neighborhood Health Center of the Lehigh Valley on North Second Street in Allentown.\n\nSt. Luke\u2019s University Health Network also is working to set up public information sessions on the marketplace, spokeswoman Denise Rader said. St. Luke\u2019s physicians will be able to assist their patients with the marketplace, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople really do need their hand held through the process because it\u2019s very complicated,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s coverage is different and everybody\u2019s needs are different.\u201d\n\nCongressional offices also will help where they can, though both Rep. Charlie Dent and a spokesman for Rep. Leonard Lance said neither office has received much information on the marketplace.\n\nBoth Republican congressmen voted against the Affordable Care Act but say their opposition won\u2019t keep them from helping constituents sign up through the act\u2019s Health Insurance Marketplace, though they do have concerns about the April 1 deadline for the individual mandate.\n\n\u201cThis is one the reasons why the congressman continues to oppose implementation of the law,\u201d Lance spokesman John Byers said in an email. \u201cThe federal government does not yet have the policies, procedures or tools in place to make it work.\u201d\n\nBoth Lance and Dent voted Friday for a House resolution to wipe out the health care law and simultaneously prevent a partial government shutdown. The measure passed in the GOP-controlled chamber, but it's unlikely to get enough support from the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\n\n\nAffordable Care Act advocates plan to help residents with the Health Insurance Marketplace, as well. The Lehigh Valley chapter of Organizing for Action is planning several outreach events Oct. 1 especially targeted at young adults, member Gloria McVeigh said. Many uninsured young adults don\u2019t realize how one serious injury could put them into major debt, McVeigh said.\n\n\u201cOur job is to make sure everyone knows it\u2019s here and it\u2019s coming,\u201d she said of the marketplace. \u201cUnless you\u2019re on Medicare, you should check it out.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nWhat you need to know\n\n\n\nA Health Insurance Marketplace that\u2019s part of the federal Affordable Care Act launches Oct. 1. It\u2019s an online store where multiple insurance companies will bid to provide health insurance.\n\nThe marketplace, found online at healthcare.gov, also will include information on federal subsidies for people making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level to help pay for health insurance, which will be a federal requirement as of April 1.\n\nThose without health insurance after that point will face an annual penalty of $95 or up to 1 percent of their taxable income, whichever is greater, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman said. Those penalties will increase annually, maxing out at $695 or 2.5 percent of taxable income.\n\nThere are a few exemptions to the health insurance requirement, known as the individual mandate. They include those who would qualify for a religious exemption, those who can\u2019t find health insurance at a cost less than 8 percent of their income and those who would qualify for coverage under the federal Medicaid expansion but don\u2019t in their state, according to Antoinette Kraus, director of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network.\n\nNew Jersey has accepted the federal Medicaid expansion, which will provide health insurance to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, but Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett is seeking to accept only a partial Medicaid expansion. Instead of enrolling more people in Medicaid, Corbett wants to use the additional federal money to go toward subsidies in the Health Insurance Marketplace for residents who would otherwise qualify for the Medicaid expansion.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that 14.9 percent of New Jersey residents and 12 percent of Pennsylvania residents are uninsured, according to Census figures.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act,allentown,business,carmen bell,charlie dent,gloria mcveigh,health insurance marketplace,leonard lance,mark aurand,news poll,organizing for action,pennsylvania health access network,salisbury township,st. luke's university health network,tom corbett", "title": "Affordable Care Act proponents: Health Insurance Marketplace to save money", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Affordable Care Act proponents: Health Insurance Marketplace to save money\", \"link\": \"http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/breaking-news/index.ssf/2013/09/affordable_care_act_proponents.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.lehighvalleylive.com/home/lvlive-media/width620/img/express-times/photo/2013/09/13427060-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11279720\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-22T09:32:09Z\", \"author\": \"Lynn Olanoff | The Express-Times\", \"tags\": [\"@et\",\"@mobile\",\"@topstories\",\"affordable care act\",\"allentown\",\"business\",\"carmen bell\",\"charlie dent\",\"gloria mcveigh\",\"health insurance marketplace\",\"leonard lance\",\"mark aurand\",\"news poll\",\"organizing for action\",\"pennsylvania health access network\",\"salisbury township\",\"st. luke\\u0027s university health network\",\"tom corbett\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.lehighvalleylive.com/express-times/photo/2013/09/13427060-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@LynnOlanoff", "site": "@lehighvalley", "card": "summary", "description": "Proponents say the marketplace, an online store where multiple insurance companies will bid to provide coverage, will be an affordable option for the uninsured.
