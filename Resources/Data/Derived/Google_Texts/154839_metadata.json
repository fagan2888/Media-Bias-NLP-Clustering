Ryan hopes there is still some magic left at Apogee for the Class 5A Division II Region I final against Cedar Hill.\n\nNo more ice problems. No more waiting around. Finally, we have football.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about Cedar Hill.\n\nClass 5A Division II Region I final\n\nRyan (10-2) vs. Cedar Hill (11-2), Apogee Stadium, 3 p.m.\n\nSeries Record: Cedar Hill leads 1-0\n\nThe winner gets: Lake Travis (12-1), Saturday at 1:30 p.m. at Waco\u2019s Floyd Casey Stadium.\n\nHow we got here: Ryan \u2013 Bi-district: Ryan d. Colleyville Heritage 44-34; area: Ryan d. Waco Midway 34-33; Regional semifinal: Ryan d. Keller Fossil Ridge 42-37.\n\nCedar Hill \u2013 Bi-district: Cedar Hill d. Temple 39-35; area: Cedar Hill d. Hebron 42-21; regional semifinal: Cedar Hill d. Abilene Cooper 28-23.\n\nOther than the game against Hebron, Cedar Hill scraped by Temple and Cooper.\n\nAs for the Raiders, to call them a second-half team is an understatement. They spotted Fossil Ridge 31 points and still won. They struggled against Midway but found a way to pull-off a 13-point comeback win in the second half.\n\nThis ties Ryan\u2019s deepest 5A playoff run. In 2004, the Raiders went to the 5A DI regional final and lost to Southlake Carroll, who beat Ryan in the regular season as well.\n\nWhat happened last year: This game is a rematch of last year\u2019s Class 5A Division II area game. Ryan lost 48-35 in the only meeting between the two teams. A slow start plagued the Raiders, as Cedar Hill went up 14-0 early. Longhorns quarterback Damion Hobbs completed 16 of 19 passes for 242 yards, three touchdowns, and one rushing score.\n\nRyan\u2019s offense matched Cedar Hill\u2019s, but a surprise onside kick and a muffed punt ended up being the demise of the Raiders.\n\nLast year\u2019s Cedar Hill squad was absolutely loaded. It had Hobbs (Oregon), wide receiver LaQuivonte Gonzalez (Texas A&M), wide receiver Brandon Harris (Iowa State), and wide receiver Quincy Adeboyejo (Ole Miss).\n\nRyan had a group of juniors and senior defensive back Reynal Caldwell. That was about it.\n\nWhat to expect this year: Cedar Hill is one of those teams that reloads year after year. They lost perhaps the state\u2019s most talented receiving corps, but they still have junior DaMarkus Lodge. He\u2019s around 6-2, 190 (depending on what site you go to) and he\u2019s already one of the most sought-after targets in the nation. It\u2019d be easier to click here and see all his offers.\n\nLodge has 1,165 receiving yards and 19 touchdowns. He\u2019s ridiculously good. See for yourself.\n\n\n\nLodge only had six catches for 39 yards against Cooper last week. But, Ryan has faced plenty of good receivers \u2013 Hebron\u2019s Jamal Adams, Midway\u2019s Devontre Stricklin and Fossil Ridge\u2019s Ryan Parker.\n\nIf Ryan\u2019s defensive line can overwhelm Cedar Hill\u2019s offensive line and force Justin McMillian into hurried passes, that will be the Raiders\u2019 best pass defense. Don\u2019t sleep on Cedar Hill\u2019s backfield either. Larry Hill and Aca\u2019cedric Ware are pretty good, too.\n\nDefensively, Cedar Hill\u2019s most notable player is defensive back Marcus Green, who\u2019s orally committed to Oklahoma.\n\nRyan\u2019s offense has been effective through the ground and through the air. If Ryan can get its running game going and senior quarterback Mitchell Bridges hits his favorite targets, Trent Willis and Xavier Gray, the Raiders won\u2019t have any problems scoring.\n\nNow I wonder what effect the long layoff will have on Ryan. The Raiders had a lot of momentum after the win against Fossil Ridge, but that seems like forever ago now.\n\nThe Raiders have to play all of Monday\u2019s game like they played the second half of the Fossil Ridge game. Ryan can\u2019t play like it did in the first half against Fossil Ridge and expect to win. Cedar Hill\u2019s too good for that.\n\nAlso, the winner of the game can\u2019t sustain any injuries because of the quick turnaround. It doesn\u2019t help that Lake Travis defeated A&M Consolidated 21-7 on Saturday and will have two extra days of rest.\n\nRyan player to watch: DT Reese Strait (17 tackles for loss, five sacks, two forced fumbles)\n\nCedar Hill player to watch: WR DaMarkus Lodge (1,165 receiving yards, 18.8 yards per catch, 19 TDs)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "og": {"site_name": "Denton RC High School", "description": "When Ryan steps back onto the field at Apogee Stadium on Monday, the Raiders will be nine days removed from the biggest comeback in school history.
