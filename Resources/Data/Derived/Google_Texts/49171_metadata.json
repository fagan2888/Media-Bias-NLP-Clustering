Larry Hogan has beaten cancer, has phenomenal approval ratings, and has pretty much everyone liking him\u2013both Democrat and Republican. The man knows how to get things done, and has promised to tackle the issues he campaigned on in the 2015 gubernatorial election. Yet, last week, some Maryland Democrats lobbed a rather nasty accusation against the governor concerning the building of a new jail, and other projects, that they consider to be\u2013you guessed it\u2013racially motivated. Even the Washington Post\u2019s editorial board was a bit taken aback by the line of attack, saying the Maryland\u2019s Democrats have \u201cHogan Derangement Syndrome\u201d:\n\nWe didn\u2019t support Mr. Hogan in his 2014 campaign. Nonetheless, what has been striking since he took office is neither his ideology (faint), nor his agenda (small-ball), nor his governing style (laid-back), nor his partisanship (run-of-the-mill) but the disproportionate attacks by Democrats on a governor whose record so far qualifies him as a moderate.\n\nLast year they pilloried him for trying to divert money for the state\u2019s underfunded pension system, a cause Democrats themselves embraced just four years earlier, before legislative amnesia set in. This year they derided his anodyne State of the State address, heavy on pledges to work collaboratively with Democrats, with initiatives \u2014 some targeted tax cuts and fee reductions; nonpartisan redistricting; efforts to combat heroin addiction \u2014 that could easily have been issued by a reform-minded Democrat.\n\nDemocrats responded with bills that would tilt the balance of power away from the governor and toward the Democrat-controlled legislature. Some of those measures, such as subjecting the state\u2019s school superintendent to legislative approval, looked gratuitously political; amid criticism, it was essentially withdrawn Tuesday.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nBefore Mr. Hogan took office, Maryland was a virtual one-party state, led by a Republican governor for just four of the preceding 45 years. Now Democrats, encumbered by a sense of entitlement and baffled by a middle-of-the-road GOP governor, seem bereft of a strategy and grasping for an agenda. They would need both to wrest power from Mr. Hogan if, as expected, he seeks reelection in 2018.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's a bit pathetic what Democrats are doing to Gov.
