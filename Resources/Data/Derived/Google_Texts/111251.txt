(London Daily Mail) A Berlin woman was reunited with her stolen dog on Sunday only to be told by vets that it had been gang raped.

Kessie, a three-year-old Bardino-Galgo mix, was stolen from outside an Edeka supermarket in the NeukÃ¶lln area of Berlin while her owner was inside on Wednesday.

Vets believe that while missing, the pet was gang raped by the thieves, and received external and internal injuries.
