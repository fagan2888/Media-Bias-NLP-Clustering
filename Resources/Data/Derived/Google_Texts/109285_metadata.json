On the minus side, the whole thing should probably be marked off with bright yellow \u201cWarning: Do Not Cross Unless You Are Completely Insufferable\u201d hazard tape. Also, in a more just world, the links to the various sections of the piece\u2014\u201cSyria/ISIS,\u201d \u201cDonald Trump,\u201d \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d \u201cBenghazi,\u201d and so on\u2014would automatically trigger those cheap-looking, high-wailing sirens that faithfully guard the bad guy\u2019s lair in pretty much every B movie ever made.\n\n\u201cThis week, families will gather to eat, drink, reminisce\u2014and, inevitably, argue about what\u2019s going on in the news,\u201d Vox chirps, strangely cheerful for an organization bent on ruining the holidays. \u201cHere are some topics likely to come up and some pointers on how to respond to what your relatives might say.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pick a favorite part of Vox\u2019s earnest instruction guide to having no social skills, but let\u2019s go with the section on Bernie Sanders. \u201cBernie Sanders is almost tailor-made to be a great topic for Thanksgiving dinner table arguments,\u201d writes Dylan Matthews, who either resides on the far moon of the planet Uranus, has a delightfully dark sense of humor, or was unwillingly assigned this piece and decided to approach it with a modicum of tepid despair. \u201cSo, when the yelling commences, here\u2019s what you should yell back.\u201d\n\nOkay, here we go. When your father-in-law says Bernie Sanders is \u201ca filthy red! He\u2019d turn America into a Soviet hellhole\u201d\u2014it actually says that, by the way\u2014you\u2019re supposed to come back with something like this: \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re probably right, father-in-law! Bernie does keep talking about some sort of political revolution, and he did spend his honeymoon in the USSR!\u201d\n\nNext, you\u2019re supposed to guzzle a whole bottle of cheap red wine, hurl the bottle into your aunt\u2019s favorite Thomas Kinkade painting, and valiantly flip the table over, mashed potatoes and all, leaving nothing but the sound of your 7-year-old cousin\u2019s quiet, terrified breathing.\n\nJust joking. According to Vox, you\u2019re supposed to patiently explain that Bernie would \u201cturn America into a Scandinavian,\u201d not Soviet, \u201chellhole (or utopia, depending on your view of things.)\u201d Also, does your father-in-law know that the \u201cinfant mortality in Finland is roughly half that in the U.S.\u201d? Does he know that Scandinavian countries, \u201cin many ways, provide a better life for their most vulnerable residents than the U.S. does\u201d? He doesn\u2019t? Well, then, fill him in! Presto! Your spouse\u2019s father is no longer a benighted, poor man\u2019s Joseph McCarthy.\n\nWell, not really, but he probably does secretly want, like Clark Griswold with his freeloading Cousin Eddie, to drive you out in the middle of nowhere and leave you for dead. Welcome to the politicized life, which has come into full, absurdist flower in this sadly madcap year of 2015. Everything is not awesome, alas; everything is political, even your dysfunctional family dinner.\n\nThe beginning of the end, it could be argued, came two years ago, when the Obama administration launched the infamous \u201cPajama Boy\u201d campaign. Featuring a smug-looking millennial who literally wore an adult-sized, single-zip onesie, the ad encouraged Americans to use the holidays to \u201cwear pajamas,\u201d \u201cdrink hot chocolate,\u201d and \u201ctalk about getting health insurance\u201d with their families. Pajama Boy may have looked like he would fall over at a micro-aggressive sneeze, but nothing would stop him from stumping for Obamacare.\n\nSadly, the proverbial pajama boys of the world\u2014much like the sprawling, increasingly unworkable Affordable Care Act\u2014are now an insistent, annoying part of American life. It\u2019s not hard to see why. The more space the government takes up in our lives\u2014in terms of health care decisions, educational opportunities, small business regulations, or who can say what and when\u2014the more people are going to fight about it. If the government were less consequential in people\u2019s day-to-day doings, the corresponding politics would evoke far less passion and conflict.\n\nBut there\u2019s something else going on here: Politics, for many, has morphed into personal identity. Just look at colleges today, where opposing political sentiments or offensive statements can make students collapse like panicked, half-hearted origami. And hey, it makes sense: If politics is the be-all and end-all of life, and you honestly believe we can build a utopia buttressed by bureaucratic control, your personal worth, by logical extension, is ultimately based upon your political beliefs. No offense is too petty to let stand; no Thanksgiving dinner can be left in peace.\n\nThis week, let\u2019s give thanks for America\u2019s remaining respites from the politicized life. They may be endangered, but they\u2019re out there\u2014and if we\u2019re smart, we\u2019ll work to expand them. They\u2019re often the best places, after all, to count our many blessings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanksgiving is right around the corner, friends, and you know what that means: a fresh new batch of think pieces on how to be the most unbearable person at your family\u2019s holiday gathering.\nOn...", "title": "The Tightening Grip of the Politicized Life | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/11/25/the_tightening_grip_of_the_politicized_life_128830.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/332171_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Thanksgiving is right around the corner, friends, and you know what that means: a fresh new batch of think pieces on how to be the most unbearable person at your family\u2019s holiday gathering.\nOn...", "title": "The Tightening Grip of the Politicized Life | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "The Tightening Grip of the Politicized Life | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "Vox,Thanksgiving,political landscape,Obama administration,affordable care act,Bernie Sanders,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10bc\"", "article_summary": "Welcome to the politicized life, which has come into full, absurdist flower in this sadly madcap year of 2015.\nWhen your father-in-law says Bernie Sanders is \u201ca filthy red!\nDoes he know that Scandinavian countries, \u201cin many ways, provide a better life for their most vulnerable residents than the U.S. does\u201d?\nThis week, let\u2019s give thanks for America\u2019s remaining respites from the politicized life.\nYou\u2019re probably right, father-in-law!"}
