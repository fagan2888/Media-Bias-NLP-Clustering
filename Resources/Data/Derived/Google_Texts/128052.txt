Organizers say everything went amazingly well from the dry weather to the dramatic playoff that determined the winner. The course now has its sights on even bigger golf championship events.

An estimated 120,000 people walked the grounds of Oak Tree National for the U.S. Senior Open. Organizers say everything went amazingly well from the dry weather to the dramatic playoff that determined the winner. The course now has its sights on even bigger golf championship events.

“We think we are back in the rotation and we think that is going to be helpful for us,” said Oak Tree National majority owner, Ed Evans.

Evans thinks the success of the U.S. Senior Open this past week has put Oak Tree National “back on the map.” He called the tournament “flawless”, saying the course can easily host the bigger crowds that would come with a U.S. Open.

Widening Waterloo Rd. north of the golf course would be extremely helpful in handling the crowds according to Evans.

“We would like to see it widened either from the course to (highway) 77 or the course to I-35,” said Evans.

The Oak Tree National co-owner admits the widening of Waterloo isn’t absolutely necessary, but would make handling U.S. Open crowds easier. He also feels there are enough hotel rooms in Edmond and off Memorial Rd. that could handle the 250,000 people expected at a U.S. Open.

Evans says the Club will be in talks with the USGA and the PGA of America to host other tournaments. The next best target for Oak Tree National, according to Evans, would be the U.S. Amateur in 2019 or 2020. That would put the course in good position to host a US Open in 2022.
