I expected 20 or 30 people to attend\u2013after all, it was just a concurrent session. Four-hundred and fifty people showed up, mostly people with hard-science PhDs. After the session, about 75 of them lined up to talk with me\u2014most of them telling me they were having a hard time finding a job and wanted advice.\n\nOn the other end of the professional continuum, an article in Forbes reports, \u201cWhen Walmart opens a new store, it\u2019s not uncommon for as many as 10,000 people to apply for just 300 jobs.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd as a career counselor, I\u2019ve been struck by how, increasingly, even well-degreed, well-experienced people are having a hard time landing stable, middle-income-paying, employment.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason to believe that good, stable jobs will become ever more scarce:\n\nRecent years have seen elimination of countless jobs through automation: for example, ATMs, supermarket self-checkout, automatic toll takers, telephone operators, automatic baristas, bartenders, burger makers, warehouse workers, even keymakers (in Walmart now). For example, Applebee\u2019s and Chili\u2019s have reduced their waitstaff by implementing iPads for ordering and paying your check. Can other restaurant chains be far behind? Millions of cab, bus, train, and truck drivers could eventually be out of a job if driverless vehicles becomes a reality. Oxford University researchers forecast that, within 20 years, computerization will eliminate almost half of all of jobs.\n\nIn a previous TIME article, I pointed out that many desirable jobs, for example, in journalism, art, acting, and nonprofits have been converted to volunteer \u201cpositions,\u201d internships, and low-pay independent-contractor work.\n\nIn the just-mentioned previous TIME article, I also pointed out that the costs of hiring an American continue to grow. In addition to the employer mandates of the Affordable Care Act, costs are increasing for Workers Compensation, Medicare, Social Security, Americans with Disabilities Act, EEOC, Family Leave, and employee grievances and lawsuits.\n\nUberization. Our smartphones enable just-in-time hiring: whether a corporation needing a CFO for a day to solve a problem, a homeowner searching for a handyperson who\u2019ll show up in a half hour, and, of course, anyone needing a ride. By-the-hour and by-the-day hiring will become ever more common, not just to ensure that the worker really is needed but to avoid those expensive and stressful wrongful termination lawsuits. If you\u2019re only hired for one day and the employer doesn\u2019t want you back for a second day, it\u2019s hard to claim wrongful termination.\n\nA scary variation on the above is the contest. When I wanted a cover designed for my next book, I posted a request for designs on 99designs.com. Over 100 graphic designers submitted one (including my requested revisions from the finalists) and I only had to pay for the one I selected\u2014just $300. In other words, 100+ people did a lot of work for nothing and one person earned probably about $10 an hour. I envision employers posting contests for all sort of work, from the best approach to streamlining a corporate process to the best fundraising plan for a nonprofit. Each would-be worker would have to compete worldwide for the privilege of getting hired for just one perhaps very short project, and at a fee near a worldwide low.\n\nWhat is to happen to the billions of people who, by definition, are below average in hireability?!\n\nWithout a broad-based plan for ensuring reasonably remunerative and otherwise rewarding work, there is increased risk of social unrest, especially given the expanding gap between rich and poor and the crushing college student debt, which isn\u2019t even dischargeable through bankruptcy.\n\nThis five-part plan, some of which was covered previously, might help:\n\n1. K-16 entrepreneurship education. New businesses create jobs, so teaching students the art and science of ethical entrepreneurship should create jobs while providing new goods and services. The best tradeoff might be to replace a day or two a week of physical education with entrepreneurship education.\n\n2. K-16 vocational education. For fear that we might prematurely place someone in a not-college-bound track, we force all students to take a one-size-fits all curriculum: college preparatory. That\u2019s true even though we know that even by the early grades, fairly accurate predictions can be made about who will likely be better off in a path not aimed at college\u2014for example, a path that would teach kids how to build, install, operate, maintain, and repair the sorts of complex equipment that is described above, plus MRI machines, car assembly robots, etc. Of course, there will be occasional wrong guesses about which child should go in which curriculum, but far fewer errors than by ignoring the probabilities and insisting that everyone get a college-preparatory curriculum.\n\n3. Taxpayer-funded jobs. I envision a Work-Project-Administration-like program, an Assistance Army, that would, for example, build infrastructure, bring more tutors to K-12 classrooms, provide better in-home support for shut-in seniors, beautify riven inner cities, and fund visual and performing artists to enrich the community.\n\n4. Educate the public to embrace \u201cmosaic careers.\u201d Of course, full-time, stable jobs offer advantages: Many people like having a routine, a regular place to go to work, a job they can grow comfortable in, coworkers that become friends, whom they pass the years with. Alas, for many people that may be impossible in today\u2019s and especially tomorrow\u2019s economy.\n\nMany people so dislike the idea of earning their living from multiple part-time, low-pay, often temporary jobs that they\u2019d rather be unemployed. Other people are daunted at having to look for multiple jobs, perhaps frequently. Those are legitimate concerns, but mosaic careers do have advantages, for example, variety, flexible schedules, and more learning opportunities. Perhaps a campaign of public-service announcements, a la the anti-smoking and anti-drug-abuse initiatives, might convince more people to pursue a mosaic career.\n\n5. Educate the public on the value of and how to live on less. The public may need to accept that The American Way\u2013trying to spend your way to happiness\u2013may be not only unrealistic but unwise, if not a fool\u2019s game. Beyond the basics, most people find their greatest contentment through rewarding work, relationships, and creative outlets not through an expensive hobby like golf or a 20th pair of shoes.\n\nMarty Nemko holds a Ph.D. specializing in education evaluation from U.C.
