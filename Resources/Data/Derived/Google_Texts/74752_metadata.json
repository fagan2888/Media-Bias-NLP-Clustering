On average, people reported a 51.8 percent satisfaction level with their senior leaders, and this agency-by-agency breakdown indicates that there\u2019s some pretty harsh boss-hate in certain government offices (my heart goes out to you, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network leaders: a 22.5 percent approval rating has got to hurt).\n\nThose who have stuck with their government jobs aren\u2019t very happy about it. Orszag cited a new study published by the Partnership for Public Service (of which he is a board member), which reports dismal public employee job satisfaction levels: On average, government employees reported a 57.8 percent satisfaction rate, compared to a 70.7 percent satisfaction rate in the private sector.\n\n\u201cIn a hyperpolarized environment in which we effectively have a bipolar Congress with no middle, there are just much smaller returns to being in government,\u201d he said during an interview with The Atlantic \u2019s Steve Clemons on Wednesday. Because of this, smart people working in business see less appeal in taking a pay cut and moving to Washington. \u201cWhat would excite many of the people I know about being in government would be the opportunity to actually do things, rather than just lob grenades at each other,\u201d he said.\n\nPeter Orszag quit his government job. For three and a half years, he ran two federal budget agencies, and in 2010, he defected to Wall Street. Even though he thinks the government desperately needs more smart people, he has deep empathy for those who flee to the private sector.\n\nTop agency leaders just aren\u2019t that good, Orszag argued, and government jobs aren\u2019t appealing to the top workers in other sectors. \u201cWe are at significant risk over the next 20 years of a dearth of leadership in the senior agency level, which is necessary regardless of whether you\u2019re a Republican or Democrat,\u201d he said.\n\nPoor performance by certain agency leaders is aggravated by what Orszag described as a general aversion to risk. Any truth in stereotypes about government work\u2014slow moving, bureaucratic, unoriginal\u2014is the result of a few factors, Orszag said.\n\n\"Lots of the great leaders of the past would not be able to survive in a Twitter world.\"\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s a turf problem. \u201cIt\u2019s always important for people in the policy environment to have an outside option \u2013 something else they could be perfectly happy doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who are the most risk-averse \u2013 if there\u2019s nothing else you could imagine doing with your life \u2013 it causes you to be really afraid of doing anything that could deprive you of whatever exalted position that you have.\u201d\n\nIntense political divisions among elected officials don\u2019t help. \u201cIf you don\u2019t think anything is going to happen anyway, why be bold? If you\u2019re stuck in a world of polarization and bimodal Congress and nothing\u2019s possible, your incentives are to just kind of sit tight and hope nothing bad happens,\u201d he said.\n\nBut perhaps most notably, Orszag blames bloggers for government inefficiency. \u201cLeadership requires just a little bit of opacity, a little bit of give to hope that things turn out. Lots of the great leaders of the past would not be able to survive in a Twitter world, a constant blogging, Politico world. I think that leads to risk-aversion: If you\u2019re worried about the next Politico story or the next tweet or whatever, you\u2019re kind of afraid of your own shadow.\u201d\n\nThis an interesting position for a Bloomberg columnist to take. But in Orszag\u2019s case, government work might be a lost cause. \u201cWhat could the government have done to keep you?\u201d Clemons asked Orszag during the interview. He answered his own question. \u201cMaybe the answer is nothing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blame the bloggers, Peter Orszag says.", "author": "Emma Green", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Blame the bloggers, Peter Orszag says.", "title": "Why It Can Be Tough to Work for the Government", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/City_crowded_office_space_2899334278/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/events/archive/2013/12/why-it-sucks-to-be-a-government-employee/282497/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6511\"", "article_summary": "Top agency leaders just aren\u2019t that good, Orszag argued, and government jobs aren\u2019t appealing to the top workers in other sectors.\nPoor performance by certain agency leaders is aggravated by what Orszag described as a general aversion to risk.\n\"Lots of the great leaders of the past would not be able to survive in a Twitter world.\"\nLots of the great leaders of the past would not be able to survive in a Twitter world, a constant blogging, Politico world.\nBut in Orszag\u2019s case, government work might be a lost cause."}
