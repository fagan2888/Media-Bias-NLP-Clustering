Sunday morning talking heads

A rare case this year when the star guest on the Sunday shows isn’t a presidential candidate. Mitch McConnell will be on “This Week,” “Meet the Press,” “State of the Union,” and “Fox News Sunday” to defend GOP opposition to Merrick Garland’s confirmation and answer a tricky question: Why is it worth waiting a year to fill this vacancy when odds are very good it’ll be either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump who fills it? How McConnell handles that will tell you something about how Senate Republicans are planning to cope with a Trump nomination. If he plays the good soldier, insisting that Trump will be a solid conservative in office, it’ll suggest that Senate GOPers are willing to give him a shot to unite the party. If he says that Senate Republicans will exercise their advise-and-consent power scrupulously no matter who wins, that’s a sign that they’re already preparing to go their own way in congressional elections this fall.

John Kasich will be on all five shows this morning to try to explain why helping Trump win delegates in Utah is a good idea for a guy whose chances at the nomination depend on a brokered convention. The most interesting interview this a.m., though, will probably be Lindsey Graham’s chat with John Dickerson on “Face the Nation.” This will be the first time, I believe, that he’s spoken publicly about the fundraiser he’s planning for Ted Cruz, and it comes just two days after Mitt Romney urged Republicans to vote for Cruz in Utah. If you’re up for a bizarro-world segment in which one of the most prominent members of the GOP establishment tells the world that Ted Cruz is the last best hope of the party, here you go.

Reince Priebus will also be on “This Week” and “State of the Union” to describe what it’s like to hold the world’s worst job. The full line-up is at the AP.
