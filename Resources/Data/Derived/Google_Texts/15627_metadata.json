It goes like this: Turkey is a rich source of the essential amino acid tryptophan, which our bodies need to build certain kinds of proteins. Tryptophan also is a precursor to serotonin, used to make melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep. Therefore, eating a lot of turkey will make me sleepy while watching football.\n\nDespite how perfectly sound each link in that chain of logic may appear, the conclusion is absolutely false.\n\n\u201cTurkey doesn\u2019t make you sleepy,\u201d said Kim Sasso, a registered and licensed dietitian who spoke to a Loyola University Health System press officer.\n\nYes, it\u2019s true your holiday bird contains tryptophan, but many other foods, including most other meats, contain the amino acid at comparable levels. In fact, the humble soybean and cheddar cheese both contain more tryptophan, gram for gram, than turkey. As Sasso explained, no matter how much turkey you eat, it simply won\u2019t be enough \u2014 after breakdown, metabolism, and transfer within your body \u2014 to have a real impact on your brain and cause sleepiness after your holiday meal.\n\nSo what does make you sleepy on Turkey day?\n\nEating too much in general, says Sasso, along with \u201cthe stressful hustle and bustle of the holiday, travel schedules, alcohol indulgence, and cooking tasks.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about tryptophan and turkeys, watch the video from ByteSize Science, sponsored by the American Chemical Society.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tryptophan, turkey, does, not, induce, food, coma, youre, sleepy, because, you, ate, too, much", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The amount of tryptophan in your holiday bird is not enough to cause sleepiness, but eating too much will.", "title": "The Truth About Your 'Turkey Coma'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/tryptophan-turkey-does-not-induce-food-coma-youre-sleepy-because-you-ate-too-much-363008", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/11/25/tryptophan-turkey-does-not-induce-food-coma-youre-sleepy-because-you-ate-too-much.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The amount of tryptophan in your holiday bird is not enough to cause sleepiness, but eating too much will.", "title": "The Truth About Your 'Turkey Coma'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/tryptophan-turkey-does-not-induce-food-coma-youre-sleepy-because-you-ate-too-much-363008", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/11/25/tryptophan-turkey-does-not-induce-food-coma-youre-sleepy-because-you-ate-too-much.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/25/tryptophan-turkey-does-not-induce-food-coma-youre-sleepy-because-you-ate-too-much.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-11-25T14:00:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-25T14:00:12-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The amount of tryptophan in your holiday bird is not enough to cause sleepiness, but eating too much will."}, "article_summary": "It goes like this: Turkey is a rich source of the essential amino acid tryptophan, which our bodies need to build certain kinds of proteins.\nIn fact, the humble soybean and cheddar cheese both contain more tryptophan, gram for gram, than turkey.\nYes, it\u2019s true your holiday bird contains tryptophan, but many other foods, including most other meats, contain the amino acid at comparable levels.\nSo what does make you sleepy on Turkey day?\n\u201cTurkey doesn\u2019t make you sleepy,\u201d said Kim Sasso, a registered and licensed dietitian who spoke to a Loyola University Health System press officer."}
