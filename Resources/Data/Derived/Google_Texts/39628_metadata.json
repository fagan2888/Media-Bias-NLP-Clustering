(David R. Jennings / Broomfield Enterprise)\n\nKayla Becker, a member of the Liberty Livestock 4-H Club, wound up showing this year's grand champion market goat, a Boer she's named \"Mighty Goat.\"\n\nThe youngster also showed a sheep, a Suffolk-Hampshire cross named \"Trooper,\" which was the 2014 Boulder County Fair's reserve grand champion market lamb.\n\nTo add to her accomplishments, Kayla also ended up winning a giant belt bucket and blue ribbon on Saturday for her skills in showing a variety of animals \u2014 horses, steers, dairy goats, market goats, lambs and hogs \u2014 in a Junior Round Robin competition.\n\n\"She's had a great, great fair, said her mother, Janet Becker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's actually really, really good for being in 4-H only three years,\" said Kayla, who will soon be starting sixth grade at Greeley's Chappelow Elementary School.\n\nShe spends her summers with her grandparents, Richard and Jane Miller, who live outside Longmont on East County Line Road, and her aunt, Ronda Weber, who raises show lambs on a farm between Longmont and Berthoud.\n\nKayla's Boulder County Fair accomplishments are carrying on something of a family tradition, her proud mother said.\n\nJanet Becker said she'd showed the grand champion lamb and grand champion hog at the 1993 Boulder County Fair, when she was a member of the Pleasant View Sheep Keepers 4-H Club, as well as the Grand Champion lamb at the 1994 Colorado State Fair.\n\nKayla appeared to have mixed feelings, however, about the possibility of parting with her own grand champion goat and reserve grand champion market lamb at Saturday's 59th annual Boulder County Fair Junior Livestock Auction.\n\n\"I love them so much,\" she said of Mighty Goat and Trooper.\n\nNor were beef and dairy cattle, rabbits, goats, sheep, chickens, turkeys, barrows and gilts the only animals and poultry up for auction on Saturday, the next-to-last day of this year's fair.\n\nOn Saturday morning, another set of bidders put up hundreds of dollars to buy award-winning 4-H products featured at the fair.\n\nIsobel Tuck, an 11-year-old member of the Niwot Nifties 4-H Club who attends Boulder Country Day School, said she was happy with the $100 she got for a basket of banana chocolate-chip and gluten-free \u2014 money her mother, Lucy Tuck, said Isobel would be donating to the club.\n\nKendra Harris, an 18-year-old recent Mead High School graduate and a member of the Kicks-and-Bucks 4-H Club who'll be attending Colorado State University to study animal science this fall, scored $500 for the basket of Angora fleece she'd trimmed from her rabbit.\n\nHarris said that rabbit itself won a championship in this year's fair in a category of English Angora and breeding rabbits.\n\nAlexandra Tanaka-Cuerden, a member of the Fairview Crops and Livestock 4-H Club who attends Erie High School, got $200 in the auction for a yellow cake she'd decorated with buttercream icing.\n\nShe said she won a \"people's choice\" award for her cake decoration at the fair, although \"I've only been doing it for a couple of months . . .I'm happy to receive anything.\"\n\nJessie Slepicka, another member of the Niwot Nifties 4-H Club who's a recent Niwot High School graduate and will be attending the University of Colorado to study criminal justice this fall, got $300 in Saturday's 4-H Product Sale for his cranberry-and-apple turnovers.\n\n\"I thought it went really well,\" Slepicka, a 13-year 4-H veteran, said of this year's fair and auction.\n\nAs for Saturday afternoon's livestock sale, the winning bid for Kayla Becker's grand champion market goat was $2,000, but she won't have to part with Mighty Goat. The bidder, identified by fair officials as Agra Holdings, is donating the goat back to Kayla.\n\nA buyer identified by the auctioneer as Gas Mat bid $3,000 for \"Trooper,\" Kayla's reserve grand champion lamb, but the girl's aunt said the family will probably buy the animal back rather than have it wind up in a feedlot.\n\nKayla said she and her family would be going to a Red Lobster for dinner Saturday night to celebrate her Boulder County Fair experience.\n\nContact Times-Call staff writer John Fryar at 303-684-5211 or jfryar@times-call.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26307850/boulder-county-fair-auctions-prove-showcase-greeley-11", "modificationDate": "2014-08-09T17:47:06-0600", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By John Fryar \n \n  Times-Call staff writer", "description": "An 11-year-old Greeley girl had what her mother said Saturday an \"awesome\" showing at this year's Boulder County Fair.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26307850:view"}, "startDate": "2014-08-09T17:45:31-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26307850/boulder-county-fair-auctions-prove-showcase-greeley-11", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0809/20140809__10TCAFAIRw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An 11-year-old Greeley girl had what her mother said Saturday an \"awesome\" showing at this year's Boulder County Fair.", "title": "Boulder County Fair auctions prove a showcase for Greeley 11-year-old"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "An 11-year-old Greeley girl had what her mother said Saturday an \"awesome\" showing at this year's Boulder County Fair.", "title": "Boulder County Fair auctions prove a showcase for Greeley 11-year-old", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_26307850/boulder-county-fair-auctions-prove-showcase-greeley-11", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0809/20140809__10TCAFAIRw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-09T17:45:31-0600", "endDate": "2024-08-09T17:42:37-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder County Fair auctions prove a showcase for Greeley 11-year-old", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By John FryarTimes-Call", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2014-08-09T17:47:58-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5e2\"", "article_summary": "Further Info: Bouldercountyfair.orgAn 11-year-old Greeley girl had what her mother said Saturday an \"awesome\" showing at this year's Boulder County Fair.\nKayla's Boulder County Fair accomplishments are carrying on something of a family tradition, her proud mother said.\nKayla said she and her family would be going to a Red Lobster for dinner Saturday night to celebrate her Boulder County Fair experience.\nKayla Becker, 11, hugs her grand champion goat after she won grand champion round robin for showmanship in 4H at the Boulder County Fair on Saturday.\nThe youngster also showed a sheep, a Suffolk-Hampshire cross named \"Trooper,\" which was the 2014 Boulder County Fair's reserve grand champion market lamb."}
