Giunta and her sister were asked to run the society\u2019s Flamingo Fantasy Ball, but their mother was battling lung cancer. Throwing a soiree was the last thing she wanted to do.\n\nStill, she said yes and spent months shuttling from planning meetings to her mother\u2019s home, and eventually to the hospital. \u201cI would go to the American Cancer Society during the day and check on her every night,\u201d she says.\n\nOne of the last visits to her mother came the day of the ball. Unable to speak, Mary Carlino wrote a note on a piece of paper. \u201cProud\u201d is all it said, Giunta recalls. Her mother died the next day.\n\n\u201cThat was a turning point in my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t save my mother but I could help others.\u201d\n\nFor 20 years, Giunta has had a laser-like focus on raising money for the local ACS chapter. She has spent the past 16 years organizing one of the area\u2019s major charity social events: the Cattle Barons\u2019 Ball. The 2013 event achieved a major milestone, raising $1 million for the organization and its research efforts.\n\nGiunta knows that she\u2019s become the face of the event she describes simply as \u201cboots and chaps and cowboy hats.\u201d She treats the volunteer duty more like a full-time job, heading to the Kennedy Boulevard offices nearly every day.\n\nShe works underneath a framed poster from \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek nod to her reputation as a taskmaster, much like the tyrannical fashion magazine editor Meryl Streep plays in the movie.\n\n\u201cLeave your tiara at the door,\u201d she says of her warning to volunteers who think helping out for the Cattle Barons\u2019 Ball is about recognition and not dedication.\n\nShe says her loyalty to the Cancer Society was inspired by her mother, and her late mother-in-law, Tampa philanthropist Grace Greco Giunta. But its importance became even more profound when she faced her own battle with breast cancer 14 years ago.\n\nInitially, Giunta was in denial that she had cancer. How could somebody who spent so much time fighting to beat cancer through research be sick?\n\n\u201cI was completely let down when I was diagnosed,\u201d she says. \u201cI made the mistake of thinking I was invincible.\u201d\n\nShe says she knew something was wrong, but kept putting off a trip to the doctor because she was busy. When she finally visited an oncologist and took a couple of tests, the news hit fast. There was a lump the size of a lima bean, it was aggressive and it needed to be removed immediately.\n\n\u201cYou think this has to happen to someone else,\u201d she says.\n\nThe six rounds of chemotherapy, three weeks apart, nearly killed her, she says. She landed in the hospital with dangerously high temperatures and her daily trips to the Cancer Society became impossible.\n\nHer survival and health today fortify Giunta\u2019s commitment to raising money for the organization. There\u2019s a sense of gratitude when she walks by the society\u2019s \u201cwig room\u201d for women who lose their hair to chemotherapy. The self-described shopaholic says she could buy her own wigs, but she realizes some women cannot.\n\n\u201cIt made me realize it wasn\u2019t affordable for everyone,\u201d says Giunta, now 62.\n\nShe says she wants to raise money to find less toxic therapies for cancers, and for education efforts. Giunta doesn\u2019t want to see others ignore signs of cancer like she did.\n\nBut it also reminds her that every penny raised by the Cattle Barons\u2019 Ball and other fundraisers must be invested wisely. The high-profile social event, where tickets start at $500 a person, relies heavily on corporate sponsors to cover much of the administrative costs, she says.\n\n\u201cWhen my husband (Richard) and I write the check, we want to know it\u2019s going to the American Cancer Society and research,\u201d she says.\n\nGiunta knows it\u2019s easy for those who don\u2019t know her to stereotype her as a South Tampa socialite. She knows better, that this mission is personal.\n\n\u201cI think people assume you do it to promote yourself. But I\u2019m not,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m promoting the American Cancer Society. It\u2019s about giving back to the community I love.\u201d\n\nmshedden@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7365\n\nTwitter: @MaryShedden", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 05 Oct 2013 01:01:00 -0400", "Description": "Gloria Giunta started volunteering at Tampa\u2019s American Cancer Society because she felt fortunate and wanted to give back.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Gloria Giunta started volunteering at Tampa\u2019s American Cancer Society because she felt fortunate and wanted to give back.", "title": "Belle of Cattle Barons\u2019 Ball has personal connection to charity event", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/health/belle-of-cattle-barons-ball-has-personal-connection-to-charity-event-20131005/", "image": {"width": 3601, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131005/ARTICLE/131009566/AR/0/AR-131009566.jpg", "height": 2595}, "updated_time": "2013-10-04T19:36:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Gloria Giunta started volunteering at Tampa\u2019s American Cancer Society because she felt fortunate and wanted to give back.", "title": "Belle of Cattle Barons\u2019 Ball has personal connection to charity event", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131005/ARTICLE/131009566/AR/0/AR-131009566.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-10-05T01:01:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-10-04T19:36:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeff1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI would go to the American Cancer Society during the day and check on her every night,\u201d she says.\nGloria Giunta started volunteering at Tampa\u2019s American Cancer Society because she felt fortunate and wanted to give back.\n\u201cI\u2019m promoting the American Cancer Society.\nShe landed in the hospital with dangerously high temperatures and her daily trips to the Cancer Society became impossible.\nShe has spent the past 16 years organizing one of the area\u2019s major charity social events: the Cattle Barons\u2019 Ball."}
