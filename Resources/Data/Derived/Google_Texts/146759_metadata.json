That's the number of hirings that U.S. employers made in July, the highest value since December 2007.\n\nWonkbook\u2019s Chart of the Day: Obamacare has reduced the uninsured rate for pretty much everyone \u2014 except kids.\n\nWonkbook's Top 5 Stories: (1) Government probably staying open; (2) U.S. battles infectious diseases on multiple fronts; (3) hiring strong here, but concerns abroad; (4) the climate stakes ahead; and (5) how Congress might tackle police militarization.\n\n1. Top story: The government, and the Export-Import Bank, probably won't shut down\n\nHouse GOP's government-funding bill appears poised to avert shutdown. \"House Republican leaders Tuesday unveiled a temporary government funding bill that includes a short-term extension of a trade-promotion agency that has been targeted by conservative activists, eliminating a key sticking point in the effort to avoid a government shutdown. The bill would keep the government running on this year\u2019s budget levels...until \u00admid-December....The legislation should win approval in the House by Thursday, sending it to the Senate, where it is expected to pass next week. That would avert a repeat of last October\u2019s 17-day shutdown of the federal government, which was caused by Republicans trying to undo the health-care law.\" Paul Kane and Robert Costa in The Washington Post.\n\nExport-Import Bank will get new life \u2014 at least for now \u2014 in spending bill. \"Hensarling...has been highly critical of the bank and has accused it of crony capitalism and favoring big business. He had proposed letting its mandate expire \u2014 a prospect worrying many in the business community. An extension through mid-2015...would remove the threat of closure on Oct. 1...and give businesses reliant on Ex-Im programs some breathing room. It would not, however, completely resolve the heated political debate about the future of the bank, which underwrites loans and insures exports for U.S. companies and lends to foreign companies buying U.S. goods.\" Emily Stephenson and Krista Hughes in Reuters.\n\nExplainer: Why Obama, Congress are in full punt formation. Damian Paletta in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nDemocrats at some point may want a multiyear extension of Ex-Im's authorization. \"Extending its charter for the next few months...will buy the party more time to agree on a long-term solution, plus postpone a politically divisive squabble just weeks before the midterm elections. But Democrats want a long-term reauthorization of five years 'minimum,' Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer, D-Md., reiterated.\" Emma Dumain in Roll Call.\n\nRepublican bill would give Obama money for Ebola, funding flexibility for child-migrant crisis. \"The Obama administration requested...an additional $88 million to help bring drugs and personnel to West African countries ravished by the outbreak. Rogers said the House proposal will match that request \u2014 bringing the total money available to fight the diseases to more than $250 million....No additional resources will be allocated to help the federal government manage a growing pool of undocumented minors from Central America, Rogers said, but the CR will give agencies 'more flexibility' to spend money already allocated.\" Lauren French in Politico.\n\nPossible wild card: Does Cruz want another shutdown? \"Enter Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), the Tea Party firebrand who helped provoke last year\u2019s 16-day government shutdown in a drive to derail Obamacare. He\u2019s at it again \u2014 this time threatening to block the continuing resolution over immigration policy. Cruz endorsed a GOP effort to attach an amendment to the CR that would block Obama\u2019s executive order deferring the deportation of...the so-called 'dreamers.'...Cruz declined to rule out opposing the stop-gap spending bill if it doesn\u2019t include language rescinding the Obama administration\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\" Eric Pianin in The Fiscal Times.\n\nData on $800B in stimulus spending will soon disappear. \"It\u2019s not because the Web site is going away....It\u2019s because of a far more strange \u2014 and complicated \u2014 reason that, some say, exposes a larger problem that could have even greater implications for the billions the government spends. The data will disappear from the site because the government board that oversees the Web site and ensures the stimulus money is spent properly is not renewing its license with Dun & Bradstreet, a major U.S. financial firm that assigns an identification number to all entities doing business with the federal government. When the license expires at the end of this month, those identification numbers \u2014 and other associated data \u2014 will no longer be available to the government.\" Christian Davenport in The Washington Post.\n\nCorporate tax inversion: Two new developments make a deal more likely. \"A top Senate Democrat, Charles Schumer, said on Tuesday that he will offer legislation to restrict inversions, and would agree to allow it to lapse after three years. That would give Democrats one of their top priorities while also giving Republicans leverage to force a full-scale tax-code overhaul \u2014 one of their top priorities \u2014 in 2017, the New York lawmaker said. Meanwhile, some lawmakers also are weighing the possibility of combining anti-inversion legislation with some significant tax breaks that Republicans want, such as a permanent tax credit for business research....That could be combined with tax breaks that Democrats would like to make permanent, such as for college tuition. Those discussions are preliminary, however.\" John D. McKinnon in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nPoll: Americans back Congress addressing inversions. John D. McKinnon in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nInversion vote unlikely in September. \"'I kind of doubt it,' Reid said when asked if there would be a vote in September. When asked why not, Reid only chuckled....Congress and the Treasury Department have been exploring ways to stem the growth of inversions....Forty-seven U.S. corporations have reincorporated overseas through corporate inversions in the past 10 years, far more than during the previous 20 years combined, according to the Congressional Research Service. Secretary Jacob J. Lew said Monday...that his agency could act soon.\" Humberto Sanchez and Niels Lesniewski in Roll Call.\n\nVideo: Obama Wall Street backer Tony James downplays economic importance of corporate inversions. Zachary Warmbrodt and Jon Prior in Politico.\n\nBurger King risks customer loyalty with its Canada move. \"Consumer perception of the brand \u2014 measured by YouGov BrandIndex\u2019s Buzz score \u2014 has turned negative following an Aug. 26 announcement that Burger King is merging with Tim Hortons Inc. (THI) and shifting its base north of the border, where corporate taxes are lower. Purchase consideration, which measures the portion of consumers who might visit the chain on their next fast-food run, also has declined, the research firm said yesterday in a report. When the companies first disclosed that they were in merger talks on Aug. 24, it fueled debate over American businesses shifting to other countries in search of lower tax bills.\" Nick Turner in Bloomberg.\n\nPETRAEUS AND O'HANLON: Renewing Ex-Im Bank a no-brainer. \"Why would Congress not renew the basic charter of the Export-Import Bank...? The charter on the Ex-Im Bank is soon to expire; without action...the Congress will be dooming the bank to dissolution. It is hard to see why this arm of the government could be controversial. After all, it is essentially free; it has actually returned $2 billion more to the Treasury than it has required to cover operating costs and any bad loans over the last five years. And it helps the United States compete with 50+ other nations that have financing mechanisms for their own firms trying to do business abroad.\" David Petraeus and Michael O'Hanlon in USA Today.\n\nDE RUGY: How the Ex-Im bank hurts U.S. companies. \"In November of 2013, the Ex-Im Bank 'facilitated' the sale of Caterpillar equipment to an Australian mining group, Hancock Prospecting, for an iron-ore project called Roy Hill. Ex-Im Bank advocates claim the sale will create jobs while promoting U.S. exports. But this is only a win for the tiny percent of businesses that benefit from Ex-Im Bank subsidies. While the sale may be good for giant manufacturer Caterpillar, it will end up harming other iron ore mining companies in the United States....The Export-Import Bank is not so much 'pro-jobs' as it is 'pro-jobs for companies that have friends in Washington.' Tragically, Ex-Im Bank is too often a jobs killer for unsubsidized firms.\" Veronique de Rugy in The Detroit News.\n\nTop opinion\n\nSUNSTEIN: Americans' costly failure to refinance. \"Obviously, we can't blame banks for people\u2019s poor decisions. Yet there are many ways that banks could help to promote refinancing \u2014 for instance by making it easier or even automatic (when rates decline by a certain amount), or by providing clear, simple, accessible information. And with appropriate incentives, government policy could encourage banks to do these things. If one of our goals is to help struggling homeowners, we could do a great deal, certainly in the future but even now, by encouraging and simplifying refinancing....And the new research raises an intriguing question: In what other contexts are low take-up rates leading people to leave a lot of money on the table?\" Cass R. Sunstein in Bloomberg View.\n\nTYAGI: The right weights for mortgage risks. \"A better option would be to implement time-varying, pro-cyclical floors, forcing banks to hold more capital during housing booms. And, whereas a single, fixed floor might push banks toward riskier loans that offer higher returns for the same amount of capital, a dynamic system would allow lower floors for the lowest-risk mortgages and require higher floors for riskier loans. Moreover, while risk weight is an important macro-prudential lever, it must be used in conjunction with regulators\u2019 other tools....It is important to calibrate the impact of risk weights on housing-market cycles relative to other measures, not least because excessive and overlapping intervention could itself fuel dangerous cycles. The reliance of modern banking regulation on risk weighting is nowhere more important than in the mortgage market. If regulators get it wrong, the entire edifice could collapse \u2014 yet again.\" Amit Tyagi in Project Syndicate.\n\nHABER AND LEVINE: The Fed's too cozy relations with banks. \"The Federal Reserve was established in 1914 as independent of the president and Congress \u2014 and for good reason. The Fed's founders understood that politicians had to be blocked from using monetary policy to juice the economy before elections. Extensive research supports the wisdom of the Fed's political independence; monetary policy works best when it is insulated from the vagaries of election cycles. The problem is that while the Fed is largely independent of politicians, it is intimately connected, and even answerable, to the financial institutions that it is supposed to regulate.\" Stephen Haber and Ross Levine in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMcARDLE: Obamacare premiums are a magical mystery tour. \"What we want to know is what happens when they\u2019re actually in a competitive market. I can tell a story where the exchanges create transparency and competitive pressure that drive prices down; I can tell a story where the subsidies and various regulations drive prices even higher. I can tell a story where the insurers conclude that this market isn\u2019t worth the tsuris and leave it to Blue Cross/Blue Shield, with all sorts of fascinating results. We won\u2019t know which story is true until 2017 or beyond. So if you\u2019re planning to buy the benchmark silver plan this year, whatever it is, you can safely rejoice.\" Megan McArdle in Bloomberg View.\n\nJOHNSON: The economics of seat-reclining aren't so simple. \"Coase, however, insists that for his argument to work, transaction costs must be zero. Not low. Zero. Yet the reclined upon face substantial transaction costs. Most obviously, information problems abound, even beyond the ambiguous distribution of property rights. It would be costly to discern which type of person they might be bargaining with. Are they sitting behind an inveterate recliner and who might turn belligerent if asked not to recline, even for a price? Is the passenger in front of them a moralist who will take offense at the very suggestion of treating one another as bargaining partners rather than relying on norms of decency and respect? Other such possibilities are plentiful.\" James Johnson in The Washington Post.\n\nENGELHARD: How affordable is the ACA? \"No law is perfect, but the intensely partisan political acrimony in Congress has made it impossible to tweak the ACA to make it better. The premium assistance, cost-reduction subsidies and overall limits on healthcare spending within the ACA have benefited many low- and middle-income individuals and families and protected them from catastrophic medical bills. But for those with chronic conditions who require a greater volume of services, acquiring accessible, affordable health care in the individual market, even with the ACA subsidies, may still remain out of reach.\" Carolyn Long Engelhard in The Hill.\n\nLEE AND PARKER: America's water-infrastructure crisis. \"America was built on top of water and wastewater pipes and tunnels. And today, that foundation is crumbling right under our feet. Last year, the American Society of Civil Engineers said U.S. water and wastewater systems are close to failing. It\u2019s now estimated we\u2019ll need to spend $4.8 trillion over the next 20 years to fix these systems and maintain the country\u2019s current water service levels....Despite this, the federal government continues to ignore the problem. In fact, federal spending on water infrastructure is down more than 30 percent since fiscal year 2012....If our water infrastructure fails, how long could the American economy survive?\" Ed Lee and Annise Parker in Politico Magazine.\n\nAnimal buddies interlude: Dog waits in the operating room for his cheetah best friend.\n\n2. The U.S. is putting up infectious-disease fights on multiple fronts\n\nU.S. military\u2019s response to Ebola is hampered by lack of Ebola expertise. \"The Pentagon announced Monday that it would set up a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia to help provide medical care for health workers responding to the epidemic, prompting criticism from international aid groups and global health advocates who said the action was paltry compared with the need in the hardest-hit countries....The Defense Department has provided some equipment, supplies and staff in the region since the outbreak began months ago. But the expectation was that Obama\u2019s remarks on Sunday would produce more substantive action and that the U.S. military...could address gaps in the response quickly. But the United States does not have a workforce trained in the special protocols for Ebola, Lindborg said.\" Lena H. Sun in The Washington Post.\n\nMark your calendars: Joint Senate panel hearing on Ebola crisis on Tuesday. Elise Viebeck in The Hill.\n\nChart: Oxford study predicts 15 more countries are at risk of Ebola exposure. Abby Phillip in The Washington Post.\n\nMore U.S. aid on its way to West Africa to combat Ebola. \"The United States will spend an additional $10 million to fight Ebola in West Africa, bringing its total investment against the epidemic to more than $100 million. The new funds, announced Tuesday by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), will support the African Union's deployment of roughly 100 health workers to support exhausted medical personnel.\" Elise Viebeck in The Hill.\n\nHere's a fast about-face: House GOP cuts funding for Ebola, then restores it hours later. \"House Republicans earmarked $88 million to fight Ebola in their stopgap bill to fund the government, ultimately meeting the White House's request for additional aid. The move was a reversal from earlier in the day when Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) limited the funding to $40 million....The bill now gives an additional $30 million to the Centers for Disease Control and $58 million to a federal health emergency fund to assist in developing experimental Ebola treatments.\" Elise Viebeck in The Hill.\n\nA rare enterovirus with no vaccine is vexing several Midwestern states. \"A rare virus is sweeping the Midwest, landing dozens of children in the hospital with breathing difficulties. Illnesses are often linked to the beginning of a school year, as close contact and cooler weather facilitate the sharing of germs among children. Health authorities say the virus emerging in the middle of the country is more severe than a typical illness, and is particularly hard on children who have asthma or previous respiratory troubles....Researchers aren\u2019t exactly sure how easily or often the virus spreads since it hasn\u2019t been studied extensively....The agency is still trying to determine how big the outbreak is and how long it will persist.\" Michelle Fay Cortez in Bloomberg.\n\nExplainer: What exactly is Enterovirus 68? Abby Phillip in The Washington Post.\n\nAs for diseases for which there is a vaccine: Measles cases near 600 in U.S. \"Measles cases are on the rise in the U.S. this year, 14 years after national leaders declared that the disease had been eliminated within the country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed many of the 592 measles cases and 18 outbreaks in the U.S. this year to parents not getting their children vaccinated....The majority of the 592 measles cases involved people who weren\u2019t vaccinated against the disease, which is a highly contagious virus....The disease is rare in the U.S. because most children are vaccinated. The 18 outbreaks reported to the CDC represent 89 percent of all cases in the U.S. this year.\" Howard Koplowitz in International Business Times.\n\nU.S. grapples with growing chikungunya problem. \"In the United States, more than 750 cases of another painful disease, chikungunya, have been reported this year. Almost all have been in tourists returning from the Caribbean, where the disease is rampant, particularly in the Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Martinique and Puerto Rico. Nine million Americans visit the Caribbean each year. But Florida residents who had not traveled were infected this summer, and the virus was found in a Texas mosquito, meaning that it is becoming established in the United States. Chikungunya was unknown in the Western Hemisphere until late last year.\" Donald G. McNeil Jr. in The New York Times.\n\nOther health care reads:\n\nPolitically, Obamacare isn't about health care.

Louise Radnofsky in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nTILL: A way to stop Ebola in its tracks? \"Last week, as experts assembled at the World Health Organization headquarters...there was a glaring absence in the public discourse: an accurate assessment of the U.S. government\u2019s capacity to produce ZMapp, one of the experimental drugs under discussion for speeded approval....The world\u2019s supply is currently exhausted, and production of even several dozen additional doses of the drug remains months away. But the U.S. government could in fact produce an extraordinary amount of the drug in a relatively short timeframe. A Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program, launched in 2006...wildly accelerated the rate at which vaccines and monoclonal antibodies like ZMapp can be produced.\" Brian Till in The New Republic.\n\nDancing interlude: Watch this boy tear up the dance floor.\n\n3. Some positive data on the job market amid global economic worries\n\nHiring reaches highest level since December 2007. \"Employers hired some 4.9 million workers in July...the Labor Department said Tuesday. Employers reported 4.7 million openings in July, roughly the same as in June, which was at a 13-year high. In July, there were around 2.1 unemployed workers for every job opening, up slightly from two in June, but down from...nearly 6.5 unemployed workers for every opening at the depth of the recession in 2009....Tuesday\u2019s report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, offers the latest sign of how job markets have firmed up more than five years after the official end of the 2007-09 recession.\" Nick Timiraos in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nJob openings, quits register on Yellen's labor dashboard. \"The upswing in openings and a six-year high in the number of people voluntarily leaving their jobs, a sign of Americans\u2019 confidence in finding other work...will probably keep central bankers on the path toward reducing stimulus while holding the line on interest rates....JOLTS, adds context to monthly payrolls figures by measuring dynamics such as resignations, help-wanted ads and the pace of hiring. Although it lags the Labor Department\u2019s other jobs data by a month, Yellen follows the report as a measure of labor-market tightness and worker confidence.\" Victoria Stilwell in Bloomberg.\n\nBut consumers still aren't spending, feel squeeze of health care and housing. \"After climbing by 3.5% in 2012, overall spending fell 0.7% last year. Spending dropped 7.6% on apparel and by 4.7% on entertainment....Meanwhile, spending continued to increase for health care and housing. Housing was the only major category to increase more quickly in 2013 than in 2012. The data paint a grim picture of the health of the American consumer, with the average 'consumer unit'...reporting less income in 2013 than 2012. The data also add to evidence that many Americans are being squeezed by rising costs of health care and housing.\" Josh Zumbrun in The Wall Street Journal.\n\nGlobal jobs crisis with no easy solution awaits us, World Bank says. \"The Bank said an extra 600 million jobs needed to be created worldwide by 2030 just to cope with the expanding population. 'There's little doubt there is a global jobs crisis,' said the World Bank's senior director for jobs, Nigel Twose....'And equally disturbingly, we're also seeing wage and income inequality widening within many G20 countries, although progress has been made in a few emerging economies, like Brazil and South Africa.' He said that overall emerging market economies had done better than advanced G20 countries in job creation, driven primarily by countries such as China and Brazil, but the outlook was bleak.\" Agence France-Press.\n\nCitizens' economic malaise appears to echo those countries' performances in job creation. \"The Pew Research Center found that 60 percent say their own country's economy is performing poorly. Dissatisfaction runs highest in the world's most advanced economies, where 64 percent say conditions are bad. In the United States, 58 percent give the American economy poor marks. The deepest despair was recorded in countries hit hardest by the European debt crisis....There are exceptions to the pervasive gloom: 89 percent of Chinese are positive about their country's economy, even though it's slowed markedly....In Vietnam, 87 percent of respondents gave the economy high marks. In Germany, 85 percent did.\" Paul Wiseman in the Associated Press.\n\nExplainer: 10 takeaways from the new Pew survey, from Greek pessimism to Chinese jubilance.

What's at stake in the next round of climate negotiations\n\nCO2 levels in atmosphere rising at dramatically faster rate. \"Levels of heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rose at a record-shattering pace last year, a new report shows, a surge that surprised scientists and spurred fears of an accelerated warming of the planet in decades to come. Concentrations of nearly all the major greenhouse gases reached historic highs in 2013, reflecting ever-rising emissions from automobiles and smokestacks but also, scientists believe, a diminishing ability of the world\u2019s oceans and plant life to soak up the excess carbon put into the atmosphere by humans, according to data released early Tuesday by the United Nations\u2019 meteorological advisory body.\" Joby Warrick in The Washington Post.\n\nAs oceans suck up some of that CO2, ecosystems and fisheries may suffer. \"One change the new report looks at in depth is ocean acidification....No matter how it\u2019s calculated, oceans are keeping a substantial chunk of CO2 out of the atmosphere. However, that\u2019s coming with the price of ocean acidification. The report says ocean acidification is happening at a rate unheard of in at least 300 million years, and just as alarming, that rate is projected to accelerate until at least mid-century. Acidification has wide-ranging consequences including wreaking havoc on coral reef ecosystems, weakening the shells of shellfish, negatively affecting fisheries and generally altering the ocean food chain.\" Brian Kahn in Climate Central.\n\nPwC report says world losing ground on decarbonizing energy supply. \"Almost 200 countries agreed at United Nations climate talks to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times to limit heat waves, floods, storms and rising seas from climate change. Temperatures have already risen by about 0.85 degrees Celsius. Carbon intensity will have to be cut by 6.2 percent a year to achieve that goal, the study said. That compares with an annual rate of 1.2 percent from 2012 to 2013. Grant said that to achieve the 6.2 percent annual cut would \u200erequire changes of an even greater magnitude than those achieved by recent major shifts in energy production in some countries.\" Ben Garside in Reuters.\n\nWorld Bank to expand plan to rescue emission projects. \"The World Bank seeks to expand a plan to buy emission credits from projects including those that capture heat-trapping gas at garbage dumps, underpinning demand in the carbon markets for the first time in nine years. The proposal would initially use options to help spur about $100 million in government donations to a World Bank methane-reducing facility....The program is designed to create more reductions for each dollar spent because only projects offering to cut emissions for the lowest prices would win access to its money....The bank and the U.S. State Department are among those working to expand the planned program....The U.S. has backed the initiative since its G8 presidency in 2012.\" Mathew Carr in Bloomberg.\n\nMap: How climate change could put hundreds of bird species at risk.

How will Congress treat police militarization?\n\nPolice militarization gets the bipartisan treatment. \"The police response in Ferguson has stoked a national conversation about the type of equipment and training local police officers in the U.S. receive....The Pentagon is allowed to give surplus equipment to local police departments free of charge. Other federal agencies, such as the Homeland Security and Justice departments, give grants to local police forces to buy equipment. Those grants are, on the whole, given without any request for accountability. Although the Pentagon denies that any of its tactical equipment was used in the police force's response to the Ferguson protests, the so-called 1033 program has nonetheless come under lawmakers' scrutiny. And it's giving Democrats a reason to team up with fiscally conservative Republicans.\" Emma Roller in National Journal.\n\nPrograms might not be cut, but changes may be on the way. \"The federal agencies that provide the arms defended the programs, citing the usefulness of the equipment in supporting local law enforcement and for first responders in natural disasters....Agency representatives also emphasized that state officials are responsible for determining whether the equipment is necessary and how it is used....McCaskill gave no sign that lawmakers intended to cut the programs but said after the hearing that improved community policing programs and more training about how to use the equipment might better serve the towns and cities where it is sent.\" Marianne Levine in the Los Angeles Times.\n\nHow many police shootings happen each year? No one knows. \"A summer of high-profile police shootings, most notably the Aug. 9 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., has rekindled a decades-long debate over law enforcement\u2019s use of lethal force. Police unions and some law-and-order conservatives insist that shootings by officers are rare and even more rarely unjustified. Civil rights groups and some on the left have just as quickly prescribed racial motives to the shootings, declaring that black and brown men are being 'executed' by officers. And, like all previous incarnations of the clash over police force, the debate remains absent access to a crucial, fundamental fact.\" Wesley Lowery in The Washington Post.\n\nPoll: Huge racial gap in views of police.
