These images are transmitted via a Cloud-based server to Dr. Yogita Thakur, who reviews them from her office at Ravenswood Family Dentistry in East Palo Alto, 6 miles away.\n\n\u201cThis is how we reach children in areas where dental care is usually limited,\u201d Thakur said.\n\nThis process, called telehealth, allows dentists to diagnose, treat and educate patients remotely, rather than in person. The primary aim is to bolster preventive care, but if the dentist sees that significant work is required, such as a root canal or crown, an in-person appointment can be scheduled.\n\nThe need for such innovation seems readily apparent.\n\n\u201cMost people in our society are not getting dental care,\u201d said Dr. Paul Glassman, director of the Pacific Center for Special Care at the University of the Pacific School of Dentistry.\n\nDespite dental problems being the No. 1 chronic disease that children face, a state audit of Medi-Cal\u2019s dental program last year found that less than half of the 5.1 million children enrolled in the federal-state health plan for the poor were receiving care.\n\nWith the goal of changing that statistic, a law that went into effect this year requires Medi-Cal providers to be reimbursed for dental services provided through telehealth.\n\nBut as of July, only seven dentists in the state had billed the dental arm of Medi-Cal, called Denti-Cal, for teledentistry services.\n\nA number of factors may be contributing to the law\u2019s ineffectiveness, but few doubt that the key reason is Medi-Cal\u2019s remarkably low reimbursement rates.\n\nA report released by the Department of Health Care Services in July showed that Denti-Cal reimbursements are less than one-third of the national average paid by commercial insurance.\n\nSome providers have stopped accepting new Denti-Cal patients altogether.\n\n\u201cIncreasing reimbursement rates so they are sufficient to cover the cost of care is important to ensuring providers can participate in the Denti-Cal program, and that applies to whatever delivery model is used,\u201d said Alicia Malaby, a spokeswoman for the California Dental Association (CDA).\n\nIn addition to the question of payment, providers may be wary of using teledentistry simply because \u201cit\u2019s a very different style of providing dental services,\u201d Glassman said.\n\nSome dentists worry that teledentistry will lead to increased competition for patients, but \u201cit\u2019s actually a way of expanding dental practice,\u201d he said.\n\nGlassman began developing a teledentistry model of care, called the Virtual Dental Home (VDH), 10 years ago.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to figure out how to get to where the vulnerable populations are,\u201d Glassman said.\n\nA six-year pilot project demonstrated that virtual dental care could not only work, but reduce the cost of care as well.\n\n\u2018Getting the word out on this is going to be top priority.\u2019\n\nCarmela Castellano-Garcia, California Primary Care Association\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tested (the VDH model) in a number of different areas and populations. Head Start schools, Early Head Start, adults in residential care, low-income community centers, all the way up to nursing homes,\u201d Glassman said.\n\nThese populations are some of the estimated 30 percent of Californians (about 11 million people) who face barriers to dental care.\n\nOne of the benefits of the VDH model is \u201cits ability to facilitate patients\u2019 access to the full dental team and comprehensive dental care,\u201d Malaby said.\n\n\u201cI can sense the hesitancy because it\u2019s so new,\u201d Thakur said. \u201cProviders think, \u2018I did not really see and touch the patient, so how can I make a recommendation for their care?\u2019 \u201d\n\nGlassman understands the reluctance.\n\n\u201cI often joke when I\u2019m speaking to dental hygienists, \u2018How many of you remember the class you took on telehealth in dental school?\u2019 \u201d Glassman said. \u201cBecause of course, there\u2019s no such class.\u201d\n\nProviders need information and training to feel comfortable with teledentistry, said Carmela Castellano-Garcia, CEO of the California Primary Care Association (CPCA).\n\n\u201cGetting the word out on this is going to be top priority,\u201d Castellano-Garcia said.\n\nThe CPCA is working with California\u2019s new dental director, Dr. Jayanth Kumar, to provide new training programs.\n\nSecuring funding for teledentistry models is another challenge.\n\nThe CDA is co-sponsoring AB648, which would provide funding for implementing the Virtual Dental Home in new areas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a long process,\u201d Castellano-Garcia said. \u201cBut ultimately, this is going to expand dental care in the state.\u201d\n\nAt Ravenswood, the dental team wants to continue using the VDH model to reach low-income children as early as possible. About 80 percent of pediatric dental disease is found in low-income populations, Thakur said.\n\n\u201cThe idea here is to prevent dental disease from ever happening.\u201d\n\nHellesen writes for the California HealthCare Foundation Center for Health Reporting at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just 7 dentists are signed up in innovative program to expand care to millions of low-income children.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Teledentistry Could Boost Access to California's Poor Kids But Is Little Used.
