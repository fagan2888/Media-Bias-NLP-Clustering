That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with respect to the chronic disease issue. I have to think both political parties missed that during the Affordable Care Act debate.\u201dThe potential bipartisan action is all the more remarkable given that some of the proposed initiatives involve improvements or expansions of programs created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), usually the opposite of an area for bipartisan legislating.Perhaps working in the committee\u2019s favor is that it is dealing with little-known parts of the Affordable Care Act dealing with reforming Medicare\u2019s payment system to reward quality health outcomes rather than simply the number of health services provided. Those programs have been much less controversial than aspects of the health law like the individual mandate.Sen.(R-Ga.), one of the leaders of the chronic care effort, said the fact that some of the proposals deal with Affordable Care Act initiatives \u201chasn\u2019t had any impact so far. I don\u2019t see why it would.\u201dThe Finance Committee\u2019s working group in December released a document with a range of options to consider for making Medicare\u2019s coverage of chronic conditions smarter.One proposal would expand the ACA\u2019s \u201cIndependence at Home\u201d pilot project, where Medicare gives financial incentives to teams of doctors to provide coordinated care for a patient at home, with the intention of saving money while improving care.Other ideas seek to improve ObamaCare\u2019s Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), which are groups of doctors that come together to coordinate care and get financially rewarded through Medicare if they lower costs while hitting quality benchmarks.Another set of proposals would encourage the use of telehealth\u2014using technology to provide care remotely.\u201cWe know that better care coordination provides better quality care at a less costly price,\u201d said Sen.(D-Va.), who is leading the effort along with Isakson, Wyden and Hatch.The goal is to \u201cbring Medicare into the 21st century,\u201d he said.Still, there is more work to be done. The committee will be reviewing hundreds of comments from stakeholders and industry in working to turn the list of ideas into an actual legislative document.Changes to Medicare\u2019s payment system can have high stakes for industry. Comments from the Federation of American Hospitals, for example, stressed that payments need to be high enough to cover the cost of transitioning to new systems of care.The American Health Care Association, the nursing home trade group, commented that it is \u201cconcerned about the number and pace of changes\u201d in payment system innovations.Hatch has made clear that the bill cannot add to the deficit, so working with the Congressional Budget Office to make sure the programs that save money outweigh those that cost money is an important step.\u201cFinding real solutions to something as complex and important as chronic care is a challenging task,\u201d Hatch said when the committee's options document was released in December. \u201c[W]hile there are no easy answers, I remain committed to finding budget neutral solutions that will provide better care for patients.\u201d\n\nThis article is a part of the From Volume to Value series sponsored by Astellas.
