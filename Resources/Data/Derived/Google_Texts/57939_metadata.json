Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,\u201d Robertson said in an interview with GQ. He went on to add that he thinks being gay is illogical because, well, \u201cIt seems like, to me, a vagina\u2014as a man\u2014would be more desirable than a man\u2019s anus.\u201d\n\nCue the outrage by gay advocacy groups. Cue the announcement of an indefinite suspension by A&E, the network that produces Duck Dynasty. Cue conservative charges of anti-Christian intolerance. So predictable.\n\nBut Robertson\u2019s comments aren\u2019t all that shocking. A broad swath of Americans\u2014about 45 percent, according to Pew Research\u2014agree with Robertson that homosexual behavior is \u201csin,\u201d though they might not have expressed their beliefs in such a brash way. This is especially true of religious Americans, including a large number of Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Mormons, and Muslims.\n\nPhil Robertson's comments may be ignorant, offensive, or ineloquent. But they are not all that shocking.\n\nThe presumably informed readers of GQ must be aware that such beliefs exist, and it\u2019s hard to believe they are \u201cshocked\u201d when an outspoken conservative Christian like Phil Robertson espouses them. His comments may be ignorant, offensive, or ineloquent. But they are not all that shocking.\n\nWhat is shocking are Robertson\u2019s comments about race in the same interview. Buried under the firestorm of media and public outrage over Robertson\u2019s comments on sexuality is his stunning insinuation that blacks were quite happy in the Jim Crow South:\n\nI never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I\u2019m with the blacks, because we\u2019re white trash. We\u2019re going across the field .... They\u2019re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, \u2018I tell you what: These doggone white people\u2019\u2014not a word! ... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.\n\nNow here is something that\u2019s truly surprising. His recollection is oddly reminiscent of the Song of the South vision of the past, long since abandoned by even fringe historians. I\u2019m reminded of a talk titled \u201cThe danger of a single story\u201d that Chimamanda Adichie gave at TEDx in Oxford, England. There is never only a single story about a place or a people that tells the whole truth, she argues. The truth emerges upon hearing many stories, and one story taken alone is at least a partial falsehood.", "article_metadata": {"description": "His comments about gays are offensive, but his vision of the Jim Crow South is shocking\u2014and his conservative defenders and liberal assailants are mostly ignoring it.", "author": "Jonathan Merritt", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "His comments about gays are offensive, but his vision of the Jim Crow South is shocking\u2014and his conservative defenders and liberal assailants are mostly ignoring it.", "title": "The Real Duck Dynasty Scandal: Phil Robertson's Comments on Race", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/dd_01252012_zd_0400/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/the-real-em-duck-dynasty-em-scandal-phil-robertsons-comments-on-race/282538/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f21\"", "article_summary": "What is shocking are Robertson\u2019s comments about race in the same interview.\nPhil Robertson's comments may be ignorant, offensive, or ineloquent.\nBut Robertson\u2019s comments aren\u2019t all that shocking.\nBestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,\u201d Robertson said in an interview with GQ.\nCue the announcement of an indefinite suspension by A&E, the network that produces Duck Dynasty."}
