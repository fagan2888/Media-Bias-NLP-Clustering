She is the host of the Katie Halper Show on WBA1, writes for places like The Nation, Feministing, Jezebel and appears on places like MSNBC, RT, Sirius radio (which hung up on her once). Katie's had her photo taken with Rudy Giuliani and was called \"cute and somewhat brainy\" by the National Review.\n\nimages via wikipedia\n\nIn an age of terrible, hyperbolic, trivializing analogies, it takes a special one to really stand out. Here are the best, or worst, examples of terrible comparisons from the week.\n\nBlack people\u2026 they\u2019re just like zoo animals. Benjamin Cole, a top advisor to Rep. Aaron Schock (R-IL) wrote the following about two Black people he saw outside of his Washington DC apartment: \u201cSo apparently the closing of the National Zoo has forced the animals to conduct their mating rituals on my street.\u201d Cole, the former Baptist pastor and energy industry spokesman is not just a brilliant anthropologist/ zoologist/ racist, but a sharp political aid, because he posted these thoughts on Facebook. See other racist gems from Cole, here. Shock accepted Cole\u2019s resignation on Thursday. So, we are now back to living in that post-racial world in which Rosa Parks ended racism and the President is Black.\n\nObamacare\u2026 it\u2019s just like the Holocaust. Of course there was an Obamacare-Holocaust comparison because, it\u2019s a week day. Michael Greve, a law professor and activist, is also the former head and a current board member of the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). The CEI is \u201ccoordinating and funding\u201d a case pending before the Supreme Court, which seeks to undo the Affordable Health Care Act. This week, Greve compared America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), which is participating in the Affordable Health Care Act, to the Nazis:\n\nBy helping the ACA over the hurdle, AHIP signed its corporate members\u2019 death warrant in exchange for the individual mandate, risk corridors, and a few other placebos. AHIP had the railroad cars to the camps neatly lined up.\n\nVaccine deniers\u2026 they\u2019re just like Galileo. Glenn Beck isn\u2019t known for his intellectual coherence but this still stands out for how inane it is. First, Beck explained how even though we have know idea about the link between autism and vaccines (even though science has debunked the alleged link):\n\nWe also don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with autism\u2026 If you happen to be a parent and you say, you know, \u2018I\u2019m sorry. God gave me a brain, God gave me personal choice and responsibility for those choices, I\u2019m going to say no to those vaccines because I\u2019ve done my homework. Nobody that hasn\u2019t done their homework says no to vaccines.\n\nThen, after mocking science and praising the those who believe in God over science, Beck somehow manages to compare the science deniers to Galileo. You know\u2026 Galileo the Italian SCIENTIST who was charged with heresy, placed under house arrest and had his writing banned for challenging the Church\u2019s claim that the sun rotated around the earth:\n\nWhere is anybody saying, \u2018My gosh, we\u2019re living in the days of Galileo\u2026 The Church has become the state, and if you don\u2019t practice their religion exactly the way they tell you to practice it, you\u2019re done. How many people have lost their jobs, have lost their credibility?\n\nMarriage equality\u2026 it\u2019s just like bacon-wrapped shrimp in Jewish delis. During an interview with CNN on Sunday, Mike Huckabee defended his opposition to marriage equality and encouraged the GOP to remain as un-evolved as he is on the issue:\n\nAnd as a biblical issue, unless I get a new version of the scriptures, it\u2019s really not my place to say, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m just going to evolve.\u2019\u2026. It\u2019s like asking somebody who\u2019s Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli. We don\u2019t want to do that.\n\nBut Huckabee has some gay friends. So, it\u2019s cool.\n\nThere actually is an analogy to be made between accepting same-sex marriage and serving bacon-wrapped shrimp. Find out what it is on this week\u2019s Morning Jew, where Heather Gold and I(Katie Halper)!
