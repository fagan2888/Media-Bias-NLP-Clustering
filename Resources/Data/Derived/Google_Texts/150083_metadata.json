I always look forward to breaking in a virgin town. I don\u2019t venture out much. I'm not a guy with a lot of interests who likes to go out and explore the local flavor. I don\u2019t know what I'm missing in Mobile\u2026maybe some Katrina wreckage. Tragedy is always interesting. But I couldn't give less of a darn about local barbecue.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: Why is this tour called \"The Last Gasp\"?\n\nA: It\u2019s just, after so many years of doing this that\u2019s always how you feel. Like Jesus Christ, am I still on the darn road?\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: You are known for being a defiant smoker. What would it take to make you quit?\n\nA: I kind of have quit. After the Super Bowl, I put myself into a rehab of my own making to quit smoking. I just stayed at home without any cigarettes. If you don\u2019t have cigarettes, you can\u2019t smoke. It\u2019s that easy. I've been cheating before and after shows, but I've cut down about 90 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: How long have you been a smoker?\n\nA: Thirty-some years, since 1980.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What convinced you it was finally time to stop?\n\nA: My wheezing would wake me up. It\u2019s almost like a darn train whistle. I couldn\u2019t get through a podcast without pausing to hack up wet phlegm flubber.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: You complain about Millennials quite frequently. Why do they annoy you so much?\n\nA: This generation sucks. They\u2019re soft. It\u2019s a really tepid, weak, boring generation. When you look at Justin Bieber getting into all this trouble. Like he\u2019s a troublemaker. He\u2019s not throwing TV sets out of hotel windows. Oh yeah, he got drunk and he sped. He got caught spray painting something. That\u2019s the out of control guy.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: Amy Winehouse wasn't hardcore enough for you?\n\nA: She\u2019s not ours though. They still get down across the pond in the UK. They still do real drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What are your feelings on the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare?\n\nA: I don\u2019t give a darn. I don\u2019t go to hospitals. I don\u2019t get check ups. That\u2019s just asking for trouble. If I had promised my girlfriend I\u2019d go to wine country with her parents, and then I thought, 'oh darn why did I say that?', I might go to a doctor hoping to have something wrong with me. I\u2019m sure with the lifestyle I've led, if I went to a doctor, they\u2019d find something.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: What do you think about everyone being required to have health insurance?\n\nA: I think it\u2019s (bogus);same as car insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ:What if you got in a wreck and the other driver didn't have insurance?\n\nA: Then they'll be working for me for the rest of their life.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: Do you have any tour rituals?\n\nA: We hit thrift stores in every town we go to, as many as we can. I have a fondness for 70s over-the-top Rodney Dangerfield in \"Caddyshack\" kind of clothes. My tour manager will start pulling thrift stores up on the phone as soon as we hit our first exit and we\u2019ll tool all over,hitting the Goodwills, etc, etc. Sushi and thrift stores, those are two things we look for in a town.\n\n\n\n\n\nQ: Sushi? You really have turned over a healthy new lifestyle leaf.\n\nA: Just from quitting smoking, I've already gained 10 or 12 pounds, so I\u2019m trying to eat healthier. We got a NutraBuliit and I'm eating my veggies and fruits mixed into smoothies everyday. I almost never do drugs anymore. I don\u2019t hang out after shows, because when you try to go out it\u2019s just an endless series of pictures. You can\u2019t even talk to people anymore. They just want another picture with another friend. And then they say oh that didn\u2019t come out quite right... I\u2019ll sit and have a beer with you, but I'm not here just to pose for pictures.\n\nFor more about Doug Stanhope, visit http://www.dougstanhope.com/\n\n\n\n\n\nStanhope in action.
