Former House Speaker, local businessman and community leader Allan Bense is in the hospital.

Friends and family confirm that Bense was admitted to Shands Hospital in Gainesville Monday.

Bense had a serious bout with pancreatic disease a few years ago.

No word if this hospitalization is related to that same illness or something else.

Bense served in the Florida House of Representatives from 1998 through 2006.

He was house speaker for the 2005 and 2006 sessions.

He is currently the chairman of the Board of Trustees for Florida State University and sits on the boards of a number of other major corporations and charitable organizations.

Monday afternoon his son-in-law, current house Speaker Will Weatherford issued a statement saying "Bense is recovering at Shands. His family is grateful for the care he's receiving and the prayers he's receiving but they also hope the public respect the family's privacy as Bense makes an expected full recovery."
