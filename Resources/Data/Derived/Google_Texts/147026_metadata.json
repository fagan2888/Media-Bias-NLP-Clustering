The grand total: approximately 2 1/2 years.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nInvestigators later put dollar amounts on his crimes: $437,901 in fraudulent retention bonuses, $58,127 for the \u201cD.O. Oversight\u201d absences, $8,000 for the parking spot, and so on. Altogether, he cost taxpayers $886,186.\n\n\nBeale\u2019s most recent manager at the EPA was Gina McCarthy, then the assistant administrator in the Office of Air and Radiation. She told the inspector general that she had \u201cconcerns\u201d about Beale\u2019s claim to be secretly working for the CIA, but there is no evidence she ever acted on those concerns, according to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n#page#The consequence for McCarthy was a promotion; President Obama nominated her to head the EPA in March and she was confirmed in July.\n\nThe waste, mismanagement, and unaccountability is usually a bit more mundane. The inspector general of the Department of the Interior, having recently completed a review of how the Bureau of Indian Affairs leases office space, found issues with every lease it reviewed, 14 in all. The report concluded that the BIA is overspending and renting office spaces larger and more expensive than federal rules permit, costing taxpayers $32 million.\n\nOther examples of waste, fraud, and utterly miserable performance abound:#ad#\n\nAt the U.S. Postal Service, a former facilities project manager pleads guilty to accepting bribes to steer inflated construction contracts, costing the USPS $982,064.\n\nThis week the Center for Effective Government released a report showing that in 2012 the U.S. State Department responded to only 1 percent of FOIA requests within the 20 days required by law.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy announces it will need two years to prepare to clean up a nuclear-waste storage tank that is leaking. The department first confirmed that the tank was leaking in October 2012.\n\nScrutiny of the General Services Administration\u2019s infamous 2010 conference in Las Vegas didn\u2019t change much. The inspector general of the Department of Commerce concluded that the National Institute of Standards and Technology conference in Orlando in 2012 incurred a number of \u201cavoidable costs\u201d that pushed up the $1.1 million price tag for the event.\n\nThe Department of Labor paid for the Washington Nationals\u2019 mascot to welcome workers back after sequestration.\n\nDefenders of the federal workforce will be quick to point out that most of these cases were uncovered, investigated, and, in most instances, punished by the offices of the inspector general at the various federal agencies. They were, but only after fortunes were spent and wasted. As Joseph E. Schmitz, former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Defense, observes, some of the watchdogs mandated by Congress simply are not in place. Since Obama took office, the Departments of Labor, Interior, Defense, and Homeland Security, and the Agency for International Development,\u00a0have gone years without an inspector general nominated by the president confirmed by the Senate.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, every scandal generates a new round of guidelines and calls for better employee training, as if new federal employees needed to be instructed to follow the rules on acquisitions, not commit fraud, and not tell their bosses that they\u2019re unavailable to come in to work because they\u2019re secretly working for the CIA. The managers of the worst offenders rarely if ever are held accountable, and, as we\u2019ve seen, apparently no scandal is sufficient to warrant firing a cabinet secretary. If Sebelius escaped consequence for failure, why should anyone below her worry, or anyone in any other branch of the federal bureaucracy?\n\nMembers of the Obama administration judge the federal bureaucracy the way they want the electorate to judge them: by their good intentions, not their actual results.\n\n\u2014 Jim Geraghty writes the Campaign Spot on NRO. His first novel, a comic satire of the federal bureaucracy entitled The Weed Agency, will be published by Crown Forum in June.", "card": "summary", "title": "Why Liberals Can\u2019t Govern, by Jim Geraghty, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Wed, 2014-03-12 03:00", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "Why Liberals Can\u2019t Govern", "keywords": "Jim Geraghty", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "Why Liberals Can\u2019t Govern, Jim Geraghty, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Jim Geraghty, Politics, Nation, World"}, "article_summary": "The inspector general of the Department of the Interior, having recently completed a review of how the Bureau of Indian Affairs leases office space, found issues with every lease it reviewed, 14 in all.\n\u201cBecause of where he sat in the organizational structure, there were no questions,\u201d [Office of the Inspector General special agent Mark] Kaminsky says.\nOn February 21, CGI Federal signed a $4.87 million contract extension that will ensure it works on the site at least through March 31.\nAs Joseph E.
