"The beauty of the sharing lifestyle is that it is financially sustainable, it builds confidence and community through human interaction and human kindness, and in many ways it benefits the environment through reduced waste,” Jonathan Gillon, co-founder and CEO of Roost, told The Fiscal Times. Roost is a website that allows you to share storage and parking space.

While many of these startups, most of which are still in the initial stages of development, may not survive or make it big, there’s nevertheless a lot of potential for both consumers and businesses because, after all, there’s no limit to what can be shared. And electronic payments make the process largely hassle free.
