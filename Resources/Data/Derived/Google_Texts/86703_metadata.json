Like the days of old, simple bacterial infections have become a cause for worry due to antibiotic resistance. Vice on HBO recently traveled alongside some of the health care professionals at the forefront of the battle against antibiotic resistance to find out about what the future holds for multi-drug resistant infections.\n\n\u201cThe last hope for the human race\u2019s survival, I believe, is in the rainforests of tropical Asia,\u201d said ethnopharmacologist Dr. Christophe Wiart. \u201cThe pharmaceutical wealth of this land is immense.\u201d\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, a post-antibiotic era is one in which common infections and minor injuries can kill. Antibiotic resistance compromises the prevention and treatment of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses, and fungi.\n\n\u201cA jungle is not a peaceful environment,\u201d Wiart added. \u201cTree fights with trees. Trees fight with insects. They all fight and communicate and they use chemicals and we are looking for those chemicals. But we have no time. What would happen if we\u2019ve got major pandemics? Millions of deaths. This is no joke. It is now or never.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "post, antibiotic, world, vice, travels, doctors, looking, solution, antibiotic, resistance", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Vice on HBO follows doctors looking for a solution to the new post-antibiotic world.", "title": "Meet The Doctors Looking For A Solution To Antibiotic-Resistance [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/post-antibiotic-world-vice-travels-doctors-looking-solution-antibiotic-resistance-329514", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/16/post-antibiotic-world-vice-travels-doctors-looking-solution-antibiotic-resistance.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vice on HBO follows doctors looking for a solution to the new post-antibiotic world.", "title": "Meet The Doctors Looking For A Solution To Antibiotic-Resistance [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/post-antibiotic-world-vice-travels-doctors-looking-solution-antibiotic-resistance-329514", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/04/16/post-antibiotic-world-vice-travels-doctors-looking-solution-antibiotic-resistance.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/16/post-antibiotic-world-vice-travels-doctors-looking-solution-antibiotic-resistance.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-16T11:16:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T11:16:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Vice on HBO follows doctors looking for a solution to the new post-antibiotic world."}, "article_summary": "The new post-antibiotic world threatens to uproot centuries of work in the field of medicine.\nLike the days of old, simple bacterial infections have become a cause for worry due to antibiotic resistance.\nAntibiotic resistance compromises the prevention and treatment of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses, and fungi.\nTrees fight with insects.\n\u201cThe pharmaceutical wealth of this land is immense.\u201dAccording to the World Health Organization, a post-antibiotic era is one in which common infections and minor injuries can kill."}
