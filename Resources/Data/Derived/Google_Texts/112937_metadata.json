I\u2019d seen the ads in the back of the Village Voice \u2014 where the bands had odd interesting names like Blondie, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Suicide \u2014 and headed down to the Bowery to see what was going on at this place CBGB\u2019s (nobody called it CBGB). I remember standing out on the Bowery \u2014 this club in the middle of nowhere \u2014 then walking under the awning and paying my $2 to the cute girl at the front desk. The first band I saw was Television. and I could tell from their sound that they must be Velvet Underground fans \u2014 interesting. Then after they went off, I heard the juke box, saw the pinball machine, got a cheap beer and stuck around for 3 years.\n\nWhen I initially went to CBGB\u2019s, it wasn\u2019t with the intention of taking photographs. I was just looking to hear some good music. But after hanging out there for a few days, I started to think that this would be a very cool place to try something I\u2019d already been thinking about \u2014 photographing by available light at night. So I took my Leica camera, and pushed the Tri-X film like crazy, until I could take pictures of people lit up by the street lights on the Bowery. Not just the people in bands, but everyone \u2013 artists, filmmakers, waitresses, bartenders, managers, friends.\n\nI was going to document this scene like Brassai documented Paris in the 1930s.\n\n(click images to view full-size)\n\nTalking Heads, 1977\n\nThis was their first weekend as a foursome at CBGB\u2019s, after adding Jerry Harrison, before they started recording the LP \u201cTalking Heads: 77.\u201d\n\nPatti Smith, Bowery 1976\n\nPatti lit up by the Bowery streetlights. I tapped her on the shoulder, asked if I could do a picture, took two shots and everyone went back to what they were doing. 1/4 second at f/5.6 no tripod.\n\nBlondie, 1977\n\nThis was taken at the Punk Magazine Benefit show. According to Chris Stein (seated, on slide guitar), they were playing \u201cLittle Red Rooster.\u201d\n\nNo Wave Punks, Bowery Summer 1978\n\nThey were sitting just like this when I walked out of CBGB\u2019s. Me: \u201cDon\u2019t move\u201d They didn\u2019t. L to R: Harold Paris, Kristian Hoffman, Diego Cortez, Anya Phillips, Lydia Lunch, James Chance, Jim Sclavunos, Bradley Field, Liz Seidman.\n\nRichard Hell + Bob Quine, 1978\n\nRichard Hell and the Voidoids, playing CBGB\u2019s in 1978, with Richard\u2019s peerless guitar player Robert Quine. Sorely missed, Quine died in 2004.\n\nBathroom, 1977\n\nThis photograph of mine was used to create the \u201creplica\u201d CBGB\u2019s bathroom in the Punk Couture show last summer at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. So I got into the Met with a bathroom photo.\n\nStiv Bators + Divine, 1978\n\nStiv Bators, Divine and the Dead Boys at the Blitz Benefit show for injured Dead Boys drummer Johnny Blitz.\n\nRamones, 1977\n\n\u201cThe kids are all hopped up and ready to go\u2026\u201d view from the unique \u201cside stage\u201d at CBGB\u2019s that you had to walk past to get to the basement bathrooms.\n\nKlaus Nomi, Christopher Parker, Jim Jarmusch \u2013 Bowery 1978\n\nJarmusch was still in film school, Parker was starring in Jim\u2019s first film \u201cPermanent Vacation\u201d and Klaus just appeared out of nowhere.\n\nHilly Kristal, Bowery 1977\n\nWhen I used to show people this picture of owner Hilly Kristal, they would ask me \u201cWhy did you photograph that guy? He\u2019s not a punk!\u201d Now they know why. None of these pictures would have existed without Hilly Kristal.\n\nDictators, Bowery 1976\n\nHandsome Dick Manitoba of the Dictators with his girlfriend Jody. I took this shot as a thank you for him returning the wallet I\u2019d lost the night before at CBGB\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t like that I tell people he returned it with everything in it.\n\nAlex Chilton, Bowery 1977\n\nWe were on the median strip on the Bowery shooting what became a 45 single sleeve for Alex\u2019s \u201cBangkok.\u201d A drop of rain landed on the camera lens by accident. Definitely a lucky night!\n\nBowery view, 1977\n\nThe view from across the Bowery in the summer of 1977.\n\nRamones, 1977 \u2013 never before printed\n\nI loved shooting The Ramones. They would play 2 sets a night, four nights a week at CBGB\u2019s, and I\u2019d be there for all of them. This shot is notable for Johnny playing a Strat, rather than his usual Mosrite. Maybe he\u2019d just broken a string. Love that hair.\n\nRichard Hell, Bowery 1977 \u2013 never before printed\n\nRichard exiting CBGB\u2019s with his guitar at 4am, about to step into a Bowery rainstorm. I\u2019ve always printed the shots of him in the rain, but this one is a real standout to me now.\n\nPatti Smith + Ronnie Spector, 1979\n\nMay 24th \u2013 Bob Dylan Birthday show \u2013 Patti \u201cinvited\u201d everyone at that night\u2019s Palladium show on 14th Street down to CBGB\u2019s to celebrate Bob Dylan\u2019s birthday. Here, Patti and Ronnie are doing \u201cBe My Baby.\u201d\n\nLegs McNeil, 1977\n\nLegs, ready for his close-up, near the front door of CBGB\u2019s.\n\nSuicide, 1977\n\nRev and Alan Vega \u2013 I thought Alan was going to hit me with that chain. This was the Punk Magazine Benefit show.\n\nIan Hunter and Fans, outside bathroom\n\nI always think of \u201cAll the Young Dudes\u201d when I look at this shot. These fans had caught Ian Hunter in the CBGB\u2019s basement outside the bathrooms, and I just stepped in to record the moment.\n\nTommy Ramone, 1977\n\nOnly at CBGB\u2019s could I have gotten this shot of Tommy Ramone seen through Johnny Ramones legs.\n\nBowery 4am, 1977\n\nEnd of the night garbage run.
