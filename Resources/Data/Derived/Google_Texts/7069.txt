Sarasota Sheriff's officials tell us a man walking on the beach with his daughter was killed when a small plane made an emergency landing on the beach Sunday afternoon.

Investigators say the pilot, 57-year-old Paul Kokomoor of Englewood, sent out a distress signal after the single-engine plane lost power just before 3 p.m.

Unable to make it to a nearby airport in Venice, Kokomoor landed the plane on Caspersen beach, not far from the edge of the water.

That's when investigators say he struck 36-year-old Ommy Irizarry and his 9-year-old daughter Oceana Irizarry. Both were visiting the area from Georgia. Oceana was flown to All Children's Hospital, where she remains in critical condition.

"When I looked a little farther, a couple feet down the beach, there was medics helping out what seemed to be the father, and he had blood on his face and they seemed to be doing CPR," described Zack Arceneaux.

The pilot and his passenger, 60-year-old David Theen, were not injured.

We are learning the victim was here to celebrate his 9th wedding anniversary. Hours before the accident, Irizarry wrote on Facebook how much he loved his wife and how excited he was to spend the next 100 years together.

Witnesses say the victim's wife saw the crash happen.

"I saw the mother also, looked to be in some sort of distress... to see that happen to her family," said one witness. "Just trying to go to the beach with your family... you never know."
