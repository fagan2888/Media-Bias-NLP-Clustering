This is the first time the Pope has made such a strong condemnation of the church\u2019s sexual abuse scandals, and has promised to penalize the offenders.\n\n\u201cI feel compelled to personally take on all the evil which some priests, quite a few in number, obviously not compared to the number of all the priests, to personally ask for forgiveness for the damage they have done for having sexually abused children,\u201d the Pope stated in front of an audience on Friday after receiving members of BICE. \u201cThe Church is aware of this damage, it is personal, moral damage carried out by men of the Church, and we will not take one step backward with regards to how we will deal with this problem, and the sanctions that must be imposed.\u201d\n\nBICE is a non-governmental organization working for the rights of children across the world. In the address directed to its members, Francis emphasized the importance of \u201cmoral and religious education of children\u201d as well as the rejection of \u201ceducational experimentation with children and young people.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most importantly, though, Francis has taken responsibility for the priests who have sexually abused thousands of children over the course of decades \u2014 at least partially. Barbara Dorris of the U.S.-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) isn\u2019t impressed by his speech. \u201cBut that is all it is: talk,\u201d she said. \u201cWe beg the world\u2019s Catholics: Be impressed by deeds, not words. Until [Francis] takes decisive action that protects kids, be skeptical and vigilant.\u201d\n\nThe Pope had previously been slightly more defensive about the Church\u2019s sexual abuse history, stating that the Church \u201cis perhaps the only public institution that has moved with transparency and responsibility\u201d in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera back in March. \u201cNo one has done more,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd yet the church is the only one that has been attacked.\u201d\n\nPope Benedict XVI, previously head of the Church, had also condemned the crimes committed by sexually-abusive priests but had done little to punish the offenders or rectify the situation. The United Nations and children\u2019s rights group worldwide have said the church tends to protect its own reputation more than it protects children from the abuses of priests. The UN urged the church to investigate the members of clergy who had molested children and open the files of those who had \u201cconcealed their crimes\u201d and Francis did create a commission to investigate these crimes. But until now, he has made few public comments about it.\n\n\u201cYou cannot interfere with children,\u201d Francis concluded in his talk with BICE. But victim groups like SNAP, Bishop Accountability, and One in Four are waiting to see if the Pope\u2019s remarks will make much difference. \u201cIf history is a guide, those complicit bishops should shudder,\u201d David Clohessy, national director of SNAP, told the Daily Beast. \u201cBut they probably won\u2019t. Hopefully [priest sex abuse] will truly be over one day, and then we can talk about forgiveness. But we aren\u2019t there yet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "catholic church, sexual abuse priests, pope francis", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Pope Francis has personally apologized for the sexual abuse carried out by Catholic priests, and asked victims for their forgiveness.", "title": "Pope Francis Asks For \u2018Forgiveness\u2019 For Sexual Abuse", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pope-francis-apologizes-sexual-abuse-asks-forgiveness-damage-done-priests-276126", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/pope-francis-speaks-about-sexual-abuse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pope Francis has personally apologized for the sexual abuse carried out by Catholic priests, and asked victims for their forgiveness.", "title": "Pope Francis Asks For \u2018Forgiveness\u2019 For Sexual Abuse", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pope-francis-apologizes-sexual-abuse-asks-forgiveness-damage-done-priests-276126", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/pope-francis-speaks-about-sexual-abuse.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/pope-francis-speaks-about-sexual-abuse.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-11T15:28:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-11T15:28:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pope Francis has personally apologized for the sexual abuse carried out by Catholic priests, and asked victims for their forgiveness."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31e8\"", "article_summary": "Barbara Dorris of the U.S.-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) isn\u2019t impressed by his speech.\nPope Francis has publicly asked the sexual abuse victims of the Catholic Church for forgiveness, during a talk directed at members of the International Catholic Child Bureau (BICE).\nThis is the first time the Pope has made such a strong condemnation of the church\u2019s sexual abuse scandals, and has promised to penalize the offenders.\nHopefully [priest sex abuse] will truly be over one day, and then we can talk about forgiveness.\n\u201cYou cannot interfere with children,\u201d Francis concluded in his talk with BICE."}
