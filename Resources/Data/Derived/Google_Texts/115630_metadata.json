This means that only one parent has legal guardianship of the children and poses a host of concerns for families.\n\nMedical issues are one such instance where same-sex couples have few rights in states that don't acknowledge gay marriage. April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse have four adopted children and say they have a marriage, though Michigan does not acknowledge it. \"We have a marriage. We just don't have a piece of paper that legally binds us to each other,\" DeBoer told NPR.\n\nSince Michigan doesn't allow gay marriage, DeBoer adopted two of their children, and Rowse the other two. This poses frightening consequences for the couple if one of them died. With no legal status as parents for two of their kids, their rights would be left to the discretion of a judge. \"A judge could award that child to someone else\" making the surviving parent \"a legal stranger to the child that they've helped raise since birth,\" Rowse said.\n\nThat fact pushed them to challenge the marriage law in their state.\n\nState marriage laws that don't recognize same-sex marriage can also hurt their options at public schools.\n\nPaul Campion and Randy Johnson have been together for 24 years and married in California, but their home state of Kentucky doesn't recognize their marriage. They have four children and say they very carefully vetted the schools to find the one that afforded them the most rights. \"We remain vulnerable if they choose to discriminate against us,\" Johnson said to EdWeek, referring to their rights at schools as a same-sex couple who have adopted kids.\n\nTheir search for the right school led them to both public and parochial schools. They found the most comfort and security in the Catholic schools their kids attended. \"In a lot of ways, the Catholic schools are more prepared and proactive in embracing diversity,\" Campion said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Abby Jackson", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "\"A judge could award that child to someone else.\"", "title": "Huge Supreme Court case has a surprising focus on children", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/supreme-courts-gay-marriage-cases-are-focused-on-children-2015-4", "image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/5537ef8c6bb3f7ec538fddb6-506-253/huge-supreme-court-case-has-a-surprising-focus-on-children.jpg", "site": "bi_university", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "education,law", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Gay Marriage, Supreme Court, Abby Jackson", "description": "\"A judge could award that child to someone else.\"", "author": "Abby Jackson", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-22", "sailthru.title": "Huge Supreme Court case has a surprising focus on children", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5537ed1e6da811644f84b11c-50-50/huge-supreme-court-case-has-a-surprising-focus-on-children.jpg", "news_keywords": "Gay Marriage, Supreme Court, Abby Jackson", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5537ed1e6da811644f84b11c/huge-supreme-court-case-has-a-surprising-focus-on-children.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-04-22", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/abby-jackson"}, "sailthru.description": "\"A judge could award that child to someone else.\"", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "\"A judge could award that child to someone else.\"", "title": "Huge Supreme Court case has a surprising focus on children", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/supreme-courts-gay-marriage-cases-are-focused-on-children-2015-4", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5537ef8c6bb3f7ec538fddb6-1190-625/huge-supreme-court-case-has-a-surprising-focus-on-children.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Huge Supreme Court case has a surprising focus on children", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5537ed1e6da811644f84b11c/huge-supreme-court-case-has-a-surprising-focus-on-children.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "education"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bb6\"", "article_summary": "In many states that don't allow gay marriage, same-sex couples can't jointly file for adoption.\nState marriage laws that don't recognize same-sex marriage can also hurt their options at public schools.\nMedical issues are one such instance where same-sex couples have few rights in states that don't acknowledge gay marriage.\nSince Michigan doesn't allow gay marriage, DeBoer adopted two of their children, and Rowse the other two.\nThe Supreme Court is ramping up to hear arguments that will determine whether states can ban same-sex marriage, which along with a fight over Obamacare is one of the biggest cases this term."}
