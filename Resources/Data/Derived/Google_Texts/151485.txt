Sioux Falls, SD

Plans for South Dakota's westernmost ethanol plant are moving forward following the rezoning of land in Onida despite complaints from residents.



Onida residents don't want the proposed Ring-Neck Energy and Feed plant so close to the town. Investors hope that the plant on the edge of Onida will be running by fall 2016.



Corn for the $65 million facility would come from a 100-mile radius including Sully, Potter, Walworth, Dewey and Stanley counties. Investors say the corn will be enough for the plant to reach its annual production capacity of 70 million gallons.



The nearest ethanol plant to Onida is about 100 miles away in Redfield.



South Dakota ranks fifth in the nation for its ethanol production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
