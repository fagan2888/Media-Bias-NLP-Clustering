Unlike the chaotic, panic-inducing fires he so often fought, Gregory Barnas always exuded a calmness that was ideal for his job, a fellow Jersey City fire captain told The Jersey Journal yesterday.

Barnas, 57, of Wallington, died yesterday while fighting a fire in his hometown after he fell off its roof.

Calm, meticulous, quiet, approachable, dedicated and knowledgeable were just some of the words Capt. Loren Hart, 40, of Jersey City used to describe Barnas, based on the three years he worked with him at Ladder Co. 6.

Hart said that while some firefighters treated fighting fires as just a job, it took on a much more profound meaning for Barnas.

“For someone like him who volunteered not only in his town, but statewide in terms of teaching, it’s a vocation,” he said. “He really was an outstanding fireman, and that’s the highest compliment you can pay a firefighter.”

Flags in Jersey City were flown at half-staff and bunting was placed on Barnas’ firehouse. On two Facebook pages created after Barnas’ death, tributes were posted from all over the East Coast by firefighters he trained.

At the scene of a Jersey City fire yesterday, Deputy Fire Chief Kevin Stewart testified to Barnas’ dedication to his work, calling his death a “colossal, tragic loss ... He went above and beyond off-duty and on-duty.”

Barnas, who joined the Jersey City Fire Department in 1985 and was promoted to captain in 2003, served as company officer of Ladder 6 for the better part of his career, the JCFD said in a statement released today.

Barnas is survived by his wife, Patty, and his two sons, Kevin and John. Kevin became a Jersey City firefighter last June and John aspires to follow in his father’s footsteps.

Kevin and John Barnas were both at the scene of the Wallington fire when their father tumbled to his death.

“He died doing what he loved, and there’s something noble about that,” Hart said. “And that’s the only consolation we have for this type of loss.”
