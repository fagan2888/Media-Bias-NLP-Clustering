A 6% gain in less than two months is impressive, but it might also imply the health care sector is tired and in need of a breather. Price action across health care sector and industry ETFs indicates otherwise. Last week, XLV, the largest health care ETF, notched a technical breakout, reasserting its leadership.\n\n\u201cOn the chart we can see a classic ascending triangle formation, so named because it has a flat top and rising, or ascending, bottom. While all triangles have the potential to be both reversal or continuation patterns, an ascending pattern usually leans bullish as bulls get more aggressive. They do not let prices dip to prior lows before buying and that suggests demand is still strong despite the overall sideways movement of the stock,\u201d reports Michael Kahn for Barron\u2019s.\n\nThere are multiple ways of confirming the health care sector\u2019s strength in 2015. For example, entering Tuesday, 87 S&P 500 stocks were up at least 10% year-to-date, 14 of which were healthcare names.\n\nThe iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (NYSEArca: IHF), which has risen to acclaim as one of the premier ETF avenues for playing Obamacare, has been a notable source of strength. Of the 14 S&P 500 healthcare stocks that are up at least 10% this year, several are IHF constituents. That group includes Aetna (NYSE: AET), Cigna (NYSE: CI) and Dow component UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH). Those three stocks combine for nearly 28% of IHF\u2019s weight. [Healthcare Services ETF Gets a Boost]\n\nUnitedHealth is one of just four Dow stocks up at least 10% this year. One of the other three is Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), XLV\u2019s second-largest holding at a weight of 7.8%. With that, it is not surprising that IHF is one of 185 ETFs that have touched all-time highs, as of this writing, Tuesday. Twenty five of those 185 ETFs, including XLV, are health care ETFs. [More M&A News Lifts Pharma ETFs]\n\nA bullish sign for XLV is that the ETF is hitting new highs even as Dow component Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), the ETF\u2019s largest holding with a weight of 10%, is faltering. The good news is J&J\u2019s downside momentum is waning.\n\nJ&J \u201chas lost its downside momentum. If it can move above its declining trendline, it could give the healthcare ETF a big boost and propel it solidly back into the lead relative to the broad market,\u201d according to Barron\u2019s.\n\nXLV has added nearly $607 million in assets this year. Among the nine SPDRs only XLU and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEArca: XLE) have hauled in more new assets. Entering Tuesday, six of the 10 best sector ETFs and four of the top 10 non-leveraged ETFs overall were healthcare funds.\n\nHealth Care Select Sector SPDR", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "sector etfs,health care etfs,pfizer,johnson & johnson,healthcare providers etf,johnson & johnson,feature stories,featured,ihf,lead,trend following,xlv", "google-site-verification": "Q-wAoS5rW2yMYxQN_OT0klqLjkfU6a6rxznKurdUlsY", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.etftrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/favicon-1.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd57dc\"", "article_summary": "Entering Tuesday, six of the 10 best sector ETFs and four of the top 10 non-leveraged ETFs overall were healthcare funds.\nTwenty five of those 185 ETFs, including XLV, are health care ETFs.\nHealth Care Select Sector SPDR\nPrice action across health care sector and industry ETFs indicates otherwise.\nThe Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLV) was the second-best of the nine sector SPDR exchange traded funds last year, trailing only the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSEArca: XLU) on its way to a 25.1% gain."}
