They have taken the first two this weekend at Citi Field after the NL East leaders returned from an 8-1 road trip.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been smashing the ball and today, the last two games, we have not. Today we looked a little tired,\u201d Mets manager Terry Collins said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been dragging a little bit.\u201d\n\nNew York has dropped five in a row at home, its worst skid this season, to fall to 42-23 at Citi Field.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be fine,\u201d Collins added. \u201cWe just had a blip and we\u2019ve got to pick it up.\u201d\n\nLast season\u2019s NL Rookie of the Year, deGrom (12-7) rebounded from a bout of food poisoning that perhaps contributed to the worst start of his two-year career Monday at Philadelphia. This time, he struck out 10 in six innings while yielding two runs and four hits.\n\n\u201cI felt good today, especially early on. I just struggled there a little bit in the sixth,\u201d deGrom said. \u201cIt was just one of those days where they were battling me pretty good.\u201d\n\nAfter giving up a leadoff double and throwing 30 pitches in the first, Kelly (8-6) settled in and shut down the Mets. Sporting his large goggles and a black mustache, he gave up five hits over 7 1-3 innings - matching his career high.\n\nThe right-hander, demoted to the minors in June, became the first Red Sox pitcher to go 6-0 in a month since Pedro Martinez in May 1999. The last to do it in August was Roger Clemens in 1990.\n\n\u201cThe way he did it wasn\u2019t how you draw it up,\u201d interim manager Torey Lovullo said. \u201cHe lasted longer in this game than deGrom did. If you were to tell me that was the case after the first inning, I never would have believed it.\u201d\n\nThe only damage against Kelly came in the seventh on Juan Uribe\u2019s RBI double. Pablo Sandoval made a diving play at third base to prevent another run.\n\nJean Machi pitched a perfect ninth for his third save, one day after the Red Sox used all seven relievers in a 10-inning victory.\n\n\u201cOur youngsters came in here and they\u2019re growing up before our very eyes,\u201d Lovullo said.\n\nSandoval snapped a scoreless tie in the sixth with an RBI double after Betts\u2019 leadoff single.\n\nLater in the inning, Brock Holt knocked in a run with a groundout when fill-in first baseman Daniel Murphy tried for a double play instead of throwing to the plate. It appeared Murphy could have had Sandoval hung up between third and home.\n\nBetts homered on an 0-2 pitch from Hansel Robles in the seventh.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nThird baseman David Wright was rested after playing consecutive extra-inning games the previous two nights. Wright returned Monday after missing more than four months with spinal stenosis, and the Mets want to be careful with their captain. \u2026 With the bullpen taxed, 42-year-old starter Bartolo Colon worked a scoreless ninth inning on his regular throw day. It was his first relief appearance since April 14, 2011, with the Yankees.\n\nFOND MEMORIES\n\nWith the Red Sox making their first regular-season visit to Citi Field, the Mets have taken the opportunity to celebrate their 1986 World Series win over Boston. They gave away bobbleheads of reliever Jesse Orosco celebrating the final out and showed highlights of the October triumph 29 years ago.\n\nOrosco was the answer to a trivia question on the ballpark video board, and received a huge ovation when he stunned an overwhelmed fan by personally delivering the prize in the stands. The standing-room-only crowd of 43,255 was the second-largest in the regular season at 7-year-old Citi Field, behind opening day in April (43,947).\n\nMOOKIE TIMES TWO\n\nThe teams were trying to arrange a face-to-face meeting between Betts and former Mets outfielder Mookie Wilson, who was at the ballpark. The timing didn\u2019t work out because Betts was busy during batting practice - but hopefully Sunday, the Red Sox said.\n\nACE LEFT-HANDER\n\nWith the U.S. Open getting set to start next door, tennis great John McEnroe threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Wearing a No. 1 Mets jersey with his name on the back, the New Yorker made an accurate toss from the top of the mound.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRookie RHP Noah Syndergaard (8-6), who turned 23 on Saturday, pitches the series finale for the Mets. He is 7-1 with a 1.82 ERA in nine home starts but has given up at least one homer in five consecutive outings overall. LHP Wade Miley (10-10) takes the ball for Boston after allowing a career-high 13 hits Tuesday in a loss at the Chicago White Sox.", "article_metadata": {"description": "All of a sudden, the New York Mets are having a tough time at home.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "All of a sudden, the New York Mets are having a tough time at home.", "title": "Mets give deGrom little help, lose 3-1 to last-place Red Sox", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/mets-give-degrom-little-help-lose-3-1-to-last-plac/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/ecedc056cd5e8426800f6a706700543d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/ecedc056cd5e8426800f6a706700543d.jpg", "description": "All of a sudden, the New York Mets are having a tough time at home.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mets give deGrom little help, lose 3-1 to last-place Red Sox"}, "Author": "MIKE FITZPATRICK", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7b0\"", "article_summary": "Mookie Betts homered and scored twice as the last-place Red Sox won for the eighth time in 11 games.\nNEW YORK (AP) - All of a sudden, the New York Mets are having a tough time at home.\nJean Machi pitched a perfect ninth for his third save, one day after the Red Sox used all seven relievers in a 10-inning victory.\nThe right-hander, demoted to the minors in June, became the first Red Sox pitcher to go 6-0 in a month since Pedro Martinez in May 1999.\nJoe Kelly won his sixth straight outing, recovering nicely from a rocky start to outpitch Jacob deGrom and lead the Boston Red Sox past the Mets 3-1 on Saturday."}
