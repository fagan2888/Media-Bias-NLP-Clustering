Mark Meadows, a Freedom Caucus member, in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cMy impression of the current bill is that it\u2019s not strong enough to really address concerns that most Americans would have [over a Iran nuclear deal].\u201d\n\nThe current Iran review bill \u201cis not strong enough to really address concerns that most Americans would have,\u201d says @RepMarkMeadows.\n\nMeadows said House leadership is still evaluating whether to allow debate on the bill or to bring it to the floor \u201cunder suspension,\u201d which would prevent amendments from being offered.\n\nMeadows, R-N.C., acknowledged \u201cthere is a good chance\u201d the bill would pass if Boehner, R-Ohio, and his team brought the bill forward on suspension and without debate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of lobbying being done that [some congressional oversight] is better than nothing,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nThe current Iran review legislation\u2014a bill Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., negotiated with Democrats and that President Obama supports\u2014would give Congress 30 days to review a nuclear pact with Iran.\n\n>>>Senate Votes to Give Congress Review Over Iran Nuclear Deal\n\nCongress could offer only a resolution disapproving the deal. If the House and Senate could get enough votes to overcome a presidential veto\u2014which is considered doubtful\u2014Obama would have to leave the congressionally mandated sanctions in place.\n\n\u201cI think the bottom line with this bill is that we are giving indirect congressional approval to a potentially bad deal because we can\u2019t muster the number of votes to override the veto on a resolution of disapproval,\u201d Meadows said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be condemning Sen. Corker and the hard work he\u2019s put forth. This may be the best we can get. But in my mind, it is really going against what the founding fathers set up.\u201d\n\nMeadows said one change to the bill being discussed is to specify that the resolution of disapproval not be subject to a filibuster in the Senate if Obama were to veto it and an override vote was needed.\n\nAnother amendment Meadows suggested would require that any breach of a nuclear deal by Iran be reported to Congress, and that the legislation clarify that the stipulation apply to any sort of violation, not just one the administration considers \u201csignificant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reporting language and asking for a simple majority vote in the Senate [no filibuster] would be two procedural things we can ask for that certainly don\u2019t send a message and really wouldn\u2019t be objectionable to the Iranians because it has nothing to do with the Iranian regime\u2014it has to do with our government process,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nA third amendment described by Meadows would mandate that the director of national intelligence certify Iran has \u201cdismantled its ballistic weapons development and research programs.\u201d\n\nHouse conservatives would also like to mandate that Iran stop support and funding of terrorism and terrorist groups, but Meadows says that issue may be addressed with standalone legislation.\n\n\u201cSome of these issues, like forcing Iran to recognize Israel, are not material to the fact of whether [Iran is] following an agreement,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nThe United States and other world powers have set a June 30 deadline to work out a deal to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. In April, negotiators announced the framework of a proposed agreement.\n\nMeadows hopes a debate over the agreement\u2014and Congress\u2019 role in enforcing it\u2014will allow lawmakers to make any deal stronger.\n\n\u201cI am not opposed to doing a deal with Iran,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cAm I in favor of negotiating and avoiding ultimately what would be a prelude to military action [if there is no negotiation]? The answer is yes. However, we have to make this particular piece of [review] legislation stronger so we can reach a better deal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House conservatives are pressuring GOP leadership to get a chance to \u201cstrengthen\u201d a bill imposing congressional review over a nuclear deal with Iran.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House conservatives are pressuring GOP leadership to get a chance to \u201cstrengthen\u201d a bill imposing congressional review over a nuclear deal with Iran.", "title": "House Conservatives Seek Changes to Iran Bill", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IranReviewMeadows.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-12T19:06:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1IwBuPh"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "House conservatives are pressuring GOP leadership to get a chance to \u201cstrengthen\u201d a bill imposing congressional review over a nuclear deal with Iran.", "title": "House Conservatives Seek Changes to Iran Bill", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IranReviewMeadows.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-05-12T17:15:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-12T19:06:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iran, nuclear deal, Mark Meadows, House Freedom Caucus, John Boehner, Bob Corker, Mitch McConnell"}, "article_summary": "A group of House conservatives is pressuring GOP leadership to allow the chance to \u201cstrengthen\u201d a Senate-passed bill imposing congressional review over a proposed nuclear deal with Iran.\nThe current Iran review legislation\u2014a bill Sen.
