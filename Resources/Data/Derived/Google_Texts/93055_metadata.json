To address these alarming statistics, the Be There San Diego Initiative has been awarded a $5.8 million Health Care Innovation grant for a coalition project to help reduce heart attacks and strokes in San Diego County.\n\nThe Initiative\u2019s program, San Diego: A Heart Attack and Stroke Free Zone, is a regional collaboration of health care organizations and stakeholders to improve health care delivery and patient outcomes.\n\nThe goal during the three year project is to enroll 4,000 high risk patients and lower their blood pressure and cholesterol levels through evidence-based practices and a better understanding of the importance of treatment adherence. The project will also promote heart attack and stroke prevention measures, test novel, cost-effective technology solutions and provide educational opportunities both for patients and within the physician community.\n\nPartners in the Be There Initiative include UC San Diego Health System, Arch Health Partners, Scripps Health, Sharp HealthCare, Kaiser Permanente, Palomar Medical Center, Naval Medical Center, Veterans Administration, the San Diego County Medical Society Foundation, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, community clinics and others. UC San Diego Health System serves as the fiscal agent for the project.\n\n\u201cHealth organizations that are competitive in the market will be working together for the benefit of San Diego patients,\u201d said Anthony DeMaria, MD, principal investigator of the Heart Attack and Stroke Free Zone program and cardiologist at UC San Diego Health System. \u201cThis approach will decrease our community\u2019s risk for cardiovascular disease and could result in saving millions in the county by preventing half of the heart attacks and strokes that would have otherwise occurred in the participating patient population.\u201d\n\nPatients will be educated about the program, consented and enrolled through their physician\u2019s office beginning later this year. Participants will also receive blood pressure cuffs to monitor levels at home and work closely with a health care coach.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s a silent condition, we find that many patients are unaware of having hypertension, and only about 40 percent of patients diagnosed with high blood pressure take their medication, which can directly lead to cardiovascular disease. We hope through the Heart Attack and Stroke Free Zone program, we can increase this to 80 percent,\u201d said Katherine Bailey, executive director of the Be There Initiative.\n\nThe Health Care Innovation grant supporting the project is made possible by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) through the Affordable Care Act and is part of an ongoing effort to advance innovative solutions in delivering and improving patient care across the nation.\n\n\u201cThe grant is going directly towards making it standard practice that patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease are identified through screening and receive and take the appropriate measures if they have high blood pressure or high cholesterol,\u201d said DeMaria, professor of medicine at UC San Diego School of Medicine. \u201cWe also want to motivate physicians from different health care systems to communicate and share data with each other, as well as work more closely with their patients to meet their goal levels. Together, we can significantly decrease cardiovascular disease in our county, region and nation.\u201d\n\nFor more about the Health Care Innovation Awards program, please visit http://innovation.cms.gov/initiatives/Health-Care-Innovation-Awards/Round-2.html\n\nTo learn about Cardiovascular Medicine at UC San Diego Health System, please visit http://heart.ucsd.edu\n\n# # #\n\nMedia contact: Michelle Brubaker, 619-543-6163, mmbrubaker@ucsd.edu", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "geo.placename": "San Diego", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/images/HealthSystem_310x150.png", "twitter": {"description": "UC San Diego Health is the one place ranked number one in San Diego by U.S. News & World Report's Best Hospitals metro area rankings.", "title": "UC Health - UC San Diego", "image": "https://health.ucsd.edu/images/og-Default.png", "creator": "@UCSDHealth", "site": "@UCSDHealth", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#4A9FBC", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/images/HealthSystem_70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "UC San Diego Health is the one place ranked number one in San Diego by U.S. News & World Report's Best Hospitals metro area rankings.", "google-translate-customization": "34c18153a3840a19-c0e9473abf338896-g0db1ca1eacdf4878-f", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/images/HealthSystem_310.png", "p": {"domain_verify": "98c6903030b37cc99eeaf2ccbf44b85a"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/HealthSystem_144.png", "ORGANIZATION": "University of California, San Diego", "google-site-verification": "dVGoKlLW5yWr2UaQU9nwXH1WGOGU0bsCI3N7QjY2TFQ", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/images/HealthSystem_150.png", "og": {"type": "website", "image": "https://health.ucsd.edu/images/HealthSystem_310.png", "site_name": "UC Health - UC San Diego"}, "viewport": "user-scalable=1, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=4"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c43\"", "article_summary": "Partners in the Be There Initiative include UC San Diego Health System, Arch Health Partners, Scripps Health, Sharp HealthCare, Kaiser Permanente, Palomar Medical Center, Naval Medical Center, Veterans Administration, the San Diego County Medical Society Foundation, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency, community clinics and others.\nTo address these alarming statistics, the Be There San Diego Initiative has been awarded a $5.8 million Health Care Innovation grant for a coalition project to help reduce heart attacks and strokes in San Diego County.\nUC San Diego Health System serves as the fiscal agent for the project.\nThe Initiative\u2019s program, San Diego: A Heart Attack and Stroke Free Zone, is a regional collaboration of health care organizations and stakeholders to improve health care delivery and patient outcomes.\nParticipants will also receive blood pressure cuffs to monitor levels at home and work closely with a health care coach."}
