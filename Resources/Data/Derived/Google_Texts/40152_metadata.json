Rubio briefly outlined his biography, talked about modernizing higher education and called for repealing and replacing \u201cObamaCare\u201d health insurance subsidies with \u201cpre-tax\u201d health savings accounts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking you to Caucus for me,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cOn February 1 in this state, we will begin the process of selecting the next American president\u2026The question is what comes next for America and what comes next, if we\u2019re willing to do what must be done, is the greatest era in our history.\u201d\n\nEarlier this morning Rubio held a news conference in a picnic shelter on the fairgrounds, telling reporters he does \u201cnot agree\u201d with rival Donald Trump\u2019s call to end \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d for children of immigrants who are born in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m open to doing things that prevent people who are deliberately coming to the U.S. for purposes of taking advantage of the 14th Amendment, but I\u2019m not in favor of repealing it,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI haven\u2019t read his plan. I\u2019ve only read press accounts\u2026Obviously there are some ideas that have merit, but the majority of it is really not a workable plan that could ever pass congress.\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Grassley escorted Rubio into the fairgrounds and Grassley told reporters he wants answers as to why Hillary Clinton\u2019s private attorney had the computer server she used to send email while she was secretary of state. Rubio said even things that aren\u2019t classified could be sensitive and useful to foreign intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cSo it is concerning,\u201d Rubio said of Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email account. \u201cI think it shows quite frankly incompetence, on her part, to not know that this was important information she needed to protect and to be clear to her staff, if that\u2019s who it was, not to be sending that information on an open, private server.\u201d\n\nRubio has said he aims to win the Iowa Caucuses, but he has not dedicated many campaign resources to the state and he last visited Iowa a month ago.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t run to finish in second or third place anywhere,\u201d Rubio said, as the rain poured on the roof. \u201cObviously these are complicated processes, but we love coming to the state.\u201d\n\nRubio told reporters he not only has his senate \u201cduties\u201d to attend to in Washington, D.C., but he\u2019s been spending time raising money and campaigning elsewhere. Rubio and his family visited the fair Monday evening \u2014 before the storm front moved in \u2014 and he rode the bumper cars with his kids. In 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama did the same thing with his girls and the next day Obama joked that riding the bumper cars was good preparation for a candidate debate. Rubio joked about the experience, too.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough bumper cars to prepare for this debate,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThere\u2019s too many Republicans running. One out of five Republicans it seems these days.\u201d\n\nDespite the heavy rain, a crowd had gathered to hear Rubio speak this morning clad in rain gear, standing under an umbrella or simply getting drenched.\n\n\u201cA special welcome to all of you,\u201d Carol Hunter, The Register\u2019s news director told the crowd, \u201cbecause you must truly to interested in presidential politics to be out today.\u201d\n\nAUDIO of Rubio\u2019s speech at the fair\n\n(Photos by Asya Akca)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Radio Iowa", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio campaigned at the Iowa State Fair today, joking the rainy weather reminds him of his hometown of Miami. \u201cThanks for braving the rain,\u201d Rubi\u2026", "title": "Rubio says \u2018majority\u2019 of Trump\u2019s immigration plan \u2018not workable\u2019 (AUDIO)", "url": "http://www.radioiowa.com/2015/08/18/rubio-says-majority-of-trumps-immigration-plan-not-workable/", "image": {"width": 3264, "identifier": "http://cdn.radioiowa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RubioGrassley.jpg", "height": 2448}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-18T17:31:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-19T20:42:22+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.radioiowa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/RubioGrassley.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a76\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThanks for braving the rain,\u201d Rubio told a crowd at The Des Moines Register\u2019s Political Soap Box.\nRepublican presidential candidate Marco Rubio campaigned at the Iowa State Fair today, joking the rainy weather reminds him of his hometown of Miami.\nRubio and his family visited the fair Monday evening \u2014 before the storm front moved in \u2014 and he rode the bumper cars with his kids.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t enough bumper cars to prepare for this debate,\u201d Rubio said.\nIn 2007, then-Senator Barack Obama did the same thing with his girls and the next day Obama joked that riding the bumper cars was good preparation for a candidate debate."}
