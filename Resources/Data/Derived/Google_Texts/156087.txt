According to an investigation by Atlanta’s WSB-TV, Georgia ranks first in deportations of illegal immigrants among all non-border states. And it trails only Texas, Arizona, and California as fourth overall, based on a review of government deportation records.

In fiscal year 2013, there were 7,120 illegal immigrants deported in Georgia alone, according to WSB-TV reporter Aaron Diamant’s investigation. Of the 1,173 who had felony convictions, nearly half—513—had been removed at least once before.

“This is a disturbing trend that has to stop,” Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., said in a statement to The Daily Signal. “The reality is violent illegal immigrants are repeatedly entering our country and posing a dangerous risk to our families and communities. Too many victims have unjustly suffered the consequences of President Obama’s lawless executive amnesty and lack of action to address this illegal immigration crisis.”

Perdue cosponsored Kate’s Law, which would increase penalties on illegal immigrants who unlawfully re-enter the United States after being removed. Senate Democrats blocked the measure last month.
