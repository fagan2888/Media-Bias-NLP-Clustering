In the spirit of Thanksgiving, a quirky bowling tournament put a holiday spin on the traditional game.

The Riverâ€™s Edge in Davenport held a Turkey Bowling competition on Saturday, November 23, 2013.

Bowlers on ice skates rolled frozen turkeys down an ice lane, attempting to knock down a set of bowling pins. Participants said it was definitely more difficult than bowling the regular way.

Prizes were awarded for those expert bowlers who mastered Turkey Bowling.
