Two Kansas City, Kansas, men have been found guilty of attempted capital murder for shooting a Wyandotte County deputy multiple times while he was face down on a convenience store floor.

The Kansas City Star reports 25-year-old Dyron King and 36-year-old Cecil Meggerson also were convicted Friday of multiple counts of aggravated robbery, aggravated battery and illegally possessing firearms.

Deputy Scott Wood was inside the convenience store in Kansas City, Kansas, on March 4 when three armed robbers jumped him and took his gun. He was shot multiple times but was able to radio for help before being shot in the face. He survived.

Prosecutors say King, Meggerson and a third man committed a string of robberies in Kansas and Missouri before the attack on Wood.
