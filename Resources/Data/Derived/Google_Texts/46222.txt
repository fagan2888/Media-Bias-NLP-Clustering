Des Moines, IA

Shiny new kitchen equipment, a modern furnace and fresh paintwork are among the recent updates at the historic Iowa governor's mansion thanks to a successful fundraising campaign.

Just over $2 million has been pledged to a fundraising campaign led by the Terrace Hill Foundation for improvements and to establish an endowment for the Victorian mansion. The house was donated to the state in 1971 for use as the governor's residence.



The fundraising has exceeded the $1.6 million goal set two years ago when the effort began. Several renovation projects have already been completed, including a new commercial-grade kitchen and an energy-efficient heating system.



Terry Branstad, who served as governor from 1983 to 1999 and then returned to office in 2011, is on his second stint living in the home.
