This week, The Northeast Ohio Media Group Editorial Board discussed if the minimum wage should be raised (see video above), the ACLU sued the state prisons, Eric Kearney withdraws from the governor's race ticket, Ponzi scheme operator Eric Bartoli was arrested in Peru, Congress debated if unemployment benefits keep people from finding jobs, the Opportunity Corridor's affect on neighborhoods was questioned, and Antun Lewis was found guilty of setting a house fire in 2005 that killed nine people. Included below are overviews for these story and more from the best of the week.\n\n\n\nMONDAY\n\n\n\n\n\nACLU sues state prisons for denying reporters' interviews with inmates convicted in prison riot\n\nThe ACLU said that prison officials have claimed that they deny reporters' interview requests because the inmates are at the tightest security level in the system and ineligible for interviews. The group is seeking an injunction that would allow the inmates to speak with reporters about the riot.\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Columbus, alleges that the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction have violated the constitutional rights of the inmates by banning them from reporters \"based upon policies and decisions that have no rational basis.''\n\nA prison spokeswoman declined to comment. The lawsuit revives one of the lowest points in the prison system's history, when inmates took control of the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility and killed guard Robert Vallandingham and nine inmates in a siege that cost the state $42 million. | Read John Caniglia's story\n\n\n\n\n\nLower gas bills\n\nDominion East Ohio estimates that the average residential bill for December will be about $103, down about 10 percent from December average gas bills of about $115.

The statement offered no hints about FitzGerald's plans to pick a new running mate but indicated the decision to move on was mutual.\n\nFitzGerald had cast his choice of Kearney as his first major decision as a candidate to unseat Republican Gov. John Kasich. In many ways the lawyer and former Democratic leader in the Ohio Senate made sense. As a black legislator with strong Statehouse relationships he brought balance to a ticket topped by the white FitzGerald, who is making his first run for statewide office. And with his Cincinnati base, Kearney added name-recognition in the politically important opposite corner of the state.\n\nWithin 48 hours of FitzGerald putting him on the ticket, Northeast Ohio Media Group and others began digging into Kearney's personal and business finances, ultimately discovering Kearney owed up to $825,000 in federal payroll taxes and state unemployment taxes. And that didn't include credit card debt that American Express sued Kearney over last year. He has paid that bill down from $14,000 to $2,100. | Read Henry J.

FBI and IRS officials have said Bartoli's Cyprus Fund promised investors high yields in conservative blue-chip stocks. Bartoli and his partners fraudulently raised about $65 million from 1995 until 1999, when dividend checks stop being mailed to Ohio investors.\n\nShareholders received about half of the money raised.\n\nFederal prosecutors in Cleveland have said Bartoli used some of the money he fleeced from investors to fund his lavish lifestyle, including a farm in Wayne County with a barn decorated with chandeliers and hardwood floors.\n\nHe also converted a building into a replica of a 16th century pub. Investigators found jewels and gold coins hidden in a passage behind a wall. | Read Regina Garcia Cano's story\n\n\n\nHomicides down\n\nCleveland Police statistics show 77 homicides were reported in the city as of Tuesday morning.

The first 26 weeks, known as state benefits, are funded by taxing employers. However, Ohioans are eligible for a maximum of 63 weeks of benefits, 37 of which are paid for by federal funding Congress must approve.\n\nDemocrats have proposed extending federal benefits for an additional year at $25 billion. Many Republicans have opposed an extension, calling it too costly. The two-year bipartisan budget bill deal struck Tuesday, to prevent another government shutdown, does not address unemployment benefits. Supporters of the extension unsuccessfully fought to have the jobless benefits included in the budget. | Read Olivera Perkins' story\n\n\n\nPrison alternatives\n\nAs Ohio's prison population nears an all-time high, Ohio prisons director Gary Mohr is pushing for more funding for reentry programs and other community alternatives.

The meetings will be at 3 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at University Circle United Methodist Church, 1919 East 107th Street, Cleveland.\n\nOrganizers say they want to maximize benefits for six neighborhoods in the path or vicinity of the route \u2013 Buckeye, Central, Fairfax,Kinsman, Slavic Village and University Circle. Except for the increasingly prosperous University Circle, the corridor is cutting through parts of Cleveland where 40 to 65 percent of the residents live below the federal poverty level.\n\n\"If the Cleveland Clinic and University Circle really want this, and there can be a benefit to the community at the same time, I would support that,\" said Timothy Tramble, executive director of Burten, Bell, Carr Development Corporation, which serves a four-square-mile area where the median household income is around $10,000.\n\n\"I just don't have total confidence that aside from having the roadway, that they will do the community benefits part.\" | Read Allison Grant's story", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "week-in-review, news", "title": "Minimum wage debated; Eric Kearney withdraws; ACLU sues prisons: Week in review", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "The Northeast Ohio Media Group editorial board discussed if the minimum wage should be raised (see video above), the ACLU sued the state prisons, Eric Kearney withdraws from the governor's race ticket, Ponzi scheme operator Eric Bartoli was arrested in Peru, Congress debated if unemployment benefits keep people from finding jobs, the Opportunity Corridor's affect on neighborhoods was questioned, and Antun Lewis was found guilty of setting a house fire in 2005 that killed nine people.", "title": "Minimum wage debated; Eric Kearney withdraws; ACLU sues prisons: Week in review", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/top-5/2013/12/minimum_wage_debated_eric_kear.html", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/brightcove01/width620/img/22/275353188001/201312/319/275353188001_2924364789001_opinion-show.jpg?pubId=275353188001", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/brightcove01/width620/img/22/275353188001/201312/319/275353188001_2924364789001_opinion-show.jpg?pubId=275353188001", "description": "The Northeast Ohio Media Group editorial board discussed if the minimum wage should be raised (see video above), the ACLU sued the state prisons, Eric Kearney withdraws from the governor's race ticket, Ponzi scheme operator Eric Bartoli was arrested in Peru, Congress debated if unemployment benefits keep people from finding jobs, the Opportunity Corridor's affect on neighborhoods was questioned, and Antun Lewis was found guilty of setting a house fire in 2005 that killed nine people.", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Minimum wage debated; Eric Kearney withdraws; ACLU sues prisons: Week in review"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, December 14, 2013, 11:08 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, December 14, 2013, 11:00 AM", "article_author": "Damon Sims, Northeast Ohio Media Group", "Description": "The Northeast Ohio Media Group editorial board discussed if the minimum wage should be raised (see video above), the ACLU sued the state prisons, Eric Kearney withdraws from the governor's race ticket, Ponzi scheme operator Eric Bartoli was arrested in Peru, Congress debated if unemployment benefits keep people from finding jobs, the Opportunity Corridor's affect on neighborhoods was questioned, and Antun Lewis was found guilty of setting a house fire in 2005 that killed nine people."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde81\"", "article_summary": "THURSDAYAs Congress decides whether to extend unemployment benefits, debate centers on cost and if payments keep people from finding jobsClose to 40,000 Ohioans could lose unemployment benefits, beginning Dec. 28, unless Congress votes to extend them.\nThe two-year bipartisan budget bill deal struck Tuesday, to prevent another government shutdown, does not address unemployment benefits.\nDemocrats have proposed extending federal benefits for an additional year at $25 billion.\nThe first 26 weeks, known as state benefits, are funded by taxing employers.\nAs Ohio's prison population nears an all-time high, Ohio prisons director Gary Mohr is pushing for more funding for reentry programs and other community alternatives."}
