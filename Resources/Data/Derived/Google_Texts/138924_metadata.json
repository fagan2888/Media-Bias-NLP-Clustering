Roger Clemens was one of them and O\u2019Brien admires Clemens so much that he said this: \u201cOf all the people I played with, he\u2019s like the John Wayne of pitchers.\u201d\n\nFunny story from their time together: O\u2019Brien said Clemens had pitched something like seven innings in a game against Seattle and was, for all intents and purposes, done. Clemens retreated to the clubhouse and took off his gear.\n\n\u201cHe was totally naked standing there watching the game,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\nThen a Mariners pitcher, in retaliation for something which had happened earlier in the game, beaned one of Clemens\u2019 teammates.\n\nClemens hurriedly began putting on his uniform and cleats. He didn\u2019t want to leave the job of exacting \u201cjustice\u201d to someone else.\n\n\u201cHe put his hat on, grabbed his glove and went running out there to start the eighth,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\n\u201cHe told (manager) Cito (Gaston) \u2018I\u2019ve got this.\u2019 So he went out there and warmed up. First pitch, he hits (Paul) Sorrento, who happened to be leading off the inning. He hit him right, square dead in the back. Cito came out and took him out of the game.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the story: It was so important to Clemens (\u201cHe\u2019s a special cat,\u201d O\u2019Brien said) to be ready for the start of the inning that he didn\u2019t have time to put on all of his gear.\n\n\u201cHe had no undershirt, no shorts, no nothing.\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe just put on pants. No socks. Nothing. He didn\u2019t have a jock. He was totally nude. He put on his uniform top. He knew he couldn\u2019t dressed and still get out of (the clubhouse). He was running in front of his little runway, running and hopping and trying to put his other shoe on.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brien knows Clemens as a fierce competitor. He doesn\u2019t know Clemens as a user of performance-enhancing drugs. He testified on Clemens\u2019 behalf in 2012 and wrote in the book about an instance when Clemens chose not to \u201ccheat.\u201d O\u2019Brien tossed Clemens a scuffed ball before the umpire could see it. Clemens tossed it back and said, \u201cI don\u2019t need that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "Bishop Kelley alum Charlie O'Brien caught 13 pitchers who won Cy Young Awards.
