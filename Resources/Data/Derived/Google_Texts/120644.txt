Bachmann, a former Republican congresswoman from Minnesota and tea-party favorite, also believes that LGBT rights will lead to the legalization of child rape . She was also one of the main inspirations for the violent, theocratic vampire movement in season five of HBO’s True Blood .

The Obama-Lubitz comparison is the most recent entry into Bachmann’s running tally of miserably bad analogies and metaphors. For instance, last year, she said that, “Obamacare is the health care version of Snapchat: Now you see it, now you don’t.” And in 2011, she compared America’s supposed loss of “economic liberty” under the Obama administration to the freakin’ Holocaust.
