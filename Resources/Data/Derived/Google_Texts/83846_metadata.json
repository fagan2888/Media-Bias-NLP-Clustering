I felt fine and strong, but the weight of my pack took its toll, and the altitude often left me short of breath.\n\nI carried, among other things, a tent, a sleeping bag, a gas stove, clothes, food, a first aid kit, crampons, and a DSLR camera.\n\nNights in the tent were bitter cold. Hauling a heavy pack in the altitude up above 17,000 feet was\u2014to put it modestly\u2014tiring. But the corporal excesses of easy living melted away with the miles and the altitude.\n\nBlisters became calluses. Sunburns turned to tan. Sore muscles became stronger ones. The body hardened to the task as the days went on.\n\n>>> This is Part 2 of Nolan Peterson\u2019s three-part account of his trek to an age-old Himalayan trade route used by refugees. Read Part 1 here and Part 3 here.\n\nI was headed for the Nangpa La, a pass that bridges the Himalayas between Nepal and Tibet.\n\nThe trail was rough, meandering, and at times hard to identify. This ancient, nomadic route has been practically abandoned by Tibetan refugees under China\u2019s eye for the past six years, and parts have faded into the wild terrain because of the unending erosion of wind and snow.\n\nLandslides from the two massive earthquakes that hit Nepal in 2015 also have wiped out some sections of the trail, leaving no choice but to skirt along steep, crumbling cliffs. You can only hope the ground will support your weight as you nervously peer down hundreds of feet of exposure.\n\nA fall here would be fatal. Even if you survived the tumble, a broken leg or ankle would likely be a death sentence in this remote section of the Himalayas. As the tagline from the movie \u201cAlien\u201d says, in this place \u201cno one can hear you scream.\u201d\n\nIntermittent clues to the path\u2019s history sprang up along the way. Nomads and refugees had built stone huts and walls as shelters from the wind at various points. At these abandoned campsites I found disintegrated sneakers, the soles worn through, and tattered jeans and T-shirts. I also found a shattered porcelain vase with Chinese lettering, as well as food wrappers and soda cans with labels in Chinese.\n\nYet there were no active signs of man\u2019s existence. It was complete, abandoned isolation.\n\nIt was, in fact, quite eerie to have this massive place all to myself as I traveled within a pantheon of jagged, earth-tone cliffs beyond which towering, burning white peaks touched unbelievable heights. I was lucky with the weather. The days were perfectly clear, giving all the colors a supernatural radiance, highlighted by the hyperclarity of the thin, high-altitude air.\n\nLooking beyond the tops of peaks that reached as high as jetliners fly, I could see the dark blue sky begin to fade to black.\n\nMountain ranges like the Himalayas are an unfamiliar visual experience; your mind struggles to understand the scale of what your eyes are reporting. All you can do is observe in appreciative silence, imprinting the memories as permanently as possible.\n\n\u201cThrough footless halls of air \u2026 up, up the long, delirious, burning blue,\u201d I found myself reciting, recalling the John Gillespie Magee poem, my days as an Air Force pilot, and familiar sensations of altitude and freedom.\n\nStill, a grounding reality marked my time in the mountains. During the cold nights and the hard work of each day\u2019s walk, my thoughts often drifted to the hungry, tired, and scared Tibetan refugees who accomplished the same journey in jeans and tennis shoes. More humbling is that the refugees\u2019 journey was doubly long, since I did only a round trip to the pass and back on the Nepal side.\n\nThe refugees must have suffered terribly. Like Pasang Nuru Sherpa, who made the trek in 1975 when he was 23, they didn\u2019t have my fancy mountaineering clothing, a tent, or a portable stove on which to cook hot meals. Or my stash of protein bars, for that matter.\n\nThey hiked at night, fearing Chinese border patrol troops who will shoot refugees on sight. Unable to use flashlights, the refugees linked arms so as not to lose each other in the darkness. They used socks as gloves. They used duct tape and needle and thread to hold together their disintegrating footwear. During the days, they tied strips of black trash bags over their eyes to protect from snow blindness.\n\nI wondered if this untamed landscape and its proximity to the heavens had inspired in the Tibetan refugees the same lofty, waxing poetic sensations that I had felt. More than likely, however, physical suffering and the continued threat of being incarcerated and sent back to China kept their eyes and minds firmly planted on the earth.\n\n(Click on the icon at upper left to see key landmarks. Kelsey Lucas/Visualsey)\n\nEnd of an Era\n\nThe Khumbu region of Nepal is home to the Sherpa people. The Sherpas ethnically descended from Tibet and are famous as high-altitude porters and climbers. They have been essential to Mount Everest expeditions dating from George Mallory\u2019s attempts in the 1920s. (Mallory was the British climber who famously quipped, \u201cBecause it\u2019s there\u201d when a journalist asked why he wanted to climb Everest.)\n\nThe mountain region in which the Sherpas live is devoid of any sort of wheeled transport. Only well-worn footpaths, centuries old, connect the myriad villages and Buddhist monasteries within the Khumbu. Everything from medicine and food to building supplies is hauled in on human or animal backs. And until about 2009, a good deal of supplies flowed across the Nangpa La.\n\nSix years ago, the center fields of Namche Bazar were covered in Tibetan traders\u2019 tents. It was an eclectic market of knock-off mountaineering clothing, yak wool blankets, meat, jewelry, and Buddhist talismans.\n\n\u201cIt was wonderful to arrive in Namche Bazar and see all the lower fields near the big stupa completely covered in mats and beautiful carpeting,\u201d said Lorenzo Gariano, the Italian mountaineer spearheading the rebuilding of the school in the earthquake-rocked village of Thame.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like a Friday market,\u2019 Gariano said, \u201d it was a continuous flow of caravans coming backwards and forwards, sending their goods.\u201d\n\nAnd stealthily flowing behind the yak trains and nomads crisscrossing the Nangpa La was an undercurrent of Tibetan refugees, as many as 2,000 to 3,000 a year, who escaped China across the high Himalayas.\n\nToday, both the obvious and the furtive evidence of the porous Himalayan border have vanished. Trade has ended across the Nangpa La, and so has the flow of refugees. The annual number of Tibetan refugees to reach Nepal has dropped to around 200 (with none coming across the Nangpa La), about 7 percent of the pre-2009 refugee flow.\n\nNow, all of the Khumbu region\u2019s supplies are hauled in by porters and yak trains originating from the Lukla airport or from the trailhead in Jiri, a full week\u2019s walk from Namche Bazar along a trek that tortuously cuts up and down a meandering river valley like a sine wave.\n\nTibetan yak trains and their gold-toothed, ponytailed drivers are absent from the trails lining the Bhote Khoshi River valley\u2019s steep, rocky walls. The trading places in Namche Bazar are empty.\n\n\u201cThey [China] completely closed the border, not from here, but from the Tibetan side,\u201d said Anu Sherpa, 69, a former mountaineering Sherpa who has worked on peaks like Mount Everest and Pumori. He is a lifelong resident of Namche Bazar, where he spoke to me from his mountaineering equipment shop.\n\n\u201cWhen the Tibetans come without permission, they go to border jail or maybe somewhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people they shoot, the Chinese do.\u201d\n\nNo Way Out\n\nDuring my return trek from the Nangpa La, I stopped in Namche Bazar for a couple days to learn about what life had been like when the pass was open. Admittedly, a yak burger and an Everest beer were also on my mind. On my return to Kathmandu, I visited the Tibetan government-in-exile\u2019s headquarters there to get an update on the current condition of the Nangpa La.\n\nThe people I spoke with in Namche Bazar and Kathmandu included Tibetan traders, refugees, Sherpa mountaineers, and lodge and shop owners.\n\nThey explained how before 2009 Tibetan refugees were hustled into Namche Bazar at night and hidden in the Buddhist monastery and private homes to avoid detection by a nearby Nepali police post. After a few hours of rest, the refugees would leave in the dark to continue their trek to Kathmandu, Nepal\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cThe refugees would come at night and escape early in the morning to Lukla,\u201d Anu Sherpa said. \u201cIn the winter, they would come with their hands frozen.\u201d\n\nThose who made it across the pass often suffered from serious injuries because of the extreme cold and their inadequate clothing.\n\n\u201cThe major injuries include frostbite because they don\u2019t have the proper clothes. And they don\u2019t have sunglasses, so they are snowblind,\u201d said Tashi, a 30-year-old Tibetan refugee who fled across the Nangpa La in 1999 when he was 14. He asked me not to use his last name to protect relatives still living in Tibet.\n\nTo get past Chinese troops monitoring the border, Tashi concealed himself within a Tibetan trade caravan. He said:\n\nThere were Chinese troops, but I went with Tibetan yak traders. I pretended I was one of them. It was spring, so the glacier was melting, and it was dangerous. The crevasses were very wide, and sometimes we would sink into the snow.\n\nAfter arriving in Nepal, Tashi settled in Thame with relatives. He now works at the Tibetan government-in-exile\u2019s offices in Kathmandu.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young, many Tibetans came across the pass,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult nowadays. The Nangpa La is totally closed.\u201d\n\nNext: What could happen if China relaxes its grip on the mountain pass.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Those escaping China used socks as gloves and duct tape to hold together footwear.
