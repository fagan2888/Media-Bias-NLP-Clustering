With just 3,000 people, it\u2019s the big city on the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation.\n\nLike other Native American groups, the Hupa suffer from high rates of obesity and diabetes. That\u2019s where Meagan Baldy comes in. She runs the Hoopa Community Garden and sought to educate her fellow Hupa people about eating local, traditional foods. But trying to change people\u2019s habits is never easy.\n\nShe started by offering a \u201cfarm box\u201d \u2013 a box of free produce, whatever is in season. But people failed even to pick up their boxes. Baldy discovered that people didn\u2019t know how to prepare most produce.\n\nServing the vegetables to her own family was a battle at first, so it must have been for others as well, Baldy reasoned. So, she snuck in greens and tried cooking them in creative ways.\n\nWhen she posted a picture of kale and eggs to Facebook, people asked her how she made it.\n\nFrom there, the brainstorm: Baldy launched her own YouTube channel \u2014 Cooking Healthy in Indian Country \u2014 to show people how to cook easy, nutritious meals for their families.\n\n\n\nPeople who might have been suspicious of kale and beets can learn how to make a stir-fry of local Trinity River salmon, trumpet mushrooms and a side of kale or beet pancakes, complete with a strawberry and honey sauce.\n\n\u201cWhen I developed the show, it was mainly to say that our local vegetables are not hard to use,\u201d Baldy said. \u201cI like to take comfort food and add these vegetables.\u201d\n\nOn YouTube and Facebook, she\u2019s taught viewers how to make creamy kale and artichoke dip, black bean salsa, chard tacos and kabocha muffins. She also featured a venison stir-fry.\n\nBaldy cooks with traditional Hupa foods \u2013 deer, salmon, berries and mushrooms \u2013 to encourage the American Indian community to integrate them back into their diets.\n\n\u201cI really emphasize native and traditional foods because why do we have high diabetes and high heart disease rates?\u201d she said. \u201cAs native people, we sustained on a traditional diet for thousands of years. Acorns are high in fiber, which we now lack. Berries and roots are high in antioxidants, iron \u2013 stuff we desperately need that we aren\u2019t getting.\u201d\n\nHumboldt County as a whole has some of the worst health outcomes of any of California\u2019s 58 counties. For Native Americans, the statistics are even worse. According to Humboldt County\u2019s 2013 Community Health Assessment, the diabetes death rate for Native Americans is nearly triple that of whites in Humboldt County.\n\nThe diabetes prevalence rate in Hoopa is at 9.9 percent, according to the K\u2019ima:w Diabetes Programin Hoopa. The program\u2019s coordinator, Dr. Terry Raymer, said that number only accounts for the known cases.\n\n\u201cThe high prevalence is due to a combination of loss of traditional culture and loss of traditional foods,\u201d Dr. Raymer said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly some pretty good evidence that the chronic long-term effects of historical trauma has some impact on the prevalence of diabetes. It\u2019s really quite complicated. It\u2019s not just that people don\u2019t exercise.\u201d\n\nBaldy\u2019s show addresses the many causative factors and the complexity of diabetes in Hupa. In the videos, she explains the nutritional value of foods, naming their different vitamins and benefits. A collaboration of local health organizations help support the cooking show.\n\nBaldy also emphasizes supporting the community. She often gives shout-outs to local farmers and artisans, showing off their handmade aprons and hats. One local elementary school teacher plays \u201cCooking Healthy in Indian Country\u201d in her class.\n\n\u201cI definitely think nutrition needs to be more of an issue here,\u201d said Amy Davis, who teaches sixth grade at Hoopa Valley Elementary, adding that Baldy helps shed light on issue in an interesting way to children.\n\nAt first the audience was local, but through social media shares and buzz in the American Indian community, Baldy has viewers nationwide. United Indian Health Services promoted her, and Good Health TV, a national American Indian and Alaska Native education network that promotes health literacy through programming, is about to pick up her shows.\n\nBut it\u2019s the comments on videos and compliments on the street that make her day, she says.\n\nWhat\u2019s on the menu next?
