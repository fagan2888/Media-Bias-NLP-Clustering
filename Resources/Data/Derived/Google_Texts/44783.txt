Obama apologizes on a clip that’s played over and over again on the morning news shows Friday, Nov. 8. “Fox and Friends” added a little background music as Obama apologizes, “I’m Sorry, So Sorry” by Brenda Lee. According to CNN, Obama apologizes for the insurance cancellations due to Obamacare.

Even though Obama said repeatedly that no one would lose their coverage due to Obamacare, it happened. His apology appeared sincere to some, with the President saying: "I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me.” Others are calling this a "half-hearted" apology, like Fox News today. The essence of what Obama said was "I am sorry you lost your plans because you believed me," according to Monica Crowley, Fox News contributor.

The President apologizes just days after he attempted to clarify what he originally meant when saying folks wouldn’t lose their coverage, but that didn’t satisfy the critics who hammered back at him through the media.

Apparently some of the blame is going to the Insurance companies pulling their plans, some from just specific states, to save money. Obamacare resulting in folks losing their insurance policies coupled with the website for Obamacare, which is still somewhat dead in the water due to all kinds of glitches, is creating a mess.

Fox News had a technical engineer on their morning show who pointed out that all the questions being answered on the failed website seem to have one thing in common. Most folks admit they are not a technology expert, but these were the people in charge of getting the Obamacare website up and running.

Apparently that was one of the biggest mistakes made over the Obamacare website, not having a technology expert as part of the team to narrow down just what they needed this website to do and for what type of load it was expected to carry daily. This should have been in place before millions upon millions of dollars were thrown into a failing website.
