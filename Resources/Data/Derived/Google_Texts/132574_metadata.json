Rubio comically tried to explain how worthless his experience in the U.S. Senate is anyway, then proceeded to name things that actually aren\u2019t Marco Rubio\u2019s legislative accomplishments:\n\nWALLACE: One of the knocks against you, Senator, is that you\u2019re the Republican Barack Obama, that you lack the experience to be president. You\u2019ve been in the Senate for five-plus years. So, let me ask you, what do you consider your biggest legislative accomplishment? RUBIO: Well, first let me say the most important job of president is commander in chief. Being president is not like being a senator, but it\u2019s not like being a governor either. It\u2019s a unique office unlike any other in the world. And if all \u2014 if you look at the entire Republican field, no one running for president has more experience or shown better judgment over the last five years on the issues of national security than I have. I\u2019m proud of the things we have achieved in my time there. We brought accountable to the V.A. I helped lead an effort that got rid of the Obamacare bailout fund. Just a month ago, in a bipartisan way, I helped impose additional sanctions on Hezbollah. And I also have if experience of accomplishments as speaker of the House. But this election is about the future, about what kind of country we are going to leave for our children in 21st century, the number one role of the federal government and the president is to be commander in chief, and keep us safe. I will do that. And I\u2019ve got more experience and have shown better judgment on those issues than any of the other candidates in this field.\n\nJust when Rubio thought he had powered through it, though, Wallace called \u201cbullshit\u201d on his claim to have ended the \u201cObamacare bailout.\u201d Rubio\u2019s argument seems to be that it doesn\u2019t much matter who actually did a thing, as long as Rubio was FIRST! in the comments section about it (emphasis mine):\n\nWALLACE: I want to pick up on one of the accomplishments you have mentioned. And you have said often that you led the effort to end the bailouts, the so-called \u201crisk corridors\u201d for Obamacare which could have protected insurance companies who lost money on premiums. Here you are talking about. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUBIO: I\u2019m always the only one running president that\u2019s ever done anything against Obamacare. Not a speech, but I actually achieved something. I led the effort and we got rid of the bailout fund, which may very well lead to the collapse of Obamacare. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALLACE: But, Senator, while you certainly did speak out on the issue, it was other Republicans who actually put that provision in a spending bill that Obama was forced to signings which put it into effect. In fact, you voted against that spending bill. And the fact checkers at \u201cThe Washington Post\u201d gave you, as we put it up on the screen, four Pinocchios for your claim in this regard. How do you respond, sir? RUBIO: Well, they\u2019re wrong. First of all, the reason why it was inserted into that budget to begin with is because I was the first one to raise and I spent a year and a half pushing this issue, communicating with the speaker\u2019s office, communicating with the majority leader\u2019s office, communicating with my colleagues. For a year and a half, I was the only one even talking about the risk corridor, the Obamacare bailout. It happened because we led the effort on it. Did someone else physically type it up and insert it in the bill? That\u2019s absurd. Maybe, but that\u2019s not the issue here. The issue is, who led the effort in achieving that? And from everyone that was watching this from the very beginning, to the editorials around this country \u2014 I believe \u201cThe New York Times\u201d wrote one saying how Marco Rubio has done something that\u2019s going to lead to the collapse of Obamacare. No one can dispute that we led the effort. We raised this issue. We pushed this the entire time. And had it not been for our efforts, the Obamacare bailout may very well still be there in law.\n\nYes, it\u2019s absurd to point out that Marco Rubio didn\u2019t do the thing he said he did. What were we thinking? But this is no mere technicality, as Rubio makes it out to be. It goes to the heart of Wallace\u2019s question, which was about legislative accomplishments. Rubio voted against the bill that he didn\u2019t insert anything into, but claimed he did. That\u2019s \u201clegislative,\u201d if not an \u201caccomplishment.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s answer is partially correct, even the many fact-checkers who have debunked his specific claim to have \u201cinserted\u201d a provision limiting risk corridor payments into a spending bill concede that he was an early and persistent voice on the issue. That\u2019s not the point, though. Wallace asked him for a legislative accomplishment, not an example of sustained and influential shit-talk. Rubio\u2019s running to be president, not to be Rush Limbaugh. Even if you give Rubio the benefit of the doubt here, he has only proven that even when he\u2019s way out in front on an issue, he can\u2019t get it done.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On this week's Fox News Sunday, Rubio wanted to bask in the afterglow of his endorsement by The Des Moines Register, but host Chris Wallace had to go and throw", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wallacerubio-1.jpg", "title": "Chris Wallace Busts Marco Rubio Hard Over Bogus Obamacare Claim"}, "twitter": {"description": "On this week's Fox News Sunday, Rubio wanted to bask in the afterglow of his endorsement by The Des Moines Register, but host Chris Wallace had to go and throw a poison pill into the mix.", "title": "Chris Wallace Busts Marco Rubio Hard Over Bogus Obamacare Claim", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wallacerubio-1.jpg", "creator": "@TommyXtopher", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2016-01-24T18:09:20+00:00", "keywords": "columnists,election 2016,opinion,tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "For a year and a half, I was the only one even talking about the risk corridor, the Obamacare bailout.\nAnd had it not been for our efforts, the Obamacare bailout may very well still be there in law.\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUBIO: I\u2019m always the only one running president that\u2019s ever done anything against Obamacare.\nI helped lead an effort that got rid of the Obamacare bailout fund.\nFirst, Wallace asked Rubio to take on the criticism that he lacks the experience to be president, and to name his favorite legislative accomplishment."}
