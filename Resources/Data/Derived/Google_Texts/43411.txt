Tucson Police say four pedestrians were hit by a vehicle Saturday night near the University of Arizona campus. Investigators say the driver, identified as 45-year-old Gerald D. Taylor, fled the scene but later turned himself in to police.

Traffic detectives said a group of five students were crossing North Euclid Avenue in a crosswalk near East Fifth Street. Police say the group waited for traffic to stop, but Taylor drove through it, hitting four of the students.

Two students were treated for serious injuries, one for minor injuries, and one has life-threatening injuries.

Taylor allegedly had three children in his car at the time, and police say speed and alcohol were factors in the accident. He was booked into the Pima County jail on nine counts including aggravated DUI, child abuse, and leaving the scene of a serious injury accident.
