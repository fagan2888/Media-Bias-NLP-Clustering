Joe Heck, R-Nev., and his Democratic opponent, Erin Bilbray, is playing out like an episode of \u201cFamily Feud\u201d with lots of laughs and smiles.\n\nThat\u2019s the impression you get after watching the contenders\u2019 latest TV commercials \u2014 Bilbray\u2019s first and Heck\u2019s second. They\u2019re both positive 30-second spots featuring their children talking about how great mom and dad are.\n\nThe Bilbray ad, titled \u201cfighter,\u201d stars her 12-year-old daughter, Caroline, who gets up at 5 a.m. to work out because she wants to be a Navy fighter pilot when she grows up. She does sit-ups and runs before breakfast.\n\n\u201cI get up early every day,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what my mom taught me if I want to be a Navy jet fighter pilot.\u201d\n\nThen she turns to politics.\n\n\u201cMy mom, Erin Bilbray, is running for Congress to help our community \u2014 like when she and dad started a free clinic to take care of kids,\u201d Caroline says.\n\nThen a picture of her grandfather in uniform appears.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll protect veterans, making it illegal to cut their benefits,\u201d Caroline says.\n\nBilbray, a longtime political activist who started an organization to train women Democrats to run for office, then has her daughter say that political parties don\u2019t matter, a new message for Bilbray\u2019s campaign as the Nov. 4 general election approaches. Bilbray also is Nevada\u2019s Democratic committeewoman, a position in the national party.\n\nNonetheless, Caroline says, \u201cMom says it shouldn\u2019t matter what party you belong to.\u201d\n\nThen she heads to the breakfast counter to join her parents and her little sister, Daisy, 8.\n\n\u201cMy mom lives by the rule,\u201d Caroline says, and Bilbray picks up the line: \u201cNever make a promise you can\u2019t keep.\u201d\n\nDaisy rolls her eyes, \u201cI knew you would say that,\u201d prompting laughter all around.\n\nThe TV spot \u2014 which can be seen here http://youtu.be/S1YRsTOygcU \u2014 is running for two weeks on cable TV \u2014 at a cost of $153,252, according to the Bilbray campaign.\n\nHeck\u2019s ad also stars his children, daughters Monica and Chelsea and son Joey, who sit together, talking directly to the camera. Monica notes the family\u2019s life changed when Heck became a congressman. He\u2019s running for a third term.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s the same guy he\u2019s always been,\u201d says Chelsea.\n\nThen each of the children talk about various aspects of Heck\u2019s life, holding photographs up to illustrate their points.\n\nJoey holds up a picture of Heck, an Army Reserve officer, in uniform while serving a tour in Iraq.\n\n\u201cAs a veteran he fights to improve the lives of our American heroes returning from battle,\u201d Joey says.\n\nChelsea shows a picture of Heck, a physician, in his white hospital jacket.\n\n\u201cHe saved lives in Iraq and right here at home,\u201d Chelsea says.\n\nAnd Monica emphasizes Heck the family man.\n\n\u201cThe values he teaches us \u2014 faith, family and community \u2014 are the same values he takes to Washington,\u201d Monica says. \u201cThat\u2019s why we love him and he\u2019s a great congressman.\u201d\n\nThe spot ends with Heck, his wife and kids sharing pizza in the kitchen, all smiles.\n\nThe new TV ad, which can be seen here \u2014 http://youtu.be/TqHePmEoZx0 \u2014 is running for two weeks on both cable and broadcast television at a cost of just under $200,000, according to his campaign.\n\nThe contest for the 3rd Congressional District in Southern Nevada is the most competitive among the state\u2019s four congressional seats because it\u2019s evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats. But Heck is considered the favorite to win re-election, according to analysts, as Bilbray struggles to gain traction.\n\n\u2014 Laura Myers\n\nYUCCA FLAME STILL DIM\n\nNevada leaders last month set aside $1.4 million to continue battling the Yucca Mountain program. But in Washington, the head of the agency charged with evaluating the controversial nuclear waste site indicated last week the issue sits on the far back burner.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission is under court order to continue working toward a final decision on Yucca, at least until a dwindling sum in the agency\u2019s nuclear waste fund runs out. Accordingly, analysts are finalizing volumes of safety studies, preparing a supplement to a groundwater impact statement and cataloguing thousands of documents into the NRC\u2019s electronic library.\n\nOf $13.5 million remaining in the Yucca Mountain fund, about $6 million has been spent so far. The NRC estimates the tasks will consume about $10 million total, according to a monthly report issued Aug. 26.\n\nWhatever dollars will be left over are nowhere near the millions that would be needed to reach a formal decision whether the site 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas would be safe to store highly radioactive material. The process includes drawn-out legal proceedings in which administrative judges would weigh more than 300 technical challenges that have already been filed on site safety, with probably more to come.\n\nIt remains to be seen what the NRC\u2019s next step might be, a point that could come in the spring. At an Energy Daily gathering with reporters last week, NRC Chairman Allison Macfarlane gave no clues, saying she was not certain herself.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t know, we\u2019ll have to see,\u201d Macfarlane said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we have to constantly check in about.\u201d\n\nMacfarlane said she is satisfied the NRC is complying with the court order, the result of a lawsuit charging the agency prematurely halted its work after the Obama administration in 2009 dropped support for Yucca Mountain as a nuclear site.\n\nJudges \u201csaid continue the license process with the funds available, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Macfarlane said, adding it would be difficult to move forward in any case because the Department of Energy wants to withdraw as the project applicant. Once the nuclear waste fund is exhausted, so would the NRC\u2019s role.\n\nIn Carson City, however, Nevada officials believe they still must prepare to see the Yucca project through to the end \u2014 or to remain vigilant if by some eventuality the program is resurrected.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at this very seriously,\u201d said Bob Halstead, director of the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects.\n\nState officials are guessing NRC could have between $1 million and $3 million left over after its ongoing tasks are completed. That might be enough money to initiate the next phase of legal proceedings, if not to complete them.\n\n\u2014 Steve Tetreault\n\nBAD FEELINGS IN NEW JERSEY\n\nWhile Nevada basked in the glow of winning the $5 billion Tesla Motors\u2019 battery plant, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and others debated the future of the Boardwalk\u2019s gaming market.\n\nA source in Christie\u2019s office said New Jersey had early discussions with Tesla representatives a year ago about locating the plant in the Garden State.\n\nOne problem existed, however: New Jersey\u2019s law banning direct sales of cars unless they were handled by an auto franchise dealer. New Jersey is one of 48 states which ban or in some way limit direct car sales.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office told Tesla leaders to bring the matter up with the New Jersey Legislature. Get a bill passed that allows Tesla to bypass auto dealers, and Christie would happily sign the legislation.\n\nBut, according to the source, Tesla never moved forward with the legislation and blamed Christie for inaction. Those comments incensed the governor.\n\nThis might be the last time Tesla representatives ever set foot across New Jersey state lines.\n\n\u2014 Howard Stutz\n\nContact Laura Myers at lmyers@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2919.
