Willow\n\nUnlike many current dating apps, \u201cWillow\u201d users' first impression of their potential soul mate isn\u2019t based on physical appearance.\n\nTinder, Grindr, and Down Dating are among many dating apps encouraging users to find a potential partner based on a \"hot or not\" system. Determined to put the social back in social media, Willow wants it users to answer a set of personality questions before showing their pictures. The app is free to download, and a Facebook account is required in order to link your account to the app.\n\nUpon linking the app to your Facebook account, a geo-locator is used to pin point other people in your area. You will then be asked three questions the user has created. Potential questions can range from more serious, such as, \u201cWho are some of your personal heroes that have influenced your life?\u201d to much sillier, \u201cIf your hair was a type of pasta, what kind of pasta would it be?\u201d You have the option to skip questions you don\u2019t like and answer the ones you do. When you\u2019re comfortable, you may reveal your photos.\n\n\u201cWhat I realized was missing from a dating app, or an app that is meant to be social was an actual conversational aspect,\u201d Willow founder, Michael Bruch, told Elle. \u201cI wanted to create an app that got people talking.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three-year-old Bruch came up with the concept while attending a guest lecture at New York University on empathy. From the lecture, he learned humans are more empathetic than we think, and then he decided to create an app reflecting this, while serving the dating community. Willow\u2019s tagline is: \u201cBranch Out.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, you are willing to talk to a large variety of people, depending on what they have to say,\u201d Bruch told Elle. \u201cSocial media should reflect that. Human interaction is more complicated than just a picture.\u201d\n\nWillow was released Aug. 6 and is available to download from the iTunes Store. Willow is currently only available for iOS but is coming to Android soon.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "willow dating app, online dating, brains before beauty", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Unlike many other popular dating apps, \u201cWillow\u201d prompts its users to ask personality questions before revealing what they look like.", "title": "New Dating App Asks You To Put Brains Before Beauty", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brains-beauty-new-dating-app-willow-asks-personality-questions-showing-pictures-297522", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/11/willow-app-screen-shot_2.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Unlike many other popular dating apps, \u201cWillow\u201d prompts its users to ask personality questions before revealing what they look like.", "title": "New Dating App Asks You To Put Brains Before Beauty", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brains-beauty-new-dating-app-willow-asks-personality-questions-showing-pictures-297522", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/11/willow-app-screen-shot_2.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/11/willow-app-screen-shot_2.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-08-11T12:19:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-11T12:19:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Unlike many other popular dating apps, \u201cWillow\u201d prompts its users to ask personality questions before revealing what they look like."}, "article_summary": "Dating app \u201cWillow\u201d gives its users the opportunity to get to know each other before revealing their physical appearance.\nDetermined to put the social back in social media, Willow wants it users to answer a set of personality questions before showing their pictures.\nWillowUnlike many current dating apps, \u201cWillow\u201d users' first impression of their potential soul mate isn\u2019t based on physical appearance.\n\u201cWhat I realized was missing from a dating app, or an app that is meant to be social was an actual conversational aspect,\u201d Willow founder, Michael Bruch, told Elle.\nThe app is free to download, and a Facebook account is required in order to link your account to the app."}
