More than 30 ambulances were called to help patients overwhelmed by the sewage from a leak in San Gabriel. Kate Larsen reports for the NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on Friday, June 5, 2015. (Published Friday, June 5, 2015)

A sewer line broke Friday night near a San Gabriel convalescent home, prompting a "shelter-in-place" order.

In total 15 residents from the Vista Cove home in the area of South Arroyo Drive and West Santa Anita Street were taken to sister facilities, but a larger evacuation was averted after the sewage system was restored, a San Gabriel Fire Department spokesman said.

The problem, which caused a backup and spill, was initially reported at around 9:11 p.m. and the system was again operational at around 11 p.m.

More than 30 ambulances were parked at the facility in case an emergency evacuation of all 86 Vista Cove residents had to be carried out after the city sewer line ruptured.

Four apartment buildings were also affected, however it was hoped residents would be able to return to their homes after restoration companies evaluated any sewage spill damage.

There were no injuries due to the incident.
