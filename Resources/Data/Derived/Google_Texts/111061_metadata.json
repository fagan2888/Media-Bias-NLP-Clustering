BMW\u2019s model nomenclature is now even-numbered for coupes (2, 4 and 6) and odd-numbered for four-doors (3, 5 and 7). Thus, the 328ix I reviewed in December was a four-door sedan, the 435ix was a two-door.\n\nBeneath the hood of the new M235i is a 320-horsepower, 3.0-liter inline-6-cylinder engine, twin-scroll turbocharged with direct-injection, mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission.\n\nSlip down into the relatively narrow, bolstered, thigh-lengthened driver\u2019s sport seat and participate in the performance. Push the Sport button on the center console and move the shifter into manual mode for more sensitive throttle and quickened shifts. In Sport mode, the coupe will run 0 to 60 in fewer than 5 seconds.\n\nElectronically controlled, sport-tuned dampers enhance the car\u2019s handling. Adding to the impression is the sound emitting from the dual exhausts. The combination of grip and rolling ease is gained from Michelin Pilot Super Sport 225/40ZR18 tires. Adding security are larger M Sport brakes, 13.4-inch discs in front and 13.6 at the rear.\n\nThe coupe\u2019s rear seat lacks legroom and headroom. Access and egress are okay, as the front seats, with push of a lever, slide far forward for open space to crawl through. The small coupe is bigger than expected in the luggage compartment \u2013 13.8 cubic feet.\n\nEven at its curb weight of 3,535 pounds, this is one of the smaller BMWs I\u2019ve driven in recent years. Smallest was the Z3 back in the late \u201990s. One of the most fun to drive was the 1999 M Coupe, based on the Z3 chassis. The M Coupe, with a long hood and odd-looking rear end, stood only 50 inches in height and was barely over 13 feet in length. Above the rear wheel arches, the body tucked in sharply to rear-quarter windows. It was a rough rider, yet so much fun to drive \u2013 a great handler. Under the hood, of course, was an inline-6, generating 240 horsepower and 236 lb.-ft. of torque. In the upper left-hand corner of the windshield was a small-type notice reading, \u201cOver the car\u2019s first 1,200 miles don\u2019t use full throttle and don\u2019t exceed 106 miles per hour; and over the first 3,100 miles don\u2019t exceed137 miles per hour.\u201d\n\nThe M package pushed sticker price on the 2014 coupe to $46,025. That\u2019s $5,000 higher than a 2014 328i xDrive GT I reviewed five months ago and $10,000 higher than a \u201914 320i xDrive about that same time.\n\nMelbourne red metallic exterior with M badging and black leather interior with alcantra headliner highlighted the overall appearance. The coupe was equipped with moonroof, fine-wood trim, automatic climate control, navigation and AM/FM/CD/MP3 with hands-free Bluetooth and USB, xenon headlights and retractable headlight washers.\n\nThe 235 has two usable cupholders, never a priority with BMW, at the front of the center console.\n\nThe M235i averaged 23.4 miles per gallon, at the lower end of its 22/32 EPA estimate.\n\nAdding interest for U.S. luxury-make consumers is recent talk from Leipzig, Germany, where the M235i Coupe is built, that within the next year it will be available in this country with BMW\u2019s xDrive all-wheel-drive system.\n\nBud, I read your column every week and, partially upon your writing, I purchased a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee loaded. And (in regards to your column last week), to think I could have purchased a Kia for the same amount. The Jeep will climb circles around any Korean vehicle. And you can keep the moonroof, as Colorado is the skin cancer capital of the nation. Thanks for your articles. \u2013 B.R.\n\nWell, Brent, I can find lots of favorables for both the Grand Cherokee and the Sorento. I will tell you, though, when we host the annual family Christmas gathering, it looks like a Jeep convention outside our home.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fa7\"", "article_summary": "Matching that request is the 2014 BMW M235i Coupe, which reached showrooms two months ago.\nOne of the most fun to drive was the 1999 M Coupe, based on the Z3 chassis.\nAdding security are larger M Sport brakes, 13.4-inch discs in front and 13.6 at the rear.\nThe M Coupe, with a long hood and odd-looking rear end, stood only 50 inches in height and was barely over 13 feet in length.\nBMW\u2019s model nomenclature is now even-numbered for coupes (2, 4 and 6) and odd-numbered for four-doors (3, 5 and 7)."}
