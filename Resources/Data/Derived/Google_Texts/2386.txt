With defenseman Nate Schmidt expected to miss six to eight weeks with a broken shoulder, Steve Oleksy was recalled from Hershey on Tuesday, two days after he was reassigned to the minor leagues following a one-day stint.

The back-and-forth for Olesky should subside for quite some time, as coach Barry Trotz said that Oleksy will remain with the Capitals until at least the all-star break, which will begin following their game against Edmonton on Jan. 20.

Oleksy, who hasn’t played for the Capitals this season, has four goals, seven assists and 85 penalty minutes in 35 games with the Bears. He played in 33 games for Washington last season and in 28 games with the Capitals in 2012-13.

Schmidt, who hadn’t been playing for the Capitals, was sent to Hershey for a two-game series against Norfolk over the weekend and was injured on a hit into the end boards on Sunday. Trotz said Monday he won’t require surgery.
