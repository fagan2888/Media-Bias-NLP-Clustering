DonkeyHotey, CC BY 2.0\n\nWith the government shutdown entering its second week and a widespread consensus that blames Republicans for putting the country to its knees, a new study sheds light on the thought process that led many Republicans, especially those who are ultra-conservative, to become so stubborn that they would have rather furloughed 800,000 federal employees than allowed a spending bill with funds delegated to Obamacare to pass. But these thought processes aren\u2019t unique to Republicans, but instead, apply to anyone who vehemently believes their opinions to be the truth, and nothing but the truth.\n\nCongressional Republicans, such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, passionately fought to cut out Obamacare funding from the spending bill in the weeks leading up to the imminent shutdown. He argued that he was defending the beliefs of the American people. He wasn\u2019t the only one to argue that point. Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) told Fox News Channel that this is \u201cabout the happiest she\u2019s seen Republicans in a long time because we\u2019ve seen we\u2019re starting to win this dialogue on a national level.\u201d Meanwhile, Rep. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) told Newsmax regarding Democrats, \u201cThey need to look in the mirror, because they\u2019re the ones to blame. They\u2019re the ones that shut the government down.\u201d\n\nThis kind of dogmatic view that Republicans have been in the right all along is known as \u201cbelief superiority,\u201d researchers of the study said, and it\u2019s not unique to only Republicans. The Duke University researchers wanted to see if extreme views of both liberals and conservatives showed signs of belief superiority, as opposed to more moderate viewpoints.\n\nTo do this, they had 527 adults between 18 and 67 years old complete a nine question survey on hot button issues. They were also asked to discuss how superior they felt about their opinions. The questionnaire's topics included:\n\n\u00b7 health care (the degree to which health care should be covered by the government or by private insurance)\n\n\u00b7 illegal immigration (the degree to which people who enter the country illegally should be dealt with more strictly or more leniently than at present);\n\n\u00b7 abortion (the conditions under which abortion should be legal)\n\n\u00b7 the degree to which national and state laws should be based on religious beliefs.\n\nAs expected, participants whose responses were further toward the extremes of each topic also felt that their opinions were the end all be all of the subject. \u201cThese findings help explain why politicians with more extreme views can\u2019t reach across the aisle,\u201d Kaitlin Toner, lead author of the study, said in a statement. \u201cAs more extreme candidates get elected to Congress, compromise becomes more difficult and deadlocks increase because those with more extreme views are more certain they are right.\u201d\n\nBut the researchers said that having confidence in one extreme is \"not limited to politics. Anytime people hold an extreme position, even on a trivial issue, they seem to think their views are better than anyone else's,\" Dr. Mark Leary, who supervised the research, said in the statement.\n\nSo it makes sense that our government has shutdown. Leading up to the shutdown, House Republicans refused to omit language that they inserted into the appropriations bill to defund Obamacare. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats refused to pass the bill with that language in it. Both sides are still adamant about their positions, however, two possible solutions have emerged:\n\nDemocrats began passing around a \u201cdischarge petition\u201d on Friday that would force a vote on the spending bill and reopen the government if its gets the majority of House signatures. This would go against House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s claim that the House doesn\u2019t have enough votes for the Democratically-proposed \u201cclean bill,\u201d which wouldn\u2019t contain any alterations to Obamacare, CBS reported.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, are looking to force negotiations when Congress convenes to negotiate a bill that would raise the debt ceiling, a bill that must be passed in order for the country to avoid defaulting on its loans. Yet, President Obama refuses to negotiate on the debt ceiling because he believes it would set a precedent that a looming default could be used as leverage in budget negotiations, according to USA Today.\n\n\u201cThe hard right says, \u2018see, by holding a gun to their heads, we got something that we wanted. We\u2019ll up the ante this time,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told CBS. \u201c\u2026You can\u2019t call for that legislative blackmail or it will get worse and worse and worse.\u201d\n\nSource: Toner K, Leary M, Asher M, et al.
