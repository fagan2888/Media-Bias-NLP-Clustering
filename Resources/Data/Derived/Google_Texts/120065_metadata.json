Hereafter, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d will be called \u201cObamacare,\u201d not for derogatory reasons but because the official name of the bill misrepresents what it is.\n\nLawsuits challenging Obamacare on both issues are currently pending. Sissel v. HHS and Hotze v. Sebelius challenge the law under the Origination Clause, and are likely on their way to the Supreme Court, with stops currently at the D.C. Circuit and the Fifth Circuit Courts of Appeals respectively. In Sissel v. HHS, 44 members of Congress signed an amici curiae brief in support of the plaintiff-appellant\u2019s position. Another lawsuit in Wisconsin, Association of American Physicians & Surgeons v. IRS, presents a Tenth Amendment frontal assault on what remains of the ACA after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius.\n\nIn that case, the Court ruled 7 to 2 that the \u201cMedicaid expansion\u201d portion of Obamacare \u201cviolates the Constitution [i.e., the Tenth Amendment] by threatening existing Medicaid funding.\u201d In his decision, Chief Justice Roberts explained that \u201cCongress has no authority to order the States to regulate according to its instructions.\u201d This ruling, often overlooked by the media,was in the same case in which the Court, narrowly and conditionally, upheld the individual mandate under \u201cCongress\u2019s power to tax.\u201d\n\nThe Tenth Amendment foundation upon which the Supreme Court struck down one portion of Obamacare rests upon an earlier ruling that the federal government cannot \u201ccompel\u201d a state, as an independent sovereign in our country\u2019s federal system, to regulate. In that 1992 ruling, New York v. United States, the Court determined that \u201cthe Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States to regulate.\u201d As Justice Roberts noted \u2014 quoting Steward Machine Co. v. Davis (1937) \u2014 in the majority opinion in the 2012 landmark case, \u201cwhen \u2018pressure turns into compulsion,\u2019 the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism.\u201d While the states\u2019-rights challenge to the Medicaid expansion part of Obamacare in 2012 was based upon, and repeatedly cited, the 1992 precedent, the Supreme Court did not consider that same Tenth Amendment challenge to the individual mandate.\n\nThe 1992 opinion relied heavily upon a 1936 decision, United States v. Butler, for its explanation that \u201cthe Tenth Amendment confirms that the power of the Federal Government is subject to limits that may, in a given instance, reserve power to the States. . . . \u2018The question is not what power the Federal Government ought to have but what powers in fact have been given by the people.\u2019\u201d\n\nButler examined the constitutionality of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, a bill that enacted processing taxes on agricultural commodities. In striking down the law, the Court explained: \u201cThe act invades the reserved rights of the states. It is a statutory plan to regulate and control agricultural production, a matter beyond the powers delegated to the federal government. The tax, the appropriation of the funds raised, and the direction for their disbursement are but parts of the plan. They are but means to an unconstitutional end.\u201d\n\nThe Court further held in Butler that \u201cThe power of taxation, which is expressly granted, may, of course, be adopted as a means to carry into operation another power also expressly granted. But resort to the taxing power to effectuate an end which is not legitimate, not within the scope of the Constitution, is obviously inadmissible.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In other words, Congress cannot use its taxing power to allow it to control something it has no constitutional power to control.\n\nWittingly or not, the Chief Justice\u2019s 2012 conditional conclusion that the individual mandate \u201cis within Congress\u2019s power to tax\u201d was diametrically opposed to the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Butler. Then again, our current Supreme Court was standing more for a Constitution that was living, breathing, moving, and serpentining.\n\nIf one were simply to substitute Obamacare for the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, and \u201chealth care\u201d for \u201cagricultural production,\u201d the Court\u2019s 1936 constitutional analysis should still hold: \u201c[Obamacare] invades the reserved rights of the states. It is a statutory plan to regulate and control [health care], a matter beyond the powers delegated to the federal government. The tax, the appropriation of the funds raised, and the direction for their disbursement, are but parts of the plan.\u201d\n\nHow could something \u201cobviously inadmissible\u201d under the Tenth Amendment 78 years ago be conditionally approved by the Supreme Court in 2012, even as the Court was reaffirming the federalism principles underlying the Tenth Amendment in the same case? Sooner or later the U.S. Supreme Court should deal with the elephant it has brought into the room by ignoring clear Tenth Amendment precedent.\n\n\u2014 Representative Louie Gohmert is vice chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security.
