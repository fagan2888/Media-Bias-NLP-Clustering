Though there are numerous studies (see here, here, and here) that support the idea that viewing grossly unrealistic female body types can change girls\u2019 opinion of beauty, Barbie\u2019s lead designer, Kim Culmone, says that the doll was never meant to be realistic and, further, \u201cgirls\u2019 perceptions are so different than grown ups\u2019.\u201d In an interview with FastCo Design, Culmone proves what big business executives have proven time and time again: Female body image and mental well-being are not a priority when it comes to pushing product.\n\nThough Barbie\u2019s figure has changed slightly over the years, the doll has almost-always been described by psychologists and feminists alike as \u201cimpossibly-proportioned.\u201d According to a 1996 study entitled \u201cKen and Barbie at Life Size,\u201d Barbie\u2019s head is two inches larger than the average American woman\u2019s, her waist is 19 inches smaller, and her hips are about 11 inches smaller. But Culmone insists that Barbie\u2019s proportions are a result of trying to make clothes easily fit and shouldn\u2019t be considered in the context of creating an unattainable body prototype for young girls. The proportions, she says, allow for the doll clothes to accommodate the 11.5-inch fashion doll size more readily. Culmone also emphasized that while Mattel may be open to trying new Barbie bodies, part of the reason why they keep the size is for the doll to have a rich heritage, where parents can pass down old doll clothes to be used on newer models.\n\n\u201cEverything may not always be able to fit every doll, but it\u2019s important to me that the majority of it does, because that was my experience as a little girl,\u201d said Culmone. \u201cThere\u2019s an obligation to consistency. Unless for some reason in the future, there\u2019s a real reason to change the body \u2014 because of either a design imperative or functional imperative \u2014 heritage is important to us.\u201d\n\nSo tradition and good fabric are important to Culmone, but what about little girls\u2019 body image?\n\nCulmone, however noble her intentions may be, illustrates the disconnect between big business and a genuine concern for the mental health of females who tend to be deeply impacted by images like Barbie\u2019s. And she\u2019s not alone. Within the last year executives from big clothing brands like Abercrombie and Lululemon have come under fire for remarks made that are out of touch with the reality of what American girls and women look like, as well as how super-thin images influence female perception of beauty.\n\nLast year, Abercrombie & Fitch founder, Mike Jeffries, came under fire for remarks he made in a 2006 interview, which seemed to manifest into a continued exclusion of plus-sized women\u2019s clothing from the stores shelves. In the interview, Jeffries said that he wants fit, traditionally attractive people to buy Abercrombie\u2019s clothing and would be completely fine with excluding the rest of the fairly larger American public. \"Candidly, we go after the cool kids,\" he said. \"We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.\"\n\nBy May 2013, facing a threatened boycott of Abercrombie stores, Jeffries apologized for his \u201ccool kids\u201d comment, saying he resented his choice of words. The same can be said of former Lululemon chairman, Chip Wilson, who now-infamously said that \u201csome women\u2019s bodies just don\u2019t actually work\u201d for his company\u2019s yoga pants. He has since stepped down as chairman, according to Business Insider.\n\nTime and time again, company execs promote negative body image without even necessarily knowing it. By excluding certain sizes, they send women the message that there is a way they\u2019re supposed to look and the average American woman, at size 14, isn\u2019t it. Female perceptions of beauty are very malleable, and these companies contribute to how women \u2014 and girls, in the case of Barbie \u2014 perceive beauty.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "barbie designer, kim culmone, body image", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Barbie designer Kim Culmone doesn't think there's anything wrong with the doll's impossible proportions, proving once again that big business doesn't care about how it shapes girls' body image.", "title": "Why Is Big Business So Out Of Touch With How Products Impact Girls' Body Image?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/barbies-lead-designer-kim-culmone-proves-once-again-big-business-doesnt-care-about-girls-negative", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/04/shutterstock164790278.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Barbie designer Kim Culmone doesn't think there's anything wrong with the doll's impossible proportions, proving once again that big business doesn't care about how it shapes girls' body image.", "title": "Why Is Big Business So Out Of Touch With How Products Impact Girls' Body Image?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/barbies-lead-designer-kim-culmone-proves-once-again-big-business-doesnt-care-about-girls-negative", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/04/shutterstock164790278.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/04/shutterstock164790278.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-02-04T12:58:26-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-04T12:58:25-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Barbie designer Kim Culmone doesn't think there's anything wrong with the doll's impossible proportions, proving once again that big business doesn't care about how it shapes girls' body image."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7a2\"", "article_summary": "The proportions, she says, allow for the doll clothes to accommodate the 11.5-inch fashion doll size more readily.\nTime and time again, company execs promote negative body image without even necessarily knowing it.\nBut Culmone insists that Barbie\u2019s proportions are a result of trying to make clothes easily fit and shouldn\u2019t be considered in the context of creating an unattainable body prototype for young girls.\nFemale perceptions of beauty are very malleable, and these companies contribute to how women \u2014 and girls, in the case of Barbie \u2014 perceive beauty.\nUnless for some reason in the future, there\u2019s a real reason to change the body \u2014 because of either a design imperative or functional imperative \u2014 heritage is important to us.\u201dSo tradition and good fabric are important to Culmone, but what about little girls\u2019 body image?"}
