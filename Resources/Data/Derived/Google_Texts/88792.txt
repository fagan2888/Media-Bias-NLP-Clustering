Crews are on scene of a mobile home fire in just west of Rose Hill in Butler County.

Firefighters were called around 2 p.m. to the 1700 block of Ione Road. They arrived to find the home engulfed in flames.

The four people who lived there were not home at the time of the fire.

Jim Schmidt with the Rose Hill Fire Department said it took crews about 20 minutes to gain control of the blaze. Firefighters were able to save about half of the home and most of the family's belongings.

The cause is under investigation, and a damage estimate has yet to be determined.
