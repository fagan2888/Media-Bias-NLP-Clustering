Last April he gushed, \"I'm nerdy enough to actually think that\u2019s one of the coolest challenges you could ever imagine,\u201d according to a tweet by a Miami Herald reporter.\n\nGovernment reform almost never makes the cut as an issue during a presidential campaign. Barack Obama didn\u2019t make reform or innovation of government institutions a central plank of his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, and it\u2019s unlikely that few other than Bush will make a big deal of it during their run in 2016.\n\n\u201cNeither institutional innovation nor its fraternal twin, institutional reform, is likely to catch voter fancy,\u201d noted William A. Galston, a former domestic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton and a political scholar with the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cBoth sound too much like yawn-inducing \u2018government reorganization,\u201d Galston and his associate, Elizabeth H. McElvein, wrote in a Brookings blog post last week. \u201cWhen asked what the next president should do, issue experts and political pundits are far more likely to respond with lists of proposed policies, themes and narratives.\u201d\n\nYet, it would be a huge mistake to neglect institutional innovation, they wrote, especially when \u2013 as in the case of today \u2013 \u201cexisting institutions are failing to address the most serious issues of the day and are falling in the public\u2019s esteem.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Federal Tech Mess is Costing Taxpayers Billions\n\nThe need for a serious discussion by Republican and Democratic presidential aspirants couldn\u2019t be greater.\n\nIn highlighting the ongoing crisis in government last February, The Fiscal Times wrote, \u201cThe federal government is a rudderless behemoth \u2013 a massive, $3.7 trillion a year enterprise that is struggling to come to grips with a fast changing society, mind-boggling innovations in technology and business practices, and growing public impatience with bureaucratic ineptness, waste and corruption.\u201d\n\nGalston and McElvein spent five years exploring the problems of a dysfunctional government and contemplating the institutional reforms that might somehow turn things around.\n\nOne lesson they quickly learned was that galvanizing Congress and the executive branch to make needed changes is extremely difficult, because the \u201cdefault setting of every form of government\u201d is the status quo. \u201cOvercoming resistance and simple inertia is hard,\u201d they wrote, \u201call the more so because what exists is real and familiar while the proposed change is imagined and novel, unfamiliar and therefore threatening.\u201d\n\nRelated: 5 Government Reforms That Could Save Billions\n\n\u201cAlthough the details vary, it always takes energy and sustained commitment to move the status quo,\u201d they added.\n\nOver the years, government reform has come in all sorts of packages, from relatively small-bore fixes of existing agencies like the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Secret Service or the Internal Revenue Service, to far more ambitious overhauls of agencies or even the creation of new ones.\n\nMore fundamental restructuring or cutting edge innovation is much harder to achieve, and often it takes a cataclysmic event \u2013 such as the 9-11 attacks on the U.S. or the collapse of the housing market or banking system.\n\nRelated: Why Obama\u2019s Pitch for Government Reform Hit a Wall\n\nYet those innovations driven by dramatic events throughout history have had the most profound and lasting impact on the government and society, Galston and McElvein suggest. This is why they focused on what they described as \u201cthe kind of change that leads to the creation of new institutions rather than to the reform of existing ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe focus of the paper is on a specific kind of change, mainly innovation \u2013 creating something new that didn\u2019t exist before,\u201d Galston explained in an interview. \u201cThe issue of institutional change was far too broad to take on in single paper, and so the focus of this paper was on circumstances that seemed to require something brand new to step into a policy space and deal with it in a new way appropriate to the circumstances.\u201d\n\nAmong the case studies they used to illustrate their point:\n\nThe creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), a classic example of institutional innovation undertaken under extreme pressure \u2013 namely the threatened collapse of the nation\u2019s entire banking system.\n\nThe creation of the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 a major consolidation of law enforcement and immigration agencies undertaken in the shadow of the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil in modern times.\n\nThe creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which represents an incubated institutional innovation.\n\nThe creation of Federal Reserve System, which they described as an intermediate case that stands between the rapid, crisis-driven, consensual adoption of the FDIC and the much slower, bottom-up process that preceded the EPA.\n\nThe National Security Act of 1947 \u2013which responded to persistent problems and in the process established the post-war institutional architecture for intelligence, the military services, and national security policy-making.\n\nRelated: Smart Tax Reform Has to Account for This Massive Change\n\n\u201cThere is no single road to success for acute government innovations,\u201d Galston and McElvein concluded. \u201cSome reforms respond to acute problems at moments of crisis, while others seize windows of opportunity to address persistent problems. Some reflect the pressure of public opinion, while others are driven by consortia of insider experts and elected officials.\u201d\n\nOne obvious caveat, however: Creating new, innovative agencies might be a wise course; but allowing existing, moribund agencies to continue unchallenged leads to government bloat, wasted taxpayer dollars and ultimately an unsustainable federal government.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Florida governor J", "title": "Government Innovation \u2013 The Critical Issue Missing From the 2016 Campaign", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/26/Government-Innovation-Critical-Issue-Missing-2016-Campaign", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/26/Government-Innovation-Critical-Issue-Missing-2016-Campaign", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Florida governor J", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac4b\"", "article_summary": "The creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which represents an incubated institutional innovation.\n\u201cBoth sound too much like yawn-inducing \u2018government reorganization,\u201d Galston and his associate, Elizabeth H.
