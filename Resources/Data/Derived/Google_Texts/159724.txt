There are enough lessons to be learned by close games throughout a season that sometimes it's just nice to have fun, play and enjoy the game.

That's what the Colorado men's basketball team did on Saturday morning.

Seven different players scored in double figures, several set career highs in key statistical categories and the Buffaloes rolled to a 94-70 victory against Jackson State at Coors Events Center.

"It was more of a feel-good victory," CU head coach Tad Boyle said. "It's nice to have our guys be reinforced in a positive way."

CU (3-1), which had to gut out a 63-58 win against Wyoming on Wednesday, won its third in a row and did it by putting the Tigers (1-3) away early in the second half.

Pretty much all the final numbers indicated a blowout victory, including CU's shooting accuracy, which, at 62.2 percent, sizzled about as much as the 10,000 pieces of bacon handed out to fans before the game.

The number that stood out the most, however, was the 23 assists CU had on its 28 buckets. That is CU's highest assist total since having 24 against Northern Arizona on Dec. 21.

"I thought it was a great showing by our team," Boyle said. "I was really proud of our guys for playing together. When you have 23 assists on 28 baskets, it means you're playing together, you're sharing the ball."

Leading that charge were junior guards Askia Booker and Spencer Dinwiddie, who combined for 12 assists (six each).

"No. 1, that's a credit to my teammates for finishing plays," said Booker, whose six assists is a career high. "I can't do that without them. Those are things that we need (in order) to win. We can't have the ball stick in our hands too much. If we do that, it's easy to guard, but if we move, we're hard to guard and we'll win games like that."

The Buffs certainly weren't easy to guard on Saturday. They connected on 64 percent of their shots in the first half and 60 percent in the second.

Booker had his best all-around game, especially on offense. He was 6-for-10 from the floor en route to a season-best 15 points. He hit three 3-pointers.

"I got it going a little bit," said Booker, who also had five rebounds. "I thank coach for that, though. He told me to be aggressive and take shots when I'm open. He wants me to take good shots and I think I took pretty good shots today."

In addition to Booker, sophomore Xavier Talton and freshman Dustin Thomas both had a career-high 13 points; freshman Jaron Hopkins had a career-best 12 points; Dinwiddie and Josh Scott each had 11; and Wesley Gordon added 10.

"It felt really good," Hopkins said of the all-around production. "I feel like we're becoming more unselfish as a team. I don't think I've ever been a part of a team that (had seven players in double figures) and accomplished that, but that's a really good thing for us as a team."

It's the first time under Boyle that the Buffs have had seven double-figure scorers -- and only the second time they had as many as six. They were one off the school record of eight double-figure scorers, set Feb. 3, 1973, at Iowa State.

CU never trailed Jackson State and opened up a big lead with an 11-0 run early in the first half. Gordon had four points to kick-start that spurt, which gave the Buffs a 16-4 lead.

Jackson State never went away, though. Javeres Brent scored 14 first-half points, including hitting four of his seven 3-point attempts. Brent finished with 20 to lead the Tigers.

The Buffs took a 46-35 lead into intermission. Coming out of the break, Booker drained a 3 to start a 10-4 run.

Julysses Nobles kept Jackson State within striking distance for much of the second half. He had nine points, including four in a row to cut the CU lead to 70-58 with 8:20 to go.

CU responded to that with a 6-0 spurt, highlighted by Dinwiddie's breakaway dunk. A 3-pointer by Talton with 4:19 to go was the final dagger, giving CU an 82-61 lead. The Buffs outscored the Tigers 24-12 in the final 8 minutes.

"I think we took a step forward today in the right direction," Boyle said. "It's one game. We can't get too full of ourselves, but some positive things to build on, for sure."
