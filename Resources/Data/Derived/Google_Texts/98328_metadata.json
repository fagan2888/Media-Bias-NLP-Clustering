The one-page policy letter, signed by Maj. Gen. Charles Flynn, cited federal law that allows women to breast-feed on federal property but directed them to make \u201cevery attempt to cover the exposed breast.\u201d\n\n\u201cNursing mothers will not be subject to harassment, ridicule or intimidation,\u201d it said. \u201cAny individual who becomes disruptive, non-compliant or otherwise engages in similar uncooperative behavior will be asked to leave the facility or area.\u201d\n\nThe command pulled the new policy Wednesday and replaced it with a version that omits the requirement for women to nurse discreetly and attempt to cover their breasts. It also mandates that all nursing moms be given time and adequate facilities to pump breast milk or nurse, and says mothers are allowed to breast-feed in public locations without being harassed.\n\nDennis Drake, a spokesman for U.S. Army Hawaii, said the latest policy also replaces a July 2014 U.S. Army Garrison Hawaii policy with similar language requiring that women \u201cdiscreetly\u201d breast-feed and will help avoid confusion and ambiguity.\n\nThe Hawaii mea culpa comes a couple of months after the commander of Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho rescinded his policy that required non-military mothers to wear a cover or go to a designated room to breast-feed their babies.\n\nWithin a matter of days of enacting the new rule, the base was inundated with commander\u2019s action-line queries and complaints on its Facebook page. Members of a popular Facebook page for breast-feeding military moms largely condemned it as discriminatory, illegal and insensitive.\n\nAlthough some mothers saw the policy as a positive because it guaranteed them a private place to nurse, others said it made breast-feeding more complicated. Some infants refuse to nurse under a cover, and a mother with another small child in tow might not be able to move easily into a designated nursing area.\n\nWhen he rescinded the policy a week later, the base commander issued an apology and voiced support for public breast-feeding.\n\n\u201cI better understand the concerns regarding breast-feeding in public and am sorry individuals were offended,\u201d Col. David Iverson said in an April 23 statement. \u201cThe policy was not intended to ostracize anyone, and I regret it had that effect.\u201d\n\nMany questioned whether such policies are even legal, considering that federal law states that \u201ca woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a federal building or on federal property, if the woman and her child are otherwise authorized to be present at the location.\u201d\n\nBut Tech. Sgt. Samuel Morse, a Mountain Home AFB spokesman, said the federal law \u201cdoes not address one way or another the manner in which one may breast-feed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe (original) policy was crafted with the intention of protecting the rights of mothers who choose to breast-feed their children while also respecting other base personnel and families in public locations,\u201d he said.\n\nNo consistent policy\n\nMedical experts tout the health and emotional benefits of breast-feeding for both mother and infant, but should doing it in public trump the rights of others who find a bared breast offensive or sexual in nature?\n\n\u201cPeople care about it a lot, because breast-feeding is everywhere. It\u2019s in the media no matter whether you\u2019re in the military or not,\u201d said Robyn Roche-Paull, a Navy veteran, nurse, lactation consultant and author of \u201cBreastfeeding in Combat Boots.\u201d \u201cEverybody knows it\u2019s the best thing to do, and breast-feeding in public has really taken off.\n\n\u201cFor women to be told that they can\u2019t do so, it gets a lot of them up in arms because it\u2019s feeding a baby,\u201d she said. \u201cA baby needs to eat, that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201d\n\nMilitary policies on breast-feeding vary by branch of service. The Air Force, Navy and Marines have policies protecting servicemembers\u2019 right to breast-feed, either mandating or strongly encouraging commands to provide clean spaces \u2014 not restrooms \u2014 for pumping, and delaying deployments in the months after childbirth. The Army does not, though it does defer deployments postpartum.\n\nSpokesperson Tatjana Christian said that although the Army does not have a formal breastfeeding policy, it encourages mothers to take advantage of breast-feeding resources, including lactation support rooms and nursing mothers\u2019 programs.\n\nRep. Niki Tsongas, D-Mass., who is sponsoring a measure that would require the Army to develop its own breast-feeding policy, said the Mountain Home incident highlighted the need for an Army policy as well as for diligent congressional oversight of issues facing female troops.\n\n\u201cI think we take this as seriously as we do because of all the other issues we\u2019ve learned about in Congress that (military) women confront,\u201d she said, from sexual assault to a lack of body armor designed specifically for women.\n\nTsongas said she hears from some female servicemembers who feel supported by their command and others who don\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThese mothers were doing their best, but there was no set protocol in place,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lack of an appropriate place, a lack of understanding of how much time it could take. I know I\u2019ve had a number of my staff members become mothers, and it really is something you have to have the time to do properly and the support to take the time out to do it.\u201d\n\nMilitary makes strides\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breast-feeding an infant for the first six months, and a combination of breast-feeding and the introduction of solid foods until at least 12 months. It says breast-fed babies are healthier, and breast-feeding reduces the risks of sudden infant death syndrome and developing asthma or obesity later in life.\n\nTricare, the military\u2019s health insurance, recently announced that it will begin covering breast-feeding supplies such as pumps, which vary widely in price, from about $35 for manual pumps to $250 or more for electric versions, as well as breastfeeding counseling.\n\nLast year, 120,085 infants were born to Tricare-eligible beneficiaries.\n\nRoche-Paull, who also oversees the Breastfeeding in Combat Boots Facebook page, said the military has become more supportive of breast-feeding since the early 1990s when she entered the service. Then, she said, there were no regulations in place protecting sevicemembers\u2019 right to breast-feed. At a time when women were taking on more roles within the military, many were reluctant to push the issue.\n\n\u201cThere was no place to pump, there was no time to pump, there was nothing, plain and simple,\u201d she said. If you insisted on breast-feeding, \u201cyou were putting women back with all of the strides they were making, so why would you want to do that?\u201d\n\nRoche-Paull said \u201cthere\u2019s nothing to see\u201d when a woman is breastfeeding because the baby\u2019s head covers most of the breast, and that breasts in a sexual context are widely on display and nobody has a problem with it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I see more breasts hanging out in the magazine in the waiting area or on billboards on the way to base,\u201d she said.\n\nrowland.ashley@stripes.com\n\nTwitter: @Rowland_Stripes", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "For the second time in three months, a military command has quickly rescinded a breast-feeding policy that was seen as too restrictive by nursing mothers.", "description": "For the second time in three months, a military command has quickly rescinded a breast-feeding policy that was seen as too restrictive by nursing mothers.", "title": "Military bases struggle with breast-feeding policies", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "http://www.stripes.com/polopoly_fs/1.352991.1434624959!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_490/image.jpg", "site_name": "Stars and Stripes", "description": "For the second time in three months, a military command has quickly rescinded a breast-feeding policy that was seen as too restrictive by nursing mothers.", "title": "Military bases struggle with breast-feeding policies"}, "pinterest": "nopin", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "GOOGLEBOT": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 100001735654878, "page_id": 45623437315, "app_id": 165185360164551, "pages": 45623437315}, "google-site-verification": "hlKKPUwK4Mj52FGnItKp6N6dig0k7ssfOeVtcespZ_0", "keywords": "Army Pacific, Hawaii", "organization": "Stars and Stripes", "DC.subject": "Army Pacific, Hawaii", "DC.title": "Military bases struggle with breast-feeding policies"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd9c\"", "article_summary": "Members of a popular Facebook page for breast-feeding military moms largely condemned it as discriminatory, illegal and insensitive.\nWhen he rescinded the policy a week later, the base commander issued an apology and voiced support for public breast-feeding.\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 For the second time in three months, a military command has quickly rescinded a breast-feeding policy that was seen as too restrictive by nursing mothers.\nSpokesperson Tatjana Christian said that although the Army does not have a formal breastfeeding policy, it encourages mothers to take advantage of breast-feeding resources, including lactation support rooms and nursing mothers\u2019 programs.\n\u201cA baby needs to eat, that\u2019s what it comes down to.\u201dMilitary policies on breast-feeding vary by branch of service."}
