Russia is in the middle of a land grab in Europe and his political party is heading for an election that could doom his last two years in office, but President Obama thinks the best way to spend his time is calling celebrity Ryan Seacrest’s radio show to say he really does look sharp in jeans.

Actually, he said he looks “very sharp” in jeans.

Obama made the call Friday afternoon, as part of his nationwide sales pitch for the Obamacare scam. After he droned through the usual spiel – website, 800-number etc. – Seacrest asked him about his recent highly publicized trip to a Gap store in New York City (where he was headlining a couple of fundraisers to woo liberal “1 percenters” able to shell out big bucks to for the Democrat defenders.)

Seacrest ribbed Obama about a Gap sales woman who implied the president’s taste in blue jeans was as lacking as his approach to Vladimir Putin.

Obama’s response shows he takes personal offense more seriously than national defense. He’s been, like, “unfairly maligned.”

“The truth is, generally, I look very sharp in jeans,” Obama said. “There was one episode like four years ago in which I was wearing some loose jeans, mainly because I was out on the pitcher’s mound and I didn’t want to feel confined while I was pitching, and I think I’ve paid my penance for that. I got whacked pretty good. Since that time, my jeans fit very well.”

From another a less narcissistic president, a less artificial president – a guy named Mitt Romney comes to mind – this might have been funny, self-deprecating and friendly. From this president, from his tone and from his record, it sounded like he actually means it.

He really does think he looks sharp in jeans.

Very sharp.
