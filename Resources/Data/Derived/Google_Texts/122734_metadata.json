(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nFrom the day he took office, President Obama committed his administration to transparency and openness in government. Since 2009, agencies have undertaken unprecedented efforts to share information, including proactively posting more government records online and making data available to fuel innovation and entrepreneurship \u2014 more than 120,000 data sets are now available on data.gov.\n\nAgencies are building government systems and software in the open so taxpayers can see \u2014 and contribute to \u2014 what is created. This year, the administration published the first open-source budget. And the Obama administration was the first to release White House visitor logs on our website showing the 4 million visitors to the White House.\n\nOUR VIEW: Federal agencies stiff-arm FOIA requests\n\nIncreasingly, government agencies are operating with a \"default to open\" approach.\n\nThe administration also continues to make important strides in improving the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) process.\n\nDespite a historically high demand for records over the past six years, challenging fiscal realities and decreased staffing, agencies have processed more than 3.8 million requests.\n\nAgencies have released records either in full or in part for more than 90% of requests processed for disclosure. The most commonly cited FOIA exemptions were those that protect personal privacy, while the exemption related to national security on average accounted for only 1%.\n\nTo ensure that policies and practices of government reflect the ideas and expertise of the American people, we launched We the People, where more than 15 million users have signed more than 360,000 petitions. In January, we published the Public Participation Playbook in the open with participation from the public, giving agencies a toolkit to further enhance public engagement.\n\nWhile there is always more work to be done, this administration continues to demonstrate its commitment to improving open government and increasing transparency.\n\nWe invite the public to continue participating in this important work.\n\nCorinna Zarek is senior adviser for Open Government to the U.S. chief technology officer, in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nMelanie Pustay is director of the Office of Information Policy at the Department of Justice.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1baZiK8", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Agencies have released records either in full or in part for more than 90% of requests processed for disclosure.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Agencies have released records either in full or in part for more than 90% of requests processed for disclosure.", "title": "White House: We're committed to openness", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/15/white-house-foia-datagov-we-the-people-editorials-debates/24823241/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Agencies have released records either in full or in part for more than 90% of requests processed for disclosure.", "title": "White House: We're committed to openness", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/92710f00dd0b47470dfed9b4d95d4830779d934f/c=181-0-864-683&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/03/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635620463503489457-OPPOSE.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Topics/Editorials and Debates", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Topics/Editorials and Debates", "title": "White House: We're committed to openness", "author": "Corinna Zarek and Melanie Pustay", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a4d47cae3767bfd18aa25a2953a425577478a2aa/c=356-0-868-683/local/-/media/2015/03/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635620463503489457-OPPOSE.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e2a9eed9deb43acbddfd2ee2662de3cef60ac89/c=181-0-864-683/local/-/media/2015/03/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635620463503489457-OPPOSE.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a365a38238d280539d9927a8c9dc4a4628d130d/c=58-0-966-683/local/-/media/2015/03/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635620463503489457-OPPOSE.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/547a220f236de3b9c488b2888dc57ab4c2701b96/c=0-105-1023-683&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/03/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635620463503489457-OPPOSE.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-03-15T20:01:49.190000-04:00", "shorthed": "White House: Committed to openness", "articleid": 24823241, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f02a958f8e3aefc58c09599f576b304b0d6ee476/c=0-105-1023-683/local/-/media/2015/03/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635620463503489457-OPPOSE.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fcc48a6f75809aa26b6666adf7370bbd6aaf039f/c=632-0-1014-683/local/-/media/2015/03/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/635620463503489457-OPPOSE.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "White House, FOIA, data.gov, We the People, Public Participation Playbook, President, Obama, editorials, debates,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe27f7\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)From the day he took office, President Obama committed his administration to transparency and openness in government.\nAnd the Obama administration was the first to release White House visitor logs on our website showing the 4 million visitors to the White House.\nAgencies are building government systems and software in the open so taxpayers can see \u2014 and contribute to \u2014 what is created.\nAgencies have released records either in full or in part for more than 90% of requests processed for disclosure.\nIn January, we published the Public Participation Playbook in the open with participation from the public, giving agencies a toolkit to further enhance public engagement."}
