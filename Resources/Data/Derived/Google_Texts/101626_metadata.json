The two companies born out of SAIC\u2019s split last year were supposed to go down different paths, but few expected it to be like this. (J. Lawler Duggan for Capital Business/Zaid Hamid for Leidos)\n\nTwo summers ago, Science Applications International Corp., one of the Washington\u2019s region\u2019s biggest companies, made a surprising announcement.\n\nAfter more than four decades of operation, the government services contractor was going to split in two. SAIC would spin off a $4 billion publicly-traded unit bearing its name. The parent company would rebrand itself \u201cLeidos,\u201d derived from the word kaleidoscope, which reflected its effort to unite solutions from different angles.\n\nThe reasoning for the split made sense at the time. SAIC\u2019s old way of doing business \u2014 where units offering similar services operated in silos \u2014 meant the company often got in its own way because of organizational conflicts of interest, executives said. Its sprawling bureaucracy made it difficult to chase new markets.\n\nSo the company divvied up its operating segments. New SAIC, headquartered in McLean, would focus on helping government customers manage IT systems and provide technical services, an area of expertise for the former SAIC. Leidos, which moved to Reston, would continue old SAIC\u2019s work in the field of national security, and target the commercial sector with its emerging health and engineering offerings.\n\nOn Sept. 27, 2013, the companies went their separate ways, just four days before the government entered a shutdown. SAIC\u2019s chief executive, former Air Force chief of staff John P. Jumper, assumed the helm at Leidos. Anthony J. Moraco, the head of the previous company\u2019s intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance group, was appointed to lead the new SAIC.\n\nView a comparison of SAIC and Leidos stocks. Amounts shown are non-adjusted.\n\nLeidos walked away from the deal with the company\u2019s more-promising business units and an established leadership team, according to analysts. New SAIC\u2019s mandate was to keep the legacy business going and ensure a smooth transition for government customers whom the company had been serving for decades, chief executive Moraco said.\n\nOne year later, a glance at the stock charts of both companies shows a stark contrast.\n\nLeidos has yet to win over Wall Street. It posted a loss of $438 million in its most-recent fiscal quarter, dragged down by its sagging commercial health-care business and losses related to an underperforming power plant in Connecticut.\n\nInvestors, meanwhile, have warmed to SAIC. After a rocky start, its profits have risen over the past two quarters.\n\nThe stock market performances reflect different perceptions for companies dealing with many of the same overarching issues. Sales at both companies are down, a result of the slowdown in federal spending that has hit most government contractors.\n\nFew in the industry expected the companies\u2019 fortunes to take such diverging paths in so short a time. And it can be tricky to make an apples-to-apples comparison between the two companies, said Roman Schweizer, a defense policy analyst at Guggenheim Partners.\n\nLeidos aimed to forge its way in new markets; SAIC planned to stick to its knitting. One year isn\u2019t long enough to judge a company\u2019s strategy, added Michael Lewis, managing director of McLean-based Silverline Group, and an investor in Leidos.\n\n\u201cI think we need to give them at least 24 to 36 months\u201d before saying whether Leidos made a mistake, Lewis said.\n\nHealth-care, energy losses\n\nLeidos\u2019s foray into health care and renewable energy is the main reason for its lackluster performance, analysts say.\n\n\u201cAnytime we see a big federal company buying a commercial practice, often it doesn\u2019t end up very well,\u201d said William Loomis, managing director at St. Louis-based financial services firm Stifel Nicolaus, which invests in both companies.\n\nThat\u2019s because the commercial market is different from the government market, he said.\n\n\u201cWhile technically the solutions you provide may be similar between commercial and federal, how you sell them, manage the projects, understand the customers\u2019 requirements and mission is very different,\u201d he said.\n\nLeidos was not a complete newcomer to the field. In 2011, the former SAIC acquired Vitalize Consulting Solutions, a health-care IT company. A year later, it acquired MaxIT Healthcare Holdings, a company that specialized in setting up electronic health record systems.\n\nIn the energy sector, the contractor had been selling its \u201cSmart Grid as a Service\u201d hardware and software product to utility companies since 2011.\n\nBut Leidos ran into difficulties with a biomass energy plant it had assumed in Plainfield, Conn., a project that also originated under the former SAIC. The company announced its intention to sell the plant but ran into operational issues in the meantime. Production shortfalls and outages at the plant cost Leidos $32 million in bad debt expenses and $9 million in operating losses, the company said.\n\nAt the same time, the commercial health-care business sputtered. Many companies that might have been interested in IT services were instead holding off on major expenditures until they understood the full ramifications of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI think the market shifted on [Leidos], and it just caught them off-guard,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nThe company posted a loss of $482 million in the health and engineering services segment during the last quarter, a drop of more than 120 percent compared with the previous year.\n\nChief executive Roger Krone, who was brought on this summer, noted that the company\u2019s national security and federal health-care business remains strong, and helped offset the drop in its other segments.\n\n\u201cWhile the performance of Leidos has not measured up to earlier expectations, we still have a solid business,\u201d Krone said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cMany of our troubles in the past have come when we overextended into adjacencies that are outside of where our core competencies are.\u201d\n\nThat means a renewed focus on government contracting. The Pentagon\u2019s upcoming multibillion dollar initiative to overhaul its health system technology is \u201cone of the biggest focal points for Leidos at this time,\u201d Krone said.\n\nAs the current prime contractor for the Pentagon, Krone said Leidos is \u201ca domain expert in military health systems.\u201d\n\nLeadership shuffles\n\nSAIC and Leidos have had different leadership stories over the past year. While Moraco has been a constant at the helm of SAIC, Leidos spent much of the year casting about for a permanent leader.\n\nJumper took over the predecessor company in 2012 and guided it through the transition. In February, he announced his decision to retire as soon as a successor was named. K Stuart Shea, the company\u2019s chief operating officer, was widely expected to take over from Jumper. Instead, Shea announced his resignation in March. No reason was given for his departure, but the company said it was \u201ca mutual decision.\u201d\n\nFor four months, the board of directors searched for a replacement until they finally honed in on Krone, a former Boeing executive and industry veteran. Krone was selected because his \u201cdepth of experience [would] enable him to drive the Leidos strategy, while enhancing and optimizing the company\u2019s operational and financial performance,\u201d Lawrence Nussdorf, lead director of the company\u2019s board, said in a statement.\n\nKrone has only been at the top for a few months, but analysts said he appears to be an able candidate to guide Leidos during this difficult period.\n\n\u201cHe seems to have an open mind on the direction for the company,\u201d Loomis said.\n\nAnalysts expect Krone to bring significant changes to Leidos\u2019s way of doing business and refocus the company on its traditionally strong areas, such as intelligence.\n\nKrone confirmed that fact, saying he plans on being \u201crather boring.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe company and our employees have seen too many distractions in the recent past,\u201d Krone said. \u201cIt\u2019s now time to stop the drama and get everyone refocused on ... what we\u2019re really good at.\u201d\n\nAt SAIC, Moraco and his team have done a better job of executing the vision laid out for the company at the time of the breakup, analysts said.\n\n\u201cThe leadership team knows the specific company lines of business very well and has realistic expectations about the market,\u201d said Schweizer, the Guggenheim analyst.\n\nSAIC\u2019s strategy\n\nAt SAIC\u2019s McLean office, spirits were high during the company\u2019s first anniversary celebrations last week. The company held a silent auction to raise money for charity, and asked employees to send in photos of themselves as part of a company-wide photo contest.\n\nThe reason SAIC got off to a sharper start is largely thought to be its single-minded focus on providing technical services to government customers.\n\nSAIC doesn\u2019t have \u201cthe distraction of multiple market segments or business models,\u201d Moraco said. \u201cIt\u2019s that focus that allows us to perform very effectively.\u201d\n\nFor almost a year before the split, company leaders were devising a strategy for the spinoff. That resulted in the \u201cmatrix\u201d business model the new SAIC uses, in which different segments of the company collaborate to serve customers, whether they\u2019re the Army, Navy or Air Force. The strategy was an intentional departure from the former SAIC\u2019s operations, in which units designed similar services didn\u2019t communicate with each other, even if the work overlapped, said Nazzic Keene, the company\u2019s sector president for global markets and missions.\n\nThen there\u2019s the name \u201cSAIC\u201d itself.\n\nDespite the logistical confusion that accompanied keeping the name, Moraco said it has served the company well because it is a familiar brand to government buyers.\n\n\u201cHaving the name in this [competitive] market is a great advantage,\u201d he said.\n\nLeidos faced the challenge of establishing its personality in the market at a time when the slowdown in government spending had ramped up competition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a quality business, it just needs to be put back on track,\u201d said Lewis, the Silverline Group analyst.\n\nWhere they go from here\n\nSo what lies ahead for both companies? The same challenges that most contractors face, such as uncertainty about the level of federal spending over the next two years.\n\nFor Leidos, the key to winning back the confidence of Wall Street is in coming up with a plan that can stabilize the business, Schweizer said.\n\nTo that effect, Krone said he has a \u201cclear vision\u201d for Leidos.\n\n\u201cWe need to invest in things like research and development, continued innovation and internal collaboration, and we need to take care of our people \u2014 they are the ones that will drive this company forward,\u201d Krone said. \u201cIf we can do all of those things and be competitive in our markets, we will continue to have a strong business in the future.\u201d\n\nFor SAIC, a long-term goal could be investing in some of the areas where Leidos is strong, such as defense intelligence, Loomis said.\n\nLooking back, Moraco insists the decision to split the company was the right one, even if it the results did not immediately play out as expected.\n\n\u201cIn this market, both companies are better positioned to be competitive and more responsive to our government customers,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "capbizhero, saic, leidos, tony moraco, john jumper, roger krone, saic earnings, leidos earnings, saic stock, leidos stock", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The two companies born out of Washington contracting behemoth SAIC\u2019s split were supposed to go down different paths.
