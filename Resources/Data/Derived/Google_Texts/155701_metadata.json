It wouldn't be surprising to see a nice, big, comfortable-looking couch with someone laying down on it with their eyes closed, speaking to their therapist. Whatever your idea of therapy may be, throw it out the window. Psychologists and software developers have come together at the University of Southern California\u2019s Institute for Creative Technologies to create Ellie, a virtual therapist.\n\n\u201cAs I talk, Ellie is reading my facial expressions, my vocal patterns, and my body posture,\u201d Cleo Stiller, host of Asking For A Friend, said in the video. \u201cShe\u2019s also interpreting my speech in real time. Am I using positive or negative language? She adjusts her questions based off of my responses.\u201d\n\nIn creating Ellie, the researchers are hoping to allow people to open up more about their problems in front of a machine, instead of a live person.\n\nThe video also describes a different, video game-like therapy, that has users walk through a mock doctor\u2019s office and answer yes or no and multiple choice questions about how they\u2019re currently feeling. The program, called eSmart, was created by Emory University in part \u201cto address the stigma around therapy,\u201d Stiller said.\n\nDon\u2019t fret about robots or virtual reality simulations taking away jobs or the human element of a real therapist, either. According to Skip Rizzo, director for virtual reality at USC\u2019s Institute for Creative Technologies, simulated programs will be more of an assistant to human therapists, \u201cYou see your shrink once a week, but during the week, you\u2019ve got somebody you can talk to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "therapy, virtual, reality, psychologists, develop, virtual, human, help, ease, anxiety", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Virtual reality might be taking over your next therapy session.", "title": "Virtual Humans May Soon Lead Online Therapy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/therapy-virtual-reality-psychologists-develop-virtual-human-help-ease-anxiety-356618", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/10/09/virtual-therapist.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Virtual reality might be taking over your next therapy session.", "title": "Virtual Humans May Soon Lead Online Therapy", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/therapy-virtual-reality-psychologists-develop-virtual-human-help-ease-anxiety-356618", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/10/09/virtual-therapist.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/09/virtual-therapist.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-10-09T15:17:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T15:17:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Virtual reality might be taking over your next therapy session."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1b4\"", "article_summary": "The program, called eSmart, was created by Emory University in part \u201cto address the stigma around therapy,\u201d Stiller said.\nPsychologists and software developers have come together at the University of Southern California\u2019s Institute for Creative Technologies to create Ellie, a virtual therapist.\nDon\u2019t fret about robots or virtual reality simulations taking away jobs or the human element of a real therapist, either.\n\u201cAs I talk, Ellie is reading my facial expressions, my vocal patterns, and my body posture,\u201d Cleo Stiller, host of Asking For A Friend, said in the video.\nIt wouldn't be surprising to see a nice, big, comfortable-looking couch with someone laying down on it with their eyes closed, speaking to their therapist."}
