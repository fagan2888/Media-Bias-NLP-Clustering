HONOLULU (AP) â€” The Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu says tropical depression Kilo could strengthen into a tropical storm as early as Sunday.

The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports (http://bit.ly/1h6f7EJ ) that as of 2 p.m. Hawaii time forecasters say the storm is about 700 miles southwest of Honolulu. It is moving west at about 13 mph.

The storm's maximum sustained winds were 35 mph with higher gusts.

Forecasters say they expect Kilo to gradually strengthen over the next couple of days.

Over the next 24 hours, Kilo's is expected to keep moving while forward motion decreases. The storm is expected to turn northwest Monday.

Kauai, Oahu and the Big Island are under flash flood advisories as Kilo continued to bring muggy weather and a chance of thunderstorms to the main Hawaiian islands on Sunday, the Star-Advertiser reported.

On Friday, Gov. David Ige signed an emergency plan making the state's Major Disaster Fund available if Kilo makes landfall in Hawaii.

Kilo is still expected to strengthen into Tropical Storm on Sunday and gradually intensify into a hurricane.

But the storm's forecast path now takes it near Johnston Atoll and into the Papahanamokuakea National Marine Monument and keeps it away from the main Hawaiian Islands.
