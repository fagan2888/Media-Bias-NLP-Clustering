Famed former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka has taken his gruff style of speaking from the football field to the political world, cutting a campaign ad for Republican Illinois gubernatorial hopeful Bruce Rauner.

The 30-second spot, which debuted Sunday during the Bears game against the Buffalo Bills, shows Mr. Ditka seated across a table from Mr. Rauner, explaining just why he likes the gubernatorial candidate.

“You’re tough,” Mr. Ditka said, smashing his fist into his palm. “You attack the special interests. Bam! Hit ‘em right in the mouth!”

Mr. Rauner then says that perhaps he’s “been too hard” on special interests groups — at which point Mr. Ditka fixes him with a cold, hard stare.

“OK, you’re right,” Mr. Rauner finally says. “I don’t know what I was thinking.”

“Yeah, stick to the game plan, Bruce. Stick to the game plan,” Mr. Ditka replies.

Mr. Rauner faces a tight race against Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn.
