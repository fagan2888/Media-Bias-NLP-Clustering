The passwords must be changed every three, four and six months, and I have a strategy for updating each one. But their different rotation rates mean that one or another always needs attention, sapping my concentration and occasionally precipitating disaster. (\u201cToo many unsuccessful attempts! Contact administrator!\u201d)\n\nAnd then along come the halcyon weeks when they are all exactly the same, a time when mind and fingers fly and I get to think about other things, like the patients in front of me.\n\nIn addition to those three passwords, I have quite a few others: one for our old collection of electronic records (whose information cannot be transferred to our present database), two for separate lab computers not connected to the main computer, one for the billing system, one for mandatory online educational activities, one for the residents\u2019 schedule and evaluations. Most of these have their own slow cycles of renewal; I keep track of their rotations on a tattered index card in my pocket.\n\nAnd I should be grateful for the passwords I do have, because there are quite a few I do not have. For instance, I have no access to the separate electronic records used in our emergency room, so I have little idea what goes on with patients there until they surface somewhere within my digital range. I have no access to yet another system used by most of our outpatient consultants (and they have no access to ours).\n\nWho knows what the biblical stonemasons sang to themselves during work hours at their Tower of Babel. This is the soundtrack at ours: \u201cWhat exactly did the kidney guy tell you to do?\u201d \u201cAre you sure?\u201d \u201cHow did the ER explain that?\u201d \u201cCould you just bring in the new pills next time?\u201d\n\nAs it says in Genesis, humans who speak the same language do reasonably well until a higher power makes a series of panicky, poorly thought out software purchases, at which point all productive collaboration grinds to a halt.\n\nIn 2009, fewer than 10 percent of hospitals had any kind of electronic medical records. By 2014, 75 percent had at least a basic system, all rushing to comply with the mandate for electronic transactions contained in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe data do not indicate how many, like ours, are now awash in the products of competing vendors whose proprietary coding specifically impedes inter-system collaboration. Nor are there yet any algorithms for untangling the wires of a system as rich in different languages as ours.\n\nThe rush to electronic information was prompted by the best intentions. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, \u201cusing electronic health records will reduce paperwork and administrative burdens, cut costs, reduce medical errors and most importantly, improve the quality of care.\u201d\n\nNo one in our Tower debates those goals; we struggle daily to accomplish them, and often, incredibly, we succeed.\n\nWe succeed with the simple expedient of paper.\n\nPaper has become our lingua franca, our fallback and standby. In our new digital universe, we have peculiarly seen a retro explosion of paper. We may no longer write paper prescriptions, but we fax or hand-deliver paper versions of our electronic dealings routinely now. When you don\u2019t know what electronic language the receiver speaks (and you never do), you go with paper.\n\nFurthermore, one of our systems automatically prints out a paper health summary for every patient we see \u2014 even for patients who have established a confidential electronic portal into the system. We cannot seem to turn the print feature off. We press these summaries into our patients\u2019 hands or, if they say no thanks, we leave the sheets in the printer to be shredded. That\u2019s about a ream of paper a day right there.\n\nA few months ago, on a day when morphing passwords had messed up my entire morning, I stopped in the public ladies\u2019 room next to our work space. There, teetering atop the trash can, was one of these paper summaries. It contained (in boldface type) the name, address, date of birth and medical record number of one of my patients, her medical diagnoses, prescriptions, next appointments, and her own ultrasecret password to set up that confidential patient portal.\n\nSo much for the secure exchange of health information, so much for the best electronic intentions, so much for whatever order and control are implied by all those passwords. I could hear the arches of our poor tower crack just a little more. I folded the papers into my pocket so I could put them in the shred pile later.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151214154926, "BN": "well", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/well/live", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/well/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 14, 2015", "keywords": "Computer Security,Computers and the Internet,Electronic Health Records,Doctors,Featured,Live", "GBLC": "Doctors;Featured;Live", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/well/In Age of Digital Records, Paper Still Carries Weight ( 20151214 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Abigail Zuger, M.d.", "SCG": "well", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Abigail Zuger, M.d.", "byl": "Abigail Zuger, M.d.", "twitter": {"description": "Amid the proliferation of technology, and passwords, a backup plan is as close as the print key.", "title": "In Age of Digital Records, Paper Still Carries Weight", "url": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/14/in-age-of-digital-records-paper-still-carries-weight/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/12/15/science/15ZUGER/15ZUGER-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimeswell", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000004092837, "description": "Amid the proliferation of technology, and passwords, a backup plan is as close as the print key.", "CG": "Health", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "December 14, 2015", "article": {"section": "Health", "tag": "Live", "published_time": 1450126166, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2015-12-14T20:49:26-05:00"}, "utime": 20151214204926, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20151214, "pdate": 20151214, "des": "Computer Security;Computers and the Internet;Electronic Health Records", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/12/15/science/15ZUGER/15ZUGER-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Well", "description": "Amid the proliferation of technology, and passwords, a backup plan is as close as the print key.", "title": "In Age of Digital Records, Paper Still Carries Weight", "url": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/14/in-age-of-digital-records-paper-still-carries-weight/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/12/15/science/15ZUGER/15ZUGER-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/12/14/in-age-of-digital-records-paper-still-carries-weight/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "In Age of Digital Records, Paper Still Carries Weight", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/12/15/science/15ZUGER/15ZUGER-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "In 2009, fewer than 10 percent of hospitals had any kind of electronic medical records.\nWe may no longer write paper prescriptions, but we fax or hand-deliver paper versions of our electronic dealings routinely now.\nFor instance, I have no access to the separate electronic records used in our emergency room, so I have little idea what goes on with patients there until they surface somewhere within my digital range.\nIn our new digital universe, we have peculiarly seen a retro explosion of paper.\nWhen you don\u2019t know what electronic language the receiver speaks (and you never do), you go with paper."}
