Gibbons, who first tried heroin four years ago, is battling addiction, and her mother has been pushing to get her the treatment she needs.\n\nThat time, Ashley got into a rehab facility for two weeks of treatment and then into a halfway house, where the state paid most of her bill through a program for people younger than 25. But Ashley turned 25 while she was there and was told she had to leave, in part, she says, because she hadn\u2019t been following the rules. She now owes the facility $3,000.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have it,\u201d she said. \u201cI make $8.75 at ShopRite, and that\u2019s $150 a week. I\u2019m an addict, not a rich bitch.\u201d\n\nThrough it all, Alicia has kept pushing to get Ashley the treatment she needs. At one point, the mother got so desperate for help that she called the cops in hopes of getting her daughter arrested.\n\n\u201cI just wanted her away,\u201d Alicia said. \u201cIt takes getting into trouble to get mandated to go away. I kept pressing charges against her. Charges, charges, charges.\u201d\n\nRates of heroin addiction and fatal overdose are skyrocketing in the United States, and a political consensus has emerged to emphasize treatment over criminal prosecution. But there\u2019s little agreement on how to pay for more treatment, leaving addicts facing obstacles so daunting even a healthy person would struggle to overcome them.\n\nTreatment centers are often prohibitively expensive, overcrowded, underfunded and subject to byzantine government rules. Health insurance coverage is stingy to nonexistent. And the social stigma of heroin addiction is still so potent that many users and their families are reluctant to seek help in the first place.\n\nThat leaves one sure route into rehab: \u201cTreatment in the overwhelming majority of cases begins behind bars,\u201d said Jim McGreevey, the former New Jersey governor, who runs an experimental treatment program in Jersey City.\n\nThe need for more treatment is acute, said Obama administration drug czar Michael Botticelli, who estimates that up to 80 percent of heroin addicts are never treated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re approaching the same mortality rate as at the height of the AIDS epidemic,\u201d he said. When addicts first get treated in jail, \u201cit means we have missed so many opportunities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite soaring rates of addiction, treatment remains hard to access and prohibitively expensive.", "generator": "Piklist 0.9.9.7c", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Rates of heroin addiction are skyrocketing in the United States, but there\u2019s little agreement on how to pay for more treatment.", "title": "Heroin almost killed Ashley.
