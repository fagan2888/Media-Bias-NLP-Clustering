ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) STORY: U.S. capitol police on Monday (March 28) said a male suspect drew a weapon on officers at the north entrance to the U.S. Capitol Visitor's Center and that an officer fired at and injured the suspect. Capitol police chief Matthew Verderosa told reporters during a briefing that early indications suggest the incident was an act of a single person and that there was no reason to believe it was anything more than a criminal act. There was confusion in early accounts about what occurred but a U.S. official had said no evidence had materialized of a connection to terrorism.
