Start salivating “Star Wars” fans.

J.J. Abrams has revealed a first look at an X-Wing fighter that will appear in the upcoming “Star Wars: Episode VII” via a video posted on the “Star Wars” YouTube channel. The acclaimed director checks in from the set, where he’s detailed a new reward for the film franchise’s charity initiative, “Force for Change.”

Here, Abrams touts a new prize package that includes a set visit, the chance to appear in the film and a private screening in the winner’s hometown before the film hits theaters on December 18, 2015. During his short plea, the camera pans out to reveal the sleek, possibly banged up fighter vessel. As Abrams wraps up, a small droid scurries through the set and the rightful owner of the X-Wing hops aboard.

The charity drive is raising money for UNICEF’s Innovation Labs and is hosted by Omaze. Fans can enter the contest by making a donation as small as $10. So far, Abrams says participants from 119 countries have donated; the effort raised more than a million dollars in the first 24 hours of launch.

The highly anticipated installment in the franchise will feature the return of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) along with new cast members, “Girls” star Adam Driver, Academy Award winning actress Lupita Nyong’o, “Game of Thrones” star Gwendoline Christie and “Inside Llewyn Davis” star Oscar Isaac.
