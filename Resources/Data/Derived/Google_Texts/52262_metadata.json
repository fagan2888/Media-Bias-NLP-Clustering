The success in Vilnius shows, how right it was for Germany, to push first for a common European position,\" she said in a statement.\n\nEU foreign ministers meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Vilnius on Saturday agreed the world \"cannot remain idle\" and said a clear and strong response was needed to prevent any future use of chemical weapons in Syria.\n\n\"We always think Germany should also be the advocate of the so-called smaller countries in the European Union who have not the opportunity to participate at the G20 meetings,\" Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said afterward.\n\n\"After we saw this excellent and very wise position of the European Union, the (German) Chancellor (Angela Merkel) and myself decided that we support now the G20 statement.\"\n\nThe website of Die Zeit weekly said on Friday not signing the G20 document was \"a low point\" in Merkel's career.\n\n\"Does she really think Germany doesn't need any friends anymore?\" it asked.\n\nMerkel is tipped to win a third term in the September 22 vote but it is not yet clear whether she can continue her preferred center-right coalition with the Free Democrats (FDP).\n\nAn opinion poll published last Thursday showed 70 percent of Germans oppose U.S. military action in Syria.\n\n(Reporting By Arshad Mohammed;
