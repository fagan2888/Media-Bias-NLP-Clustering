You can\u2019t put your finger on it, but you know, deep down, it\u2019s just not working anymore. Instant Messenger isn\u2019t loading or Napster just crashed. Your computer hangs there, motionless. There might be a guttural \u2018thunk\u2019 from your hard drive or, even more terrifying, nothing at all. Then, with no sense of decorum, it arrives: the single horseman of the PC apocalypse, the Blue Screen of Death. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL again to restart your computer. You will lose any unsaved information in all applications. Press any key to continue. The Blue Screen of Death first appeared in the very early 1990s as a feature of the Windows 3.0 operating system. This error message, which locks users out of the system, is typically summoned by driver glitches or when the software and hardware have trouble communicating. It\u2019s your PC\u2019s way of saying, \u201cLook, I know you can\u2019t see it, but I\u2019m really having a bad time here\u201d\u2014just before a shutdown. If you\u2019ve ever met Blue, you probably hate it. You lost that big paper in college, your music collection went out the window, or maybe something even worse. You sat there, by the dim light of your rebooting system, cursing your luck and the color blue all in one breath.\n\nThe biggest misconception about Microsoft\u2019s Blue Screen is that it is itself a glitch or a failure. The truth is that it\u2019s neither. In fact, it is just the opposite: the Blue Screen of Death is a knight we\u2019ve mistaken for a rogue. It\u2019s designed to tell you that a problem has occurred and in so doing to keeps the real errors from spreading. It\u2019s the neighborhood watch that sees a fire and calls 911. It\u2019s a whistle-blower, a concerned citizen. The Blue Screen, as we now know it, is just trying to watch our backs. There was a time, however, when the Blue Screen of Death wasn\u2019t so civic-minded, when our anger towards it was a little more justified. The Blue Screen with which we are now familiar is actually a remake, an homage to an enigmatic message that occurred when the very first institutions of personal computing were being developed. By one account, Lattice Inc., a component developer for an early version of the Windows operating system, first documented an insidious blue error screen that would occasionally interrupt their progress. When alerting IBM about this bug, the developers at Lattice reportedly referred to the event as the Blue Screen of Death\u2014a subtle dig at the blue branding of IBM itself. After Windows 2.0 entered the marketplace users began to make similar reports. In the wild, a whole bestiary of error screens even became legend. Beta versions of Windows carried the occasional Red Screen of Death, while Microsoft\u2019s Disk Operating System had a void-like Black Screen which featured an impotent, blinking cursor. All of these outcomes required a reboot at the very least to rectify. Before too long, Microsoft stepped in. Most bugs can be addressed, remedied, or mitigated, their damage minimized and their effects forgotten. But the complexity of an operating system mated to a variety of different hardware components makes it impossible to account for all possible defects in advance. Microsoft had different plans for these cases: rather than hiding the errors, it would promote them.\n\nWhat began as an unsanctioned glitch eventually became an official part of the operating system, fully integrated before Windows 3 launched. According to the Microsoft Developer\u2019s Center, \u201cWhen Microsoft Windows encounters a condition that compromises safe system operation, the system halts. This condition is called a bug check. It is also commonly referred to as a system crash, a kernel error, or a Stop error.\u201d Next comes a series of characters on a blue screen, which allows a technician to look up what errors have occurred and address the problem. \u201cThe hexadecimal number following the word \u2018STOP\u2019 is called the bug check code or Stop code. This is the most important item on the screen.\u201d Wikimedia Basically, Blue has two main jobs. First, it reports a halt to processes going on inside your computer. If your motherboard is overheating, the Blue Screen of Death lets you know. This prevents actual, irreparable, physical damage from occurring. Second, Blue reports what it thinks caused the problem by displaying an error message that the human user can look up. It\u2019s a simple gig: observe and report. But while the job might be simple, it is widely misunderstood. Despite what those friendly \u201cI\u2019m a Mac/I\u2019m a PC\u201d commercials would have us believe, computers are immensely complex systems. There\u2019s a whole world of interdependencies and functional language that must be called into service every time you want to play Angry Birds. It\u2019s a world that you can\u2019t see and couldn\u2019t interact with even if it were visible. Hidden behind your desktop wallpaper is a universe of hardware and software subsystems that do your work. They decompress your videos, upload your pictures, and render the visible elements of your interface. There are so many of them, in fact, that occasionally on-the-job accidents occur. Such accidents are even more likely\u2014and potentially more impactful\u2014in the anything-goes ecosystem of WinTel personal computing, where manufacturers and users could mate a variety of different hardware and software together in a manner neither Microsoft nor Intel could ever have foreseen.\n\nThe Blue Screen of Death may look like a delinquent spray-painting hex-code curse words onto your computer screen, and it may even have started out that way. But there\u2019s another way to understand Blue: as the responsible overseer trying to wrangle so many unwieldy hardware and software systems that don\u2019t always play nicely with one another\u2014the Thin Blue Line of personal computing. Then in 2012, the Blue Screen got a face-lift. \u201cYour PC ran into a problem that it couldn\u2019t handle, and now it needs to restart,\u201d reads the new Windows 8 Blue Screen of Death. Blue\u2019s updated look even offers a more succinct way to diagnose what\u2019s wrong, asking you to look up a problem with a user-friendly name like \u201cDisk Error\u201d instead of the previous, \u201cSTOP 0x0000008E.\u201d Blue is softer now, both in hue and tenor, and it even attempts sympathy with a :( sad face. But why bother giving the Blue Screen of Death a face? It\u2019s hard to imagine a world where any error screen, no-matter how friendly or well designed, would be met with anything but ire and resentment. Maybe Microsoft hopes that it\u2019s harder to hate something when it has even the most rudimentary of faces\u2014a tacit admission of the success of Apple\u2019s twenty-five year program of hiding technical defects with humanizing iconography. Or maybe by giving the scapegoat virtual features, Windows 8 allows for a more effectively detestable target of our anger. By closing the gap between the exasperated human and the malfunctioning computer, Blue sacrifices itself on behalf of our frustration. Despite the new veneer, the Blue Screen will always be the bearer of bad news. Wikimedia This is a story about misunderstandings and reconciliation, about a hero working against our immediate desires in order to preserve the system as a whole. Not just the PC\u2019s system, but everything it makes possible: the working relationship between you and your cyber-organized life. Blue is just the go-between, the messenger. And as with all bearer\u2019s of bad news, it\u2019s easy to blame the messenger. Blue is indifferent, offering little recourse save a reboot. Perhaps its time to forgive poor Blue. If we could put aside our stigmas and appreciate these error messages for what they are, we might then be in a position to learn something that the Blue Screen of the Death has known for a long time: just because we can\u2019t see something doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t part of it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It is but the messenger, like a fever, an Object Lesson", "author": "Evan Meaney", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "It is but the messenger, like a fever, an Object Lesson", "title": "Sympathy for the Blue Screen of Death", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/bsodblank/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/sympathy-for-the-blue-screen-of-death/282015/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1d0\"", "article_summary": "Then, with no sense of decorum, it arrives: the single horseman of the PC apocalypse, the Blue Screen of Death.\nIn fact, it is just the opposite: the Blue Screen of Death is a knight we\u2019ve mistaken for a rogue.\nThe Blue Screen of Death first appeared in the very early 1990s as a feature of the Windows 3.0 operating system.\nThe Blue Screen of Death may look like a delinquent spray-painting hex-code curse words onto your computer screen, and it may even have started out that way.\nThere was a time, however, when the Blue Screen of Death wasn\u2019t so civic-minded, when our anger towards it was a little more justified."}
