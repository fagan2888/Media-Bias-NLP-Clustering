Described as the German \u201cPopeye,\u201d Schlitte learned from a young age how to use his 18-inch right bicep to his advantage.\n\n\"I first discovered I could use my gift when I was three years of age,\u201d Schlitte told Yahoo7 Sport. \u201cWe had a family oven at home in Germany and I picked up a rather large bucket of coal for the oven and carried it around for my mother, which was probably very uncommon for a three-year-old.\"\n\nAfter entering an arm wrestling competition at a local bar in the small village of Haldensleben when he was 16 years old, Schlitte started to turn heads with the impressive amount of strength he displayed with one arm. He began taking on other arm wrestlers who were much bigger than him but couldn\u2019t compete with the power of his abnormally large right arm.\n\nToday, Schlitte has eight national arm wrestling championships in Germany and 14 international championships under his belt. He also became the youngest to ever win a Sylvester Stallone-inspired \u201cOver The Top\u201d Tournament and even defeated an arm wrestling robot after breaking the machine. It\u2019s safe to say there is nothing Schlitte would like to change regarding his appearance.\n\n\"I have spent 10 years traveling around the world doing what I love,\" he added. \u201cEveryone has a challenge in life. I'm not a religious guy or anything but this was a gift from a higher power and this was my calling in life.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "german, popeye, matthias, schlitte", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "German \"Popeye,\" Matthias \"Hellboy\" Schlitte, turned a genetic defect that caused his right arm to grow to almost double the size of his left into a professional arm wrestling career.", "title": "German 'Popeye' Takes Over Arm Wrestling With Genetic Defect [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/german-popeye-enters-professional-arm-wrestling-after-genetic-defect-gives-him-massive-right-arm", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/matthias-hellboy-schlitte.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "German \"Popeye,\" Matthias \"Hellboy\" Schlitte, turned a genetic defect that caused his right arm to grow to almost double the size of his left into a professional arm wrestling career.", "title": "German 'Popeye' Takes Over Arm Wrestling With Genetic Defect [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/german-popeye-enters-professional-arm-wrestling-after-genetic-defect-gives-him-massive-right-arm", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/matthias-hellboy-schlitte.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/17/matthias-hellboy-schlitte.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-17T14:13:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-17T14:13:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "German \"Popeye,\" Matthias \"Hellboy\" Schlitte, turned a genetic defect that caused his right arm to grow to almost double the size of his left into a professional arm wrestling career."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc56\"", "article_summary": "Professional arm wrestler Matthias \u201cHellboy\u201d Schlitte was born with a genetic defect that caused his right arm to develop to almost twice the size of his left arm.\nHe began taking on other arm wrestlers who were much bigger than him but couldn\u2019t compete with the power of his abnormally large right arm.\nHe also became the youngest to ever win a Sylvester Stallone-inspired \u201cOver The Top\u201d Tournament and even defeated an arm wrestling robot after breaking the machine.\nToday, Schlitte has eight national arm wrestling championships in Germany and 14 international championships under his belt.\nDescribed as the German \u201cPopeye,\u201d Schlitte learned from a young age how to use his 18-inch right bicep to his advantage."}
