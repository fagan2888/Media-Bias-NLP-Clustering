They have chiefly relied on clich\u00e9s, buzzwords and attempts to prove who is the most contemptuous of President Obama or Hillary Rodham Clinton. There is a similar weakness in the smaller Democratic field, which has had only one debate; subsequent forums may provide more meat.\n\nThe Republican void was on display in the debate on Wednesday focusing on the party\u2019s favorite issue: taxes. All the candidates would cut extensively, though most would add trillions to the debt. The proposals from the two front-runners, Donald J. Trump and Ben Carson, would create the largest budget shortfalls.\n\nThey also tried to camouflage their plans\u2019 heavy tilt in favor of the more affluent. Mr. Trump stresses that he would end the carried interest tax loophole benefiting private-equity and hedge fund executives. He would also eliminate the estate tax, which is paid by only 0.2 percent of all families. Killing carried interest would raise $2 billion a year; killing the estate tax would cost $20 billion.\n\nThe much-maligned moderator at last week\u2019s debate was essentially correct that Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s tax cuts would give almost twice as much to the rich as to the middle class, though the candidate denied it. An analysis by the Tax Foundation of Mr. Rubio\u2019s initial proposal \u2014 which has been slightly modified \u2014 showed that it would give the biggest benefits to the poorest, but that the top 1 percent would get about twice as much, on a percentage basis, as the middle and working class.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo understand why candidates avoid budget specifics, look at the one realistic proposal, that of John Kasich, the governor of Ohio. He would cut taxes and offer a balanced budget in eight years. Some of the entitlement changes he advocates would be tough; but the real problem is that he would freeze nondefense discretionary spending for eight years, bringing it far below levels in the Eisenhower administration as a percentage of the economy. These cutbacks would affect big-ticket items such as veterans\u2019 health care, the Border Patrol and health research, and would be politically impossible.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, long the b\u00eate noire of Republicans, was mentioned only twice in passing at the debate. Demanding repeal is easy; a replacement is much harder to come up with. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida has tried. His initiative would lower some costs and lessen regulation, but it would also provide fewer benefits, weaken a ban on discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions and limit tax-free insurance offered by employers.\n\nThe immigration discussion has been dominated by Mr. Trump\u2019s promise of a \u201cbeautiful\u201d wall along the southern border that he insists Mexico would pay for. Climate change was barely mentioned, other than condemnations of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies.\n\nSimilarly, all the candidates attacked what they consider the president\u2019s weakness on foreign policy and national security. With the exception of Senator Lindsey Graham, who does not register sufficiently in polls to get on the main stage, they offered few specifics on how they would fight terrorists, or counter Russian incursions and China\u2019s assertive territorial claims.\n\n\u201cThe only Republican with a defined national security policy is Lindsey Graham,\u201d says John Nagl, formerly a top adviser to Gen. David H. Petraeus and now the headmaster at the Haverford School. \u201cThey certainly aren\u2019t willing to give defense the resources it needs, to impose a gasoline tax to fund national security needs, or to do anything serious.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, there have been deceptive debates in past campaigns. Mr. Obama presented himself as a protectionist, vowing to renegotiate trade pacts. George W. Bush promised a \u201chumble\u201d foreign policy.\n\nStill, campaigns and debates matter. The candidates and the news media have yet to meet that standard this time.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151101120216, "twitter": {"description": "The three Republican presidential debates have failed to provide enough information about how any of the candidates would govern.", "title": "G.O.P.
