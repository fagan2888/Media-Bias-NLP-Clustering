Florida employers could pay as much as $253 million in new taxes, and North Carolina employers as much as $120 million.\n\n\n\nThe cumulative hit to employers in the 25 states could be between $1.03 billion and $1.55 billion, Jackson Hewitt found.\n\n(Read more: Aetna could be forced out of Obamacare: CEO)\n\nDiane Rowland, a Medicaid expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told CNBC.com, \"All of us have said there's a cost to not expanding\" Medicaid.\n\n\"This is the employer side being able to quantify the effect,\" Rowland said. \"I think as some of these economic arguments come out, the harder it is for some of these political arguments in states where [Medicaid expansion] is still under consideration\" to hold sway, she said.\n\n(Read more: Obamacare blitz woos the young with star power)\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, as written, originally mandated that the government-run Medicaid health-care program for the poor be expanded nationally to include previously ineligible adults who earned less than 139 percent of the federally poverty line.

There, the federal government will foot 100 percent of the increased costs of expansion until 2017, when its share of costs drops to 95 percent, and then to 90 percent from 2020 on.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Some employers in 25 states not expanding Medicaid could owe more than $1.5 billion in new taxes starting next year because of Obamacare penalties.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Some employers in 25 states not expanding Medicaid could owe more than $1.5 billion in new taxes starting next year because of Obamacare penalties.", "title": "No Medicaid expansion?
