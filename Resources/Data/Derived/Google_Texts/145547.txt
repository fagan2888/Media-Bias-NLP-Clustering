Oh, the things Tim Howard could save.

Referencing goalie Tim Howard's stellar performance during Team USA's World Cup match against Belgium Tuesday, the trending hashtag #ThingsTimHowardCouldSave imagined Howard as capable of much more than the 16 saves he managed during the soccer game.

The tweeting public painted Howard as some kind of superhero. Tweets passed around a photo meme in which Howard, a North Brunswick native, strove to save everyone and everything. His body, frozen in a "save" pose, was photoshopped into various iconic scenes, including the death of Simba's father in "The Lion King" and the sinking of the Titanic.

In the photos, Howard was saving Blockbuster video stores from going out of business. Taylor Swift, too, from Kanye West's stunt at the Video Music Awards. And, in a scene from the movie "Independence Day," defending the White House from an alien attack.

In a dizzying bit of meme fusion, one contribution pictured Howard rescuing the older brother's finger in the 2007 viral video "Charlie Bit Me," which was in turn a part of last week's big meme — the chomping mouth of Uruguay striker Luis Suarez . Thanks to the Howard meme, the goalie could also be seen rescuing Team Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini from Suarez's toothy grip, the very same one that visibly injured Chiellini's shoulder during the Italy-Uruguay game on June 24.

Even presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett got in on the fun, posting the Tim Howard hashtag with a photo that contained a big "House of Cards" spoiler. (Hint: the image related to a certain journalist, so, if trying to stay in a spoiler-free bubble, beware of the picture down below.)

The meme was still trending globally on Wednesday night, well after the American team's 2-1 loss to Belgium.

Tim Howard fever also caused someone to edit the Wikipedia entry for the U.S. secretary of defense to include the goalie's name — for many soccer fans, he had indeed claimed the title. There's actually a White House petition for that, along with another petition to rename the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Virginia after Tim Howard. Actual Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel even called Howard to thank him for defending the U.S. at the World Cup.

Running with the same theme, the @timhoward2016 Twitter account seemed to put forth the idea that Howard would be a safe bid for president.

On Wednesday President Barack Obama himself called Howard and his teammate, forward Clint Dempsey. The White House posted video of the call to YouTube.

"To see the way you guys captured the hearts and imaginations of the whole country is unbelievable," Obama told the players. Addressing Howard specifically, he added, "I don't know how you're gonna survive the mobs when you come back home, man. You're going to have to shave your beard so they don't know who you are."

Google recorded more than 2 million searches for the goalkeeper.

Before the game even began, he was already Nielsen Social's top Word Cup player for the week of June 23 through 30, with 47,000 "@" mentions for his account, @TimHowardGK. According to Twitter, Howard received the most mentions of any U.S. player during the Belgium game.

Because it's STILL TRENDING, and it may be the best hashtag ever. http://t.co/BLd0XJlE13 #ThingsTimHowardCouldSave pic.twitter.com/qqrjYBV7Hf — Bustle (@bustle) July 2, 2014

More World Cup

Twitter says 9.1 million tweets were devoted to the Belgium vs. USA game during the match Tuesday. But #BELvsUSA remained in the worldwide trends before, during and after the match. "C'mon US" urged the Americans on, and as the game wound down with the fate of both teams undecided — though Belgium was winning — "Still 15" went global, as in "there's still 15 minutes."

But not so fast — soon "there's 1" (minute left) and "Wow 1" trended when everyone noticed the extra time wasn't as much as team USA fans might have liked.

"Proud of the USA" followed Team USA's loss to Belgium, along with "Seeing Tim Howard," as tweets talked about seeing the goalie cry after the game was over. But Howard wasn't the only player who attracted a fair amount of tweets.

When Team USA winger Julian Green scored, Twitter recorded 187,413 tweets per minute about the game. Green became an international trend, along with "He's 19," given tweets that commented on his young age.

Belgium player Kevin De Bruyne, who trended worldwide, dominated Twitter when viewers said he looked like Ron Weasley, Price Harry and Sherminator, Chris Owen's character from the movie "American Pie." (All three identities trended as well.)

After the loss, it would appear that American soccer fans got "48-0 in Super Bowls" trending as a concession, along with the less tasteful "still 2-0" (in world wars). Looking to the World Cup's future, "Russia 2018" followed the Belgium game in the trends, with many tweets taking solace in the notion that young Green may again fight for the U.S. in the tournament.



Supreme Court's ruling on Hobby Lobby

On Monday, Twitter exploded with reactions to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that employers who have a religious objection to their insurance policies covering contraceptives do not have to cover them.

While the contraceptives named in the case were IUDs, and so-called "morning-after pills" ella and Plan B, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, author of the court's dissenting opinion, said the ruling opened the door for other challenges to health coverage based on religious objection.

"The court, I fear, has ventured into a minefield," Ginsburg said, writing about the challenge to the Affordable Care Act and the decision, which the court says applies to "closely held corporations" — those named in the related cases are Hobby Lobby Stores (an arts-and-crafts chain) and Conestoga Wood Specialties.

The mandate that health plans offer complete coverage for birth control to female employees, the court said, violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

Its name inextricably entwined with the decision, Hobby Lobby drew more than a half million searches Monday, and Ginsburg trended on Facebook for excerpts from the dissent.

In a case of social media miscommunication, the Twitter account for the Supreme Court news site SCOTUSblog — @SCOTUSblog — fielded a whole lot of disgruntled posts intended for the actual court.
