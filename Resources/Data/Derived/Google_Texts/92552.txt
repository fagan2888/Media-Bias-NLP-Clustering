Bill Maher received an unusual amount of pushback from his panel on Friday night’s “Real Time,” including a fellow comedian not exactly known for his political humor.

Maher was assessing the state of political polarization in America and pointed his finger at a likely source: FOX News, which he said was responsible for making Americans incapable of knowing “how to talk to each other.” Of all people, Jerry Seinfeld, a panelist, wasn’t biting.

“I think you do have a better argument that each side just talks to its side, listens to its side. That’s polarizing,” Seinfeld said. “To blame it all on FOX News doesn’t seem to be completely fair.”

Andrea Mitchell and former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, a Republican, also weren’t on-board with Maher’s assessment. The host kept on though, saying that there’s something inherent in the Republican brain that makes it want to receive information that affirms what it already believes, kind of like sticking to the routine of going to the same diner and ordering the same food.
