Researchers also did not find any link between one sibling with depression and one with Parkinson's.\n\n\"This finding gives us more evidence that these two diseases are linked,\" said Peter Nordstr\u00f6m, Professor in the Department of Community Medicine and Rehabilitation at Ume\u00e5 University, in a press release. \"If the diseases were independent of each other but caused by the same genetic or early environmental factors, then we would expect to see the two diseases group together in siblings, but that didn't happen.\"\n\nResearchers also found more severe depression was correlated with a higher likelihood of developing Parkinson's. Those hospitalized once for depression were about 3.5 percent more likely to develop it, while those hospitalized 4 or 5 times were 40 percent more likely to end up with Parkinson's.\n\nLinks between depression and Parkinson's didn't change when considering things like alcoholism or injuries for those diagnosed with depression.\n\nNordstrom told Live Science that despite the results of the study, the number of people with depression who develop Parkinson's is still very small, and that more research is needed to understand the possible link between the two. It's possible, he said, that the ways depression affects the brain could somehow be setting the brain up for Parkinson's.\n\nThe study is published in Neurology.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Depression may be an indicator of Parkinson's disease, or a risk factor for it, researchers said after studying patient records that spanned more than 20 years.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Depression may be an indicator of Parkinson's disease, or a risk factor for it, researchers said after studying patient records that spanned more than 20 years.", "title": "Depression linked with development of Parkinson's disease", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/05/21/Depression-linked-with-development-of-Parkinsons-disease/8211432218643/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/8211432218643/2015/1/14322220328515/v2.1/Depression-linked-with-development-of-Parkinsons-disease.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@UPI", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8211432218643/2015/i/14322220328515/v2.1/Depression-linked-with-development-of-Parkinsons-disease.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Depression may be an indicator of Parkinson's disease, or a risk factor for it, researchers said after studying patient records that spanned more than 20 years.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Depression linked with development of Parkinson's disease"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "article_summary": "Links between depression and Parkinson's didn't change when considering things like alcoholism or injuries for those diagnosed with depression.\nThe study found people with depression were 50 percent more likely than those without it to develop Parkinson's.\nIt's possible, he said, that the ways depression affects the brain could somehow be setting the brain up for Parkinson's.\nThe data showed that over the 26-year period, 1,485, or about 1.1 percent, of people diagnosed with depression later developed Parkinson's, while 1,775, or about 0.4 percent, of people who did not have depression ended up with Parkinson's.\nResearchers also did not find any link between one sibling with depression and one with Parkinson's."}
