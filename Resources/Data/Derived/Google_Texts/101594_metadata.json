Individual call centers deal with a particular client and set of services they\u2019re under contract to deliver, and such contracts \u201ccome and go\u201d based on the whim of the client \u2014 normally a function of revenues and profits, he said.\n\nConvergys closed its doors Jan. 21.\n\nHobbs said WSC met with Maximus on Feb. 25 for a \u201cRapid Response\u201d \u2014 Workforce Solutions\u2019 reemployment service \u2014 in preparation for a partial layoff, with some or most of the positions being rehired in July when Maximus expects a new contract.\n\nThe company plans to eliminate approximately 1,600 jobs at its Boise, Idaho, call center effective April 25. In a letter to those employees, Helene Fisher, program manager/vice president of the company\u2019s federal services division, described Maximus as a subcontractor under contract to General Dynamics Information Technology.\n\nIn turn, GDIT provides \u201csupport to consumers who require assistance and information related to the Affordable Care Act, (ACA), which is managed by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS),\u201d Fisher wrote.\n\nAccording to the letter, the layoffs in both cities are due to the \u201cnature of the contract and the reduced volume of calls, both of which are directly related to the enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the enrollment period ends, fewer employees are needed to support the reduced call volume,\u201d Fisher wrote.\n\nMarch 31 is the deadline this year to sign up for health insurance under ACA.\n\nHobbs said all Maximus\u2019 1,350 employees in Brownsville have received a WARN letter, required by federal law to notify employees in advance of mass layoffs or plant closings, though the employees who will actually be affected will be notified \u201con or about April 11.\u201d\n\nWARN stands for \u201cWorker Adjustment and Retraining Notification.\u201d\n\nHobbs said his group and the Texas Workforce Commission are making plans to provide Rapid Response services at Maximus on the date the layoffs take place.\n\nGilbert Salinas, vice president of the Brownsville Economic Council, said Convergys was the first big call center to come to Brownsville.\n\n\u201cIt opened it up for a string of other call centers to come in,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a big deal when they came in.\u201d\n\nPHARR LOCATION TO STAY OPEN\n\nAlthough Convergys\u2019 location in Brownsville closed, its call center in Pharr will not follow suit, said Brooke Beiting, media relations specialist for the Cincinnati-based company.\n\n\u201cPharr is business as usual,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely hiring.\u201d\n\nConvergys published a news release Thursday saying the Pharr center is \u201cgoing strong in the midst of construction\u201d during the demolition and rebuilding of El Centro Mall.\n\nConvergys\u2019 building will remain at the shopping center, which is in the middle of a demolition to bring in new venues, including Main Event, a family gaming center. The call center continues to pursue new hires in Pharr.\n\n\u201cWe are looking for ambitious individuals who can work from our contact center, and have a passion for providing great customer service and promoting our client\u2019s products and services,\u201d Andrew Lindeman, site director at the Pharr center, said in the news release. \u201cWe are reaching out into our community to fill these openings, because these are not only terrific positions, they are great stepping stones to a career in operations, recruitment, or training.\u201d\n\nPat Hobbs said that economic considerations contributed to the decision to close the Brownsville location.\n\n\u201cTo my knowledge, the Convergys call center here in Brownsville closed because they lost their contract and could not afford to stay in operation,\u201d he said via e-mail.\n\nRegulations connected to the Affordable Care Act, or \u2018Obamacare,\u2019 did not cause the Brownsville facility to close, Hobbs said.\n\nTo my knowledge,\u201d he said, \u201cthe costs associated with ACA mandates had nothing to do with the center\u2019s closing.\u201d\n\n360 workers lost their positions as a result of the Brownsville call center closing, Hobbs said. Some have transferred to the company\u2019s Pharr site, while others have turned to unemployment insurance, he said.\n\nHobbs doesn\u2019t anticipate that Convergys will expand in the region.\n\nI don\u2019t foresee another Convergys location opening in the Valley,\u201d he said.\n\nHe did leave the door open to the possibility that an additional company could come.\n\n\u201cThere have been queries from other call center companies interested in locating here,\u201d he said.\n\nMonitor staff writer Dan Santella contributed to this report.\n\nsclark@brownsvilleherald.com", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Monitor", "description": "Call center jobs in Brownsville are becoming scarcer: After celebrating 14 years in the city just six months ago, Convergys has closed its doors.", "title": "Pharr's Convergys continues to recruit new hires despite closure of Brownsville site", "url": "http://www.themonitor.com/news/local/pharr-s-convergys-continues-to-recruit-new-hires-despite-closure/article_420e04b6-ae48-11e3-8e6c-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/themonitor.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/a3/3a3ea926-aef6-11e3-a172-001a4bcf6878/5328d8a972e04.preview-620.jpg?resize=620%2C428", "height": 428}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@monitornews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Call center jobs in Brownsville are becoming scarcer: After celebrating 14 years in the city just six months ago, Convergys has closed its doors.", "fb": {"app_id": 108049775881002}, "keywords": "convergys,pharr,brownsville,local,business,top_story", "google-site-verification": "V8P2NNokGINCTv-r9xQHek8dzZWwYYMCQbh2f7o4PGQ", "news_keywords": "convergys,pharr,brownsville,local,business,top_story"}, "article_summary": "Despite those closings, Pharr\u2019s Convergys location continues to pursue new hires, a company spokeswoman said.\nI don\u2019t foresee another Convergys location opening in the Valley,\u201d he said.\nGilbert Salinas, vice president of the Brownsville Economic Council, said Convergys was the first big call center to come to Brownsville.\nHobbs said he was told Convergys lost the contract it had been servicing in Brownsville.\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely hiring.\u201dConvergys published a news release Thursday saying the Pharr center is \u201cgoing strong in the midst of construction\u201d during the demolition and rebuilding of El Centro Mall."}
