Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, who are vying to become the strongest alternative to Mr. Trump, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich also are slated to speak here. Ben Carson is also scheduled to attend \u2014 though the retired neurosurgeon has said he no longer sees a path to the nomination.\n\nHeather Knopp of Virginia said she has been a \u201cCruz fan\u201d since the Texas Republican led a 21-hour plus \u201cfilibuster\u201d against Obamacare in 2013 and said she won\u2019t support Mr. Trump if he is the nominee.\n\n\u201cI will never vote for that man,\u201d Ms. Knopp said, adding she would write-in Mr. Cruz\u2019s name on the ballot.\n\n\u201cI am not the only one. I know lots and lots of people that are doing the same thing,\u201d the 49-year-old said. \u201cI want to sleep at night.\u201d\n\nTim Finn said he is leaning toward Mr. Rubio and said he would \u201chave to hold his nose\u201d to cast his support behind Mr. Trump if the fellow New Yorker wins the race.\n\n\u201cHe is going to have to tone it down,\u201d Mr. Finn, 56, said.\n\nAnn Eubank of Alabama, meanwhile, suggested Mr. Trump\u2019s backers should rethink their support.\n\n\u201cI think that there is a section of our population who are so angry that they\u2019ve lost their common sense, and are supporting a candidate that they really don\u2019t know what he is going to do,\u201d Mr. Eubank, 76, said.\n\nSome, though, embraced Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cI happen to like Donald Trump,\u201d said Wayne Mazza, of Pennsylvania. \u201cI like the fact that he is rattling the cage because I think what it has done is show the corruption in our party.\u201d\n\nMr. Mazza said, at the moment, that Mr. Trump is his first choice, and Mr. Cruz is his second.\n\n\u201cI just want someone who loves our country and that will do the best to protect this country,\u201d he said. \u201cI think Donald Trump will do that, and I think Ted Cruz will do that as well.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump expanded his lead in the GOP presidential race on Super Tuesday by grabbing the top spot in seven states, including Virginia, Tennessee and Alabama \u2014 sending a shiver down the spine of establishment and conservative Republicans leaders, who are worried time is running out to stop him from securing the nomination, and hope to blow a hole in his image before winner-take-all contests in Ohio and Florida on March 15.\n\nMichael Thomsett of Tennessee, though, said he still thinks Mr. Trump can be stopped.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like Trump as a person or as a candidate,\u201d Mr. Thomsett said. I think it\u2019s amateur night, and I think he says that he is going to do a lot of things, but he doesn\u2019t have any actual plans, so I am not sure what sort of president he would be.\u201d\n\nThe 67-year-old added, \u201cI kind of suspect he is a liberal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Businessman Donald Trump could be walking into hostile territory this week when he appears at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, where grassroots activists say they don't see the New York billionaire as part of their flock and say the idea of supporting him stinks.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Businessman Donald Trump could be walking into hostile territory this week when he appears at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, where grassroots activists say they don\u2019t see the New York billionaire as part of their flock and say the idea of supporting him stinks.", "title": "Donald Trump is hard to stomach for CPAC activists", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/3/donald-trump-hard-stomach-cpac-activists/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/01/GOP_2016_Trump.JPEG-0c1d7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/01/GOP_2016_Trump.JPEG-0c1d7.jpg", "description": "Businessman Donald Trump could be walking into hostile territory this week when he appears at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, where grassroots activists say they don't see the New", "card": "summary", "title": "Donald Trump is hard to stomach for CPAC activists"}, "Author": "Seth McLaughlin", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Super Tuesday, Republican Party, Donald Trump"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4494\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI happen to like Donald Trump,\u201d said Wayne Mazza, of Pennsylvania.\nTed Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, who are vying to become the strongest alternative to Mr. Trump, and Ohio Gov.\nMichael Thomsett of Tennessee, though, said he still thinks Mr. Trump can be stopped.\nSome, though, embraced Mr. Trump.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything against him whatsoever, he is just not right for a conservative Republican party.\u201dAsked whether he considered Mr. Trump as conservative, Mr. Merritt, who supports Mr. Cruz, did not miss a beat."}
