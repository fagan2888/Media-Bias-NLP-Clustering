Sticking her tongue out like a sheep dog, wagging her tail against Robin Thicke\u2019s middle-aged paunch while the world watched her get the attention she craved\u2014she was way out-tweeting Justin Timberlake. Of course, we have to admit her egregious TV series with her poor washed-up dad was never our cup of meat, either. Maybe she really \u201ccan\u2019t stop,\u201d but we certainly can. This popped tart belongs in the recycle bin. But on the bright side, she does make us kind of miss Amanda Bynes.\n\nRick Scott\n\nSo the moment the ink is dry, metaphorically speaking, on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision to gut the Voting Rights Act, Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Rick Scott renews his efforts to \u201cscrub\u201d his state\u2019s voter lists. As a reporter at the Tampa Bay Times put it, \u201cthe burden will fall most heavily on urban counties with large Hispanic populations, notably Miami-Dade.\u201d Why? Because the governor is on the prowl for \u201cnoncitizens\u201d who dare to vote. How many will he find? Few, if any, of course, but that\u2019s not the point\u2014and it never was. It\u2019s just part of the state\u2019s Republican attack machine\u2019s mandate to strike fear in the hearts of those who might elect a Democrat.\n\nRick Perry\n\nOops, we almost let the Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry leave office without another Pink Slip! You\u2019d think that one of the richest states in the country would have a higher standard of living for every Texan, not just the rich white conservatives who have kept Perry in office, but you\u2019d be wrong. Thanks to his attack on the state\u2019s health care system, Texas has the greatest percentage of uninsured people in the United States. As NPR reported, \u201cNearly 6.5 million Texans are now uninsured even though the majority of them have full-time jobs.\u201d And don\u2019t forget what\u2019s he\u2019s done to women\u2019s reproductive rights, despite the best efforts of Wendy Davis, a Democratic State Senator who stood up against him in a attention-grabbing filibuster. To his credit, Perry did issue an executive order mandating that all girls entering 6th grade in Texas get the Gardisil vaccine, which eventually cut the teenage HPV infection rate in half, but it was manufactured by Merck, which gave Perry\u2019s gubernatorial campaign $400,000. Pay to play, eh? More recently, as The New Republic\u2019s Molly Redden wrote, the cowboy governor\u2019s refusal to accept the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion has denied health insurance to 1.5 million Texans living below the poverty line. And to think this guy was once a front-runner in the 2012 Republican presidential primary before he lost count in that fateful \u201coops\u201d moment that should hound him forever!\n\nTom Corbett\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s Republican governor, Tom Corbett, recently hired a certifiable nut job, Ana Puig, to be the legislative liaison for the state\u2019s Department of Revenue. She founded the Kitchen Table Patriots, a Tea Party cabal, whose \u201cmedia guy\u201d was a Nazi memorabilia enthusiast. She\u2019s promoted events featuring topics like \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood and creeping sharia law in America\u201d and \u201cPro-Islamic bias and indoctrination in our public school textbooks,\u201d and she\u2019s gone on to claim that President Obama has a \u201cmodel for implementation of 21st century Marxism.\u201d We\u2019d give her a pink slip, but let\u2019s go straight to the top: Corbett, you shouldn\u2019t be encouraging people who think this way in times like these. The Keystone State can do better.\n\nPaul LePage\n\nIt might start to look like it\u2019s \u201cPick on Crazy Republican Governors Month\u201d but there\u2019s a reason Maine Gov. Paul LePage deserves a Pink Slip. He told a group of Mainers recently that President Obama \u201chates white people.\u201d (Tell that to Lawrence Summers! No, don\u2019t, we don\u2019t want the president talking to that arrogant a-hole.) Reportedly LePage told a group of Republican lawmakers that Obama could have been the best president ever if he had just highlighted his biracial heritage but, LePage explained, Obama hasn\u2019t done that \u201cbecause he hates white people.\u201d Where do these guys get these nutty notions? And just as important, where do they get the votes to take office? That\u2019s what\u2019s really scary.\n\nIke Boutwell\n\nThis Kentucky movie theater owner banned \u201cThe Butler\u201d from his Movie Palace and Showtime Cinemas venue in Elizabethtown. Apparently he was outraged that Jane Fonda was portraying former First Lady Nancy Reagan in Lee Daniel\u2019s hit film about an African-American butler who served eight U.S. presidents. From any perspective, it\u2019s been a big box office success. But Ike Boutwell, a former Marine, still regards one of America\u2019s greatest living actresses as \u201can enemy of the United States.\u201d He said it would be \u201cthrowing gas on the fire\u201d to screen this movie, and it would be \u201ca terrible dishonorment [sic] on my part to give money to a woman\u201d such as Fonda. He\u2019s still holding a grudge because Fonda foolishly allowed herself to be part of a North Vietnamese propaganda photograph posing with Hanoi\u2019s soldiers manning an anti-aircraft gun in 1972, something she has since regarded as \u201can unforgivable mistake\u2026. I don\u2019t know if I was set up or not. I was an adult. I take responsibility for my actions.\u201d Boutwell should get with the times. These days Vietnam has become a tourist trap for westerners. The war is over, buddy. Hollywood is as America as apple pie.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nWe still want him to run in a Republican presidential primary because he is so much fun to mock. But when New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed a $40 million lawsuit against the Donald accusing his Trump University of engaging in illegal business practices, that really got our attention. Apparently Trump treated students like chumps at his for-profit investment school, charging them $1,500 to $10,000 in fees. As Schneiderman said, \u201cNo one, no matter how rich or famous they are, has a right to scam hardworking New Yorkers.\u201d The investigation first came to light in 2011 after it was reported that dozens of students had complained to authorities in New York, Texas, Florida and Illinois that they were being hoodwinked or, as our A.G. put it, being snookered \u201cto spend tens of thousands of dollars they couldn\u2019t afford for lessons they never got.\u201d We\u2019re not going to wait for the wheels of justice to turn because we already see through that phony promoter with the trussed-up pompadour: Trump, you\u2019re fired.\n\nChancey Allen Luna & James Francis Edwards\n\nFor \u201cthe fun of it,\u201d Dwayne Jones, 17, told Oklahoma police. That was the explanation why his companions Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and James Francis Edwards, 15, allegedly shot dead a college athlete who happened to jog past the car the three teens were sitting in. And so Christopher Lane, a 22-year-old Australian college baseball player attending school in the U.S., took a bullet in the back because they were bored\u2014and armed.\n\nSydney Leathers\n\nGive the enterprising young woman some credit, but parlaying her 15 minutes of fame after being on the receiving end of Anthony Weiner\u2019s excited sexts into an X-rated video career, as witnessed by her frolicking in the skin flick, \u201cWeiner and Me,\u201d is arguably going too far, even by our hypocritical standards. This 23-year-old Indiana gal has done a clothing endorsement deal, an appearance on Howard Stern and been a guest host of a Manhattan strip club. She\u2019s entitled to market herself. But she did an unprotected sex scene for Vivid Entertainment with a guy who had done a previous sex scene with a young woman who tested positive for HIV, according to Gawker, reportedly causing a \u201ccoitus inter-ruptus\u201d in the sex industry for a bit so they could shake it all out. Blowing the cover of the former Brooklyn Congressman whose wife just gave birth to a little Weiner is one thing, but putting her own life in danger so some shmuck could profit off her cheap thrills is not a good business move. On the other hand, maybe Leathers could go back to Indianapolis and run for Congress. She certainly knows something about the body politic by now.\n\nRobert Mugabe\n\nPoor Zimbabwe. This hard-pressed country, once Britain\u2019s former colony when it was known as Rhodesia, just can\u2019t shake this shady guy who\u2019s been running the pitiful place since 1980. He had his moment in the sun, when he helped black Zimbabweans get majority rule, but that was years ago. His hold on power has only become encrusted with corruption and greed, while the prosperity he promised his people has always seemed to rest only on the property he could confiscate from white settlers and their businesses. His record stinks but he just won another five-year term\u2014and he\u2019s only 89. Was there election fraud? What a racist thing to suggest! Mugabe racked up 61 percent of the presidential vote. But he did say that \u201cthere will come a time when we lose our patience\u201d with the West\u2019s constant pressure for democratic reforms. We lost our patience with this authoritarian villain long ago. Good riddance.\n\n[/colored_box]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Long Island Press", "og": {"site_name": "Long Island News from the Long Island Press", "description": "Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest WhatsApp Email Tumblr LinkedIn Reddit Print [colored_box color=\u201dred\u201d] Miley Cyrus Miley Cyrus didn\u2019t win one prize at MTV\u2019s recent Video Music Awards but she sure was a big hit in the worst way.
