Efforts to corral children into highly focused sports programs often arise from good intentions, Jayanthi says, yet research suggests that kids who specialize in a single sport when they\u2019re young risk injury and burnout but don\u2019t improve their odds of attaining an elite sports career.\n\nThe push to start children on focused training programs stems in part from the idea that practice distinguishes elites from the rest, a notion Malcolm Gladwell popularized with his \u201c10,000-hour rule\u201d in his book \u201cOutliers.\u201d\n\nCiting research by Florida State University psychologist K. Anders Ericsson showing that a group of elite violinists accumulated an average of 10,000 hours of practice before reaching the top, Gladwell asserts that 10,000 hours is the \u201cmagic number for true expertise.\u201d\n\nYet Gladwell\u2019s rule contradicts the evidence regarding sports. Studies have found a wide range in the amount of practice that athletes require to reach the top, says David Epstein, author of \u201cThe Sports Gene,\u201d a book that examines sports performance.\n\nHe points to Swedish athlete Stefan Holm as an example. Holm devoted most of his life to training for the high jump, only to lose the 2007 World Championships to a competitor who had taken up the event 18 months earlier.\n\nHours spent training are just one aspect of an athlete\u2019s development; motivation and other psychological factors are also important, says Karin Moesch, a sports psychologist at the University of Copenhagen. Kids who complete many hours of concentrated training by age 12 or 13 may lose interest, Moesch says.\n\n\u201cThey think, \u2018I\u2019ve already done enough of that,\u2019 so they stop,\u201d she says.\n\nInjury is another concern. Jayanthi\u2019s research team studied young athletes who had come to a clinic either for sports-related injuries or sports physicals. Among the 124 tennis players in the study, those who were injured spent more than five times as much time playing tennis as they did in unstructured recreation. Uninjured players spent slightly more than twice as much time in organized sports as in free play.\n\nIn another study, Jayanthi\u2019s group evaluated about 1,200 athletes between the ages of 7 and 18, and found that injuries occurred more commonly among those who did specialized training.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the hours spent; it\u2019s what you\u2019re doing during that time,\u201d Jayanthi says, and unstructured play appears less risky than organized practice. \u201cKids have self-restraint. When they\u2019re playing for fun, they stop when they start to feel a strain, but if they\u2019re at practice they may continue because they don\u2019t want to let the coach down.\u201d Early specialization cuts short a period when young athletes can sample a wide variety of sports, and robs them of the opportunity to stumble upon their best fit, Epstein says.\n\n\u201cThough narrowly focused child prodigies fascinate us and garner media attention, it turns out that later specializers are more the norm than the exception,\u201d he writes in his book.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/07/hfyouth08-1.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae9a\"", "article_summary": "Jayanthi\u2019s research team studied young athletes who had come to a clinic either for sports-related injuries or sports physicals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the hours spent; it\u2019s what you\u2019re doing during that time,\u201d Jayanthi says, and unstructured play appears less risky than organized practice.\nHours spent training are just one aspect of an athlete\u2019s development; motivation and other psychological factors are also important, says Karin Moesch, a sports psychologist at the University of Copenhagen.\nJayanthi says this is emblematic of a growing emphasis on performance and specialization that has invaded many youth sports.\nRecently, a preteen tennis player came into Neeru Jayanthi\u2019s clinic for follow-up on an overuse injury to his wrist."}
