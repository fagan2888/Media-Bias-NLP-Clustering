As a guest on The Tonight Show, he addressed some of the latest examples for the attention.\n\nAs soon as Jimmy Fallon asked him about \u201cthe big scandal that you have going on,\u201c Christie knew what he was referring to. Fallon explained how people saw Christie pouring his bag of M&Ms into a bigger box of M&Ms at a basketball game.\n\nChristie explained that he had \u201ca big choice to make,\u201d since arenas sell boxes of M&Ms which actually just contain a bag of M&Ms. He reminded Fallon he\u2019s \u201can enthusiastic fan,\u201d and he didn\u2019t want to be dealing with \u201ca flimsy bag\u201d which \u201ccould spill all over the place\u201d if Christie was going to get up and cheer.\n\nFallon settled it with a gold dish for Christie to eat out of, reading \u201cCC\u2019s M&Ms,\u201d which \u201cDonald Trump doesn\u2019t even have\u2026 at games.\u201d\n\nChristie also had to answer for his standing behind Trump on Super Tuesday, and the memorable expressions on his face. Fallon asked what was on the minds of many, \u201cwere you being held hostage at this time?\u201d\n\nTo reaction from the audience, Christie told Fallon \u201cthis is what you would look like if you were standing behind Jay Leno when he was doing his monologue.\u201d He explained \u201cif you\u2019re used to talking, it\u2019s awkward not to talk. So if you\u2019re standing there, I\u2019m listening. What are you supposed to look like when you\u2019re listening?\u201d\n\nThe two debated what Christie could have actually done, with Fallon suggesting he move over. Christie also turned out to be a fan of the Christie and Fallon cutouts that were brought out.\n\nChristie also defended his endorsement of Trump which he called \u201chard, it\u2019s not like I drew it out of a hat. It was my judgment that I thought he was better than the other two.\u201d Christie also said he would support Fallon if he had declared, especially since he was wearing a New Jersey pin.\n\nIn part because of his facial expressions, Christie has a hard time believing he would be asked to becoming vice-president. After his term of governor is over, Christie would \u201cmaybe like to play tambourine,\u201d for The Roots.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Image via screenshot.
