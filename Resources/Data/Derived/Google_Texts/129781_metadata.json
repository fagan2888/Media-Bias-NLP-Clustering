A pained but defiant South Carolina church reopens four days after nine parishioners were massacred. California's plan to mine healthcare data raises privacy worries. Here are some story lines I don't want you to miss today.\n\n\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nDefiant \"Mother Emanuel\"\n\nEmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church -- \"Mother Emanuel\" -- reopened in Charleston, S.C., four days after nine parishioners were slain there in what evidence suggests was a race-driven rampage. Racism, however, has never kept this church down, not even during slavery. There was pain, to be sure, but also defiance and pride. Separately, the son of one victim says he was told the shooting suspect tried to kill himself.\n\nRace and the \"T\" Word\n\nIt's a question many are asking: If the massacre in Charleston was, as officials allege, motivated by racism and white supremacists, why don't they call it \"terrorism\"? Two prominent Republicans called it that Sunday, including Rep. Devin Nunes of California. Then there's the question of flying the Confederate flag. GOP leaders are treading more carefully on that one.\n\nMining Your Health Data\n\nSounds great: Make sure healthcare providers really help people get better instead of just moving money. The method worries privacy advocates. California aims to collect insurance data on prescriptions, doctor visits and hospital stays for every Obamacare patient. It'll be confidential, we're assured, but recent hacking scandals don't exactly inspire trust.\n\n\n\nThe Oddest Couple\n\n\n\nThey're the two Supreme Court justices most likely to disagree: Antonin Scalia, a brash, burly conservative; and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a diminutive, soft-spoken champion of the left. Yet the two often dine, vacation and spend New Year's Eve together. They were photographed on an elephant in India. They've even inspired an opera. How do they bridge an ideological chasm?\n\n\n\nHardly Hot Property\n\n\n\nAn elderly couple about to lose the one-room apartment they've had for 29 years. A retired woman, also facing eviction, who lives in a backyard shed and bathes in a tub of sun-heated water. A supermarket worker who shares a house, and bathroom, with eight other renters.

Diabetic retinopathy was robbing him of sight -- but not vision, it turns out. Twenty-five years later, he's a successful director of animation for outfits like Disney. \"The narrowing of my view,\" he says, \"has made me look at the broader picture.\" Today's Great Read is an inspiring story of, as Demeyer calls it, \"life through a keyhole.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\n-- Fresno is tougher than almost anyplace else on water wasters, a strategy that seems to be working.\n\n-- L.A. unveils an online system that lets people look up construction permits and other building records, saving trips downtown.\n\n\n\n-- 1 surfboard + 66 surfers + 15 seconds = a world record in Huntington beach.\n\n\n\n-- Look for gradual cooling, and a decline in fire danger, starting today.\n\nNATION-WORLD\n\n-- Mideast allies worry the U.S. could turn its back on them in the quest for a nuclear deal with Iran.\n\n-- France floats a new proposal for Mideast peace.
