Thank you for inviting a doctor to talk to financial people. Thats how Atul Gawande, M.D. opened his June 23 keynote address at the HFMA Annual National Institute in Las Vegas, where he stressed that clinical and healthcare financial professionals dont talk to each other and need to.

Despite political battles, the Affordable Care Act is law and has settled the debate over whether people deserve healthcare, said Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Womens Hospital, physician IT champion and best-selling author. Fights continue over how to provide care, but the moral decision that people have a right to healthcare insurance coverage has been made, he asserted.
