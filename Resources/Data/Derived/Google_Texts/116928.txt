LeHigh Valley Health Network to consolidate its physician practices

Allentown, Pa.-based LeHigh Valley Health Network announced Tuesday it plans to consolidate a handful of its 140 affiliated physician practices that overlap, according to The Morning Call.

This will result in unspecified workforce reductions, which the network has said will be "small." Employees will have the opportunity to find other jobs within the network, and a network statement says it anticipates the majority of employees will remain with LVHN, according to the report.

Patients will experience minimal impact from the restructuring, according to network spokesman Brian Downs.

Mr. Downs said the move is a result of pressures from the Affordable Care Act, the move to fee-for-value healthcare and reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid, according to the report.
