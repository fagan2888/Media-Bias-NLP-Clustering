So that's an important deal.\"\n\nHarper says they fully expected the president to veto their legislation. But he says they're still proud of the accomplishment. He says getting legislation like this passed is the first step. And putting a Republican President in office comes next.\n\n\"This is why the presidential elections are so important and why I believe it's important that we elect a pro-life republican for president next year,\" Harper says. \"We know you can get these things to the president's desk.\"\n\nAs for who that president should be, Harper has thrown his support behind John Kasich.\n\n\"It's still a little early. He hasn't gotten a lot of traction yet,\" Harper says. \"But he's certainly electable. So if I could hand-pick the ticket today for the Republicans, I'd take Kasich/Rubio. We'll see what happens.\"\n\nStill leading in Republican polls is Donald Trump.\n\n\"Here's what everyone likes about Trump, and I like to watch him because I want to see who he's going to insult that particular day or night,\" Harper explains. \"He says unfiltered things.\"\n\nBut is he electable?\n\n\"I think anyone is electable under the right set of circumstances,\" he says.\n\nHarper says whichever nominee is chosen will be supported by Republicans, and he believes this latest legislation is a sign of good things that could come.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Rep.
