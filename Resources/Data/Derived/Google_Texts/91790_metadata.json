By Monday both buttons were present, in green, on the front page.\n\nThe addition is not surprising as the Obamacare website has been plagued by problems and glitches since its Oct. 1 launch. Even prior to the button\u2019s addition, Obamacare representatives were encouraging people to apply over the phone.\n\nAn HHS official directed The Daily Caller to a Sunday blog post for additional information about the changes, which acknowledges the problems with the site and explains officials \u201chave been working around the clock to make improvements\u201d to Healthcare.gov.\n\nThe Associated Press reported over the weekend that administration officials said that staffing at call centers has been increased by 50 percent.\n\nThe Hill notes that in addition to the phone prompt the updated site offers users the ability to preview plans and calculate eligibility online.\n\nThe changes appear as the President Obama is scheduled to speak about the problems with the new health care law\u2019s rollout Monday in the Rose Garden.\n\nTo date the Obama administration has not released official data on how many people have enrolled in plans through the exchanges. Over the weekend administration sources said that about 476,000 applications have been filed through the federal and state exchanges since the launch at the beginning of October.\n\nThursday a House panel is scheduled to to hold a hearing on the Obamacare rollout failures. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has refused to testify before the panel.\n\nFollow Caroline on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caroline May", "description": "The Obamacare website, Healthcare.gov, has a new button on its front page: \u201cAPPLY BY PHONE\u201d.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The troubled Obamacare website, Healthcare.gov, has a new button on its front page: \u201cAPPLY BY PHONE\u201d.
