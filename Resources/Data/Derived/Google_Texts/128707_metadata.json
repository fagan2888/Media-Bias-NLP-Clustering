Geanie Morrison, R-Victoria, amends Texas\u2019 family code to clarify the circumstances in which a minor may obtain permission from a court to receive an abortion without notifying a parent or legal guardian.\n\nThe legislation passed the House last Thursday on a 93-46 vote and now is before the state Senate.\n\nCurrent law in Texas requires minors to notify and receive consent from at least one parent or legal guardian to have an abortion. Minors who want to bypass parental notification and consent because of abuse or neglect may seek to obtain a waiver through the courts.\n\nThe new legislation would require minors to file their request in the county where they live and to make their case in person rather than using \u201cvideoconferencing, telephone conferencing, or other remote electronic means.\u201d\n\nThe legislation also would amend current law to require a physician \u201cwho has reason to believe that a minor has been or may be physically or sexually abused\u201d to \u201cimmediately report the suspected abuse\u201d to the Department of Family and Protective Services.\n\nIt also requires women to provide \u201cvalid government record of identification\u201d to prove their age before undergoing an abortion.\n\nMorrison told the Associated Press the legislation will \u201cimprove protection of the minor girl and ensure that parental rights are protected.\u201d\n\nRep. Roland Gutierrez, D-San Antonio, told the AP the bill restricts women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cI think the true issue here is that the authors of this legislation want to make it harder and harder to get a judicial bypass,\u201d said Gutierrez.\n\nIn a statement, Emily Kebodeaux, the general counsel at Texas Right to Life, applauded the legislation:\n\nAfter long hours of intense debate on the House floor, the Pro-Life movement in Texas saw a huge victory through the passage of House Bill 3994. The final version of the bill encompasses many needed reforms to the judicial process available to minors seeking an abortion without involvement from their parents. This judicial bypass process should be written to protect minors from abuse as well as from being escorted through the loopholes of the process by the abortion industry trying to enhance their profit margin.\n\nNARAL Pro-Choice Texas called the bill \u201cawful\u201d in a statement.\n\n\u201c[HB 3994 is a] very harmful bill that attacks abused and neglected teens\u2019 access to abortion,\u201d the group said.\n\nTexas\u2019 KBTX reports that about 300 minors obtain abortions through the judicial bypass process each year in the state.\n\nThe bill is expected to be approved by Texas\u2019 GOP-led senate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legislation cleared the Texas House of Representatives that would strengthen the restrictions on minors receiving abortions without notifying their parents.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Legislation cleared the Texas House of Representatives that would strengthen the restrictions on minors receiving abortions without notifying their parents.", "title": "Texas Bill Alters How Minors Can Get Court-Ordered Abortion", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/TexasAbortion.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-20T15:13:10+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Gpgzfi"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Legislation cleared the Texas House of Representatives that would strengthen the restrictions on minors receiving abortions without notifying their parents.", "title": "Texas Bill Alters How Minors Can Get Court-Ordered Abortion", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/TexasAbortion.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-05-20T14:19:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-20T15:13:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Texas legislature, Rep.
