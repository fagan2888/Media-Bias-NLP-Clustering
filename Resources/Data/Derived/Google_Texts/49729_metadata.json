(Reuters) - Police had probable cause to search the apartment of a former hospital worker accused of murdering university student Hannah Graham in 2014 after a tracking dog picked up the scent of the woman, a judge ruled on Monday.\n\nThe police tracking dog found the student\u2019s scent at the apartment and on the passenger side of Jesse Matthew Jr.'s car, a former detective testified on Monday.\n\nJudge Cheryl Higgins denied a motion from defense lawyers to suppress evidence found in the search.\n\nThe disappearance and murder of Graham, an 18-year-old University of Virginia sophomore, shocked the campus and drew national headlines in late 2014. Matthew was the last person seen with her and could face the death penalty if convicted.\n\nStuart Garner Jr., a former Louisa County detective and dog handler, testified in a pretrial hearing that his dog alerted him to Graham's scent in several areas of Matthew's apartment during a massive search for the student.\n\nGarner sparred with defense attorney Douglas Ramseur about whether he had told Ramseur that he believed that Graham had never been in Matthew\u2019s apartment.\n\n\"Didn\u2019t you say Hannah Graham had never been present in Jesse Matthew\u2019s apartment?\u201d Ramseur asked, reading from an affidavit he had submitted to the court.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know,\u201d Garner said. \u201cI found that her scent was present.\u201d\n\nThe pretrial hearing, in Albemarle Circuit Court, offered a rare window into forensic evidence linking Matthew to\n\nGraham. Matthew's trial is scheduled to begin July.\n\nGraham disappeared in September 2014 and her remains were found about five weeks later. Surveillance video taken in Charlottesville's downtown mall showed Matthew and Graham walking together.\n\nMatthew also has been indicted for the 2009 disappearance and murder of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington. He is serving three life sentences for a 2005 sexual assault in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\n(Writing by Ian Simpson and Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Stephen Coates)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.", "title": "Judge authorizes search after scent of slain Virginia woman is found", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/11/Slain-Virginia-students-scent-found-suspects-apartment-witness", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-virginia-student_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/11/Slain-Virginia-students-scent-found-suspects-apartment-witness", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-virginia-student_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"Didn\u2019t you say Hannah Graham had never been present in Jesse Matthew\u2019s apartment?\u201d Ramseur asked, reading from an affidavit he had submitted to the court.\nThe disappearance and murder of Graham, an 18-year-old University of Virginia sophomore, shocked the campus and drew national headlines in late 2014.\nThe police tracking dog found the student\u2019s scent at the apartment and on the passenger side of Jesse Matthew Jr.'s car, a former detective testified on Monday.\nJudge Cheryl Higgins denied a motion from defense lawyers to suppress evidence found in the search.\nGarner sparred with defense attorney Douglas Ramseur about whether he had told Ramseur that he believed that Graham had never been in Matthew\u2019s apartment."}
