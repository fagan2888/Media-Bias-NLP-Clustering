Her office has received more than 200 complaints about Federal Verification and dozens of related businesses since 2012, the lawsuit said.\n\n\u201cCustomers report being deceived and scammed,\u201d the lawsuit said. \u201cMany customers express great frustration with the failure of Federal Verification to timely and accurately prepare their application as promised, and to submit it to the GSA after several months to more than two years since paying hefty fees.\u201d\n\nFederal Verification and its president, James Dale Sprecher, have denied wrongdoing. The company plans to use the bankruptcy process to figure out how to settle their disputes with people who\u2019ve filed complaints and remain in business, said lawyer Michael Markham, who put the firm into chapter 11 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Tampa.\n\nMany firms do specialize in getting small companies into the government contracting industry. During the most recent fiscal year, federal, state, and local governments spent nearly $33 billion on products and work that flowed through the GSA office, but the process for getting that work can be tough to navigate.\n\nMs. Bondi\u2019s office linked Federal Verification to more than 60 business names, including GSA Application Services and Government Awards Consulting, and to more than 50 websites. Some websites used logos that were \u201clikely to be confused with the federal government websites,\u201d the lawsuit said.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, some Federal Verification telemarketers told prospective customers that they were working directly for GSA or the U.S. government and that the average GSA contract winner earns $2 million or more in a year.\n\nSome Federal Verification telemarketers also said that \u201calmost all\u201d of its clients get GSA contracts, regardless of what they sell, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe company\u2019s moves allegedly violate the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, Ms. Bondi\u2019s office said. With the lawsuit, it\u2019s calling for Federal Verification to pay a penalty of $10,000 per case\u2014or $15,000 if that case involves a senior citizen.\n\nThe company\u2019s bankruptcy filing momentarily halted a trial in state court set for April 23. But after Ms. Bondi\u2019s office argued that the lawsuit involves \u201ca matter of public safety and health,\u201d Judge K. Rodney May ruled at a hearing on Thursday that the trial could go on.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
