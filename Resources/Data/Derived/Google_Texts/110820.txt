National Journal reporter Ron Fournier said Sunday that President Obama’s divisive rhetoric over the Iran deal indicated that he was out of touch with his critics and even his own party caucus.

“Barack Obama for all his strengths does not know how to find common ground with his critics and he does not understand even his own caucus,” Fournier said.

The panel of CNN’s Inside Politics was discussing news that Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) is the latest Democrat to defy the president on his highly unpopular nuclear deal. After dealing heavy-handed criticism to those who oppose his deal, Obama will now have to deal with members of his own party rejecting what he portrays as America’s only option aside from a long and costly war with Iran.

“I will vote to disapprove the agreement, not because I believe war is a viable or desirable option, nor to challenge the path of diplomacy,” Schumer wrote last week. “It is because I believe Iran will not change, and under this agreement it will be able to achieve its dual goals of eliminating sanctions while ultimately retaining its nuclear and non-nuclear power.”

White House officials and their liberal proxies have raked Schumer over the coals for his defection, going so far as to insinuate that the Jewish senator is putting loyalty to Israel ahead of his responsibilities to the U.S.

Current and former White House aides have publicly questioned Schumer’s position as the party’s next leader in the Senate due to his position on the deal.

“I certainly wouldn’t be surprised if there were individual members of the Senate Democratic caucus who would consider the voting record of those who want to lead the Democratic caucus,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said.

After calling Republicans “ideologically driven” and in “common cause with hardliners in Iran,” it remains to be seen what kind of approach the White House will take if more Democrats line up against the deal.
