The 2013 National League Gold Glove winner was hit on the left hand by a pitch from Cleveland right-hander Corey Kluber.\n\nIt turns out that Arenado suffered a bone bruise and X-rays were negative, meaning he did not break a bone.\n\nArenado, who hit a double in his first two at-bats against Cleveland, was hit by Kluber\u2019s pitch with no outs and two runners on base in the top of the sixth inning. After talking with Rockies head trainer Keith Dugger, Arenado left the game and was replaced by pinch-runner Angelys Nina.\n\nIn the Rockies\u2019 4-3 win over the Mariners at Salt River Fields, new Rockies lefty starter Brett Anderson had a black cloud, silver-lining kind of start.\n\nHe allowed 12 hits, including a homer and four doubles against the Mariners. Anderson, using his sinker and slider to get groundball outs, was able to limit the damage to just three runs in his six innings of work.\n\n\u201cIt was a bittersweet outing,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI never like to give up that many hits. It was probably the worst put-away breaking ball I\u2019ve had in God knows how long. But the good part about it was in those situations I was able to get out of it for the most part and I ended up having a quality start.\n\n\u201cAnytime you give up 12 hits and have tons of baserunners and get out of it with a quality start, I guess I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies won the game in the ninth on double off the wall be outfielder Jason Pridie to score Charlie Culberson from first base.\n\nRegarding Anderson, manager Walt Weiss said: \u201cBend but don\u2019t break, he was the epitome of that this afternoon. That guy knows how to pitch. I saw (former Brave) Tommy Glavin do that, first hand, for three years. You think you have him in trouble a few times, then you look up in the seventh inning and you have two runs. That\u2019s what it reminded me of watching Anderson today. That\u2019s just an affirmation to me that this guy knows what he\u2019s doing, knows how to pitch.\u201d\n\nRight-handed reliever Chad Bettis pitched the top of the ninth and got the victory, punching out two. With every outing he appears to cement his spot on the 25-man roster. He has not been scored upon this spring.\n\n\u201cChad has put himself in a great position,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe\u2019s thrown the ball as well as we could hope. That right-handed power that he brings is very valuable.\u201d\n\nBack in Goodyear, right-hander Jordan Lyles, competing with Franklin Morales for the fifth spot in the rotation, started off strong, then buckled a bit in the fifth inning. Over 4 2/3 innings, he gave up five runs (two earned) on five hits. He walked three and struck out three. His spring ERA sits at 3.18.\n\nThe Rockies beat the Indians 14-6, pounding out a spring-high 22 hits.\n\nJordan Pacheco hit his first home run of the spring, a two-run shot, and outfielder Tim Wheeler continued his terrific spring with a three-run shot. It was his fourth homer of the Cactus League season.\n\nHits: Catcher Wilin Rosario hit a two-run bomb in the fourth inning to drive in Brandon Barnes in the win over the Mariners. It was Rosario\u2019s second homer. \u2026 Against the Indians, Jordan Pacheco hit his first home run of the spring, a two-run shot, and outfielder Tim Wheeler continued his terrific spring with a three-run shot. It was his fourth homer of the Cactus League season.\n\nMisses: Rockies center fielder Charlie Blackmon, competing for a spot on the roster, struck out in his first three at bats vs. Mariners rookie lefty Roenis Elias.\n\nUp next: The Rockies host the White Sox Sunday at Salt Rivers Fields in a 1:10 p.m. game (2:10 p.m. MDT). Right-hander Tyler Chatwood starts for the Rockies opposite Lefty Chris Sale. Relievers Matt Belisle, Wilton Lopez and Adam Ottavino are lined up to throw for the Rockies.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brett Anderson,Chad Bettis,Nolan Arenado,Walt Weiss", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "The Rockies said that Nolan Arenado suffered a bone bruise Saturday, but  X-rays showed no broken bones.", "title": "Colorado Rockies Nolan Arenado OK after getting hit in left hand", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/03/22/rockies-nolan-arenado-leaves-game-getting-hit-left-hand/16858/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/03/nolan-arenado.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Rockies said that Nolan Arenado suffered a bone bruise Saturday, but  X-rays showed no broken bones.", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Nolan Arenado OK after getting hit in left hand", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/03/22/rockies-nolan-arenado-leaves-game-getting-hit-left-hand/16858/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/03/nolan-arenado.jpg", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Rockies said that Nolan Arenado suffered a bone bruise, but X-rays showed no broken bones."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8ec\"", "article_summary": "After talking with Rockies head trainer Keith Dugger, Arenado left the game and was replaced by pinch-runner Angelys Nina.\nThe 2013 National League Gold Glove winner was hit on the left hand by a pitch from Cleveland right-hander Corey Kluber.\nIn the Rockies\u2019 4-3 win over the Mariners at Salt River Fields, new Rockies lefty starter Brett Anderson had a black cloud, silver-lining kind of start.\nUp next: The Rockies host the White Sox Sunday at Salt Rivers Fields in a 1:10 p.m. game (2:10 p.m. MDT).\nIt turns out that Arenado suffered a bone bruise and X-rays were negative, meaning he did not break a bone."}
