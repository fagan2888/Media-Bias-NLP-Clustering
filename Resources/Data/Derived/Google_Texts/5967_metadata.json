Marcy Kaptur, D-Toledo, told a story about a woman who ran across the street and hugged her to thank Kaptur for supporting health care reform.\n\nKaptur said the woman told her, \"I just want you to know I have epilepsy. I am insured for the first time in my life.\"\n\nKaptur said several groups still have large numbers of uninsured people, including single women, people from 50 to 65 and people who work for themselves or for very small businesses.\n\nPete Schade told the crowd that from May 2011 to May 2014, the number of people with private insurance treated at the health department's clinic rose from 145 to 239. The number of people on Medicaid rose from 483 to 521, while self-pay patients declined from 354 to 159. This suggests that health care reform is taking hold, he said.\n\nBOX: Need help buying health insurance?\n\nAnyone who wants to explore the health insurance exchange set up under the Affordable Care Act can go to healthcare.gov, but local counselors also are available for people who don't have a computer or who need help.\n\nLocal residents may call the Erie County Health Department at 419-626-5623. They also may call Family Health Services of Erie County, 419-557-7189.\n\nThe national hotline to seek information is 1-800-318-2596. It's available 24 hours a day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>When the health care exchanges set up by \"Obamacare\" launched last winter, newspapers reported that very few people enrolled at first because the process was so hard.", "og": {"site_name": "Sandusky Register", "description": "Obamacare enrollment easier this year, they say", "title": "Officials tout health insurance exchanges", "url": "http://www.sanduskyregister.com/Health-Care/2014/12/07/Officials-tout-health-insurance-exchanges", "image": "http://www.sanduskyregister.com/image/2014/12/07/x720_q60/F-Inqueue-SR-StoryArchive-12052014-Health-Enrollment-009-A-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.sanduskyregister.com", "description": "Obamacare enrollment easier this year, they say", "creator": "sanduskyregistr", "image": {"src": "http://www.sanduskyregister.com/image/2014/12/07/x720_q60/F-Inqueue-SR-StoryArchive-12052014-Health-Enrollment-009-A-jpg.jpg"}, "title": "Officials tout health insurance exchanges", "site": "@sanduskyregistr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 201412070013}}, "keywords": "Sandusky Register,Health Care", "google-site-verification": "fZibeoFmCJXMlwdTVWdLhmIoBIawotoXlU1VnWOTyc0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd968a\"", "article_summary": "And those who still lack health insurance will find that the health insurance exchanges are working better this year, she said.\nOfficials tout health insurance exchangesWhen the health care exchanges set up by \"Obamacare\" launched last winter, newspapers reported that very few people enrolled at first because the process was so hard.\nBOX: Need help buying health insurance?\nOfficials who held a press conference Friday at the Erie County Health Department are trying to get the word out that open enrollment has resumed, and that there's help for people who are worried they can't figure out how to buy health insurance.\nThey also may call Family Health Services of Erie County, 419-557-7189."}
