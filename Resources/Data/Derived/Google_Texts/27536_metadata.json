Ted Cruz became the first major Republican candidate to declare himself officially in the 2016 presidential race. In announcing his presidential ambition, Cruz repeated a number of dubious claims we have heard before, and a few we haven\u2019t.\n\nSome highlights:\n\nCruz railed against a \u201cgovernment \u2026 that seeks to ban our ammunition.\u201d The Obama administration sought to ban a certain type of armor-piercing bullet, not all types of ammunition. The proposal has since been postponed.\n\nCruz claimed that as a result of the Affordable Care Act \u201cmillions \u2026 have lost their health insurance.\u201d In fact, about 10 million people on net gained insurance between September 2013 and December 2014, according to the Urban Institute.\n\nCruz also claimed that as a result of the law \u201cmillions [have been] forced into part-time work.\u201d There\u2019s no solid figure on how many may have had their hours cut to part time, but one analysis of monthly labor surveys said the number was \u201clikely\u201d a few hundred thousand.\n\nCruz announced his candidacy in an address at Liberty University on March 23. We\u2019ll review that speech and then highlight some of our work on claims Cruz has made over the past two years as a senator.\n\nThe Liberty Speech\n\n\n\nIn his announcement speech, Cruz accused the Obama administration of seeking \u201cto ban our ammunition.\u201d The administration isn\u2019t seeking to ban the public from buying ammunition, but it recently sought to ban a certain type of armor-piercing bullet.\n\nThe federal Gun Control Act of 1968 already bans armor-piercing ammunition with exemptions for ammunition it deems \u201cprimarily intended for sporting purposes.\u201d On Feb. 13, the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives proposed withdrawing an exemption it had granted in 1986 for the \u201cM855 \u2018green tip\u2019 ammunition,\u201d according to the agency\u2019s public notice explaining the proposal and seeking comments. The National Rifle Association said the M855 is commonly used in AR-15 rifles.\n\nCruz was one of 53 senators who signed a March 9 letter to the ATF objecting to the bureau\u2019s proposal for the M855. On March 10, the ATF announced it would postpone issuing a final decision, saying the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the 80,000 comments it had received to date were critical of the proposed change and required \u201cfurther study.\u201d\n\nCruz also made a pitch to repeal \u201cevery word of Obamacare,\u201d and he claimed that as a result of the law \u201cmillions \u2026 have lost their health insurance.\u201d\n\nCruz isn\u2019t the first to make this claim, which stems from President Obama\u2019s ill-fated promise, \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.\u201d That was clearly proven false when, in the fall of 2013, several million people received cancellation notices for individual market plans that no longer met the law\u2019s benefit requirements.\n\nBut to claim simply that millions lost their health insurance is misleading. Those individual market plans were discontinued, but policyholders weren\u2019t denied coverage. Many upgraded to compliant plans (albeit at a higher cost, for some).\n\nMoreover, there is evidence that far more have gained coverage than had their policies canceled. According to an Urban Institute report in March, the number of insured Americans rose by nearly 10 million between September 2013 and December 2014. Overall, the rate of uninsured in the U.S. fell during that period from 17.7 percent to 12.8 percent, the report said.\n\nCruz also claimed that the Affordable Care Act was hurting workers, saying \u201cmillions\u201d were being \u201cforced into part-time work.\u201d There may have been some impact on the hours of part-time workers, but we couldn\u2019t find any hard data that backs up Cruz\u2019s claim of \u201cmillions,\u201d or even approaches that figure.\n\nIn January, part of the employer mandate took effect, requiring businesses with 100 or more workers to offer health insurance to their full-time employees or pay a fine. Full-time, for purposes of the law, is defined as 30 hours or more per week. (The requirement will apply to businesses with 50 or more workers next year, with businesses below that staffing threshold remaining exempt.) This aspect of the law has led to anecdotal stories of employers cutting workers\u2019 hours to keep them under 30 hours.\n\nWhen we asked Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody\u2019s Analytics, about this issue, he told us that he didn\u2019t think the law had had much of an impact on job growth. But \u201c[i]f there is an impact it is on the number of part-timers who would like to work full-time. This has declined since the recession, but remains high by historical standards. This probably still reflects the ill-effects of the recession, but it may also reflect the impact of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nOne analysis, by FiveThirtyEight\u2019s chief economics writer, Ben Casselman, found it was \u201clikely\u201d that the law had \u201cled a few hundred thousand workers to see their hours cut or capped,\u201d based partly on a small increase in the proportion of part-time employees working between 25 and 29 hours a week from 2009 to 2013 and a small drop in the proportion working between 31 and 34 hours. That\u2019s based on the monthly Current Population Survey compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau. An analysis by the Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation also used CPS data and found \u201ca small increase in part-time work in 2014 beyond what would be expected at this point in the economic recovery.\u201d But that increase affected those working between 30 and 34 hours a week, as well as those below 30 hours. The analysis said the increase in part-time work was \u201cmore likely due to a slower than normal recovery of full-time jobs following the Great Recession.\u201d\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also has estimated that more than 2 million workers would cut their own hours \u2014 voluntarily \u2014 or retire earlier than they normally would have by 2021 because of the ACA. The reason? The law offers a secure option for purchasing individual insurance through the exchanges, and it provides more financial resources, in the form of subsidies, to those with low incomes.\n\nIn January, Andy Puzder, the CEO of CKE Restaurants (owner of Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s), made the same claim as Cruz \u2014 that \u201cmillions\u201d had moved from full-time to part-time jobs. But that number was speculation, based on Puzder\u2019s conversations with other restaurant-chain CEOs, as our fact-checking colleagues at Politifact wrote.\n\nCruz also repeated several misleading claims that we have written about before:\n\nCruz vowed to repeal \u201cevery word of Common Core,\u201d which he called an effort by the federal government to \u201cdictate school curriculum.\u201d As we have said before, the standards were developed by governors and state education officials and voluntarily adopted by states, and the curriculum is set by state and local school officials.\n\nCruz also warned that the Affordable Care Act puts the government \u201cbetween you and your doctor.\u201d As we wrote when Cruz made a similar claim back in 2013, the law doesn\u2019t create a government-run system. If anything, the law comes between you and your insurance company, forbidding them from capping your coverage or charging you more based on health status.\n\nCruz blamed the law for \u201cskyrocketing health insurance premiums.\u201d But as we have written before, premiums for those who buy their own private insurance will go up or down, in some cases significantly, depending on individual circumstances. And premiums for employer-sponsored plans, where most Americans have coverage, have increased at a much slower rate than they did under President George W. Bush.\n\nThe Cruz File\n\nA 30-second video announcing Cruz\u2019s candidacy for president begins, \u201cIt\u2019s a time for truth.\u201d Here at FactCheck.org, we couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\nBut as our archives show, Cruz is no stranger to FactCheck.org\u2019s pages. We have checked more than a dozen dubious claims Cruz has made since entering the Senate in January 2013. And as we will do for all of the politicians who get into the presidential race, we\u2019ll highlight some of the misleading claims that we have examined.\n\nImmigration Claims\n\nCruz voted against and has been a vocal critic of a Senate-passed immigration bill, S. 744, which has stalled in the House. After a series of border security measures are met, the bill would have allowed a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally since at least Dec. 31, 2011. The earned path to citizenship included paying fines and back taxes, proving gainful employment, completing background checks, learning English and civics, and going to the back of the line of prospective immigrants. Cruz has called any path to citizenship \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\nCruz claimed in November that the 2014 midterm elections were \u201ca referendum on amnesty\u201d and voters had sent a clear message opposing it. But Cruz was wrong. Election voters, by a margin of 57 percent to 39 percent, said those living in the U.S. illegally but working should be offered a chance to gain legal status, according to exit polling.\n\nCruz has regularly drawn applause in recent speeches for his suggestion to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and put \u201cevery one of those 110,000 [IRS] agents \u2026 on our southern border.\u201d But, as we have written, the IRS has nowhere near 110,000 employees, let alone that many agents. The number of IRS employees has been on the decline, and currently stands at about 82,000. Less than a quarter of them are revenue agents, special agents or revenue officers.\n\nOn July 21, 2013, Cruz warned that if the Senate immigration bill became law, there will be \u201c20 or 30 million\u201d people living in the U.S. illegally \u201cin another 10, 20 years.\u201d That\u2019s his opinion, but we wrote that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says the bill, if enacted, will reduce future illegal immigration in 10 years by 33 percent to 50 percent compared with current law.\n\nHealth Care/Affordable Care Act\n\nCruz has been a staunch opponent of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, regularly calling for its full repeal, as he did in his announcement speech. But Cruz\u2019s criticisms of the health care law have not always been on the mark.\n\nIn a press conference on Oct. 16, 2013, Cruz claimed that \u201cfamilies of special needs children will face a new penalty for using savings\u201d to pay for medical expenses. He was referring to a $2,500 cap on pre-tax contributions to flexible spending accounts. Actually, advocates for special needs children told us that provision hasn\u2019t had much of an impact, and the new law \u201cgreatly benefits people with disabilities.\u201d\n\nIn September 2013, Cruz distorted the impact of the Affordable Care Act on premiums. He claimed that the Ohio Department of Insurance announced an 88 percent average increase for the individual market. It didn\u2019t. The department estimated a 41 percent increase on average in a press release that called for the law\u2019s repeal.\n\nIn a TV ad, Cruz misconstrued the words of the health care law\u2019s lead author. Claiming \u201cthere\u2019s bipartisan agreement that Obamacare isn\u2019t working,\u201d Cruz said Max Baucus, a Democratic senator at the time, called the law \u201ca huge train wreck.\u201d But Baucus didn\u2019t say \u201cObamacare isn\u2019t working,\u201d and he didn\u2019t call it \u201ca huge train wreck.\u201d He was critical of the education and outreach efforts of the administration during implementation of the law, not the law itself.\n\nWe also dealt with a flurry of misleading claims Cruz made about the Affordable Care Act during his 21-hour talk-a-thon on the Senate floor \u2014 which started Sept. 24, 2013, and ended the following day. We tackled those claims in two separate stories. Among the misleading claims:\n\nCruz misrepresented union opposition to the health care law. Cruz claimed unions, including the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, want to \u201crepeal\u201d the health care law \u201cbecause it is a nightmare.\u201d Three unions used the word \u201cnightmare\u201d in a letter to Democratic leaders in Congress. But they asked that the law be fixed, not repealed.\n\nCruz falsely claimed that the spouses of 15,000 UPS employees will be \u201cleft without health insurance\u201d and forced into \u201can exchange with no employer subsidy.\u201d UPS announced it was dropping coverage for spouses, but only if they can get insurance with their own employer.\n\nCruz repeated the false claim that members of Congress are exempt from the health care law. As we have written numerous times, the law requires congressional members and their staffs to get insurance through the newly created exchanges, so they are not exempt. In fact, the law prevents them from getting insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, like other federal employees. However, the federal government will continue to make contributions toward the premiums of lawmakers and their staffs \u2014 just as most large employers do for their employees.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nIn a recent critique of NASA spending on earth and atmospheric sciences, Cruz claimed there has been a \u201cdisproportionate increase\u201d since 2009 in funding of earth sciences. There has been an increase, but spending on earth sciences is lower now as a percentage of NASA\u2019s budget than it was in fiscal 2000. And the increase reflects an effort to restore funding that had been cut. Cruz also suggested that NASA\u2019s \u201ccore mission\u201d does not include earth sciences. In fact, studying the Earth and atmosphere has been central to NASA\u2019s mission since its creation in 1958.\n\nIn a video response to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address in January, Cruz claimed that \u201cnot a word was said about radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d Obama didn\u2019t use the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d but he vowed to combat \u201cviolent extremism\u201d and asked for congressional authority to use force against the Islamic State. Cruz also said Obama \u201ccould not bring himself even to bring\u201d up the president\u2019s executive action on immigration. But he did. Obama said he would veto legislation that attempts to undo it.\n\nCruz condemned Obama\u2019s announcement that he would normalize relations with Cuba, calling the communist country \u201ca leading state sponsor of terrorism.\u201d That\u2019s a stretch, to say the least. While Cuba \u2013 along with Iran, Syria and Sudan \u2014 is listed by the State Department as one of four \u201cState Sponsors of Terrorism,\u201d the department\u2019s annual Country Report on Terrorism, published in April, provided little evidence of Cuba sponsoring terrorism, especially compared with the extensive portfolio of the others on that list.\n\nOne last thing for the record: While we noted that Cruz is the first major candidate to officially enter the 2016 presidential race, he is by no means the first. According to the Federal Elections Commission, 194 candidates, including 55 Republicans, beat Cruz to the punch.\n\nUpdated, March 27: Please see \u201cFactChecking Ted Cruz, Part II\u201d for more about Cruz\u2019s announcement speech.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley, Lori Robertson and Eugene Kiely\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d2e\"", "article_summary": "Updated, March 27: Please see \u201cFactChecking Ted Cruz, Part II\u201d for more about Cruz\u2019s announcement speech.\nCruz repeated the false claim that members of Congress are exempt from the health care law.\nTexas Sen.
