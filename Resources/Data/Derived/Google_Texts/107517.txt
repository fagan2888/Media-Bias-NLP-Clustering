NAPLES (AP) — Some former NFL stars are lending their muscle to a major Habitat For Humanity project in Naples.

The Naples Daily News reports the men are helping to build a 55-unit housing complex in North Naples.

Winston Justice, a nine-year NFL veteran, was one of the NFL stars who helped out at the construction site on Saturday. Justice and his one-time NFL teammates Chris Maragos, Adewale Ogunleye and Chester Pitts took part in the Habitat for Humanity of Collier County Super Build project.

The $13 million project is part of the new Legacy Lakes development that will be located just south of Immokalee Road.

Justice previously helped rebuild homes in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake that devastated that country.
