That's what a Florida congressman called the state of Texas during a hearing-turned-verbal showdown earlier this week.It was supposed to be a normal hearing ahead of a House GOP vote to repeal, defund or change Obamacare.But then Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-Florida) changed all that.\"I don't know about in your state, which I think is a crazy state to begin with,\" said Hastings. \"And I mean that just as I said it.\"\"That's a very defamatory statement about my state, and I will not stand here and listen to it,\" said Rep. Michael Burgess (R-Texas)\"Well fine,\" Rep. Hastings said. \"Then you don't have to listen.\"Hastings is taking on the entire state of Texas for not joining in Obamacare exchanges.\"You can leave if you choose,\" said Hastings. \"I've told you what I think about Texas. I wouldn't live there for all the tea in China, and that's how I feel.\"\"There is no reason at all to impugn the people, the governor of the state or this country and I will await the gentleman's apology,\" Burgess said.To which Hastings, answered, \"You will wait until hell freezes over for me to say anything in an apology. I would apologize to you if I was directing my comments to you. I was commenting about the state you happen to live in and I will not apologize.\"Other Texas Republicans quickly got wind of Burgess' statements.\"I stand today for why Texas is a great state,\" said Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas). \"Evidently we've got to defend our honor.\"But what Texans wants from Congressman Hastings, who was once impeached as a federal judge and removed from office, is an apology.What do you think? Should Hastings apologize? You can contact him and let him know through his office's website", "article_metadata": {"description": "&#39;Crazy.&#39;  That&#39;s what a Florida congressman called the state of Texas during a hearing-turned-verbal showdown.", "og": {"site_name": "ABC13 Houston", "description": "'Crazy.'
