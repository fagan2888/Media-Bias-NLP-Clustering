The state-of-the-art mobile health clinic will be able to provide extensive medical and dental services to area youth whose parents may not be able to take them to the doctor, for an array of reasons.\n\nAccording to Roland Gardner, CEO of BJH Comprehensive Health Services, Inc., the company chose to focus on Hampton County because records show that children in Hampton County schools are the most underserved children, with regards to medical care, in the entire state.\n\nTwo years ago in Hampton County, only one-third of the children eligible to receive dental and medical services under Medicaid did so. \u201cThere were 9,000 children eligible for medical services under Medicaid, but only 3,000 children received care,\u201d Gardner said. This is a number which he cannot accept.\n\nAccording to the medical professionals on board the clinic, dental hygienist Fallon Gordon and nurse practitioner Andrietta Wright Barnett, it is vital for parents to have their children screened by both a dental and medical professional at a young age.\n\n\u201cIt is very important for children to be seen by a dentist as soon as they start getting teethe,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cPreventative care will keep you from getting that tooth pain or having to receive emergency care. You don\u2019t want that to happen and if you go to the dentist every six months, you can catch cavities early.\u201d\n\nBarnett stated that on top of providing dental and medical care, the mobile health unit also began, for the first time, offering sports physicals to students this year. \u201cI had more kids and parents show up this year thanking me for offering the service because they don\u2019t have a doctor to go to and they usually use the emergency room for their primary care. Now they have a medical home being formed right here and when I leave here in when school is out I\u2019m in the center so if your child becomes sick in the summer you can come see me there,\u201d she said.\n\nThe clinic is a great way for working parents, or those who do not have medical insurance, to receive medical care for their children. Both Medicare and Medicaid are accepted at the walk-up clinic, with cash being accepted for visits, as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Estill so it feels good to me to come back home and help the kids in the community,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cThere are a lot of kids who have not been to the dentist or that have a dental home. Sometimes you can see the smile on their faces when their teeth feel so much better after they get their teeth cleaned,\u201d she said.\n\nParents who would like their child to be examined should have their children or themselves speak with the schools nurse, who will have paper work for the parent to fill out. This will allow the child to be seen subsequently throughout the year, without the need for additional paper work to be completed.\n\nAccording the Ethel Denmark, Rural Health Outreach Coordinator for Comp. Health for Hampton County, states that there are unique aspects of providing specific health care services in Hampton County.\n\n\u201cOne of the challenges we face is that some local providers felt that we are trying to take patients away from them. This is not the case, we are not trying to take their patients. We are only providing care to children that do not have a permanent primary care physician,\u201d said Denmark.\n\nAccording to Gardner, funding for the unit was provided by President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. BJH Comprehensive Health Services, Inc. has been operating in Hampton County since 1978. They are one of over 1,000 medical care providers in the nation that are federally funded and provide much needed services to rural areas, often lacking in medical service availability.\n\nThe mobile health clinic will make several stops at local elementary schools throughout the school year. The clinic will be at Hampton Elementary Oct. 5-8 and Nov. 23-24, Fennell Elementary on Oct. 19-22 and Feb. 8-10, Estill Elementary Nov. 2-4 and Jan. 5-6, Estill Middle/High on Oct. 26-29 and Dec. 14-17 and at Varnville Elementary on Oct. 12-15 and Nov. 30-Dec. 2. The rolling clinic will be making several stops at each school throughout the year, including more stops than listed above.
