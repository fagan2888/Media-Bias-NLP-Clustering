The latest Kaiser Family Foundation poll from November shows that close to half of American adults take a dim view of the law.\n\n\n\nBut not Moyer.\n\n\n\nThe 32-year-old Moyer, who moved to New Jersey this summer from Texas, said, prior to Obamacare, he had a skimpy plan with a $12,000 deductible and gaps in coverage.\n\n\n\nIt was almost like not having insurance,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nThrough Obamacare, however, Moyer said he was able to purchase a mid-level plan offered by Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield that costs $300 a month, after tax credits, and has an affordable deductible and co-payment costs.\n\n\n\nAs a flat-out fan of the law, Moyer said he managed to lock in a policy in the first few days of the first open enrollment period last year, defying odds that defeated most Americans who tried to enroll during the system\u2019s early malfunctions. Once he moved to New Jersey, he said, he was able to apply for an exemption that allowed him to buy a plan here.\n\n\n\nNow, the Horizon coverage gives him and his wife peace of mind.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll the complaints I\u2019ve heard don\u2019t outweigh the benefits that I\u2019ve gotten,\u201d said Moyer, the director of humanities at a school in Closter. \u201cIt is impossible to put a price on knowing that my wife and I can afford our health care.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d he added, \u201cthe actual price is affordable.\u201d\n\n\n\nBurwell acknowledged that affordability is still a high hurdle for many, however. Affordability, whether in the cost of the premium, the deductible, co-payments or co-insurance \u201cis one of the fundamental issues\u201d keeping people from getting health insurance, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to work on putting downward pressure on those costs,\u201d Burwell said.\n\n\n\nThe act has contributed to the slowing of medical inflation, particularly Medicare, she said. The health care program for the elderly spent $116 billion less than expected between 2009-2012, a Medicare Trustees report shows.\n\n\n\nDuring her brief stop in Newark, Burwell met with Mayor Ras J. Baraka and city community leaders to hear concerns about the law and ways to improve it. She said earlier meetings around the country helped federal officials understand the need to tweak the application process, such as by allowing people to apply with hyphenated names, a glitch that stopped many applications during the first open enrollment.\n\n\n\nBurwell stressed that if individuals want coverage to begin on Jan. 1, they need to have applications completed by Dec. 15. The current open enrollment period goes through Feb. 15, 2015.\n\n\n\nUnlike this time last year, the Spanish language version of healthcare.gov, the enrollment web site, is up and running. The site can be accessed at https://www.cuidadodesalud.gov.\n\n\n\nIn addition, telephone assistance is available at 1-800-318-2596. In-person assistance is available throughout the state. People can also visit healthcare.gov for a list or go to Newark City Hall, where two floors below where Burwell spoke, a number of consumers waited in line to enroll with the help of certified counselors.\n\n\n\nThose who do not purchase coverage and do not receive an exemption will be hit with a penalty when it comes time to file their 2015 taxes in 2016. The penalty is $325 per family member or 2 percent of adjusted gross income, up to a maximum of $975.\n\n\n\nThe first year of Obamacare did put a big dent in New Jersey\u2019s uninsured rate, which fell 46 percent from September 2013 to June 2014, according to a report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Burwell said government officials want to make inroads among Spanish-speaking communities and is concentrating on Spanish-speaking media and mobile technology, which Latinos favored during the first open enrollment period, Burwell said.\n\nTim Darragh may be reached at tdarragh@njadvancemedia.com.
