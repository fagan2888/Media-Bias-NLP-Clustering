Like all climate alarmists, the president wants Americans to believe there is no uncertainty about climate change. They pretend to know exactly how much human actions contribute to the changing climate. By denying any uncertainty, their goal is to shut off debate. \u201cJust trust us. We know what\u2019s best for you.\u201d\n\nBut the truth is there are more questions about climate change than there are answers. For instance, even the most advanced climate models all failed to predict the lack of warming the Earth has experienced over the last 18 years. But the president and his Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) refuse to let facts get in the way of their determination to impose greater government control over the lives of the American people.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBelow are seven irrefutable facts about climate change that are ignored because they do not fit into the alarmists\u2019 scare tactics. These facts are not disputed.\n\n1. For the past 18 years, weather satellites have not measured a global increase in temperatures although carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has increased over that same period. Weather satellites are the most advanced instruments for measuring global temperatures. The fact that these satellites have not detected a measureable temperature increase despite an increased concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere calls into question the correlation climate change alarmists preach between carbon emissions and temperature.\n\n2. According to the EPA\u2019s own data, U.S. carbon emissions have decreased nine percent since 2005. These carbon reductions have occurred as a result of technological advancements and free market forces, which will continue. This raises the question of whether burdensome regulations are necessary.\n\n3. The natural cycle of global temperatures has resulted in both higher and lower temperatures over the past 1,000 years than exist today. These temperature fluctuations occurred before significant fossil energy use. So temperatures the Earth is experiencing now have been seen before.\n\n4. If implemented, the Obama administration\u2019s Climate Action Plan would reduce global temperatures by only 0.01, or one one-hundredth of a degree Celsius. President Obama\u2019s former deputy secretary for Fossil Energy at the Department of Energy, Charles McConnell, said that the EPA\u2019s carbon rules will have only a minor impact on global climate change. Yet regulations will cost billions of dollars and jeopardize thousands of jobs.\n\n5. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has reported that there is little or no connection between extreme weather and climate change. According to a 2012 report, the IPCC stated that there is \u201chigh agreement\u201d that long-term trends in weather disasters \u201chave not been attributed to \u2026 climate change.\u201d Climate change alarmists point toward hurricanes, tornadoes and other global weather disasters as a proof that man-made carbon emissions are hurting our planet. However, as the IPCC report stated, the opposite is true. There is scientific agreement that weather disasters are not caused by climate change, despite President Obama repeatedly trying to connect the two.\n\n6. Population growth, especially in the developing world, will account for even more global carbon emissions. Carbon emissions from developing countries are projected to increase by over 125 percent by 2040. And world population is expected to surge by over 2 billion people by 2050, an increase of more than 30 percent. Yet few climate scientists acknowledge the potential impact of population growth on carbon emissions.\n\n7. Carbon dioxide accounts for a very small part of the Earth\u2019s overall atmosphere and those levels have fluctuated throughout the Earth\u2019s history. Carbon dioxide currently accounts for only .038 percent of our planet\u2019s atmosphere. And human-made carbon dioxide only makes up about 3 percent of that. Put another way, if all the gases in the atmosphere were represented by the length of a football field, only the last 1/10 of an inch would be carbon emissions caused by humans. It\u2019s hard to believe that such a small amount would supposedly have such huge consequences.\n\nThe EPA and other government agencies too often fail to present all the facts. Their agenda comes first, accuracy comes second. Climate change has many explanations \u2014 and unanswered questions. The American people need good science, not science fiction promoted by alarmists.\n\nSmith has represented Texas\u2019s 21st Congressional District since 1987.
