It’s been a big week in U.S. Supreme Court rulings. Yesterday the court upheld a major portion of the Affordable Care Act, ensuring that ‘Obamacare’ will remain intact. And today (June 26), the ruling came down that gay marriage is now officially legal in all 50 states.

The court ruled 5-4 in favor of making gay marriage legal. “No union is more profound than marriage,” wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in the majority opinion. He was joined by the court’s four more liberal justices.

While gay and lesbian couples can already marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia, this new ruling means the remaining 14 states must now stop enforcing bans on same-sex marriage.

News quickly spread of this historic ruling, lighting a firestorm of enthusiastic responses on social media. Many artists and musicians, too, jumped in to share their excitement.
