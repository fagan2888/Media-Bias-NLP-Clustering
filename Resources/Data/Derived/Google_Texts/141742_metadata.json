She hopes to get enough money in grants and donations to stay here or that a new place will offer their services for free.\n\n\"We're still in the process of trying to find some free rental space. If we could cut our overhead expenses down then we can certainly keep the organization going,\" said Brennan.\n\nWhen businesses like the Greystone Restaurant in Pottsville and McCann School of Business heard about the alliance's financial woes, they responded.\n\n\"The Schuylkill Health Alliance is a very worthwhile entity and a very much needed entity in Schuylkill County,\" said Jerry Labooty from the Greystone Restaurant.\n\nThe Greystone will give some of it's proceeds from its annual Mardi Gras event on February 17 to the alliance.\n\nBut the owner said he know other businesses in Schuylkill County will want to help the non-profit too.\n\n\"We meet that challenge and we help all those in need,\" said Labooty.\n\nThe Schuylkill Alliance for Health Care Access hopes to raise enough money to operate at least through the end of the year.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "40.685646;-76.195499", "description": "POTTSVILLE --\u00a0The Schuylkill Alliance for Health Care Access has been helping people in Schuylkill County with medical bills for more than a decade, but now the non-profit organization needs the community's help.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "WNEP.com", "description": "POTTSVILLE \u2014\u00a0The Schuylkill Alliance for Health Care Access has been helping people in Schuylkill County with medical bills for more than a decade, but now the non-profit organization needs t\u2026", "title": "Non-Profit Needs Financial Help", "url": "http://wnep.com/2015/01/21/non-profit-needs-financial-help/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://localtvwnep.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/sch-health-care.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwnep.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/sch-health-care.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@wnep", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@wnep"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Weather & Sports from WNEP-TV -- Proud to Serve Northeastern and Central Pennsylvania", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=576449977", "fb": {"pages": 54696907755}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wnep.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8f6f6b83745b5040a1eab22f36eb2434?s=16", "application-name": "WNEP.com", "ICBM": "40.685646, -76.195499", "keywords": "news, health care, pottsville, schuylkill county", "google-site-verification": "GEWMe03uX6hX8v43Ve2pFUlxI6LoNbIRq_sevJRIrrA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Newswatch16", "published_time": "2015-01-21T23:00:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-21T23:00:10+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/Newswatch16"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "But the owner said he know other businesses in Schuylkill County will want to help the non-profit too.\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this videoPOTTSVILLE -- The Schuylkill Alliance for Health Care Access has been helping people in Schuylkill County with medical bills for more than a decade, but now the non-profit organization needs the community's help.\nThe Schuylkill Alliance for Health Care Access hopes to raise enough money to operate at least through the end of the year.\n\"The Schuylkill Health Alliance is a very worthwhile entity and a very much needed entity in Schuylkill County,\" said Jerry Labooty from the Greystone Restaurant.\nWhen businesses like the Greystone Restaurant in Pottsville and McCann School of Business heard about the alliance's financial woes, they responded."}
