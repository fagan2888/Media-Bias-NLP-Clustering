He says the aircraft is in much better shape than the public has been led to believe.\n\nFor years, the F-35 has raised eyebrows for its enormous cost overruns, schedule delays and significant technical and design problems. The aircraft\u2014which is supposed to be a flying super computer that operates at a higher level than anything the Pentagon has ever seen\u2014has been plagued with so many issues that have forced critics to question whether the weapons program will ever be worth the money.\n\nRelated: How DOD\u2019s $1.5 Trillion F-35 Broke the Air Force\n\nIn contrast to most of the media attention the F-35 has received, Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan is painting a much brighter picture of the JSF. The Marines\u2019 version of the plane, he says, will be ready to fly in combat by this summer.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday, the general defended his program\u2019s price tag\u2014saying the costs have come down in the past few years since he took over the position in 2012. It was originally estimated to cost a total of $1.1 trillion but that has since dropped to about $850 billion over the 55-year life of the program.\n\nThe cost for each individual aircraft has come down by about $10 million.\n\nAccording to DOD officials, the Marine Corps\u2019 version of the F-35 costs $134 million, compared to $145 million in 2012.\n\nThe Marine\u2019s F-35, which is expected to be ready for combat by July 1, will launch with some deficiencies in its software system that will prevent it from using all of the system\u2019s capabilities. Still, Bogdan said the Marines are moving forward despite the remaining software problems.\n\nRelated: 5 Expensive Weapons Programs No One Wants\n\nThe issues occur in the software program that\u2019s supposed to help pilots communicate and respond to what\u2019s happening on the ground and in the air. The problem is when four F-35\u2019s are flying together, the systems don\u2019t sync properly, so the pilots in each jet might see the same situation differently.\n\n\u201cIt creates an inaccurate picture for the pilots,\u201d Bogdan said.\n\nBogdan claimed the tech issues aren\u2019t severe enough to keep the aircraft off the battlefield. He noted that the Marines are aware of the problems and can still operate the F-35 sufficiently.\n\n\u201cThey understand the limitations and have operational workarounds to ensure they have the capability they need,\u201d Bogdan said. The issues are still being worked on, but they won\u2019t likely be corrected until early fall.\n\nRelated: World\u2019s Most Lethal Drone Just Flew Over Florida\n\nThough the general painted the problem as a small roadblock, the Defense Department is sending the manufacturer Lockheed Martin a stiff penalty for the delays and deficiencies.\n\nDOD officials say Lockheed will have to forfeit at least some of the total $300 million it received in incentive fees to finish the software packages on time.\n\nIf the Marine\u2019s F-35 is ready for combat by July, it will be an enormous victory for the program\u2014which has been hammered with criticism from lawmakers, the media (including this reporter), experts and even some inside the Pentagon\u2014whose views on the F-35 are dramatically different (and more pessimistic) than the general\u2019s assessment.\n\nEarlier this month, the Defense Department\u2019s Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) released a scathing update on the F-35 that revealed a litany of problems with it\u2014from engine issues, to safety issues\u2014as well as the software issues that the general discussed. The report painted a much more serious account of the F-35\u2019s problems than Bogdan acknowledged. The DOT&E report also accused officials of unfairly documenting the F-35\u2019s test results.\n\n\u201cNot all failures are counted in the calculation of mean flight hours between reliability events, but all flight hours are counted, and hence component and aircraft reliability are reported higher than if all of the failures were counted,\u201d the report said.\n\nRelated: 12 Weapons That Changed Everything\n\nThe Project on Government Oversight (POGO) a nonprofit watchdog group, released its own harsh analysis of the report.\n\n\u201cThe problems described in the DOT&E report show that the F-35 has reached a stage where it is now obvious that the never-ending stream of partial fixes, software patches, and ad hoc workarounds are inadequate to deliver combat-worthy, survivable, and readily employable aircraft,\u201d POGO said. \u201cThis year\u2019s DOT&E report also demonstrates that in an effort to maintain the political momentum of the F-35, its program office is not beneath misrepresenting critically important characteristics of the system.\u201d\n\nStill the general blamed the backlash from the report on the media who read and interpreted it without the proper context.\n\nBogdan did, however, acknowledge that the program isn\u2019t perfect and that there is still a laundry list of concerns he has about the aircraft\u2014chief among them--the software, though there are a number of other problems that need to be fixed with the aircraft\u2019s engine, tires and structure. But he doesn\u2019t lose sleep over those, he said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The man in charge of the Pentagon\u2019s $391 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is sick of", "title": "General Defends Embattled $850 Billion F-35 Program", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/25/F-35-General-Defends-Error-Plagued-850-Billion-Program", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/02262013_Deficit_F-35_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/25/F-35-General-Defends-Error-Plagued-850-Billion-Program", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/02262013_Deficit_F-35_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The man in charge of the Pentagon\u2019s $391 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is sick of", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb827\"", "article_summary": "The man in charge of the Pentagon\u2019s $391 billion F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is sick of the intense criticism his embattled program has received over the past few years.\nFor years, the F-35 has raised eyebrows for its enormous cost overruns, schedule delays and significant technical and design problems.\nIt was originally estimated to cost a total of $1.1 trillion but that has since dropped to about $850 billion over the 55-year life of the program.\nStill, Bogdan said the Marines are moving forward despite the remaining software problems.\nAccording to DOD officials, the Marine Corps\u2019 version of the F-35 costs $134 million, compared to $145 million in 2012."}
