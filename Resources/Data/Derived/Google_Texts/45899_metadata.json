They celebrated the holidays as best they could and then put down floors, while boats continued to move furniture and other belongings from Afognak, Kewan said.\n\n\u201cBut early in December is when the first families made that initial move,\u201d Kewan said.\n\nPort Lions has held celebrations earlier this year, including one on the Fourth of July with a picture display from throughout the town\u2019s history, in addition to the parade, picnic and other holiday festivities and a social on March 27, 50 years to the day after the earthquake.\n\nThe City of Port Lions, Native Village of Port Lions, Afognak Native Corp. and Native Village of Afognak, along with the Port Lions School, sponsored the final event with a potluck meal, historical display, band and dance performances.\n\nDancers by the Sea, the Port Lions Alutiiq dance group, performed an original song and dance about the move from Afognak to Port Lions.\n\nDuring dinner, the microphone was open for people to share memories of the 1964 earthquake and tsunami that precipitated the move and the move itself.\n\nPeggy Nelson recalled looking forward to the move because she was scared after the earthquake.\n\n\u201cIt was a scary time back then,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what we were going to do because what do you do when the earth is shaking and the ground is sinking and the trees are moving back and forth and you\u2019re stepping over waves in the ground?\u201d\n\nPort Lions was originally founded in 1964 by people who moved from the village of Afognak, on the southern tip of Afognak Island, after it was destroyed.\n\nThe tsunami following the 1964 earthquake wiped out Afognak, destroying about 70 percent of the buildings, including homes and the community hall, according to \u201c9.2, Kodiak and the World\u2019s Second-Largest Earthquake,\u201d a book by the Daily Mirror and the Baranov Museum.\n\nBridges were also destroyed and the store had been pushed inland. Afognak itself was 5.5 feet lower than it had been the day before the earthquake due to the action and movement of tectonic plates.\n\nAt high tide, one of the main roads was covered in water, wells were contaminated by seawater, and areas filled with water by the waves did not drain.\n\nWhile the residents originally wanted to rebuild in place, they ultimately decided to rebuild elsewhere, choosing Settler Cove in Kizhuyak Bay.\n\n\u201cI had mixed emotions about leaving our beautiful house over there that we built and lived in for five years before the tidal wave,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nThe Lions International chose to help rebuild the village, and Port Lions was named after the service organization.\n\nConstruction started in May, according to \u201c9.2,\u201d and the former Afognak residents moved in that winter.\n\n\u201cWe survived all that, and I\u2019m so thankful for Port Lions and every one of you here,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI love Port Lions.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror, http://www.kodiakdailymirror.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Port Lions celebrated 50 years this weekend, the final celebration in a string during the past year, remembering its history since the village moved from its original Afognak location.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Port Lions celebrated 50 years this weekend, the final celebration in a string during the past year, remembering its history since the village moved from its original Afognak location.", "title": "Port Lions has final 50th anniversary celebration", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/14/port-lions-has-final-50th-anniversary-celebration/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/14/498548b674d9da30670f6a70670018cd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/14/498548b674d9da30670f6a70670018cd.jpg", "description": "Port Lions celebrated 50 years this weekend, the final celebration in a string during the past year, remembering its history since the village moved from its original Afognak location.", "card": "summary", "title": "Port Lions has final 50th anniversary celebration"}, "Author": "JULIE HERRMANN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The City of Port Lions, Native Village of Port Lions, Afognak Native Corp. and Native Village of Afognak, along with the Port Lions School, sponsored the final event with a potluck meal, historical display, band and dance performances.\nDancers by the Sea, the Port Lions Alutiiq dance group, performed an original song and dance about the move from Afognak to Port Lions.\nPORT LIONS, Alaska (AP) - Port Lions celebrated 50 years this weekend, the final celebration in a string during the past year, remembering its history since the village moved from its original Afognak location.\nThe Lions International chose to help rebuild the village, and Port Lions was named after the service organization.\n\u201cSome of the people on the (event organizing) committee actually moved from Afognak to Port Lions, and, I\u2019m told, very early in December, the first residents made the move from Afognak to Port Lions,\u201d Kewan said."}
