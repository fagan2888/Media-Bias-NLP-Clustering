We were putting the pressures, but we weren\u2019t getting the goals.\u201d\n\nWith the win, Colorado Academy extends its unbeaten streak to 52 games, including 41 straight wins, a record of 50-0-2 that started at the beginning of the 2012 season.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot,\u201d Murphy said about ending her preps career with another title. \u201cI\u2019ve been on this team since my freshman year and it\u2019s been great as a senior to finish it for the team.\u201d\n\nJoe Nguyen: jnguyen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joenguyen\n\nMVP\n\nColorado Academy forward Julia Murphy capped off her high school career by scoring the game-winning goal and assisting on another for the Mustangs.\n\nColorado Academy 2, Palmer Ridge 0\n\nGoals \u2014 CA: Hall, Murphy; PR: None; Assists\u2014 CA: Murphy, Richards.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Academy earns 3-peat at state, extends unbeaten streak", "title": "Colorado Academy earns 3-peat at state, extends unbeaten streak", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/25/colorado-academy-earns-3-peat-at-state-extends-unbeaten-streak/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141025_072248_colorado-academy-2.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141025_072248_colorado-academy-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-25T20:00:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T14:43:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Prep field hockey"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOur seniors have been the top leaders you can ask for the whole season,\u201d Colorado Academy coach Veronica Scott said.\nColorado Academy 2, Palmer Ridge 0Goals \u2014 CA: Hall, Murphy; PR: None; Assists\u2014 CA: Murphy, Richards.\nWe were putting the pressures, but we weren\u2019t getting the goals.\u201dWith the win, Colorado Academy extends its unbeaten streak to 52 games, including 41 straight wins, a record of 50-0-2 that started at the beginning of the 2012 season.\n3 Palmer Ridge Saturday at All-City Stadium for their third consecutive state field hockey title.\n\u201cWe checked them out, they don\u2019t have too many weaknesses, but we tried to take advantage of the ones we find,\u201d Palmer Ridge coach Paul Lewis said."}
