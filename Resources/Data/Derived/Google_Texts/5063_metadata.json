Yellen spent Tuesday on a congressional hot seat, fending off criticism from the left and right and a spate of ideas that would encroach on the central bank\u2019s independence.\n\nThe main topic during her appearance before the Senate Banking Committee was interest rates, and how soon the Federal Open Market Committee might act to raise them to prevent a clearly recovering economy from overheating.\n\nRelated: Bonds, stocks rally, after Yellen emphasizes flexibility\n\n\u201cThere has been important progress,\u201d Yellen told the senators, signaling that there may not be any action on interest rates until later this spring at the earliest. \u201cHowever, despite this improvement, too many Americans remain unemployed or underemployed, wage growth is still sluggish and inflation remains well below our longer-run objective.\u201d\n\nWhile the discussion of interest rates was largely technical and bland, sparks flew when the subject turned to renewed efforts on Capitol Hill to curtail or penetrate the veil of the Fed\u2019s operations.\n\nRepublican Committee Chair Richard Shelby of Alabama greeted Yellen with at least five ideas for overhauling the Fed \u2013 from new ways of monitoring inflation and explicit rules for guiding monetary policy to rotating the vice chairmanship of the Fed, which now permanently belongs to whomever is serving as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and consolidating the Fed\u2019s 12 regional districts into five, according to The Hill.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Reintroduces \u2018Audit the Fed\u2019 Bill\n\nIn each case, Yellen said thanks, but no thanks. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would make a lot of sense,\u201d she said of the inflation monitoring idea, in light of how inflation remains well below longer-term objectives.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a champion of the left, pressed Yellen on whether members of her staff \u2014 particularly General Counsel Scott Alvarez \u2014 are genuinely committed to implementing tough rules for the financial sector.\n\nWarren cited some comments from Alvarez that were critical of some provisions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law and pressed Yellen to rein in her staff.\n\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s general counsel or anyone at the Fed\u2019s staff should not be picking and choosing which rules to enforce based on their personal views,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI urge you to carefully review this issue and to assess whether the leadership of the Fed\u2019s staff is on the same page as the Federal Reserve Board.\u201d\n\nRelated: The \u2018Draft Elizabeth Warren\u2019 Effort Gets $1M Boost\n\nYellen replied that the board wasn\u2019t seeking changes to Dodd-Frank. And in a statement after the hearing, Yellen defended the Fed\u2019s top lawyer, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cMy colleagues and I depend, with confidence, on Scott Alvarez\u2019s expert advice and counsel,\u201d Yellen said. \u201cHe is a dedicated public servant who is committed to thoughtful public policy.\u201d\n\nIn the face of these and other broadsides, the diminutive but steely Yellen reminded lawmakers of the importance of minimizing political interference in the Fed\u2019s monetary policy making.\n\n\u201cCentral bank independence in conducting monetary policy is considered a best practice for central banks around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cAcademic studies, I think, establish beyond the shadow of a doubt that independent central banks perform better.\u201d\n\nFor sure, the Fed and Congress have had their differences over the years.\n\nRelated: US Senate to hold Fed reform hearing on March 3-aide\n\nYellen\u2019s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, faced similar suspicion and distrust from lawmakers five years ago in the wake of trillion-dollar efforts to bail out the crisis-ridden financial system. Bernanke had to mount an aggressive campaign to stave off congressional intrusion during debates over the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul legislation.\n\nThe Fed ultimately emerged from that era with broad regulatory powers and implemented a massive stimulus after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, expanding its balance sheet to $4.5 trillion, which Yellen has inherited.\n\nAs Bloomberg reported this week, lawmakers from both parties are now demanding greater \u201ctransparency and accountability\u201d from an institution that has the power to impose capital requirements for banks and influence how much Americans pay for a mortgage or an auto loan.\n\n\u201cUltimately, accountability trumps independence when lawmakers are particularly eager to blame the Fed for a crisis,\u201d Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, wrote yesterday in an op-ed in The Washington Post. \u201cWith disagreements rising about the timing and pace of rate increases and about the size of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet, Yellen and the Fed will continue to face calls for greater responsiveness to Congress.\u201d\n\nRelated: Exclusive: Local Bankers Emerge as Fed Ally in Fight Against Audit Bill\n\nArguably the biggest challenge to the Fed\u2019s structure is the growing movement to \u201caudit\u201d the Fed through legislation sponsored by Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a potential 2016 presidential candidate, that would subject the central bank's monetary policy decisions to external review. Paul\u2019s father, former Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX) pushed a similar bill while he was still in Congress \u2013 an idea that Bernanke successfully fought off.\n\nYellen argued the audit measure \u2013 recently reintroduced by Paul -- would allow politicians to second-guess the Fed\u2019s decisions, which, in turn, would weaken the central bank. And the ultimate victim of that process, she said, would be the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Fed chairwoman tried to reinforce her point by holding up a thick report before lawmakers as a way to highlight that most of the Fed's operations are already subject to outside audit.\n\n\u201cI want to be completely clear,\u201d Yellen said yesterday. \u201cI strongly oppose Audit the Fed.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a sign of growing tensions between the Federal Reserve and Congress, Fed Chair Jane", "title": "Yellen Defends Fed from Special Interest Assaults on the Left and Right", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/25/Yellen-Defends-Fed-Special-Interest-Assaults-Left-and-Right", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06182014_Janet_Yellen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/25/Yellen-Defends-Fed-Special-Interest-Assaults-Left-and-Right", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06182014_Janet_Yellen.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In a sign of growing tensions between the Federal Reserve and Congress, Fed Chair Jane", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCentral bank independence in conducting monetary policy is considered a best practice for central banks around the world,\u201d she said.\nRelated: Rand Paul Reintroduces \u2018Audit the Fed\u2019 BillIn each case, Yellen said thanks, but no thanks.\n\u201cAcademic studies, I think, establish beyond the shadow of a doubt that independent central banks perform better.\u201dFor sure, the Fed and Congress have had their differences over the years.\nAnd in a statement after the hearing, Yellen defended the Fed\u2019s top lawyer, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nYellen argued the audit measure \u2013 recently reintroduced by Paul -- would allow politicians to second-guess the Fed\u2019s decisions, which, in turn, would weaken the central bank."}
