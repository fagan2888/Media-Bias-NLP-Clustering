So is the hair on your head, your drugstore lotion, and the fact that you live longer, statistically, than the men around you. The \u201cwomen\u2019s tax\u201d still exists and it\u2019s still unbelievably irritating, gratingly unfair, and, in most places, perfectly legal.\n\nThat \u201cwomen\u2019s tax\u201d\u2014the higher prices women pay for all kinds of products and services\u2014was nicely demonstrated today with a video put together by HLN\u2019s Daily Share:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s right: razors are more expensive, as are identical face lotions, haircuts, dry-cleaning on identical shirts, and even long-term care insurance, even though Obamacare technically banned gender-based pricing discrimination in insurance coverage. (Insurance companies say women are charged more because, statistically, they live longer, and because they use health services more. It\u2019s the same logic that allows them to charge smokers more and, according to the New York Times, adds up to a difference of \u201cseveral hundred dollars\u201d per year.)\n\nWe\u2019ve known for a long, long time about gender-based pricing disparities, although California is, so far, the only state that\u2019s actually made it illegal. California\u2019s Department of Consumer affairs banned it in 1996, after a survey of haircuts and laundry services found that women were paying significantly more. As Yahoo points out, New York City has laws against the practice, as does Florida\u2019s Miami-Dade County. The outcry against New York City\u2019s law was fierce: please read this delightfully dated 1998 Times story, where a representative from a dry cleaning trade group justifies the price disparities in shirt-cleaning: \u2018\u2019There are blouses that have beads and blouses that have trimmings and blouses that have lace and all kinds of very exciting and inventive ideas to make Mrs. Consumer or Miss Consumer more beautiful but are difficult to clean and press.\u201d\n\nSponsored\n\nIn 2010, Consumer Reports found the disparities were still true for many common drugstore items, recommending that women ignore \u201cgendered packaging\u201d and reach for the cheaper option. That\u2019s fine for a razor, but it\u2019s a little trickier when it comes to something like insurance, or mortgages and insurance rates. But hey, good thing women earn as much as their male counterparts, right? Right? What?
