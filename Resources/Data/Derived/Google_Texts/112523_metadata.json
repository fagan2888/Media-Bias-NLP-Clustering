His plans were abruptly changed when he discovered that the woman was armed.\n\nChristopher Ray Foster, 37, died at the scene after the unidentified woman shot him at her home near Canton, Texas. She called 911 at around 4:30 a.m. Foster, who had an extensive criminal history, was recently released on a personal recognizance bond from Van Zandt County jail for failure to register as a sex offender, KLTV reported. Police also believed Foster was the prime suspect in an arson which occurred on Monday. According to the Texas Department of Public Safety\u2019s sex offender registry, Foster was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1999 for sexual assault of a child. The female victim was 15.\n\nSo Foster \u2013 who answered to the nickname \u201cOutlaw\u201d \u2013 wound up being DRT. (Dead Right There) The Sheriff was quick to point out that the woman was well within her rights and no charges would be brought against her, but chose what turned out to be a somewhat controversial rationale for defending her actions.\n\n\u201cPresently, as the result of underfunding and inadequate staffing at the Van Zandt County Sheriff\u2019s Office, homeowners need to take appropriate precautions to protect their families,\u201d Sheriff Michael Ray said. \u201cI will continue to support the law abiding citizens of our community when they are forced to take actions to protect their lives, liberty and property.\u201d\n\nThe decision to cite underfunding as a reason that citizens should be prepared to defend themselves resulted in calls and visits from some of the locals expressing concerns over their safety. That set up the inevitable scrum between local politicians.\n\n\u201cI want to assure citizens of Van Zandt County that if you dial 911, the sheriff\u2019s department will respond, and there will be a deputy en route,\u201d County Judge Don Kirkpatrick said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to worry that they\u2019re not protected in Van Zandt County.\u201d The problem is a budget fight, Kirkpatrick said. \u201cIt saddens me that elected officials in Van Zandt County would want to start pointing fingers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do support our law enforcement, and we\u2019re very proud of the job they do.\u201d\n\nThe judge seems to be making a solid case. The public budget records indicate that this year\u2019s budget for the Sheriff\u2019s department included a $50K increase over the previous year, the hiring of four new sheriffs and one jailer along with the purchase of 13 new vehicles. Additionally, the staff got a raise. But without knowing exactly how big their territory is and how many calls they answer on average, those numbers don\u2019t really tell us if the funding is everything they need. Still, it would be a shame if the underlying explanation proved to be a distraction from the fact that the sheriff was endorsing the right of homeowners to defend themselves. I\u2019m sure the judge is correct in saying that when citizens call 911 there will be an officer on the way to assist them. But it\u2019s a big county, and how long it may take for that help to arrive will depend on where you are and where the nearest sheriff is when the call comes in. In this woman\u2019s case, the space of a few minutes one way or the other may have been the difference between safety and assault or worse.\n\nThe bottom line is, once the dust settles over the budget debate it looks like the homeowner is not only safe, but will not be dragged into court because she defended herself. God bless Texas.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Room temperature", "title": "Texas woman terminates activities of convicted sex offender", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/02/14/texas-woman-terminates-activities-of-convicted-sex-offender/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-14T13:31:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-15T10:58:42+00:00"}, "keywords": "gun rights, Second Amendment, sex offender, Texas,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2cb6\"", "article_summary": "Texas woman terminates activities of convicted sex offenderposted at 8:31 am on February 14, 2015 by Jazz ShawA woman in Van Zandt County, Texas had an alarming and unexpected visitor in the middle of the night on Tuesday.\n\u201cIt saddens me that elected officials in Van Zandt County would want to start pointing fingers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need to worry that they\u2019re not protected in Van Zandt County.\u201d The problem is a budget fight, Kirkpatrick said.\nChristopher Ray Foster, 37, died at the scene after the unidentified woman shot him at her home near Canton, Texas.\nShe called 911 at around 4:30 a.m. Foster, who had an extensive criminal history, was recently released on a personal recognizance bond from Van Zandt County jail for failure to register as a sex offender, KLTV reported."}
