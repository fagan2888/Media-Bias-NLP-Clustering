California accounts for a lion\u2019s share of the backlog with 900,000 applications pending as of early June. The next-biggest pileup is in Illinois, with 283,000 cases, while New York has no backlog at all. All three states have implemented the health law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid.\n\nYet even some big states that chose not to expand the federal-state health program for the poor are seeing backlogs, including North Carolina, with 170,000 applications pending, Georgia, with 100,000, and South Carolina, with 62,000. Florida and Texas, which also did not expand the program, each report fewer than 11,000 in queues. Federal regulations typically require states to process applications within 45 days, and many state applications are still within that period.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a serious problem that people are waiting a long time, and the process of getting covered is more cumbersome than it should be,\u201d said Stan Dorn, senior fellow with the nonpartisan Urban Institute.\n\nFederal and state officials say the delays should not hamper people\u2019s ability to get health care because Medicaid coverage can be extended retroactively for three months and people can seek emergency care at hospitals.\n\nBut Dorn said that some providers may refuse to see patients until they have confirmation they have insurance coverage. And without insurance, patients may not have cash to pay doctors who demand it upfront.\n\n\u201cYou will have impaired access to care . . . because often the provider will not see you if you do not have a Medicaid card,\u201d Dorn said.\n\nThe waits also contradict the Obama administration\u2019s promise that the online insurance marketplaces would bring a \u201cno wrong door\u201d approach to signing up for health care, regardless of a person\u2019s income.\n\nThe reasons for the problems include technological glitches that prevented the federal insurance marketplace from transferring data on applicants to state Medicaid agencies and many states\u2019 inability to handle an enrollment surge because of inadequate staffing, their own computer problems and other issues.\n\nOfficials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) say they have made progress and can now quickly transfer data on applicants to all but three states \u2014 Alaska, Kansas and Maine \u2014 one reason that enrollment in the program surged by 1.1 million people in April.\n\nThe agency \u201cis actively transferring accounts to all states that are ready to receive them,\u201d spokesman Aaron Albright said. \u201cEvery state not receiving transfers can be enrolling people through alternative options,\u201d such as getting a spreadsheet of names and addresses of people who have applied to the federal marketplace, he said.\n\nOne reason that states such as New York and Washington have done better than others is that they modernized their Medicaid eligibility systems earlier than others, Dorn said. Other states such as Kentucky made sure their state insurance exchange could transmit data smoothly to their Medicaid program.\n\nMedicaid is the workhorse of the nation\u2019s health system, providing coverage to about one in five Americans. Twenty-six states have expanded eligibility under the health law to everyone with incomes under 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $16,100 for an individual. But even states that did not expand the program have seen increased demand for coverage, as people who were previously eligible but not enrolled tried to sign up as a result of publicity around the new exchanges and requirements that most Americans have coverage.\n\nUnlike applying for private insurance through the online marketplaces, which can be done only during a few months of the year, people can apply for Medicaid anytime.\n\nWhile states are working through their backlogs, the next big test will come Nov. 15, when open enrollment for private plans resumes and spurs a surge in people applying for Medicaid. The enrollment system should be running smoother by then, most experts say.\n\nFor states that used the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, a major complication was the technical issues that kept the federal site from sending complete applicant data to the states.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Medicaid agency said it began to get applications from the federal marketplace only in May.\n\nTrish Riley, a former Maine health official and a member of a commission that advises Congress on Medicaid, said the problems underscore the continued differences in state capabilities and cultures. Ramping up for a surge in Medicaid enrollment can be a big change for states that for decades focused on reducing fraud and abuse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to change that culture, said Riley, an adjunct professor of health policy at the University of Southern Maine.\n\nThe process has been further complicated by state eligibility reviews that have found many people ineligible who applied through the federal marketplace. States were always expected to make final eligibility decisions, but that has taken longer in some places than anticipated.\n\nMatt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, is hopeful the worst is over. He said the computerized handoffs from the federal exchange are occurring more quickly and states are getting more data to approve or deny applicants.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s been solved,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s definitely getting a lot better.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, medicaid, medicaid expansion", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "While an unprecedented 6\u00a0million people have gained Medicaid coverage since September, mostly as a result of the Affordable Care Act, more than 1.7\u00a0million more are still waiting for their application...", "title": "Long waits persist for those applying for Medicaid coverage in many states", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/long-waits-persist-for-those-applying-for-medicaid-coverage-in-many-states/2014/06/07/06b5ed6a-edaf-11e3-9b2d-114aded544be_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "While an unprecedented 6\u00a0million people have gained Medicaid coverage since September, mostly as a result of the Affordable Care Act, more than 1.7\u00a0million more are still waiting for their application...", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/long-waits-persist-for-those-applying-for-medicaid-coverage-in-many-states/2014/06/07/06b5ed6a-edaf-11e3-9b2d-114aded544be_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health, medicaid, medicaid expansion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "06b5ed6a-edaf-11e3-9b2d-114aded544be"}, "article_summary": "Other states such as Kentucky made sure their state insurance exchange could transmit data smoothly to their Medicaid program.\nFederal regulations typically require states to process applications within 45 days, and many state applications are still within that period.\nRamping up for a surge in Medicaid enrollment can be a big change for states that for decades focused on reducing fraud and abuse.\nFor states that used the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, a major complication was the technical issues that kept the federal site from sending complete applicant data to the states.\nGeorgia\u2019s Medicaid agency said it began to get applications from the federal marketplace only in May."}
