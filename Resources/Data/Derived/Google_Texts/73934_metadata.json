He dismissed the suggestion that India should make cuts to its own carbon emissions as its economy is about to take off.\n\nMoreover, while India ranks third in overall carbon emissions, its carbon footprint per capita is much smaller than that of China and the United States \u2013 a mere 1.7 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per person compared to 6.2 metric tons for China and 17.6 metric tons for the U.S., according to the World Bank.\n\n\u201cWhat cuts?\u201d Javadekar said, The Times reported. \u201cThat\u2019s for more developed countries.\u201d\n\nWithout India on board, however, any international effort to combat global warming would be meaningless. Without the involvement of third-world giants like India, future targets for emissions reductions would be riddled with holes.\n\nRelated: Obama Fights Global Warming, One Hot Spot at a Time\n\nWith a new hard-charging prime minister vowing to elevate his country\u2019s economy from third world to first-world status in the coming years, India stands at an important environmental crossroads: Its leaders must choose between continued reliance on coal-fired power plants and factories that will only add to the global climate woes or gradually turn to cleaner energy alternatives.\n\nFortunately, Javadekar\u2019s statements last week, a day after a United Nations climate summit in New York attended by Obama, proved to be more bombast than substance.\n\nOn Tuesday, Obama and visiting India Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an important agreement in Washington that would do two things: First, greatly increase India\u2019s use of renewable fuels \u2013 including solar power. Second, gradually reduce global emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, which are industrial chemicals that emit heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\n\nAs part of the deal, the U.S. Export-Import Bank (under attack by Republicans in Congress) and the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency will provide $1 billion of financing for India to purchase U.S-made solar panels and other clean energy technology.\n\n\u201cRecognizing the critical importance of increasing energy access, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and improving resilience in the face of climate change, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi agreed to a new and enhanced strategic partnership on energy security, clean energy, and climate change,\u201d according to a summary from the White House.\n\nThe agreement capped Modi\u2019s five-day visit to New York and Washington \u2013 his first high profile international trip since taking office in May as India\u2019s 15th prime minister.\n\nObama and Modi declared they were committed to working toward a successful outcome in Paris in 2015 of the conference of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including the creation of a new global agreement on climate change. Without Modi\u2019s involvement, the conference would be greatly constricted in what it could accomplish.\n\nRelated: An Alliance with India Could Help Obama Keep China in Line\n\nThe Washington Post described the agreement as \u201ca modest step\u201d toward reducing hydro fluorocarbons but a \u201cpotentially significant victory for Obama\u2019s climate strategy.\u201d\n\nObama has been forced to go it alone without congressional support in devising ways to reduce U.S. carbon emissions. He has tried repeatedly to enlist China and India to join international negotiations to find ways to scale back HFCs \u2013 which The Post says are \u201cup to 10,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of trapping the sun\u2019s heat in the atmosphere.\u201d\n\nAlthough Tuesday\u2019s agreement received little fanfare, some environmental experts believe it may prove a vital turning point in the long international efforts to slow the rate of growth of greenhouse gas emissions that scientists have linked to adverse climate change.\n\nRelated: Record Levels of Greenhouse Gases Threaten Global Economy\n\nJustin Guay, associate director of the Sierra Club\u2019s international program, said in an interview that the announcement was important both for its \u201cpolitical symbolism\u201d in putting climate change at the forefront and for the \u201cquite significant investments\u201d in clean energy technology.\n\n\u201cThis is a reflection of demand coming from India,\u201d Guay said. \u201cThey see solar as a critical part of their energy future to help them diversify away from all of the problems they\u2019ve had in developing coal plants.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt also shows there\u2019s a significant opportunity for the United States to export this technology and to utilize the financing tools we have available to us to basically secure win-win: Our companies get to sell solar and countries like India get to achieve electrification goals.\u201d\n\nAnjali Jaiswal, a global warming expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the agreement \u201ca significant outcome and a significant step forward on making progress on climate change.\u201d\n\nShe noted that until yesterday, Modi had not \u201creally showed his cards on climate change,\u201d and that it was encouraging in light of Javadekar\u2019s previous statement.\n\n\u201cAs the two biggest energy consumers and the largest democracies in the world, the United States and India have a unique role to play in taking immediate joint action to combat climate change.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Environmentalists were alarmed a week ago by an", "title": "India\u2019s Resistance to Climate Change Gives Way to Deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/02/India-s-Resistance-Climate-Change-Gives-Way-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07082013_India_Flag_Handshake_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/02/India-s-Resistance-Climate-Change-Gives-Way-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07082013_India_Flag_Handshake_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Environmentalists were alarmed a week ago by an", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde04\"", "article_summary": "Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), including the creation of a new global agreement on climate change.\nSecond, gradually reduce global emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, which are industrial chemicals that emit heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\nHe dismissed the suggestion that India should make cuts to its own carbon emissions as its economy is about to take off.\n\u201cRecognizing the critical importance of increasing energy access, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and improving resilience in the face of climate change, President Obama and Prime Minister Modi agreed to a new and enhanced strategic partnership on energy security, clean energy, and climate change,\u201d according to a summary from the White House.\n\u201cThat\u2019s for more developed countries.\u201dWithout India on board, however, any international effort to combat global warming would be meaningless."}
