There were, of course, the results of last week\u2019s midterms, which gave the GOP majority status in the Senate next year and put an end to eight long years of wandering. Once the new Congress convenes next year, McCain\u2019s chairmanship of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee is all but guaranteed.\n\nIn addition to the Senate majority, McCain teamed up with his longtime friend and creative partner Mark Salter to write a book about military service, American history and the value of an old-fashioned, martial sense of honor. The result is \u201c13 Soldiers: A Personal History of Americans at War,\u201d which looks at 13 men and women who fought for the U.S. \u2014 one for every major American war \u2014 and how the experience affected them.\n\nSalon spoke with McCain over the phone about the book, the war on ISIS, what he thinks President Obama should do on immigration and what he hopes to see from the soon-to-be GOP-controlled Senate. Our conversation is below and has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nYou and Mr. Salter haven\u2019t released a book in some time. What was it about this idea that made you want to get back into the mix?\n\nIt was an idea we\u2019ve been kicking around with John Karp, our publisher \u2026 We haven\u2019t done anything for a number of years, but I\u2019ve always kicked around the idea.\n\nSometimes I talk about history, particularly with young people, and they yawn and kind of get a little restless, because it\u2019s one thing to talk about the Civil War [and] it\u2019s something else to talk about the people who were engaged in it and what happened to them, and, in other words, kind of personalize it.\n\nPeople and leaders who ignore the lessons of history repeat them. That\u2019s an old adage, but it\u2019s very true \u2026 But how do you get people interested? You give them the examples of people who were actually engaged in war, but \u2026 you also try to give them the context of the conflict \u2026 and that way, I would hope, more young people might be more interested in [it]. That was a major motivation for it.\n\nYou mention how the lessons of history are important for leaders and would-be leaders. If you could have the incoming Republican freshman read one or two stories before taking office, which would you recommend?\n\nTwo, actually, for a little bit different reasons.\n\nOliver Wendell Holmes \u2026 was fundamentally changed by his experiences in [the Civil War] \u2026 but he went on to serve as a distinguished justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe other would be Monica Lin Brown, because she showed that there really should not be any debate over women in combat. It\u2019s one thing to have a rifle or an AK-47 or whatever it is and do the fighting, but the only thing that the medics have is equipment to try to save lives \u2014 and yet they go into the same danger that the combat soldier or Marine does as well. She ran to the sound of the guns, and saved lives, and that one I think is a lesson for the debate about the modern-day military, that as long as they are physically and mentally qualified \u2026 then I think the argument about women in combat is probably dispensed with.\n\nAnd if you could have the president read one chapter?\n\nThat is a good question. Maybe the story of Mikey Monsoor, because he might have a better understanding of the importance of the obligation we have to the men and women who have served and sacrificed not to have all of that wasted or lost because of lack of a better strategy.\n\nLet me give you an example: I was in Louisiana campaigning for our candidate there and we went to a bunch of veterans\u2019 events. At one of them, a young man came up to me and said, \u201cSenator McCain, I was at the Second Battle of Fallujah\u201d \u2014 as you know, that was the bloodiest single encounter when the surge began; we lost 86 soldiers and Marines, [and] I think 400 were wounded \u2014 and he said, \u201cI lost four guys in my platoon. Now the black flags of ISIS fly over Fallujah. Tell me, Senator, what do I tell my friends\u2019 mothers?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s was a tough one for me to answer, and as you know, I believe that this could have been avoided by leaving a residual force behind, a stabilizing force behind. History will make that judgment; I\u2019m growing a little weary of arguing it, but \u2026 maybe that would be the one [I\u2019d have the president read] \u2026 We have to perform in a way that is worthy of these people\u2019s sacrifice.\n\nWell, about ISIS; I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen reports about the rebels we armed over there defecting to al-Qaida and often taking our weapons with them. What do you say to those who are opposed to intervention and point to this as proof that arming foreign fighters backfires?\n\nI still think a seminal moment was when Hilary Clinton, David Petraeus, Bob Gates and others meeting with the president strongly recommended arming the Free Syrian Army, and he rejected that. I still to this day don\u2019t know his rationale there. At that time, the equation on the battlefield [in Syria] was shifting in favor of [Syrian President] Bashar Assad \u2026 because the Iranians had convinced or ordered Hezbollah into the fight \u2014 some 5,000 talented fighters. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard was on the ground, training and equipping and fighting against the Free Syrian Army. And Bashar Assad, without the Iranian injection \u2014 well, in the president\u2019s own words, it [was] not a matter of whether, but a matter of when Bashar Assad [would] go.\n\nIn response to the dramatic escalation on the part of the Iranians and the Russians (planeload after planeload of Russian weapons came in, too) \u2026 we basically did nothing to help [the Free Syrian Army], so they start getting beat. Now, when they are defeated, time after time, people start leaving them, because they see that they\u2019re not winning. And that\u2019s understandable. Some of them have defected to al-Nusra, because \u2026 their enemy is [ultimately] Bashar Assad \u2026\n\nThere have been setbacks, but all of that was predictable. I keep on a desk in my office the pictures that were \u2026 recently on the front page of the New York Times. Thousands of people [massacred by Assad] \u2026 those pictures are gruesome. They show crimes against humanity. And, you know, it was 8,000 ethnically cleansed at Srebrenica that motivated Bill Clinton to go and fight and defeat Milosevic in Bosnia. Now we have 200,000 killed; and 150,000 Syrians are still in Bashar Assad\u2019s prisons under the most unspeakable conditions. Sometimes I am accused of getting emotional about it. Well, I plead guilty. I plead guilty to being emotional about it. I\u2019ll leave it to the judgment of the people of Arizona whether my emotion is justified or not.\n\nSo my response to those people who are now saying, \u201cOh, it\u2019s all terrible; we can\u2019t win, etc.\u201d [is], Well, if you\u2019re willing to stand by and watch Bashar Assad slaughter now 200,000 people [and create] 3.5, 4 million refugees \u2026 we will pay a price for that. I was in a refugee camp in Jordan \u2026 and I was being taken around by a woman who was a schoolteacher, and there were kids everywhere, children everywhere, and she said, \u201cSenator McCain, you see these young boys?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, they\u2019re all over the place.\u201d She said, \u201cThey and their parents believe that [America] has abandoned them, and they\u2019re going to take revenge against you when they grow up.\u201d My friend, we are going to reap a whirlwind.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP senator and ex-presidential candidate tells Salon about war, gridlock -- and why it won't be Ted Cruz's Senate", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: John McCain answers Salon questions about Ted Cruz, ISIS and repealing Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "GOP senator and ex-presidential candidate tells Salon about war, gridlock -- and why it won't be Ted Cruz's Senate", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: John McCain answers Salon questions about Ted Cruz, ISIS and repealing Obamacare", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/11/exclusive_john_mccain_unloads_to_salon_on_ted_cruz_isis_and_repealing_obamacare/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/john_mccain.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP senator and ex-presidential candidate tells Salon about war, gridlock -- and why it won't be Ted Cruz's Senate", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: John McCain answers Salon questions about Ted Cruz, ISIS and repealing Obamacare", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/john_mccain.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 13 soldiers, assad, Editor's Picks, Election 2014, GOP, Immigration, isis, John Boehner, John McCain, mark salter, Mitch McConnell, Senate, Ted Cruz, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe30db\"", "article_summary": "And Bashar Assad, without the Iranian injection \u2014 well, in the president\u2019s own words, it [was] not a matter of whether, but a matter of when Bashar Assad [would] go.\nSome of them have defected to al-Nusra, because \u2026 their enemy is [ultimately] Bashar Assad \u2026There have been setbacks, but all of that was predictable.\nAt that time, the equation on the battlefield [in Syria] was shifting in favor of [Syrian President] Bashar Assad \u2026 because the Iranians had convinced or ordered Hezbollah into the fight \u2014 some 5,000 talented fighters.\nOnce the new Congress convenes next year, McCain\u2019s chairmanship of the powerful Senate Armed Services Committee is all but guaranteed.\nIf you could have the incoming Republican freshman read one or two stories before taking office, which would you recommend?"}
