Congress and state legislatures should “reform all major labor laws” to better meet the realities of the growing gig economy, or they should create an exemption from labor laws for gig economy workers, according to a report released Monday by a Washington-based think tank.

Gig economy companies like Uber Technologies Inc. and TaskRabbit Inc. “have turned a bright spotlight on the country’s labor laws, which are showing themselves to be hopelessly outdated as they impose rigid divisions between employees and independent contractor,” Joseph Kennedy, a senior fellow with the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, wrote in the 24-page report.

ITIF is a research and advocacy organization that focuses on tech and innovation issues.

Subjecting employees and independent contractors to different rules and protections creates uncertainty while failing to provide flexibility, to the detriment of workers, Kennedy wrote. To address this, he said, Congress should amend statutes to apply “more appropriately” in a way that doesn’t rely upon the division between employees and independent contractors. In the alternative, Congress should craft a narrow exemption for gig economy workers that pre-empt local and federal labor laws, he said.

Differentiating between employees independent contractors has gained increased attention as critics push back against companies that prefer not to classify certain workers as employees. In July, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that if elected president she would “crack down on bosses who exploit employees by misclassifying them as contractors,” according to CNET.

Lyft Inc. and Uber are each facing class-action lawsuits from drivers who argue that they should be classified as employees, rather than contractors.
