Once found out, she pleads with Carl like a kid who has gotten a bad report card: Whatever you do\u2014don\u2019t tell Dad! Why, many viewers and critics have wondered, would anyone object to teaching children to defend themselves when walkers are always at the door? Simple. Carol fears that Rick, like his misguided late wife Lori, and like the American viewers who tune in faithfully each week, need children to remain innocent, no matter what the cost. A quick glance at the stories we\u2019ve told ourselves for centuries reveals a persistent tendency to categorize children as one of two things: innocent victims or bad seeds. Carol\u2019s impromptu self-defense classes blurred that line in ways that she feared would scare Rick, as it certainly scares most Americans.\n\nPuritan settlers came to North America quite sure that all children were born evil. John Robinson, a friend of William Bradford and a 17th-century combination of the Marquis de Sade and Benjamin Spock, warned parents that nothing short of repeated, harsh discipline would get the devil out of their little Johns and Abigails. \u201cThere is in all children,\u201d he warned, \u201ca stubbornness, and stoutness of mind arising from natural pride, that must in the first place, be broken and beaten down.\u201d(Feel free to have that piece of pilgrim advice embroidered on napkins for your Thanksgiving festivities this year.)\n\nThe age of the helicopter parent we now inhabit would make much more sense to nineteenth-century folks. Enraptured by innocent waifs like Harriet Beecher Stowe\u2019s Little Eva, Charles Dickens\u2019s Little Nell, and countless others, Victorians replaced the Puritan idea of the naturally bad child with its polar opposite\u2014the child simply too good to live. \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u2019s\u201d Little Eva, a child so angelic that her feet barely seemed to touch the ground, was far too pure a soul to confront the horrors of slavery that surrounded her. When Eva simply hears the story of an abused slave, she transforms from beautiful child to a horror movie spectre, as her \u201clarge, mystic eyes dilated with horror, and every drop of blood [was] driven from her lips and cheeks.\u201d Her caretakers accurately diagnose the problem. A story like Prue\u2019s \u201cisn\u2019t for sweet, delicate young ladies, like you,\u201d declares one of the house slaves. \u201cThese yer stories isn\u2019t; it\u2019s enough to kill \u2019em!\u201d And indeed they do. Like the child of hipster foodies who stumbles unprotected into the pop-tart aisle, Eva\u2019s access to just one bite of the fruit of knowledge does irreversible damage. She dies within a few chapters, sparking readerly mourning that helped to fuel unprecedented antislavery furor.\n\nSo Barack Obama was building on a tradition that went back at least as far as Little Eva when he asked the nation to witness the suffering children being gassed to death in Syria to prepare ourselves for possible war. The victimized child has long functioned as the litmus test for American virtue. We just know we\u2019re on the right side of battle of good and evil when we are avenging lost little angels. The child-victim provides a moral get-out of jail free card. Carol\u2019s worry earlier this season about the reaction to her kiddie knife lessons reflects her knowledge that American adults\u2013even post-apocalypse\u2013are desperately worried about losing the innocent child we rely on to confirm our roles as protectors and heroes. Her own morally suspect actions in \u201cIsolation\u201d prove that she herself is not immune from the need to see herself as a child savior, even at the expense of other innocents. As the virus moves through the prison regardless of Carol\u2019s violent attempts to stop it, the desire to isolate the already-exposed children from danger seems to be yet another misguided fantasy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kids, especially those of color, are at risk of violence every day.
