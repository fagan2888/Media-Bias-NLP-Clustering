The idea that any university\u2019s mission might be simply to meet the \u201cstate\u2019s work force needs\u201d frightens me. A university education is not the same as attending trade school. It is a brief respite in an otherwise hectic and behind-schedule life, where we are allowed the luxury of thinking, a discipline recently overlooked and seemingly undervalued.\n\nIn the corporate world, we make snap decisions, which should not be confused with quick thinking. Imagine how poor those decisions will become if we eliminate the foundation of a liberal arts education in college.\n\nSo let our youth \u201cstay a little\u201d in colleges and universities to study broadly in areas that don\u2019t seem to have direct relevance to their fields of study. I want a physician who has read \u201cMacbeth,\u201d a financial adviser who adores Mozart, a lawyer who revels in the beauty of a van Gogh or a Dal\u00ed.\n\nI want geophysicists who respect Margaret Mead and Dian Fossey. Electrical engineers who can quote Aristotle, Plato and Socrates. Because I think that learning, that knowledge, affects our thought processes in big and little ways, all the time, every day. And we are better for it.\n\nMARY LOVE MATTOX\n\nBellevue, Wash.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI am glad that Frank Bruni started his column with the question \u201cWhat\u2019s the most transformative educational experience you\u2019ve had?\u201d The critical word in the question is \u201ctransformative,\u201d and it is the one I have used every semester when I ask my students a simple question: What is the purpose of education?\n\nGiving the students a few minutes to ponder, I then engage them in a discussion about the nature of education. While many of them reply that the purpose of education is to \u201ctrain ourselves in a given subject,\u201d to \u201cget a job,\u201d to \u201cbetter ourselves,\u201d to \u201cimprove the world,\u201d to \u201cbecome informed citizens\u201d and so on, I always end my discussion by telling them that the purpose of education is to \u201ctransform\u201d themselves, that their college experience is all about change in the context of mental evolution above everything else.\n\nI also remind them that the function of their professors is to serve as the spark that lights the eternal flame of learning, but that it is truly up to them to continue to fuel this fire for the rest of their lives.\n\nMICHAEL HADJIARGYROU\n\nOld Westbury, N.Y.\n\nThe writer is professor and chairman of the life sciences department at the New York Institute of Technology.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nFrank Bruni is correct for calling out those who view undergraduate institutions as trade schools whose primary purpose is to guarantee students high-paying jobs. There are jobs that afford one a high income without a college degree. Yet I would argue that every citizen deserves the cultural literacy enjoyed through political science or literature.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMy undergraduate degree is in philosophy. Its value was to teach me to think critically, a skill in short order when every meme is posted on Twitter, commented on and then discarded based on emotion or the sensibility of the day. When I graduated from college, I was asked, \u201cSo, what are you going to do with a degree in philosophy?\u201d\n\nPrepared by a discipline that taught me logical reasoning and limitless delight for inquiry, I went on to do many things: work in corporate communications and human resources and teach English. It is as a teacher that I try to inspire my students as profoundly as Mr. Bruni\u2019s Shakespeare professor did.\n\nLYNDA RICH SPIEGEL\n\nForest Hills, Queens\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nFrank Bruni does not mention one highly practical reason to study Shakespeare. To function effectively in any world, including in business, one must have some understanding of human beings. Is there a richer source of wisdom about this complex phenomenon than his plays?\n\nHELEN HILL UPDIKE\n\nNew York\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nA year ago, I read about a data science program that sounded like a great career segue, but it had a prerequisite of calculus. Having gotten no further than Algebra I, I went back to college in the evenings and took precalculus and calculus, and am now studying statistics.\n\nAt 61, I\u2019ve had to work very hard at my studies. I\u2019m no longer certain of my goal or whether I\u2019ll get there, but being immersed in the academic environment has been invigorating, and rediscovering the beauty, truth and, yes, practical applications of mathematics has been its own sweet reward.\n\nJOHN WILLIAMS\n\nNew York", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150218032710, "twitter": {"description": "Readers respond to a column by Frank Bruni, \u201cCollege\u2019s Priceless Value.\u201d", "title": "The Mission of College?
