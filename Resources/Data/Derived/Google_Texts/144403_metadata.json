Greg Tyus was appointed Monday night to fill the first two years of the term vacated by Dr. Mark McClure, who resigned from the school board before being sowrn in.\n\nBy Rick McCrabb\n\nStaff Writer\n\nSince the Rev. Gregory Tyus already was a member of the Middletown Board of Education, and he ran in the November election, his appointment \u201cmade the most sense,\u201d said the board\u2019s president.\n\nIn November, Tyus was unseated on the board by Dr. Mark McClure, but soon after his victory McClure announced he was stepping down, even before he was sworn in, because of his work obligations.\n\nSo on Monday night, Tyus was appointed to McClure\u2019s position. He will serve a two-year term, and if he wants, he\u2019ll run for another two years in November 2015.\n\nMarcia Andrew, board president, said Tyus\u2019 appointment was the best for the district because the board knew he was \u201cpassionate and wanted to help the schools improve.\u201d\n\nTyus said he had \u201cno problem with defeat,\u201d but after McClure resigned, and no one else stepped forward, he decided to retain his seat. He felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to continue his service to the district, he said.\n\nIn the letter McClure sent to the school board and the Butler County Board of Elections, he said after meeting with Superintendent Sam Ison and Treasurer Kelley Thorpe to discuss the needs for the next couple years, he realized the impact the Affordable Care Act will have on his medical practice.\n\nHe wrote that the increased number of patients and the additional documentation required by Medicare will \u201cgreatly limit\u201d his time to perform the duties of an \u201ceffective board member.\u201d\n\nKindergarten deadline may change\n\nThe district is considering changing its deadline for those students entering kindergarten. The deadline may move forward two months, from Sept. 30 to Aug. 1, said Elizabeth Lolli, senior director of curriculum and instruction. The board heard the first reading Monday night.\n\nLolli said the move hopefully will make sure students are better prepared and more mature before they enter kindergarten.\n\nShe said kindergartners today face \u201cvery, very strong academics.\u201d She said kindergarten students must possess fine motor skills, physical endurance and be able to read in order to be successful.\n\nShe said there are about 500 kindergartners in the district and 92 of them were born between Aug. 1 to Sept. 30. If that holds true next school year, there would be about 20 percent fewer kindergartners in class.\n\nEven if the board approves the move at its next meeting, Lolli said parents can have their children take an early entrance exam and if they qualify, they will be allowed to enter school early.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since the Rev.", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/tyus-to-fill-seat-on-middletown-school-board/ncM5X/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/12/17/f0/48/092412-greg-tyus.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Since the Rev.", "title": "Tyus to fill seat on Middletown school board"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2013/12/17/f0/48/092412-greg-tyus.jpg", "description": "Since the Rev.
