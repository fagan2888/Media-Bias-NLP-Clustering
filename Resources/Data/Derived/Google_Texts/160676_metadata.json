Mark Udall talks to the media after a Senate Intelligence Committee closed hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Nov. 16, 2012. (REUTERS/Yuri Gripas)\n\n4094856\n\nThe Colorado administrator who tussled with Democratic Sen. Mark Udall over a report on the state\u2019s Obamacare-cancelled plans is now leaving her department for good.\n\nOne of Udall\u2019s potential 2014 challengers has linked the move to the senator\u2019s office. (RELATED: Dem sen accused of \u2018bullying\u2019 over Obamacare cancellations)\n\nJo Donlin, currently director of external affairs for the Colorado Division of Insurance, will leave the post Feb. 28 and start fresh as a health care adviser in the state\u2019s Division of Professions and Occupations, according to the Denver Post.\n\nRepublican state Rep. Amy Stephens, who is seeking the GOP nomination to face Udall in the 2014 Senate race, believes Udall\u2019s office is to blame.\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing that Jo Donlin is leaving her job at the Department of Insurance as a result of shameful attempts by the office of Sen. Mark Udall to bully her into changing Obamacare insurance cancellation data,\u201d Stephens announced.\n\n\u201cMs. Donlin should be applauded for refusing to capitulate to the politically motivated demands made by Sen. Udall\u2019s staff. State employees should not be pressured by the office of a United States Senator.\u201d\n\nDonlin has become the center of a controversy over the number of Coloradoans whose health care plans were canceled due to Affordable Care Act regulations.\n\nAfter the state\u2019s insurance department released its initial estimate that 250,000 state residents would have their individual policies cancelled, Sen. Udall\u2019s office , claiming that the cancellations simply didn\u2019t count because 95 percent included some options for renewals.\n\nJoe Britton, Udall\u2019s legislative director, even threatened to challenge the numbers publicly if Donlin didn\u2019t make a change, according to emails released by CompleteColorado.com\n\n\u201cWe need to move on this ASAP \u2014 or we\u2019ll be forced to challenge the 249K number ourselves,\u201d Britton emailed Donlin, who didn\u2019t take the accusation lying down.\n\n\u201cSen. Udall says our numbers were wrong. They are not wrong,\u201d Donlin wrote. \u201cCancellation notices affected 249,199 people\u2026 They want to trash our numbers. I\u2019m holding strong while we get more details.\u201d\n\nDonlin emailed another colleague that after trying to explain the report\u2019s conclusions to Britton, she received a \u201cvery hostile call from Sen. Udall\u2019s deputy chief of staff.\u201d\n\nAfter requests from state Republicans, including Rep. Stephens, the state\u2019s Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA) convened a panel which supposedly conducted an investigation into the issue, but doubts were raised when DORA\u2019s chief Barbara Kelley was unable to provide documents or detailed information on the investigation to reporters.\n\nReversing her initial decision to keep the members of the panel private, Kelley revealed in January that herself and three other Democratic officials compromised the \u201cneutral panel.\u201d She maintained that she\u2019d kept no notes from the oral interviews that provided the basis of the investigation.\n\nThe panel said it found no evidence of intimidation or coercion on the part of Udall or his staff. Donlin has not made any public statement on the controversy.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
