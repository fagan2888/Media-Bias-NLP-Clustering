Peyton Manning, jovial after a two-day respite from the Broncos\u2019 offensive struggles against the Baltimore Ravens, has moved on from Week 1.\n\nDone, he says. A boisterous Arrowhead Stadium is on his mind now.\n\n\u201cThe NFL really wanted to challenge us this year, with Baltimore in Week 1 and the Kansas City Chiefs at their place four days later,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough place to play, a tough team to play, and just a couple days to get ready.\u201d\n\nThe first challenge resulted in four sacks and nine quarterback hurries that were enough to put Manning\u2019s name on the Broncos\u2019 injury report with a back issue. He practiced Monday and Tuesday, but deflected questions about his health.\n\n\u201cYou know my thoughts on the injury report. I think the media should have to an injury report as well,\u201d he said, joking. \u201cI\u2019d like to create it myself.\u201d\n\nManning\u2019s tone has changed, the saltiness from Sunday all but gone. But concern about the Broncos\u2019 offense has only grown.\n\nBaltimore\u2019s defense exposed the holes in the Manning-Gary Kubiak-meshed offense that became evident in the preseason. Manning was held to 175 yards on 24-of-40 passing attempts, zero touchdowns and one interception that was returned for a touchdown.\n\nAfter the game, Manning gave himself a grade of \u201cfair.\u201d National opinion seemed to skew lower.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep reminding ourselves around here that we did win the game, that we are 1-0,\u201d Manning said. \u201cAnd thank goodness. I can\u2019t imagine what it would have been like had we lost the game.\u201d\n\nAgainst the Chiefs, the challenge will be as daunting. Last season, Kansas City held opponents to 330.5 yards per game (seventh fewest in the league) and recorded 46 sacks (fifth most), 22 of them from edge rusher Justin Houston.\n\nIn six career games at Kansas City\u2019s Arrowhead Stadium, Manning has a 59.9 completion percentage and has averaged 302.2 yards and 2.8 touchdowns per game. History, as it has been many times, is on Manning\u2019s side. The Broncos\u2019 schedule, however, is not.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure, offensively, I speak for a lot of guys that we certainly want to play better,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThursday couldn\u2019t come soon enough to have another opportunity.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peyton Manning eager for offensive redo in Kansas City", "title": "Peyton Manning eager for offensive redo in Kansas City", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/15/peyton-manning-eager-for-offensive-redo-in-kansas-city/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150913_074157_peyton-manning-1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150913_074157_peyton-manning-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-15T16:21:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T00:45:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After the game, Manning gave himself a grade of \u201cfair.\u201d National opinion seemed to skew lower.\nI think the media should have to an injury report as well,\u201d he said, joking.\nPeyton Manning, jovial after a two-day respite from the Broncos\u2019 offensive struggles against the Baltimore Ravens, has moved on from Week 1.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure, offensively, I speak for a lot of guys that we certainly want to play better,\u201d Manning said.\n\u201cYou know my thoughts on the injury report."}
