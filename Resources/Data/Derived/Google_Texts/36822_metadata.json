And everyone seems to be comfortable, preparers and taxpayers, in preparing their returns.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs Koskinen noted, there were certainly reasons to doubt the IRS. ObamaCare\u2019s website famously melted down when it launched in October 2013, and the law has faced plenty of other bumps as it\u2019s been implemented \u2014 including when people were kicked off their insurance plans even after President Obama promised that they could keep them.\n\nThe IRS itself has been under fire for the better part of two years, after the agency acknowledged singling out Tea Party groups seeking tax-exempt status. Congressional Republicans have only sharpened their oversight of the tax agency during that time span, which served to raise the stakes for the IRS on ObamaCare.\n\nBut both the tax agency and tax preparers say that they\u2019ve been able to capitalize on the years of preparation time since Obama signed his signature healthcare law in 2010.\n\nH&R Block, for instance, was running advertisements on ObamaCare all the way back in 2013 \u2014 at least in part because the tax preparation giant didn\u2019t want to get blamed if its customers no longer got a refund because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt's amazing what the IRS can do when it's given that time,\u201d said Nina Olson, the national taxpayer advocate, at a Brookings Institution event this week.\n\nOlson, an in-house IRS watchdog, added that there\u2019s definitely been \u201cglitches\u201d this tax season. But she said the agency hasn\u2019t had the sort of problems it did with programs like the first-time homebuyer credit, for which it had far less preparation time.\n\nThe most notable of the problems this filing season was when the Obama administration sent out hundreds of thousands of forms that gave taxpayers incorrect information about how much of a subsidy they received to help pay for insurance. The Department of Health and Human Services was more to blame for that mishap than the IRS.\n\nPreparers do say that many taxpayers were undoubtedly caught by surprise this year, finding that they owed the Treasury once they reconciled the amount of credit they received with an earlier estimate for their 2014 income. For this filing season, taxpayers without health insurance owe either $95 or 1 percent of their taxable income \u2014 whichever amount is highest.\n\nKristin Esposito of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants also knocked the IRS for consistently being late in circulating ObamaCare-related tax forms, which she said had made it difficult to make taxpayers aware of their healthcare requirements.\n\nStill, she added: \u201cNone of these are catastrophic.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of things could have gone wrong. A lot of things have gone wrong, but they have not been large-scale things,\u201d said Esposito. \u201cIt is fair to say it\u2019s not been a horrible year for ACA.\u201d\n\nThe IRS has had to implement other key initiatives this filing season, including a law cracking down on offshore tax evaders.\n\nBut Koskinen says that a major reason that the ObamaCare requirements have caused few problems is that roughly four in five taxpayers only have to check a box telling the IRS that they have insurance.\n\nThe IRS chief has long called on Congress to simplify the tax code. But he also noted at the National Press Club last week that roughly nine in 10 taxpayers used software to fill out their tax forms \u2014 making it easier to integrate ObamaCare requirements without much difficulty.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, David Williams, the chief tax officer at Intuit, which makes TurboTax, said the ability to get ACA systems in order illustrated that the IRS is more agile when it comes to technology than it might seem.\n\n\u201cThe predictions of cataclysm that were in every discussion about ACA right up until the filing season vanished when you realize that the IRS had figured out most of the major problems and dealt with them,\u201d Williams, himself a former IRS official, said at the Brookings event.\n\nStill, while Koskinen and IRS officials are proud of the agency\u2019s performance this filing season, they\u2019re also loath to compliment themselves too loudly.\n\nKoskinen, if anything, has only intensified his push to increase IRS funding, which has fallen roughly $1.2 billion over the last five years. IRS officials maintain those cuts have led to \u201cabysmal\u201d customer service, with only two in five taxpayers getting through on the phone and frustrations at IRS walk-in centers mounting to the point that the police have had to be called, according to union officials.\n\nBecause of those episodes, the IRS has sought to trumpet its work on the filing season, while also remaining sympathetic to the taxpayers it has been unable to help navigate it.\n\n\u201cContinuing budget reductions have meant unacceptably long wait times for taxpayers trying to get assistance over the phone or in person,\u201d the agency said in a statement.\n\nBoth IRS officials and tax preparers say they expect the first ObamaCare tax season to be the hardest. But Esposito, of the CPA association, noted that next year\u2019s tax filing period would have its own challenges, as the IRS and preparers deal for the first time with the employer mandate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another half to go,\u201d Esposito said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The tax filing season appears to be wrapping up with only a few hiccups.", "description": "The tax filing season appears to be wrapping up with only a few hiccups.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Bernie Becker", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The tax filing season appears to be wrapping up with only a few hiccups.", "title": "IRS declares victory on ObamaCare", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/238512-irs-declares-victory-on-obamacare", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/koskinenjohn_041015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/238512-irs-declares-victory-on-obamacare", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-12T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-12T06:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/238512-irs-declares-victory-on-obamacare", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The tax filing season appears to be wrapping up with only a few hiccups.", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS declares victory on ObamaCare"}, "dcterms.title": "IRS declares victory on ObamaCare"}, "article_summary": "Both IRS officials and tax preparers say they expect the first ObamaCare tax season to be the hardest.\nThe IRS is claiming victory as ObamaCare\u2019s first tax filing season appears to be wrapping up with only a few hiccups.\nCongressional Republicans have only sharpened their oversight of the tax agency during that time span, which served to raise the stakes for the IRS on ObamaCare.\nFor this filing season, taxpayers without health insurance owe either $95 or 1 percent of their taxable income \u2014 whichever amount is highest.\nBut both the tax agency and tax preparers say that they\u2019ve been able to capitalize on the years of preparation time since Obama signed his signature healthcare law in 2010."}
