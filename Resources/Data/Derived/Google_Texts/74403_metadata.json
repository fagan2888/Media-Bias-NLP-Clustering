To close out 2014 with a chuckle, CIOs share their most interesting interview tales, which include people who don\u2019t like people, college graduates who want to be CIO, and, uh, cartoon character impressions.\n\nCovanta Covanta Holdings Corp. CIO Stu Kippelman\n\nCandidate channels Robin Williams: While interviewing a candidate for a systems administrator position several years ago, Covanta Energy Corp. CIO Stu Kippelman told the man that he looks for ways in which IT staff can tackle problems from a different angle. Mr. Kippelman said the candidate hopped up on his desk, and quoted a scene from the film \u201cDead Poets Society,\u201d in which the late Robin Williams climbs his desk to teach his students to look at things differently. He hired the candidate.\n\nBill Martin/Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. Bill Martin, CIO of Royal Caribbean Cruises\n\nFlattery will get you nowhere: Bill Martin, CIO of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. said that a candidate interviewing for a position as head of enterprise architecture told him: \u201cYou are a true legend in the industry and\u2026\u201d Mr. Martin said: \u201cThe comment made me laugh \u2026 out loud. He didn\u2019t get the job. Didn\u2019t even get through the interview.\u201d\n\nAlltech Alltech Inc. CIO Tim Arthur\n\nThe force is weak with this one. Tim Arthur, CIO of Alltech Inc., asked a candidate: \u201cIf you could do anything in the world and get paid to do it what would it be?\u201d The candidate told him he loved to do cartoon and film character voice overs. He proceeded to spend the next 20 minutes impersonating Yoda, Darth Vader, Marvin the Martian and many other characters. Mr. Martin thought: \u201cOh my Gosh, please make this guy stop.\u201d He didn\u2019t get the job.\n\nSAIC Bob Fecteau, CIO of SAIC Inc.\n\nCollege grad seeks CIO role. During one ill-fated interview, SAIC Corp. CIO Bob Fecteau asked a fresh college graduate what role he sought within the company\u2019s IT department. The grad replied: \u201cI want to be the CIO.\u201d Mr. Fecteau responded: \u201cIf you are going to be the CIO what job would you want me to do?\u201d That quickly ended the conversation. Mr. Fecteau said this sort of exchange \u201chappens more than you might think.\u201d\n\nTeva Teva Pharmaceuticals CIO Guy Hadari\n\nDon\u2019t like people? Good luck with that. During an interview, Guy Hadari, CIO of Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd., asked a proficient manager with high-potential what he wanted to do next. In part, his reply was \u201cI don\u2019t like people.\u201d Mr. Hadari said he knew immediately that this manager would struggle to become an IT executive. He said it\u2019s not enough anymore to be a great programmer or architect \u2013 IT leaders must also be skilled in communications to work with business stakeholders engagement and manage change. In other words \u2014 people skills.\n\nCreative Solutions in Healthcare Creative Solutions in Healthcare CIO Shawn Wiora\n\nWait, what\u2019s my name again? A nervous job candidate introduced himself to Creative Solutions in Healthcare LLC CIO Shawn Wiora as\u2026 Shawn Wiora. \u201cThey were so nervous. It was kind of endearing.\u201d Not endearing enough; he didn\u2019t get the job.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "CIOs seeking to fortify their IT staffs sometimes run into some, shall we say, interesting personalities while meeting job candidates.
