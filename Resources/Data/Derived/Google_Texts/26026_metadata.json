(Photo: michael hayman)\n\nHere's some things to remember before you head to the polls for Kentucky's general election, according to the Secretary of State's Office.\n\nDo list\n\n\u2022 Verify your voter registration status before you head to the polls. You can look it up at the state Voter Information Center at https://cdcbp.ky.gov/VICWeb/index.jsp.\n\n\u2022 Know where you vote. Some polling locations have changed. You can find the address and driving directions through the state VIC.\n\n\u2022 Know the most convenient times to vote. Polls are open 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Polls tend to be busiest during the morning and evening rush hours and at lunchtime.\n\n\u2022 Bring some identification to your polling location. You must either be known by a precinct officer or produce a driver's license, social security card, credit card or other form of identification that contains a picture and signature before you may cast a ballot.\n\n\u2022 Ask a poll worker for instructions on how to use the voting machine or other procedural questions if you are confused about the process.\n\n\u2022 Let officials know immediately if you encounter problems at the polls. You may talk to precinct election officers, the county clerk, the State Board of Elections at (502) 573-7100, or the Attorney General's Election Fraud Hotline at 1-800-328-VOTE.\n\n\u2022 Remind your friends and family to vote. Everyone's voice deserves to be heard at the polls.\n\nDon't list\n\n\u2022 Don't wait until the last minute to head to the polls or be discouraged by long lines. As long as you are in line by 6 p.m. on election day, you will be allowed to cast your ballot.\n\n\u2022 Don't campaign or solicit votes within 300 feet of a polling place. It's illegal in Kentucky. That includes placing campaign signs or handing out literature.\n\n\u2022 Don't record the identity of voters in the voting room. That includes using cameras and cell phones.\n\n\u2022 Don't forget to thank your poll workers. The election would not be possible without them.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1gSjQU5", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Know the \"do's\" and \"don'ts\" of voting before you head to your polling place", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Know the \"do's\" and \"don'ts\" of voting before you head to your polling place", "title": "Things to know before you vote", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2014/05/17/things-know-vote/2215860/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Know the \"do's\" and \"don'ts\" of voting before you head to your polling place", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d324205b27385800efa347ff5e5b02cf2f366af1/c=334-0-1667-1333&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/17/titlevoting.jpg", "title": "Things to know before you vote", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections/kentucky", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac20add3f92adfd1d6e695591937e6e42c30dd09/c=500-0-1500-1333/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/17/titlevoting.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46837b90ae998993d99356e31057d6d0ad0c3903/c=334-0-1667-1333/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/17/titlevoting.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/65cf2a46e294251efac8980d44d4354bd635d5ce/c=112-0-1889-1333/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/17/titlevoting.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ad857ff3f471a9f423b391a57ab1297845aebf6/c=0-104-2000-1229&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/17/titlevoting.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-09-09T13:45:46.227000-04:00", "shorthed": "Things to know before you vote", "articleid": 2215860, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d93021e91b0ec7a084ab7d527e0eff44827b6fb/c=0-104-2000-1229/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/17/titlevoting.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f8e536322b64e5e9bd07b1b166217d069e2b028e/c=625-0-1375-1333/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/05/17/titlevoting.jpg"}, "author": "Mike Trautmann", "title": "Things to know before you vote", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1e4\"", "article_summary": "\u2022 Know where you vote.\n\u2022 Know the most convenient times to vote.\n(Photo: michael hayman)Here's some things to remember before you head to the polls for Kentucky's general election, according to the Secretary of State's Office.\nDon't list\u2022 Don't wait until the last minute to head to the polls or be discouraged by long lines.\n\u2022 Let officials know immediately if you encounter problems at the polls."}
