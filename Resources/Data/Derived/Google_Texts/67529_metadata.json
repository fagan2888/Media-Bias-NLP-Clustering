A tractor pulling a massive vacuum preceded the sprinklers moistening the grass at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\n\nAs the lights dimmed from the Broncos\u2019 24-17 divisional playoff victory over San Diego, the groundskeeper and seemingly everyone else in Denver began looking ahead, to the AFC championship game Sunday against the visiting New England Patriots.\n\nThat is, everyone except most of the Broncos players and staff. Most preferred to celebrate their victory and worry about New England come Monday. The Patriots own one of the three victories over the Broncos, having rallied from a 24-0 deficit to win, 34-31, in overtime on Nov. 24.\n\nIt was one of Denver\u2019s three losses, and the one that hurt the most. Having taken a 24-7 fourth-quarter lead against San Diego and narrowly avoiding another monumental playoff collapse, the Broncos preferred to glow in the moment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not addressing the Patriots right now. I\u2019m enjoying my victory against the Chargers,\u201d Broncos defensive end Shaun Phillips said, loud and clear.\n\nThe Patriots-Broncos winner will represent the AFC in the Feb. 2 Super Bowl at East Rutherford, N.J.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be plenty of tears (for the losing team),\u201d said wide receiver Wes Welker, the former Patriots star. \u201cWe\u2019re just going out there and execute the way we can execute and, you know, come away with the win. We\u2019re definitely looking forward to it.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 unwillingness to talk specifically about the Patriots might be orders from above. Said coach John Fox: \u201cI think I\u2019m going to enjoy this one first. It hasn\u2019t sunk in. We\u2019ll dig into that tomorrow. We\u2019ll enjoy (the win) tonight. We\u2019re very honored and pleased to be in that position.\u201d\n\nFor many Broncos, this will be their first conference championship game. Among those players is wide receiver Eric Decker. \u201cIt\u2019s fun to go on to the next step and just stay alive,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are four teams left and to be one of them is pretty special.\u201d\n\nManning threw for 230 yards Sunday to surpass Joe Montana and Brett Favre for most passing yards in postseason history. He is now No. two all-time, with 5,909 yards, trailing only the Patriots\u2019 Tom Brady who has 6,147.\n\nManning said the rematch with Brady was not up for discussion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to address that (publicly) on Wednesday,\u201d Manning said. \u201cBut, we\u2019ll enjoy this one. You\u2019re supposed to enjoy these wins. We\u2019ll start working on the Patriots tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s AFC title game is scheduled for 1:05 p.m. in Denver.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s prime-time football,\u201d said Broncos linebacker Wesley Woodyard, one of the few who chose to identify the challenge. \u201cThey\u2019re one of the best teams and so are we. We\u2019re excited to play these guys.\u201d\n\nAdded defensive end Robert Ayers: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a lot for Brady. We\u2019re looking forward to it. He\u2019s going to bring his A game (and) we\u2019re going to bring ours. It\u2019s going to be a tough match. Regardless of what happened last time, if we don\u2019t bring our A game we\u2019re going to lose.\u201d\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or Twitter: @MikeChambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "John Fox, Broncos waiting to rev up rhetoric for Patriots matchup", "title": "John Fox, Broncos waiting to rev up rhetoric for Patriots matchup", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/12/john-fox-broncos-waiting-to-rev-up-rhetoric-for-patriots-matchup/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140112__BN20140113_Z00_BNSP13FBNBROSIDE2p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140112__BN20140113_Z00_BNSP13FBNBROSIDE2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-12T20:12:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T06:10:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc78\"", "article_summary": "He\u2019s going to bring his A game (and) we\u2019re going to bring ours.\nWe\u2019re definitely looking forward to it.\u201dThe Broncos\u2019 unwillingness to talk specifically about the Patriots might be orders from above.\nThe Patriots own one of the three victories over the Broncos, having rallied from a 24-0 deficit to win, 34-31, in overtime on Nov. 24.\nSaid coach John Fox: \u201cI think I\u2019m going to enjoy this one first.\nRegardless of what happened last time, if we don\u2019t bring our A game we\u2019re going to lose.\u201dMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or Twitter: @MikeChambers"}
