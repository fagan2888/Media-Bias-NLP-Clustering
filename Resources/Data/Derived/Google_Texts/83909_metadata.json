However, analysts say the pressure for cuts is growing especially as growth remains sub-par.\n\nCore inflation in January, for instance, was at 1.7 percent, the lowest since December 2014.\n\n(Additional reporting by Yeonsoo Kwak; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) - The South Korean government will unveil stimulus measures on Wednesd", "title": "South Korea to unveil stimulus steps as inflation, exports falter", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/01/South-Korea-unveil-stimulus-steps-inflation-exports-falter", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-fed-asia_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/01/South-Korea-unveil-stimulus-steps-inflation-exports-falter", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-fed-asia_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SEOUL (Reuters) - The South Korean government will unveil stimulus measures on Wednesd", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "SEOUL (Reuters) - The South Korean government will unveil stimulus measures on Wednesday as a collapse in exports and cooling inflation threaten a fragile economic recovery.\nAnalysts say the government stimulus measures will probably be aimed at job growth and not involve additional public spending.\nUnderscoring the minister's concerns, data released on the day showed South Korea's annual inflation rate cooled to its lowest in four months in January.\nsaid Park Seok-gil, economist at JP Morgan Chase and Co.\"It won't be easy for the government to take big steps right now.\"\nCore inflation in January, for instance, was at 1.7 percent, the lowest since December 2014."}
