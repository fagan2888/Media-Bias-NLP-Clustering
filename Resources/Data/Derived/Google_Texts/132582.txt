Silently, the makeshift lanterns rose into the sky Friday night above Lake Loveland to mark a life ended too soon.

In the neighborhoods around the lake, residents pulled over to take pictures of the glowing beacons and unknowingly take part in a memorial for a former Loveland resident who died one week ago.

Brandon Perez, 23, died on March 22 when he reportedly lost control of his vehicle on U.S. 34 near Corning, Iowa, about 40 miles southeast of Omaha, Neb. Also in the car were 30-year-old Hilary Knox and a 3-year-old child.

Perez was born in Loveland on Feb. 16, 1992, and lived in the city through his school years, according to friends who gathered Friday night at the shelter near the North Lake Park boat ramp. Before the crash, he was living in Fort Madison, Iowa, with his maternal grandparents, Merlin "Rusty" and Dollie Boyd of Fort Madison.

A funeral service for Perez was Saturday in Iowa â€” too far for those who gathered to travel.

Priscilla Cordova and Ashley May, among those who helped remember Brandon, said they were there with his school friends to make the event special.
