But have no fear. Japanese scientists have developed an ideal way to hold and eat a hamburger, and shared it so that you don\u2019t have to be in the dark anymore.\n\nAccording to Kotaku.com, three expert researchers in fluid mechanics, engineering, and dentistry have determined the best way to indulge in a large hamburger. They spent four months formulating the best technique. Their research showed that most people eat burgers with their thumbs on the bottom and the rest of their fingers on top, which forces all of the contents out and makes for a pretty messy ordeal.\n\nBut if you eat a burger with your thumbs and pinky fingers on the bottom for balance, and your three middle fingers at the top, it divides the burger evenly and makes for less spillage. It\u2019s science! Though, Kotaku notes, you won\u2019t be able to eat fries at the same time.
