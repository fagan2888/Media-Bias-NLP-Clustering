GLENDALE, ARIZ. — Pro Bowls creates memories for players. Super Bowls leave legacies. But Von Miller’s effort Sunday provided another encouraging sign that his career continues to trend upward. Miller didn’t expect to play in the game, figuring that the Broncos would be in the title game.

However, he made good on his promise earlier in the week to bring intensity. He finished with a game-high eight tackles.

“He was seeking out there. I mean seeking,” said Baltimore’s Elvis Dumervil said of his former teammate. “There’s a reason he’s in this game. He’s a great player.”

Miller arrived at his locker moments later and told Dumervil how “proud of him” he was after the Ravens’ star posted two sacks. Miller was surprised he didn’t match that total, saying “that was kind of how the end of my season went.”

The Broncos defense proved tough against the run, setting a franchise record for yards allowed per game. Still, Denver struggled to consistently cause havoc and create turnovers. If Miller builds on this past season, when he had 14 sacks, it could be the catalyst.

“He was full go tonight. I think I saw him lift a guy off his feet. We all know what kind of player he is,” cornerback Aqib Talib said.
