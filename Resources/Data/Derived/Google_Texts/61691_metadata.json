Owner Ralph Demicco was behind the counter. He noticed she didn\u2019t make eye contact.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to buy a gun,\u201d she said. \u201cCould I see that one?\u201d\n\nDemicco sensed something was amiss. \u201cShould you really be buying a gun?\u201d he asked.\n\nShe immediately broke into tears. \u201cI took her into the backroom,\u201d Demicco recalls. \u201cShe confided that she\u2019d been released from the state mental hospital in Concord that morning. She said she told her doctor she wasn\u2019t ready to go and if he discharged her she was going to take her life. Apparently he didn\u2019t put any stock in that.\u201d\n\nDemicco asked the name of her psychiatrist, then told her to go home and wait for the doctor to call. Then he called the doctor, who intervened. It was a suicide that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe incident stuck with Demicco. But it wasn\u2019t until later that he realized that gun dealers could take more concerted action to prevent gun suicides \u2014 by far the nation\u2019s leading cause of firearm fatalities. That came after a Dartmouth Medical School injury prevention researcher alerted him that three different customers had killed themselves in a single week within hours or days of buying their guns at Riley\u2019s.\n\nThe partnership is a rare instance of common cause between gun enthusiasts and public health proponents, amid increasingly polarized public views.\n\n\u201cThat was stunning,\u201d Demicco says. He started meeting with the Dartmouth researcher and other gun retailers and health workers. They decided to create a group called the New Hampshire Firearms Safety Coalition. Their idea is catching on \u2014 in Massachusetts, Vermont, Maryland, New York, Virginia, Tennessee, Texas, Colorado, Utah, Nevada and California, according to Elaine Frank, chair of the New Hampshire coalition.\n\nFrank is the Dartmouth injury-prevention specialist who alerted Demicco to the problem. Early on in the coalition\u2019s work, a public health worker came to a meeting after talking to gun shop owners around the state. She expressed surprise they were so positive.\n\nOne of the gun dealers in the group said, \u201cI could be insulted by that,\u201d Frank recalls. \u201cHe said, \u2018Why would you think we\u2019d be less interested in suicide prevention than you are?\u2019 It was absolutely an \u2018aha!\u2019 moment.\u201d\n\nThe partnership is a rare instance of common cause between gun enthusiasts and public health proponents, amid increasingly polarized public views on how to reduce the nation\u2019s death toll from firearms. It\u2019s not embraced by all gun proponents; some fear it\u2019s a stalking horse for more gun controls.\n\nBut it\u2019s a real-life example of what President Obama and others are calling for: a public health approach to the nation\u2019s gun violence crisis.\n\n\u201cThe concept of collaboration, which is often lost, is very much alive in this area of suicide prevention,\u201d says Bill Brassard, spokesman for the National Sport Shooting Foundation, which represents gun dealers.\n\nA prominent gun control advocate at the Harvard H.T. Chan School of Public Health agrees. \u201cWhat you want to do are the things that are easiest to do \u2014 the low-hanging fruit \u2014 and show we can work together,\u201d says David Hemenway, author of \u201cPrivate Guns, Public Health.\u201d \u201cIt takes a long time to build trust. But this is happening.\u201d\n\nThe payoff could be large \u2014 potentially bigger than gun control measures proposed to stem homicides.\n\nNearly twice as many Americans kill themselves with guns \u2014 more than 21,000 in 2014 \u2014 than are murdered with firearms \u2014 a little over 11,000. Another 1,300 gun deaths are accidental.\n\nLooking at it another way, on an average day guns are involved in 58 suicides, compared with 32 homicides.\n\nBut how much can gun dealers reduce suicide deaths? Harvard\u2019s Hemenway admits there\u2019s no solid evidence yet on how effective these relatively new programs are. But lots of research backs them up, and suicide specialists say there\u2019s good reason to think point-of-sale prevention at gun shops can make a meaningful dent.\n\nFirst, research on suicide shows that the the way someone chooses to end his or her life, the means of suicide, is crucial. This is a departure from previous thinking, which focused on the suicidal person\u2019s intent \u2014 the often-complex and hidden risk factors that lead a person to a life-ending decision. As Harvard researchers put it, \u201cmeans matter\u201d \u2014 the name of a website they\u2019ve created to get the word out.\n\nFor instance, when Britain eliminated nearly all the carbon monoxide from domestic cooking gas after 1958, suicides plummeted \u2014 it was no longer easy to die by closing the windows and turning on the stove. Similarly, Sri Lanka had a big drop in suicides when a particularly toxic pesticide became hard-to-get. In Israel, suicides among soldiers dropped 40 percent after the Israeli Defense Forces banned them from taking their guns home on weekends.\n\nBy the same logic, suicide-by-gun is a glaringly obvious prevention target. It\u2019s by far the most lethal means of suicide; up to 90 percent of attempts succeed. By comparison, deliberate drug overdoses succeed less than 3 percent of the time. Even hanging results in death less often, around 70 percent of the time, because people sometimes manage to loosen the noose if they have sudden second thoughts, and most of those who do survive.\n\nResearch also shows that only 10 to 15 percent of suicidal people are implacably determined to end their lives. \u201cMost suicidal people are actually hoping you will stop them,\u201d says University of Washington psychologist Paul Quinnett in a training video for gun dealers. \u201cThey\u2019re ambivalent.\u201d\n\nMost suicides, moreover, are not long-planned. One in 4 people between 13 and 34 years old who attempt suicide do it within five minutes of making the decision. Experts say many act within hours or days, not weeks or months.\n\nAnother important finding: Among those whose suicide attempt is thwarted, the great majority \u2014 9 out of 10 \u2014 will not kill themselves later.\n\nAll this means that putting time and distance between a suicidal person and the means to end life \u2014 especially a gun, the most lethal means \u2014 can achieve a permanent \u201csave.\u201d\n\nBut how is a gun shop clerk supposed to know if a customer is contemplating suicide?\n\n\u201cMost suicidal people send warning signs,\u201d Quinnett says. \u201cThey communicate with someone about their desire, plan or intent to die.\u201d\n\nSome cues are behavioral \u2014 lack of eye contact, appearing distraught or nervous. Some are verbal asides \u2014 statements like, \u201cCan I buy just one bullet?\u201d Or \u201cThis will take care of the alimony payment.\u201d\n\nBut Demicco, the now-retired New Hampshire gunshop owner, says a customer\u2019s response to a few practical questions, of the type gunshop owners routinely ask, can be flashing neon signs.\n\n\u201cYou have to ask: What are you going to use this for? Do you have experience with guns? Do you need a cleaning kit?\u201d Demicco says. \u201cWe\u2019re not acting as psychiatrists. But you can often tell people who may not be thinking clearly or thinking of taking their life. And at the end of the day, I don\u2019t have to go home with regrets \u2014 \u2018Gee, I wish I hadn\u2019t sold that person a gun.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDemicco acknowledges a retailer\u2019s intuition isn\u2019t foolproof. \u201cThere are some you can catch and some you simply cannot,\u201d he says.\n\nMany gun retailers have embraced their role in suicide prevention \u2014 either by spotting possible suicide risks in their shops or by educating regular customers to be alert to danger signs among their friends and families and to consider temporarily removing gun access from a troubled person.\n\nRegina Schneider owns gun shops with her husband Steve, who is president of the Maryland Licensed Firearms Dealers Association. She also does volunteer work in mental health crisis intervention.\n\nShe says Maryland gun dealers have been very receptive to suicide-prevention efforts. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any opposition at all from the people I\u2019ve talked to,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are very concerned about this problem. We do not want to sell a firearm to someone who shouldn\u2019t have one.\u201d\n\nBut it would be a mistake to think everybody in the gun business is on board.\n\nIn New Hampshire, for instance, half the state\u2019s 70 or so gun retailers participate in the New Hampshire Firearm Safety Coalition; but half don\u2019t. Demicco says that\u2019s because \u201ca pro-firearms attorney got wind of this effort and went around to shops and said, \u2018Don\u2019t subscribe to this, it\u2019s a subterfuge, it\u2019s just a gun control scheme.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cBut we don\u2019t see this as being perverted in that fashion,\u201d Demicco adds. \u201cWe won\u2019t let it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s opposition \u2014 or at least strong skepticism \u2014 on the national level too. One gun lobbyist, who did not want to discuss suicide on the record, said the industry is \u201cuncomfortable with putting the retailer in the position of being a gatekeeper and determining if the person on the other side of the counter is a suicide risk or not.\u201d\n\nAnother industry worry, as the gun advocate put it, is that public health arguments about suicide prevention are part of \u201can attempt to demonize guns and the gun industry.\u201d\n\nHarvard\u2019s Hemenway has heard this before.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been great opposition to all the successes in public health,\u201d he says. \u201cVaccinations. Anti-smoking efforts. Seat belts and airbags. Water fluoridation. All public health successes take much longer than you hope. But being in public health, you\u2019ve got to be optimistic.\u201d\n\nRelated:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Specialists say there's good reason to think point-of-sale prevention at gun shops can make a meaningful dent in curbing suicides.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Specialists say there's good reason to think point-of-sale prevention at gun shops can make a meaningful dent in curbing suicides.", "title": "Rare Common Ground: Gun Dealers And Public Health Workers Unite To Cut Suicides", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2016/01/gun-dealers-health-workers-collaborate-suicide", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2016/01/nhfsc-620x447.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2016/01/gun-dealers-health-workers-collaborate-suicide", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2016/01/nhfsc-620x447.png", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Rare Common Ground: Gun Dealers And Public Health Workers Unite To Cut Suicides"}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-15", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Fri, 15 Jan 2016 16:12:31 -0500"}, "article_summary": "Rare Common Ground: Gun Dealers And Public Health Workers Unite To Cut SuicidesBy Richard KnoxThe elegantly dressed woman looked out of place at Riley\u2019s Sport Shop, the largest gun dealer in New Hampshire.\nThe partnership is a rare instance of common cause between gun enthusiasts and public health proponents, amid increasingly polarized public views.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until later that he realized that gun dealers could take more concerted action to prevent gun suicides \u2014 by far the nation\u2019s leading cause of firearm fatalities.\nOne of the gun dealers in the group said, \u201cI could be insulted by that,\u201d Frank recalls.\n\u201cMost suicidal people are actually hoping you will stop them,\u201d says University of Washington psychologist Paul Quinnett in a training video for gun dealers."}
