America faces serious challenges. An anemic job market, with low-income Americans most affected. Escalating violence in urban areas, with black men bearing the brunt of it. Declining education performance, with inner-city youth most disadvantaged. Exploding costs and declining quality of health care.

What is most remarkable is their persistence over many decades, despite massive government spending and new regulations. Is it time for a revolution? No. We don’t need the “flush America down the toilet” proposals sold by President Obama in 2008 and now peddled by the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential candidates. We just need to apply Problem Solving 101: “When fixing something, the crucial first step is to understand the problem, determine its root cause.”

Candidates skip this first step when they propose to address youth unemployment, not by reducing the costly government mandates that discourage businesses from hiring but instead by imposing new rules and costs — higher minimum wage, more taxes, Obamacare, etc.

Obamacare proponents skipped this step when, instead of fixing the real problem — exploding costs and declining quality of health care, they rammed through an oppressive law aimed at extending (by force) health care coverage to those without. There may now be more people carrying insurance cards, but the real problem continues unabated.

America’s problems do not require an abandonment or “fundamental transformation” of our core free market principles. We just need to stop fixating on symptoms and address the root cause: an overbearing government.
