But in this case there is nothing to buy - no tapes, no app, no religious agenda sprung on you at the last moment when you're feeling vulnerable and spiritually open. No hidden fees.\n\nBut that doesn't mean there isn't a catch. You have to be willing to revert to a Paleolithic pattern of sleep - and that means turning off your electric lights at dusk and leaving them off until dawn. Do that, and in about three weeks' time, beginning about six hours after sunset each evening, you will find yourself experiencing a period of serene wakefulness that was once a nightly meditation retreat for all Homo sapiens on Earth. It's encoded in your genes.\n\nDuring the 1990s, sleep researcher Thomas Wehr of the US National Institute of Mental Health conducted an experiment that he later called an exercise in \"archaeology, or human paleobiology.\" Wehr wanted to find out if modern humans still carried within them the rhythms of a prehistoric mode of sleep. Did prehistoric humans sleep more? Did they sleep differently - or perhaps better?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWehr's logic was simple: Aided by the stimulating effects of all kinds of artificial light (from laptop screens to the bright lights of big cities), modern humans had compressed their sleep nights, like their workdays, into convenient eight-hour blocks. Yet given that light-assisted wakefulness was a relatively new invention, wasn't it possible that human beings still had in their DNA the remnants of a more primordial pattern of sleep?\n\nThe results of the experiment were staggering. For one month, beginning at dusk and ending at dawn, Wehr's subjects were removed from every possible form of artificial light. During the first three weeks, they slept as usual, only about an hour longer. (Wehr reasoned that, like most Americans, they were probably sleep-deprived.) But at week four, a dramatic change occurred. They began each night with about four hours of deep sleep, woke for two hours of quiet rest, then slept for another four.\n\nDuring the gap between their \"first\" and \"second\" sleep, Wehr's subjects were neither fully awake nor fully asleep. Rather, they experienced a condition they had never known before - a state of consciousness all its own. Later, Wehr would compare it to what advanced practitioners experience in meditation - what you might call \"mindfulness\" today. But there weren't any mindfulness practitioners in his study. They were simply ordinary people who, removed for one month from artificial lighting, found their nights broken in two.\n\nWhile trying to account for the serenity that his subjects reported feeling during their hours of \"quiet rest,\" Wehr discovered that prolactin (the hormone that rises in nursing mothers when their milk lets down) reached elevated levels in their bodies shortly after dusk and remained at twice the normal waking level the full length of the night. Prolactin creates a feeling of security, quietness and peace. And it is intimately, and biologically, tied to the dark.\n\nEven during those hours of quiet rest, the prolactin levels in Wehr's subjects remained steady. Normally, if you wake in the night, those levels go down - even if you don't turn on the lights. But if you turn the lights off at dusk and keep them off, giving your body the full spectrum of the night to work from, that richer, deeper darkness will fashion an experience so different from your normal daylight consciousness, it is almost a mystical state.\n\nIt's difficult, of course, to unplug from a culture so hyper-lit that even phones emit light, without falling out of sync with the rest of the modern world. Still, over the years I've found that cutting back on just some of the lights in my house and turning in earlier help put me in touch with something deeper, truer and older than our culture. The sense of peace and inner satisfaction that comes from knowing your own heart - gaining a working knowledge of your own soul - is one thing in life that's easier to find in the dark.\n\nIt's a state in which the goal-driven consciousness that governs our daily lives is temporarily suspended. The mind becomes calm and still, almost supple, and at the same time strangely more alert. \"I sleep, but my heart is awake,\" says the lover in the Song of Songs. It isn't a spiritual metaphor - it describes an actual state of mind.\n\n\"This is a state not terribly familiar to modern sleepers,\" Wehr lamented when the study was done and he had begun to wrap his mind around the discovery, which turned our understanding of consciousness on its head. \"Perhaps what those who meditate today are seeking is a state that our ancestors would have considered their birthright, a nightly occurrence.\"\n\nDiscovering Wehr's study in the late '90s was a major revelation for me. Not only had I been waking up at 2am for most of my life, I had also been a Zen Buddhist monk and a meditation teacher. But I'd long since become impatient with Buddhism and had given up teaching it. I always felt there was something more basic than religion at the bottom of it all. Something simpler. More universal. More rooted in the Earth and its primal rhythms - like the rising and setting of the sun.\n\nWehr's study sent ripples through half a dozen disciplines. Sleep specialists began to wonder if the modern insomnia epidemic was anything of the kind. Historians doubled down on forgotten journals and parish records to verify that before the Industrial Revolution, \"divided sleep\" was not the exception but the rule. And I turned to ancient legends and scriptures to find that much, if not most, of what the world called myth and spiritual wisdom had been conceived of in the middle of the night.\n\n\"The Metamorphoses of Apuleius\" tells of Lucius, whose vision of the goddess Isis came to him \"when midnight came that I had slept my first sleep.\" According to the Talmud, David hung a harp above his bed so that when the night wind blew across its strings, it would wake him to sing the Psalms. Jesus rose to pray in the hours before dawn. Muhammad slept for half the night, awoke to pray for a third of the night and then slept for the remaining sixth. Even the Buddha meditated at night. According to the sutras, he became an \"awakened one\" between the hours of the ox and the tiger - in other words, between 2 and 4am.\n\nNone of which tells me I ought to pray or meditate or \"be religious,\" but rather that once, long ago, before our billion-watt culture got the best of us, there was an hour in the middle of the night when peace was there for the having - not as a result of many years of assiduous spiritual practice but as a nightly blessing that nobody had to work for. It's still there. It always has been. Finding it again is as simple - or as difficult - as turning out the lights.\n\nClark Strand is the author of Waking Up to the Dark: Ancient Wisdom for a Sleepless Age.\n\nThe Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Comment", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "What if you could meditate like a Tibetan lama with no instruction whatsoever - and without having to subscribe to any religious beliefs?", "title": "Want to sleep deeply like our ancestors did?
