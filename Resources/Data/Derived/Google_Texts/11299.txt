Panama City's local PFLAG organization held their annual "Gay the Hathaway" event Saturday morning.

Friends, family members, and supporters of the LGBT community gathered at 9am in front of Gulf Coast State College with flags and posters of supportive messages.

PFLAG Panama City helps people in our community of diverse sexual orientation with support, public education, and equality advocacy.

PFLAG President Susan Sizemore says, "I'm a proud straight ally and I think it's important for LGBT people and people who are supportive to come together for LGBT people."

According to the UCLA school of Law's Williams Institute, about 9 million Americans are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.

That's from a study that came out in 2011.
