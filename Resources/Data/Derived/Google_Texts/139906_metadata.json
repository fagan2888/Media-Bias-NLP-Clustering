The Housing Authority has 2,700 families and individual households on it's wait list.\n\n\"The reality is it puts a very small dent on our wait-list,\" Betters said. \"In terms of changing the dynamics of the affordable need in the community, it's not going to do that.\"\n\nBut, he said, it's important to keep in mind that every \"increment\" helps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDirector of Housing Moofie Miller said 10 of the units will be reserved for veterans who are transitioning from temporary housing into permanent housing. Referrals for these units will come from Rocky Mountain Human Services \u2014 funded through the Veterans Administration, other governmental agencies and private partners\u2014 whose staff members work with homeless veterans and provide services to them.\n\nMiller said the goal for the veterans' units in the project \u2014 where they'll have their own separate building \u2014 is for them to serve as a self-managed complex.\n\nThey'll have a community room where they can have group meetings and develop relationships with one another.\n\n\"It takes a veteran to understand a veteran,\" Miller said.\n\nThe Housing Authority plans to form partnerships for veterans' services for those who live in the complex \u2014 House of Neighborly Service provides emergency food and clothing; Habitat for Humanity offers budgeting and home care classes; and a potential partnership with Hearts and Horses would offer therapeutic riding. And, community members have already stepped up and offered donations. A volunteer program is also in the works.\n\n\"We've received a lot of interest from the community,\" Miller said. \"I'm excited that I really strongly believe that the community's going to embrace this and veterans are going to feel appreciated and supported.\"\n\nThe hope, Miller said, is the veterans will move from homelessness to transitional housing to more permanent housing, such as the Edge, to then even their own homes, such as those from Habitat for Humanity.\n\nThe 60 other homes will be considered workforce and flood victims housing (High Park fire victims can also apply), split into six different buildings.\n\nBetters said many flood and fire survivors either lost their homes or haven't been able to go back, and this housing development will go toward making Loveland more sustainable.\n\n\"We're really excited,\" Betters said. \"This is going to be the first family project for quite some time.\"\n\nRental rates will be based on income. Section 8 vouchers are accepted.
