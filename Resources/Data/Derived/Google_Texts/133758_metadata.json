Several area churches and volunteer groups provide meals, snacks, and warm clothing such as socks, coats, hats, and gloves.\n\n\u201cSince so many local agencies are closed on Sunday we have decided to keep the shelters open all day because exposure during this extreme cold could be fatal,\u201d Corriston said.\n\nThe men\u2019s shelter is located at 841 North Market in the Inter-Faith Spiritual Center. The women\u2019s shelter is at 841 North Broadway, the site of the Ti\u2019 Wiconi Safe Haven.\n\nCorriston said that from November 1 through December 31, 2013 the shelter provided 5,101 bed nights for men and women.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "In anticipation of bitterly cold temperatures this weekend, two Wichita shelters are keeping their doors open a little longer for people who have nowhere else to go.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"description": "In anticipation of bitterly cold temperatures this weekend, two Wichita shelters are keeping their doors open a little longer for people who have nowhere else to go.", "title": "Wichita homeless shelters to stay open Sunday because of bitter cold", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-homeless-shelters-to-stay-open-Sunday-238716901.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/26C/FD1/26CFD1856C894035B229099280A4563A", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/ED7/32E/ED732EA580DF4E5180C5A1FE2468952A.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "In anticipation of bitterly cold temperatures this weekend, two Wichita shelters are keeping their doors open a little longer for people who have nowhere else to go.", "title": "Wichita homeless shelters to stay open Sunday because of bitter cold", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-homeless-shelters-to-stay-open-Sunday-238716901.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/inter-faith+ministries.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Wichita homeless shelters to stay open Sunday because of bitter cold", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Wichita homeless shelters to stay, open Sunday because of bitter"}, "article_summary": "The Inter-Faith Ministries Warming Souls Winter Shelters for the homeless will remain open all day on Sunday because of a bitterly cold weather forecast, said Executive Director Anne Corriston.\nIn anticipation of bitterly cold temperatures this weekend, two Wichita shelters are keeping their doors open a little longer for people who have nowhere else to go.\n\u201cTypically the winter shelter operates only at night, closing around 7:00 each morning,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSince so many local agencies are closed on Sunday we have decided to keep the shelters open all day because exposure during this extreme cold could be fatal,\u201d Corriston said.\nThe shelters are open from November 1 through March 31 each year."}
