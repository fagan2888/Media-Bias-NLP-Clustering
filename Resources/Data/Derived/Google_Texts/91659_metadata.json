I just have to say it: I fell in love with a Republican.\n\nBelieve me, it gets worse.\n\nI don\u2019t mean he votes Republican, I mean he\u2019s in it up to his eyeballs. The man I love personally called Henry Kissinger to tell him about Richard Nixon\u2019s funeral arrangements. He ran Orrin Hatch\u2019s bid for president and has worked for Rudolph Guiliani and even that poor, dumb bastard Rick Perry. His mother has a framed picture hanging in the house of her arm-in-arm with Robert Dole, autographed with a \u201cThanks Sharon! Bob.\u201d His father is pastor of an Evangelical church, a man who watches a defective television set built with only one channel. Fox News.\n\nFor someone like me, whose earliest memories are of a home with pictures of the pope and JFK hanging side by side on the wall, whose mother was known to say \u201cGod is not only Irish but a Democrat,\u201d who comes from a family of self-described \u201cBlue-bellied Yankees,\u201d falling for a West Virginia-bred Republican was like admitting I love Darth Vader.\n\nHow could this possibly happen, you ask?\n\nAt first it was the usual thing, sex.\n\nNo, don\u2019t puke. Get that image of a bellicose, rotund Rush Limbaugh out of your head. Banish thoughts of the pasty Karl Rove and forget entirely that cretin from Missouri who talked about \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d\n\nI first saw a picture of the man I love on an Internet dating site. Why was I there? I\u2019d dated the actor-screenwriter-dancer-musician-producer narcissists on the west side of Los Angeles to disastrous effects for far too long. If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, then I was determined to get sane. And sane looked to me like trying Match.com. (I know, I know. Don\u2019t look too hard at that last sentence.)\n\nI hadn\u2019t been on there for more than a month when I opened my inbox and saw a wink from a guy named Jimmy. I took one look at the tattooed arms, the flinty, Steve McQueen-like stare, the sardonic twist of his smile, and somehow I knew that he would smell of hickory smoke and Old Spice, and that the scruff of his 5 o\u2019clock shadow would sometimes rub a rash on my pale skin.\n\nI yelled over my shoulder, \u201cMom, check this one out! I think this guy\u2019s looking for me.\u201d\n\nMom, out visiting from her retirement in New Mexico, ambled up to assess the candidate on the screen. One eyebrow went up.\n\n\u201cYum, yum,\u201d came her verdict. Then she added, \u201cBut he\u2019s probably a Republican.\u201d\n\nComing from her that was like saying the man beats his dog when he\u2019s not in prison. During what we termed \u201cthe terrible years,\u201d Mom had forsaken most major news outlets for fear of coming across the latest pronouncements from George W. (Bad for her blood pressure, you understand.)\n\nMy response was ha-fucking-ha, very funny Mother, why do you always have to find fault with every guy in the world? Or words to that effect.\n\nYou know already the joke was on me. Four months later, I found myself seated at a swanky fundraiser for the California Republican Party, deep in the red heart of Orange County. The tattooed bad boy named Jimmy was indeed a Republican. Not merely a Republican, but a well-established campaign manager and political consultant for the GOP. Relative to my politics, not only had I fallen in love with Darth Vader, I was now dining aboard the Death Star.\n\nAfter the speech from then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger but before conservative radio talk-show host Dennis Prager took the mic, I slipped outside with Jimmy so I could get a breath of fresh air and stop biting my tongue. He, meanwhile, was jonesing for a cancer stick.\n\nJimmy had forgotten matches, so he bummed a light from a woman puffing on her Virginia Slim. The two had worked together on campaigns and fell into easy shop talk, but the woman\u2019s eyes narrowed as she began to dish about Schwarzenegger\u2019s chief of staff, who evidently leaned too far left to suit her.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I was raised by die-hard liberals, and my progressive friends did not approve.
