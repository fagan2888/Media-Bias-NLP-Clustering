WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) — A former Wilmington resident vacationing in Paris is safe.

Rachel Colonna and her husband are currently vacationing in the city where 129 people were killed and hundreds more injured in a terrorist attack last night.

Colonna says they were fortunate enough to be indoors for the night, when they heard the news of the attack.

“The streets were filled with noises of sirens and what sounded like bombings or slamming of car doors. You couldn’t tell the difference,” Colonna said.

She said they spent the remainder of the night indoors, with the lights out after a mandatory curfew was placed on the city. Their apartment is about one mile from the Bataclan Concert Hall where terrorists held 100 hostages.

Colonna said they briefly ventured outdoors today, but most businesses were closed, and the streets were empty.

“There’s not a sense of liveliness in the streets, and it’s a little barren for a Saturday,” she said.

On Monday, the couple plans to continue their vacation, traveling to London by train and they anticipate a “heightened level of security.”

“Here in Europe they’re not used to this, people don’t have licenses to carry guns, so this is extremely outside of their norm,” Colonna said.

Colonna added that people in the city are making an effort to stay positive through the situation.
