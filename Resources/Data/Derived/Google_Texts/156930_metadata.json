But these chats nevertheless touch on an important point about Republican politics: being discredited is not a barrier to success.\n\nTake Stephen Moore, for example, the Heritage Foundation\u2019s chief economist. Earlier this year, after Moore published a bizarre piece criticizing the Affordable Care Act, Paul Krugman described the conservative as \u201ca guy who has a troubled relationship with facts.\u201d\n\nKrugman added at the time, \u201cI don\u2019t mean that he\u2019s a slick dissembler; I mean that [Moore] seems more or less unable to publish an article without filling it with howlers \u2026 in a way that ends up doing his cause a disservice.\u201d\n\nLaffer\u2019s reputation is in far worse shape. As regular readers may recall , Laffer rose to GOP prominence in the 1980s pushing the celebrated-but-wrong idea that tax cuts can pay for themselves.\n\nMore recently, he served as the architect of Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback\u2019s (R) failed right-wing economic experiment, which destroyed state finances and did little to improve the state\u2019s economy. Asked for an explanation, Laffer recently boasted, \u201cKansas is doing fine.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s only true if one overlooks literally every relevant detail\n\nA few months ago, Krugman added some helpful context to Laffer\u2019s record. Since the 1970s there have been four big changes in the effective tax rate on the top 1 percent: the Reagan cut, the Clinton hike, the Bush cut, and the Obama hike. Republicans are fixated on the boom that followed the 1981 tax cut (which had much more to do with monetary policy, but never mind). But they predicted dire effects from the Clinton hike; instead we had a boom that eclipsed Reagan\u2019s. They predicted wonderful things from the Bush tax cuts; instead we got an unimpressive expansion followed by a devastating crash. And they predicted terrible things from the tax rise after Obama\u2019s reelection; instead we got the best job growth since 1999. And when I say \u201cthey predicted\u201d, I especially mean Laffer himself, who has a truly extraordinary record of being wrong at crucial turning points. As Bruce Bartlett pointed out a few years ago, Laffer was even wrong during the Reagan years: he predicted that the Reagan tax hikes of 1982, which partially reversed earlier cuts, would cripple the economy; \u201cmorning in America\u201d promptly followed. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget his 2009 warnings about soaring interest rates and inflation.\n\nIt\u2019s against this backdrop that Rand Paul and John Kasich sought out Laffer for economic guidance. It\u2019s a bit like taking advice on national security from Dick Cheney, which Republicans also keep doing.\n\nPolitics really isn\u2019t supposed to work this way.
