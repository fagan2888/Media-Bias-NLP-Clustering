NEW YORK (MainStreet) – There's a way to potentially lower your car insurance costs, but it involves letting an insurer put a monitor in your car. Not surprisingly, U.S. drivers are skeptical.

In fact, a majority (51%) say they would never join a pay-as-you-drive insurance program, according to a report from InsuranceQuotes.com. That reluctance isn't exactly dissipating as the option becomes more widely available, either. Just last year, only 37% were dead-set against pay-as-you-drive insurance last year.

Still a relatively new offering in most states, this form of insurance tracks driving behavior through a small sensor installed in a car or through an existing on-board communications system. That sensor feeds certain information back to the insurance company. It has drivers already feeling watched by in-car tracking and payment technology increasingly fearful, though folks within the insurance industry say those fears are just a bit overstated — especially since there can't be any negative repercussions to the pay-as-you-drive program.

“Insurers are not allowed to use the information to raise rates,” SAYS Laura Adams, a senior analyst at insuranceQuotes.com. “Many carriers give a premium discount in exchange for signing up for a pay-as-you-drive program and subsequently raise or lower the discount according to a driver’s mileage and performance.”

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners predicts that 20% of all U.S. auto insurance companies will incorporate some form of pay-as-you-drive program within the next five years. Insurers can use a vehicle's telecommunications and information telematics system, smartphone apps or even existing technology such as' OnStar to record driver behavior data regarding driver behavior and help set discounts that range between 10% and 30% off the annual premium.
