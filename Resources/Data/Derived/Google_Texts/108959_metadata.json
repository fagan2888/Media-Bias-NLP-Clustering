He\u2019s currently a doctoral candidate in LSU\u2019s College of Engineering. He designs and builds his own drones. He thinks they can prevent mosquito-borne illnesses, like malaria and West Nile virus. He expects his dissertation will involve creating a two-drone system: one to map standing water and mosquito-breeding areas; the other, guided by GPS and armed with 20 pounds of larvicide, to spray the trouble spots.\n\nEast Baton Rouge Parish will serve as the demonstration site. Malveaux, the LSU AgCenter and the city-parish are hammering out the details of the agreement.\n\nMeanwhile, Malveaux\u2019s already working to patent the concept. He plans to mass-produce the drones in China. He\u2019s got an advantage there because he already speaks Chinese \u2014 Mandarin, to be specific. Malveaux studied the language in Taiwan because he wanted to get the accent right.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I had a gift for learning languages fast until I went to China. \u2026 Within a week and a half, I was at the store buying a cellphone, speaking Chinese,\u201d Malveaux said.\n\nWithin three weeks, Malveaux had snagged a gig as an interpreter for an American-born Chinese girl who was vacationing in Taipei.\n\nThat might be the classic Malveaux anecdote. It\u2019s the kind of adventure that results from a certain mind-set, one that might be summarized as follows:\n\nStep 1 : Start with an idea, one most people would say is impossible or at best impractical.\n\nStep 2 : Disregard those people.\n\nStep 3 : End up exactly where you are supposed to be.\n\nFor example, somewhere around the time Malveaux was studying Chinese, he decided it would be fun to get a pilot\u2019s license. And not long after that, he began his drone research. Now, the former may help him commercialize the latter.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s proposed drone regulations would require commercial operators to hold a pilot\u2019s license. Malveaux is the co-owner of Atmosphere Aerial, a drone cinematography and photography company. If the regulations went into effect today, Malveaux would be one of the few, if not the only, people in Louisiana who could legally operate a commercial drone.\n\nHowever, the Malveaux method has a few drawbacks. Among other things, it doesn\u2019t produce a linear career path.\n\nMalveaux\u2019s first real job was as a deputy. He liked helping people, but something was missing. He had always liked engineering and thought about pursuing it at McNeese State University. But he was working full-time in the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office. Sociology was easier and quicker, and it made sense from a law enforcement standpoint. The more Malveaux understood why people behaved the way they did, the better he could help them.\n\nStill, engineering\u2019s allure never faded. Malveaux believed he could help more people in that field. He decided to get a master\u2019s in engineering from LSU.\n\nIt took Malveaux a while to get there, with a number of side trips along the way. When the mini-motorcycle craze hit, Malveaux saw an opportunity to make some money importing the bikes from China. But the smallest lot of bikes he could buy was a container load. He didn\u2019t have that kind of money, so he convinced a colleague to loan him the cash. He then spent months knocking on doors and beating the bushes to find buyers. Eventually, he sold all the bikes. While in grad school, Malveaux also worked weekends for a law firm, putting his law enforcement experience to use interviewing clients.\n\nSteven Hall, an AgCenter associate professor and Malveaux\u2019s co-adviser, has been at the AgCenter for 15 years. In that time, he has taught about 100 doctoral students.\n\n\u201cWe have had one sociologist and one psychologist, and, frankly, I didn\u2019t think either one of them were going to make it in engineering,\u201d Hall said. \u201cBoth of them did. But both of them were very unusual people.\u201d\n\nMalveaux started out as a kind of wannabe engineer with some technical ability. But Malveaux\u2019s undergraduate degree was devoid of engineering courses. LSU fixed that.\n\n\u201cWe basically put him through all the hardest undergraduate courses. He took statics and dynamics and thermodynamics and heat transfer, fluid dynamics, all kinds of horrible stuff,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAnd he did fine. He\u2019s got a 3.9 GPA in his graduate coursework. He\u2019s brilliant. \u2026 He\u2019s the real deal.\u201d\n\nNow the question becomes, what will Malveaux do with all of his abilities?\n\nMalveaux hopes to change the planet.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, mosquito-borne diseases kill several million people each year and sicken hundreds of millions. About 40 percent of Earth\u2019s population is at risk for malaria. Mosquitoes also spread dengue fever, yellow fever and West Nile virus. Malveaux believes his drone system could provide a low-cost solution. He\u2019s about to find out.\n\nLast year, the city-parish paid $4,000 to hire a plane to treat a 10,000-acre area, said Todd Walker, director for East Baton Rouge Mosquito Abatement and Rodent Control. The planes flew six days a week from June to September.\n\nThe problem is that the city-parish\u2019s spraying program mainly targets adult mosquitoes. Trucks and planes can\u2019t really get to the ditches, bayous and channels hidden behind houses or concealed by what one survey described as the second-densest tree canopy among U.S. cities.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve kind of already lost the battle if you\u2019re treating the adults,\u201d Walker said.\n\nThe drones may be able to change that, putting larvicide in the standing water where mosquitoes breed. The city-parish is discussing the details with Malveaux and the AgCenter. So far, mosquito control has agreed to provide $30,000 in funding. Part of the money would pay to prove the concept. Part of the grant would buy the city-parish a working, sprayer-equipped drone, one that could be loaded on the back of a pickup.\n\nMalveaux is thinking bigger.\n\nHe envisions an automated system with two drones stationed in a bunker. One drone would make a daylight flight to survey the area and send that data to an analyst, who would select the areas for spraying. At 2 a.m. the bunker would reopen, and a second drone would emerge to spray the selected areas. After their flights, the drones would return to the bunker and recharge.\n\nThe bunker system could cost as much as $1 million, but each bunker could service several blocks, Malveaux said. The drones could also reduce the amount of chemicals sprayed because they could precisely deliver the larvicide.\n\nMalveaux wants to build the system as his doctoral dissertation.\n\nRandy Price, an AgCenter assistant professor and a co-adviser for Malveaux, said technically Malveaux can\u2019t build a drone, or unmanned aerial vehicle, as his dissertation. The degree is awarded for an in-depth experiment on one subject.\n\n\u201cBuuuuut he\u2019s come out with some pretty creative things. \u2026 I\u2019m almost ready to tell him, \u2018You know, maybe you should just do that for your PhD,\u2019\u201d Price said.\n\nMalveaux has some new and novel ways to configure the drones, designs that allow the devices to fly farther and longer and carry more weight. Those things could help a lot of people.\n\nPrice bursts out laughing when trying to describe those designs. He quickly adds he can\u2019t discuss the details because Malveaux may be able to patent some of his work.\n\nMalveaux\u2019s problem is he has so many good ideas that it\u2019s difficult for him to pick one for his doctorate degree, Price said.\n\nHis dissertation is likely to involve remote sensing. The drones he has developed use specialized cameras in light wavelengths undetectable to the human eye. The research may include crop monitoring and mosquito control. Malveaux has talked one firm into lending him a short-wave infrared camera, a rather pricey piece of equipment, for one season.\n\n\u201cWe may find out it\u2019s not useful. We may find something interesting,\u201d Price said.\n\nEither way, acquiring the camera demonstrates Malveaux\u2019s tenacity.\n\nHe will need it to make some of his other ideas \u2014 he had a lot of them \u2014 a reality.\n\nOne of Malveaux\u2019s dreams is to establish a robotics institute at LSU. His plan is to tie all of the robotics-use elements together, from crop management and coastal studies to oil-slick monitoring and coastal restoration. He has incorporated a business to do just that, the Environmental Robotics Institute. Last year, Malveaux\u2019s startup won a $2,000 prize in the LSU Student Incubator\u2019s Venture Challenge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting vision, and we\u2019re all for that,\u201d Price said. \u201cHe just needs to get in the position where he can make that happen a little bit better.\u201d\n\nHall wouldn\u2019t bet against Malveaux.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just this sort of guy that you tell him he can\u2019t do it, and he\u2019ll show you he can,\u201d Hall said.\n\nAs usual, Malveaux is unfazed by the obstacles. He doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to get there; he just knows he will.\n\n\u201cLife\u2019s a journey, not a destination. That\u2019s for sure,\u201d Malveaux said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baton Rouge, LA /News/Business/: Sheriff\u2019s deputy, sociologist, pilot, used car dealer, importer, entrepreneur, engineer, researcher, linguist, dreamer.
