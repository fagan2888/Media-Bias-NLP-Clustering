He speaks at the National Association of Business Economics on financial stability and monetary policy.\n\nMost central bankers want to separate the two. Former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has argued that the Fed\u2019s low interest rates didn\u2019t cause the last housing bubble and financial crisis, and if a new bubble emerges, interest rates shouldn\u2019t be used to pop it. The first line of defense against a financial boom is macro prudential tools \u2014 regulations designed to address the problem with precision \u2014 and not higher rates which would hurt the whole economy.\n\nThere are three challenges to this line of thinking.\n\nFirst, as former Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig told us Monday, it\u2019s not clear Mr. Bernanke is right about rates and the last housing boom. \u201cRates that are held too low for too long, as was done between 2002 and 2006, risks inflation and asset bubbles,\u201d he said. If monetary policy is a cause of asset bubbles, it can\u2019t so easily be dismissed as the necessary tool for prevention.\n\nSecond, central bankers are putting an awful lot of faith in macro prudential tools that don\u2019t have a perfect track record. Ask Stanley Fischer, the White House nominee for the Fed\u2019s number two spot. As the governor of the Bank of Israel, he fought an ongoing battle against booming home prices using macro prudential tools, such as imposing restraints on loan to value rations on homes. The efforts had mixed effects. Home prices kept running higher. See the chart in this presentation he gave to the IMF last year. http://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2013/macro2/pdf/sf.pdf\n\nThird, there is the Jeremy Stein argument. In some cases monetary policy \u2014 i.e. higher interest rates \u2014 might be the preferable tool for addressing bubbles and threats to financial stability. That\u2019s because monetary policy finds problems that regulators can\u2019t. Regulators didn\u2019t see problems brewing in collateralized debt obligations back by residential mortgage-backed securities in 2006. But higher rates might have slowed their issuance. As Mr. Stein, a Fed governor, said last year, \u201cwhile monetary policy may not be quite the right tool for the job, it has one important advantage relative to supervision and regulation\u2013namely that it gets in all of the cracks.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s see where Mr. Tarullo comes down on these issues. It\u2019s an important Fed debate in an era of exceptionally low rates.\n\n- By Jon Hilsenrath\n\nMORNING MINUTES: KEY DEVELOPMENTS AROUND THE WORLD\n\nDudley Among Fed Winners in 2008, Geithner Among Losers in Fed Transcripts. The Federal Reserve\u2019s release of transcripts from its 2008 policy meetings provides a chance to size up who among central bank officials did well, and who didn\u2019t, in the heat of the crisis. Here\u2019s a subjective rundown from one Fed-watcher of the winners and losers who emerge from a review of 1,865 pages of documents. It\u2019s based on an unscientific sense of how accurately they assessed ongoing developments, how they responded, and also on personal style and how they interacted with others. http://on.wsj.com/1chtAoJ\n\n\n\nDallas Fed\u2019s Fisher Wants to Continue Taper. The Federal Reserve should continue reducing its monthly bond purchases in $10 billion increments this year, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher told Fox Business in an interview on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly what I am in favor of,\u201d he said. http://on.wsj.com/1fyNRuq\n\nBOE Rate Official Says Rate Hike Possible In Early 2015. Expectations of a rise in U.K. interest rates in the second quarter of next year are \u201cnot unreasonable,\u201d Bank of England policy maker Ian McCafferty said in an interview with Reuters published Tuesday. Mr. McCafferty also said a further appreciation of sterling could delay a first rate move. http://reut.rs/MqPBKI\n\n\n\nBOE\u2019S Carney Expresses Support for Yellen. Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney on Monday gave his support to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen as she leads the Fed in paring back its bond-buying program. http://on.wsj.com/1dqvjiEz\n\n\n\nEurope May Face Deflation Risk: Former ECB Chief Jean Claude-Trichet, former president of the European Central Bank, said Monday euro-zone policy makers should not rule out the risk of deflation given recent low inflation readings in the bloc. http://on.wsj.com/1chjxzM\n\nWhere Are the ECB Transcripts? Unlike the Fed, which releases full transcripts of its policy meetings with a five-year lag, the ECB keeps its deliberations under wraps for 30 years. This means under current rules that the public has to wait until about 2028 before the internal deliberations of its policy makers are made known. http://on.wsj.com/MVCj9Q\n\n\n\nIsrael\u2019s Central Bank Cuts Interest Rate. The Bank of Israel said it would reduce the key interest rate for March by 25 basis points to 0.75%, its first cut since September, citing slowing inflation, sluggish local growth and global uncertainty. http://on.wsj.com/1cKPDaG\n\nBOJ\u2019s Kuroda Renews Call for Fiscal Overhaul. Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda on Friday renewed his call for fiscal overhaul, saying \u201cvery critical problems\u201d could otherwise hit the economy, just as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe weighs whether to raise the sales tax again. http://bit.ly/1k5zmhP\n\nNo Simple Link Between GDP and BOJ Easing. Simplification of the central bank\u2019s communication approach doesn\u2019t mean Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has also simplified the policy-setting process to focus on just one set of data\u2013gross domestic product, people close to the central bank said. http://on.wsj.com/1foyk1B\n\n\n\nIndian Central Banker Comfortable With Fed Taper. Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan reiterated his call for the Fed to take into account the impact of its withdrawal of monetary stimulus on emerging economies, despite saying he was comfortable with the current pace of tapering. \u201cI actually welcome a measured pace of tapering. The only thing I have been calling for is that in the communication there should be some sensitivity to conditions in emerging markets,\u201d Rajan told CNBC. http://reut.rs/MqPmiL\n\nUkraine Names New Central Bank Head. Ukraine appoints a new central bank chief, Stepan Kubiv, a member of parliament with bank experience. http://reut.rs/1gxAoRr\n\nBrazil Likely to Raise Interest Rates. The Central Bank of Brazil meets Wednesday to determine the next step for the country\u2019s key rate, the Selic, which already stands at a towering 10.5%, one of the highest in the world. It\u2019s likely to go higher, but there\u2019s some debate about the extent of the increase. Out of 14 economists and analysts surveyed, four expect the central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee to raise the rate by 0.50 percentage point. But 10 expect the central bank to raise it by 0.25 percentage point, and perhaps hint at bringing the interest rate increases to an end. http://on.wsj.com/OuLn6Q\n\nFed\u2019s Taper Has Caused \u2018Panicky\u2019 Flight From Emerging Markets: Turkey Finance Minister In a WSJ column, Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek blames the Fed for recent emerging market turmoil, but says his country\u2019s banks are in strong position to absorb any external shocks. http://on.wsj.com/1juJjFW\n\n\n\nNigerian Central Bank Says Policy Unchanged After Governor Dismissed. The acting head of Nigeria\u2019s central bank reassured investors on Monday that the removal of the former governor would not change policy aimed at strengthening the economy, the second-biggest in Africa, AFP reports from Lagos.\n\n\n\nGRAPHIC CONTENT\n\nMarkit\u2019s flash U.S. purchasing managers\u2019 index fell sharply to 52.7 in February, from 56.7 in January. Excluding the plunge in the October index during the federal-government shutdown, the index is at its lowest level since October 2012. \u201cRespondents widely cited the negative influence of recent weather-related disruptions,\u201d the report said. http://on.wsj.com/1juTwSM\n\nFORWARD GUIDANCE\n\n- Fed Gov. Daniel Tarullo speaks on the economic outlook at 10:10 a.m. EST (1510 GMT)\n\n\n\nRESEARCH\n\nDowngraded estimates of the U.S. economy\u2019s potential performance rest more on economists\u2019 overly rosy outlook in 2007 than the damage inflicted during the financial crisis and slow recovery, an upcoming Congressional Budget Office analysis is expected to show. http://on.wsj.com/1cIMJTI\n\nYoung businesses, not small ones, drive job growth. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago\u2019s Jason Faberman on Monday became the latest in a long line of economists to undermine the misconception \u2013 promoted frequently by elected officials \u2014 that small businesses are the key to creating new jobs in the U.S. http://on.wsj.com/1plsYqG\n\nAmericans in high-risk jobs like construction and mining tend to save less money than other workers despite facing a higher risk of becoming disabled, according to a new analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. http://on.wsj.com/1bGEkBQ http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/pub_assets/pdf/re/2014/a/disability_insurance.pdf\n\nMen who may be working in the U.S. illegally earn less money if they live in states that are cracking down on the hiring of undocumented workers, according to new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. But while requiring employers to verify the legal status of new employees can be a \u201cpowerful interior enforcement tool,\u201d the economists warned it \u201ccould also lead to higher poverty and more social assistance needs among the unauthorized immigrant population.\u201d http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/papers/2014/wp1403.pdf\n\n\n\nCOMMENTARY\n\nEurope cannot afford to ignore its deflation problem, writes FT columnist Wolfgang M\u00fcnchau. He says the ECB sees the evidence but its economic models ignore financial markets, and deflation may already be here. http://on.ft.com/1chfEeb\n\n\n\nBASIS POINTS\n\n- The U.S. Labor Department is weighing cuts to a program tracking import and export prices, a cost-saving move that could alter major gauges of U.S. inflation and economic output, according to people familiar with the matter. http://on.wsj.com/1cILtQA\n\n- Germany\u2019s economy gained momentum in the fourth quarter, mainly on the back of foreign trade, data from the country\u2019s statistics office Destatis showed Tuesday. http://on.wsj.com/1foxP7K\n\nSIGN UP: Grand Central, straight to your inbox http://on.wsj.com/1n92O6N.\n\nFEEDBACK LOOP: Send us your tips, suggestions and feedback.
