About the NHSC

Established in 1970, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) helps underserved communities across the nation receive critically needed primary medical, dental, and mental and behavioral health care. Through the Corps, primary care clinicians receive scholarships and loan repayment in return for committing to practice in areas of the country that have too few health care professionals to serve the people who live there.

With more than 80 percent of NHSC providers continuing to serve in high-need areas after they fulfill their service commitment, the Affordable Care Act investment in the National Health Service Corps helps ensure underserved communities have access to quality health care both today and in the future.
