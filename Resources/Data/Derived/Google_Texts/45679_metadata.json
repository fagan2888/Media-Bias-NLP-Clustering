A state trooper was on routine patrol when he spotted and attempted to stop two ATVs in a travel lane on N.C Highway 153.\n\nThe ATV drivers stopped in a subdivision, and the trooper exited his vehicle and approached. As the trooper walked, one of the drivers drove at the trooper, hitting him. The driver then turned around and tried to hit the trooper a second time.\n\nThe trooper then shot at the suspect, which caused both the ATV drivers to flee the scene.\n\nAccording to the Highway Patrol, the trooper received serious but non-life threatening injuries and was transported to Carolinas Medical Center-Northeast in Concord.
