Legendary figures like the late Rep. Jamie Whitten of Mississippi, Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii showered their states with federal funds for highways, bridges, schools and courthouses that often times bore their names.\n\nThose times have changed, and now longtime pork-barrel specialists are more apt to have to apologize to their constituents for winning costly projects for their states than take a bow.\n\nRelated: Congress Packs Defense Bills with Millions in Pork\n\nThe latest case in point is Republican Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi \u2014 a powerful figure on the Senate Appropriations Committee who over the decades brought literally billions of dollars of largess to his home state. Just four years ago, Citizens Against Government Waste dubbed Cochran the \u201cKing of Pork\u201d because he had his name on 240 projects worth over $490 million.\n\nIn 2006, Cochran was selected by Time as one of \"America's 10 Best Senators.\" He was labeled \"the Quiet Persuader\" for his role in winning money for the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Cochran managed to extract $29 billion, or almost double the money that President George W. Bush and congressional leaders had initially pledged. Cochran had threatened to derail a defense appropriations bill unless it included funding for installations on the Gulf Coast.\n\nWhile many Mississippians might rejoice in this show of spending might in Washington, old-style pork barrel spending is a serious issue among fiscal conservatives and Tea Party members. They blame senior appropriators like Cochran for driving the federal debt well beyond $17 trillion and for fostering irresponsible budget practices.\n\nThe snowy-thatched Cochran, 76, the most senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee and popular fixture on Capitol Hill, is arguably one of the most endangered Senate Republican up for reelection this year. While the GOP has its best chance in years of winning back control of the Senate, three longtime veterans \u2014 Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (KY), Pat Roberts (KS) and Cochran \u2014 have drawn aggressive primary challenges from Tea Party adherents.\n\nRelated: The \u2018New and Improved\u2019 Ted Cruz Infuriates His Colleagues Again\n\nCochran\u2019s opponent in a June 3 primary showdown, state Sen. Chris McDaniel, hopes to follow the lead of freshman Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and go to Washington to rattle the china in Congress.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re able to defeat Thad Cochran in this primary race \u2014 he\u2019s been there 41 years \u2014 do you know the shock waves it\u2019ll send through the system?\u201d McDaniel told an audience of about 100 at the University of Mississippi last month, according to Politico. \u201cWe have to shake the establishment.\u201d\n\nThe matchup is pitting McDaniel, a dyed in the wool fiscal and social conservative who enjoys backing from the Club for Growth and other outside conservative groups, against Cochran, a traditional conservative Republican who actually admitted that he doesn\u2019t know very much about the Tea Party.\n\nRelated: What Tea Party Republicans Can Learn from Liberal Democrats\n\n\"I'm just running my campaign based on my qualifications to continue to serve as a United States senator,\" Cochran said late December in announcing that he would seek a seventh term.\n\nLeaving nothing to chance, Cochran has lined up endorsements from some of the biggest names in Mississippi politics \u2014 including former Gov. Haley Barbour and former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott \u2014 and business leaders. He also recruited Kirk Sims, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant\u2019s chief of staff, as his campaign manager and recently began rolling out TV ads.\n\nAmong the handful of conservative activists challenging sitting senators this year, McDaniel reportedly is the only one to receive the unanimous support of all the powerful outside groups that fuel campaigns on the right.\n\nThe 41-year-old hard-charging lawyer said the tea party remark shows that Cochran is out of touch with people who support low taxes and limited government. \"The Tea Party matters. They care for their country,\" McDaniel told The Associated Press. \"These are conservative voters who feel like they're not being heard.\"\n\nMcDaniel has made federal spending the centerpiece of his campaign. Last October, in announcing he was challenging Cochran, he declared that the \u201cera of big spending is over.\u201d In that regard, he is trying to exploit a growing fissure within the GOP between the far right\u2019s antipathy to spending and special interest projects and the more traditional go-along-to-get-along ethos of Cochran and other more traditional congressional appropriators.\n\nRelated: Boehner Under Siege from Conservative Groups\n\nIn an interview on Tuesday, Cruz sought to differentiate the Tea Party\u2019s world view on spending from that of the GOP old guard. He said that during his campaign for Senate last year, he was frequently asked at forums, \u201cCan we count on you to bring home the bacon?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the answer I gave voters in Texas during the campaign was, \u2018If you are looking for someone to go to Washington and maximize the pork brought home to our state, you got the wrong guy. Because if 535 members of Congress all do that, that\u2019s how we bankrupt this country.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, who fended off a Tea Party challenge in the Republican primary a week ago, offers a somewhat contrary view. While he began by saying that \u201cfiscal responsibility is something sadly lacking here in Washington,\u201d and will hurt future generations, he acknowledged the importance of lawmakers looking out for their states.\n\nRelated: Tea Party Texans\u2019 Primary Results\u2014a Mixed Bag\n\nHe noted that former Texas Republican senator Phil Gramm, a fiscal conservative, \u201cfamously said . . . that if the federal government is going to be divvying up green cheese, then he\u2019s going to make sure Texas gets its share.\u201d\n\nSen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, another veteran GOP lawmaker who overcame a Tea Party primary challenge last year, added that it would be catastrophic for Mississippi, with all its economic problems, to lose Cochran\u2019s representation in Congress.\n\nAnalysts agree it will be a hard fought primary; but more recently, some have said the race is tilting in Cochran\u2019s favor.\n\nThe reason for that? \u201cMainly because Mississippi voters, even the ones who participate in a GOP primary, understand the value of Cochran's seniority to a small poor state,\u201d said Larry J. Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist who is tracking the race. \u201cAnd Cochran's voting record is mainly quite conservative.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There was a time when lawmakers boasted to their constituents about bringing home the bacon.
