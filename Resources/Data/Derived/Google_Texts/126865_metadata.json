Pleasant before returning to downtown Charleston.\n\nWhile in the car, the report states Dewitt began to ask the victim if she was a \"naughty girl,\" and asked if she liked to have fun. He then pulled out a stack of $100 bills and propositioned her for sex, the victim told police.\n\nThe report states the victim denied multiple propositions, and was then dropped off in the area of King and Spring Streets. The victim told police Dewitt did not touch during the incident.\n\n\n\nAccording to a court affidavit, Dewitt was captured thanks to help from the Automated License Plate Reader system on the Ravenel Bridge. The victim was able to give a description of the car and a relative time they traveled over the Ravenel Bridge, and authorities were able to spot the vehicle and get its license plate number via video that was produced by the reader.\n\n\n\nOfficials say the Dewitt matched the physical description given by the witness, and he was later identified as part of a line-up.\n\nDewitt has been charged with impersonating a law enforcement officer.\n\nCopyright 2014 WCSC.
