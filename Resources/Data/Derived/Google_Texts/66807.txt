Yes, beer can lead to that creative spark we use to formulate an idea, but when it comes to doing the work and carrying out that idea, it's coffee we should turn to. Alcohol and caffeine are two substances that receive quite a bit of attention from health care professionals. Most tend to agree that both can be useful in moderation and disastrous in excess.

Both alcohol and caffeine’s effects on the brain start in the cerebral cortex, the area of the brain that is responsible for conscious thought, language, and interaction. Although alcohol’s effect on the cerebral cortex does lead to us feeling less focused, it also frees us up from our distractions. Caffeine, on the other hand, binds with adenosine receptors, leading to that surge of energy we experience five minutes after our first sip.

Further research into the effect alcohol and caffeine have on the mind and body has found that both substances can impact male fertility, genetic makeup, and even lifespan.
