Auburn University professor David South told a Senate committee last week that the federal government\u2019s increasingly hands-off approach to forest management is fueling wildfires, not atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide.\n\n\u201cThis eventually increases the risk of catastrophic wildfires,\u201d said Mr. South as quoted in the Daily Caller. \u201cTo attribute this human-caused increase in fire risk to carbon dioxide emissions is simply unscientific.\u201d\n\nThe Koch donation to the nation\u2019s largest minority education fund met with some snark on Twitter. For the Kochs, however, that\u2019s an improvement over what happened in March, when labor unions held protests over the brothers\u2019 $100 million contribution to New York-Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nPrairie Progressive said on Twitter, \u201cKochs: Sure we\u2019re buying the political system & destroying the social contract. But we gave some $ to UNCF. So we\u2019re good, right?\u201d\n\nMedia Trackers Ohio reported that Mark Sweetwood, managing editor of the Youngstown (Ohio) Vindicator, sent out a Tweet saying, \u201cI think they just like saying \u2018Negro.\u2019\u201d\n\nSuch comments drew a sharp rebuke from Dr. Steve Perry, who responded in a Tweet, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the fact that someone you are politically opposed to is helping Black kids, stop complaining and put YOUR money up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This year's best-known politically active billionaires \u2014 liberal Tom Steyer and the libertarian Koch brothers \u2014 drew headlines Friday for a pair of hefty charitable contributions, but that's where the similarities end.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "This year\u2019s best-known politically active billionaires \u2014 liberal Tom Steyer and the libertarian Koch brothers \u2014 drew headlines Friday for a pair of hefty charitable contributions, but that\u2019s where the similarities end.", "title": "Koch brothers donate to college fund; Steyer\u2019s money aimed at climate change", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/8/koch-brothers-donate-college-fund-steyers-money-ai/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/06/billionaire-extreme-weatherjpeg-03875.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/06/billionaire-extreme-weatherjpeg-03875.jpg", "description": "This year's best-known politically active billionaires \u2014 liberal Tom Steyer and the libertarian Koch brothers \u2014 drew headlines Friday for a pair of hefty charitable contributions, but that's where the", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Koch brothers donate to college fund; Steyer\u2019s money aimed at cl"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Disaster Accident, Environment, United Negro College Fund, Koch Industries, Tom Steyer"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbea2\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer announced Friday that he and his wife Kat Taylor have established a $2 million fund for victims of \u201cextreme weather events\u201d caused by climate change.\nThis year\u2019s best-known politically active billionaires \u2014 liberal Tom Steyer and the libertarian Koch brothers \u2014 drew headlines Friday for a pair of hefty charitable contributions, but that\u2019s where the similarities end.\n\u201cClimate change is the defining issue of our generation, and we can no longer afford to wait to address this very real threat,\u201d Mr. Steyer said in a press release.\n\u201cThis eventually increases the risk of catastrophic wildfires,\u201d said Mr. South as quoted in the Daily Caller.\n\u201cThose affected by the 2013 wildfire season have already felt the devastating impacts of climate change, and while the Climate Disaster Relief Fund will help with their recovery efforts, we must act now to prevent future climate-related disasters,\u201d said Mr. Steyer."}
