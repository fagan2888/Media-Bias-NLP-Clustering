CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) - Biogen cut its full-year adjusted profit forecast Friday as sales of one of its multiple sclerosis drugs, Tecfidera, slow down.

Shares dropped almost 17 percent in morning trading Friday.

The biotechnology company now expects 2015 adjusted earnings in the range of $15.50 to $15.95 per share. Its prior guidance was for adjusted earnings between $16.60 and $17 per share.

Analysts surveyed by FactSet predict earnings of $16.63 per share.

In the second quarter, the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company posted revenue of $2.59 billion, which missed Wall Street forecasts. Eighteen analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research expected $2.71 billion.

CEO George Scangos said in a written statement that the multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera is “experiencing moderated patient growth following rapid initial uptake.”

In the first quarter, Tecfidera sales climbed 63 percent from the prior-year period. The drug experienced 26 percent sales growth in the second quarter.

For the three months ended June 30, Biogen Inc. earned $927.3 million, or $3.93 per share. That compares with $714.5 million, or $3.01 per share, a year earlier. Earnings, adjusted for one-time gains and costs, were $4.22 per share.

The results topped Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $4.10 per share.

But the reduced forecast weighed on the stock. Biogen’s shares declined $64.47, or 16.8 percent, to $320.58 in morning trading.
