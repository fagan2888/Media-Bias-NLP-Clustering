He is a 2003 Spring Hill High School graduate who received his bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville.\n\nKhoury received the award on Aug. 22 at the restaurant\u2019s home base in Portland, Ore.\n\nIn Oct. 2009, he hired on as a department manager. Khoury was promoted to assistant general manager in 2011, then general manager in Oct. 2012.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly very rare to find someone who is a new GM to win it in less than a year,\u201d Khoury said. \u201cI had basically eight months to prove myself, and that\u2019s what did it.\u201d\n\nThe Columbia native was one of two people nominated for the award in their 20s \u2014 everyone else ranged from age 30-50, he said. Excited, overwhelmed, honored and grateful were a few words he used to describe winning.\n\nHe said he cannot take full credit for the accolade and praised his team members for helping him get the recognition. The honor was more a \u201cstore of the year\u201d award to him, he added.\n\nThe Nashville restaurant at 160 2nd Ave. North has a high customer volume and serves thousands of patrons per week, Khoury said. As a new GM, he increased guest counts by 5.5 percent from last year \u2014 a major contributor to him winning, he said.\n\nKirk Michael, The Old Spaghetti Factory vice president of operations, said the award is generally given to the highest performing GM, or the one who has the best year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s by far our most coveted award in the company,\u201d Michael said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal to us \u2014 It\u2019s our Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nThe award also resembles another national sports item \u2014 the Stanley Cup \u2014 because all the previous winner\u2019s names are featured on it, including Michael\u2019s moniker.\n\nThe winner is chosen based upon how well the restaurant fares in sales, profits, cost control, cleanliness, food quality and service. Regional winners are chosen by district managers, then OSF owner Chris Dussin chooses the top person.\n\nKhoury said his ambitions do not stop at the general manager position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to be a district manager with the company,\u201d he said.\n\nNashville\u2019s Old Spaghetti Factory restaurant opened on 2nd Avenue in March 1980. Later this year or early next year, the location will update its look with a new lobby layout, furniture and other items, Michael said.\n\nThe company\u2019s first restaurant opened in Portland in 1969. Since then, the family owned eatery has grown to 42 restaurants across the country with a 10 million-plus annual volume, according to the company\u2019s website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In less than a year as the Nashville Old Spaghetti Factory's general manager, Sami Khoury achieved one of the company's highest accolades.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "TIM HODGE thodge@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "In less than a year as the Nashville Old Spaghetti Factory's general manager, Sami Khoury achieved one of the company's highest accolades.", "title": "Local man nets eatery\u2019s highest honor", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sections/news/business/local-man-nets-eatery%E2%80%99s-highest-honor.html", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/article/649390_web_Sami-Khoury_swt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sections/news/business/local-man-nets-eatery%E2%80%99s-highest-honor.html", "title": "Local man nets eatery\u2019s highest honor", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=649390", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=649390", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Business,,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-21T15:04:51-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3109\"", "article_summary": "Khoury was promoted to assistant general manager in 2011, then general manager in Oct. 2012.\nIn less than a year as the Nashville Old Spaghetti Factory\u2019s general manager, Sami Khoury achieved one of the company\u2019s highest accolades.\nKhoury, 28, was named General Manager of the Year throughout the company\u2019s 42 nationwide locations.\nNashville\u2019s Old Spaghetti Factory restaurant opened on 2nd Avenue in March 1980.\nKhoury said his ambitions do not stop at the general manager position."}
