They kept up their impressive streak of bouncing back from losses Sunday by beating the New York Rangers, 5-2, on the strength of Williams\u2019 second career hat trick.\n\nSEE ALSO: Mike Richards\u2019 first two games could forecast good things for Capitals\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not used to losing, and we don\u2019t like it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou throw a stinker in there and you want to redeem yourself, and luckily for us, we were able to do it the next night.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals had a rare clunker in a loss at the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday but improved to 10-0-1 after a loss this season. This one was even more meaningful because Washington did it despite losing starting goaltender Braden Holtby because of dehydration.\n\nAfter giving up two goals to Chris Kreider and making 20 saves, Holtby left the game with 2:18 remaining in the second period. Philipp Grubauer stopped all 11 shots he faced in relief.\n\nCoach Barry Trotz said Holtby\u2019s dehydration was not serious.\n\n\u201cHe said that he was having a little trouble getting focused, and he didn\u2019t get hit or anything,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got it under control. He\u2019ll be good. We\u2019ll get him a day [off] here \u2026 so he should rebound pretty well.\u201d\n\nWinning with Holtby out of the net showed another dimension to the NHL-leading Capitals\u2018 ability to win any way. They haven\u2019t dealt with many on-ice problems in recent months, but when faced with it, they delivered offensively to finish off the rival Rangers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the best team in the NHL right now, and if you get down a couple goals, defensively they\u2019re so sound it\u2019s tough to come back,\u201d Rangers center Derek Stepan said. \u201cWe have to find a way to try to climb back into it. We go into a third period down, 3-2, but we just can\u2019t find a way to get it done.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals got power-play goals from Alex Ovechkin, his 10th and 27th overall, and Marcus Johansson, but Williams led the way with his hat trick. He tipped a point shot from Taylor Chorney past New York backup Antti Raanta, turned a pass from Evgeny Kuznetsov into an easy goal and scored an empty-netter.\n\nWilliams won the Stanley Cup twice with the Los Angeles Kings and the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP in 2014, but this was his first hat trick since Oct. 16, 2006, for the Hurricanes at the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\n\u201cI just like hearing the \u2018Tricky, Tricky\u2019 song,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI don\u2019t care who gets the hat trick. I like hearing that song.\u201d\n\nThe Rangers weren\u2019t as thrilled to hear the Capitals\u2018 goal song so often, especially after giving up two on the penalty kill. Penalty trouble doomed New York, which has given up a power-play goal in six of the past eight games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to us players on the ice to figure it out and do the job,\u201d right wing Rick Nash said. \u201cUs players have got to do a better job.\u201d\n\nThe Capitals are doing an excellent job at just about everything, but they take particular pride in not losing consecutive games, and it\u2019s becoming something of a calling card.\n\n\u201cI think we are ready to go every night,\u201d Grubauer said. \u201cWe always find a way to respond.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Williams completed a hat trick with an empty-netter in the third period, and the Capitals recovered from a one-goal deficit to beat the Rangers, 5-2, on Sunday night.", "Author": "Stephen Whyno", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Williams completed a hat trick with an empty-netter in the third period, and the Capitals recovered from a one-goal deficit to beat the Rangers, 5-2, on Sunday night.", "title": "Justin Williams has second career hat trick as Capitals rally against Rangers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/17/justin-williams-second-hat-trick-capitals-rangers/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/17/AP_801193466328.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/17/AP_801193466328.jpg", "title": "Justin Williams has second career hat trick as Capitals rally against", "description": "Williams completed a hat trick with an empty-netter in the third period, and the Capitals recovered from a one-goal deficit to beat the Rangers, 5-2, on Sunday night.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Justin Williams, New York Rangers, Washington Capitals, Braden Holtby"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cdc\"", "article_summary": "They kept up their impressive streak of bouncing back from losses Sunday by beating the New York Rangers, 5-2, on the strength of Williams\u2019 second career hat trick.\nJustin Williams remembered that the last time he recorded a hat trick was in 2006, when he played for the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care who gets the hat trick.\nSEE ALSO: Mike Richards\u2019 first two games could forecast good things for Capitals\u201cWe\u2019re not used to losing, and we don\u2019t like it,\u201d Williams said.\nAfter giving up two goals to Chris Kreider and making 20 saves, Holtby left the game with 2:18 remaining in the second period."}
