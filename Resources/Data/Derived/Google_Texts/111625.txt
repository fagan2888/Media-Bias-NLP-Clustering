Two people were booked into the Fourth Avenue Jail after three pipe bombs and meth were found in a stolen rental vehicle, Maricopa County sheriff’s deputies said.

The vehicle was located on the Carefree Highway near milepost 23 Saturday afternoon.

A passenger, Steve Scott, 44, told sheriff’s deputies that there might be explosives in the vehicle, MCSO said.

The sheriff’s bomb squad arrived and discovered the pipe bombs. They were rendered safe and removed.

Deputies arrested Michelle Buck, 41, on charges of driving without a license.

Buck and Scott each face a charge of making a false report with law enforcement.

Sheriff’s investigators determined the vehicle was rented in Jacksonville, FL, and it was reported stolen by the rental company.
