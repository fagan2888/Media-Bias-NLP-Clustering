Was afraid to confront Dr. Cornel West. No clue on immigration! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2015\n\nI liked The Kelly File much better without @megynkelly. Perhaps she could take another eleven day unscheduled vacation! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2015\n\n\"@mstanish53: @realDonaldTrump @megynkelly The bimbo back in town . I hope not for long .\" \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2015\n\nJust a couple weeks after Donald Trump and Fox News president Roger Ailes reached a truce and Trump agreed to ease up on his blistering criticism of the network \u2014 specifically its host, Megyn Kelly \u2014 the real estate tycoon unleashed a series of Twitter posts on Monday to mark Kelly\u2019s first day back at work following a 10-day vacation.Kelly posted a graphic highlighting Trump\u2019s immigration proposal \u2014 Mexico must pay for a border wall, all illegal immigrants are to be deported and birthright citizenship ends:Minutes later, Trump took to his keyboard, tweeting at 9:42 p.m.:Eight minutes later he posted again:The vitriol went south when Trump began retweeting others' comments, including one person who referred to Kelly as \"a bimbo.\"Other posts suggested Kelly\u2019s show was \"a waste of an hour\" and said she should go back on vacation, while yet another opined that the host returned \"looking like Nancy Grace.\" Fox News told the website Mediate that Kelly\u2019s vacation was long-planned \u2014 taken after the Aug. 6 GOP debate \u2014 and any suggestion by Trump that it was forced by the network is incorrect.The network stridently defended Kelly in a statement to Mediaite:\"The conspiracy theories about Megyn Kelly\u2019s vacation rank up there with UFO\u2019s, the moon landing and Elvis being alive,\" it reads. \"Megyn is on a pre-planned, annual summer vacation with her family, which is much deserved. To imply otherwise as Donald Trump and his campaign operatives have is not only wildly irresponsible, but downright bizarre.\"Perhaps Mr. Trump thinks it\u2019s advantageous to his poll numbers to keep talking about Megyn, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that Roger Ailes has fully supported her and her tough journalistic questioning since day one and is thrilled with the added exposure from the debate which resulted in even higher ratings of The Kelly File this week.\"Anyone who knows Roger is aware of how historically and consistently loyal he is to all of his talent and how he protects them at all costs. As Governor Terry Branstad said today, 'when you\u2019re a candidate, you\u2019ve got to basically answer the questions. You can\u2019t just attack the person asking the questions. That doesn\u2019t work.'\"Trump has had Kelly in his crosshairs since the debate, when she questioned him about past derogatory comments made about women. He has slammed her for being unprofessional and a \"lightweight,\" and in one interview seemed to suggest Kelly\u2019s menstrual cycle played a role in her demeanor. Trump has denied making that implication.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "donald trump, megyn kelly, feud, fox", "pubdate": "2015-08-25T07:19:00", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Just weeks after Donald Trump and Fox News president Roger Ailes reached a truce and Trump agreed to ease up on his blistering criticism of the network - specifically its host, Megyn Kelly - the real estate tycoon unleashed a series of Twitter posts to mark Kelly's return from vacation.", "title": "Trump Rekindles Feud With 'Terrible' Megyn Kelly", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/donald-trump-megyn-kelly-feud-fox/2015/08/25/id/671718/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=9477bad3-04a4-4130-a3e1-05df2fd938eb&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/donald-trump-megyn-kelly-feud-fox/2015/08/25/id/671718/", "title": "Trump Rekindles Feud With 'Terrible' Megyn Kelly", "description": "Just weeks after Donald Trump and Fox News president Roger Ailes reached a truce and Trump agreed to ease up on his blistering criticism of the network - specifically its host, Megyn Kelly - the real estate tycoon unleashed a series of Twitter posts to mark Kelly's return from vacation.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1440487140, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "donald trump, megyn kelly, feud, fox", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2015-08-25T07:19:00"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/donald-trump-megyn-kelly-feud-fox/2015/08/25/id/671718/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Just weeks after Donald Trump and Fox News president Roger Ailes reached a truce and Trump agreed to ease up on his blistering criticism of the network - specifically its host, Megyn Kelly - the real estate tycoon unleashed a series of Twitter posts to mark Kelly's return from vacation."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd154f\"", "article_summary": "To imply otherwise as Donald Trump and his campaign operatives have is not only wildly irresponsible, but downright bizarre.\nTake a look at @realDonaldTrump\u2019s immigration proposals: pic.twitter.com/F3phEpbQ74 \u2014 Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) August 25, 2015.\n\u2014 Donald J.
