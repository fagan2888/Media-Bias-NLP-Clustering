Ryan (R-Ohio) frequently touts.\n\nWhile lawmakers should be applauded for pushing for lower spending levels, members should not hesitate supporting a budget at current law spending levels. Doing so will allow Congress to exert its power over the purse by passing appropriations bills and ensure resources are spent appropriately -- not just rolled over from previous years.\n\nMost importantly, passing a budget allows the use of reconciliation, which is one of the best, real opportunities for Congress to implement a conservative limited government vision. The only catch is that it requires a budget be passed.\n\nLast year, this procedure was successfully used to pass a bill out of Congress that repealed key provisions of Obamacare. While President Obama disappointingly vetoed this bill, it would have repealed 16 taxes that hit taxpayers to the tune of $833 billion over ten years. It also would have reduced spending by $1.35 trillion over the same window.\n\nCongress again has the same opportunity to put major reforms on the President\u2019s desk \u2013 but only if they pass a budget. The key difference this time is reconciliation can be used when the next president is in office \u2013 giving members an opportunity to enact real change.\n\nBy passing a budget, Congress has the opportunity to restrain and control spending through both the appropriations process and through reconciliation. As an added bonus they can draw a contrast with the President\u2019s unserious, fiscally irresponsible proposals.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "pocket-site-verification": "e8a03e904ad67c23ec990c1928577c", "og": {"site_name": "Americans for Tax Reforms", "description": "In his last year of office, President Obama released an unserious budget that proposes to hike taxes\u00a0$3.4 trillion\u00a0over the next ten years, never balances, and creates a\u00a0$320 billion energy tax\u00a0for wasteful new spending on bullet trains and self-driving cars.&#13;&#13;Not only does this budget take the government and the economy in the wrong direction, it also breaks Obama\u2019s \u201cfirm pledge\u201d against\u00a0\u201cany form of tax increase\u201d\u00a0on any American earning less than $250,000.&#13;&#13;Congressional republicans have the opportunity to show a clear contrast and release their own budget based", "title": "Congressional Passage of a Budget Will Allow Conservative, Pro-Growth Solutions", "url": "https://www.atr.org/congressional-passage-budget-will-allow-conservative-pro-growth-solutions", "image": "https://www.atr.org/sites/default/files/7027596629_1b17209fa6_z.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 21200647, "pages": 8127889355}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "By passing a budget, Congress has the opportunity to restrain and control spending through both the appropriations process and through reconciliation.\nCongressional republicans have the opportunity to show a clear contrast and release their own budget based around pro-growth reforms, spending restraint, and fiscal responsibility in contrast to the unrealistic and partisan proposals in the Obama budget.\nWhile President Obama disappointingly vetoed this bill, it would have repealed 16 taxes that hit taxpayers to the tune of $833 billion over ten years.\nMost importantly, passing a budget allows the use of reconciliation, which is one of the best, real opportunities for Congress to implement a conservative limited government vision.\nCongress again has the same opportunity to put major reforms on the President\u2019s desk \u2013 but only if they pass a budget."}
