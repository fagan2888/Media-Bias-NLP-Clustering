I mean, frankly I can\u2019t think of a better ground to run on. Washington is broken, and it\u2019s both parties that aren\u2019t listening to the American people\u201d he stated.\n\nCruz said that Republican actions during the 2013 government shutdown were \u201cnot a question of letting me down. It\u2019s a question of letting down the people who elected us. Republicans all over the country campaigned saying \u2018if you elect us we\u2019ll fight [to repeal Obamacare]'\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cI think it [the effort to defund Obamacare] absolutely would have been successful. Now, would we necessarily have succeeded in, at the time defunding all of Obamacare? I don\u2019t know. That was a difficult \u2014 it would have taken a perfect storm. But I think at a minimum we would have provided meaningful relief for millions of people being hurt by Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cremember they all went on TV and they said \u2018as a result of this, Harry Reid and the Democrats are going to keep the Senate.\u2019 Well, it strikes me we had a little bit of a different result, and not only did we win [a] historic victory\u2026but the number one issue we won the senate on was stopping Obamacare. It was the most frequent campaign commercial of every Republican candidate. And it\u2019s interesting it doesn\u2019t occur to any of those Republican elites or Washington elites that helping lead an effort that mobilizes and energizes millions of Americans to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare may have played a significant role in our winning the Senate.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz (R-TX) expressed pride that \"Washington elites despise me\" because \"it's both parties that aren't listening to the American people\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ted Cruz (R-TX) expressed pride that \"Washington elites despise me\" because \"it's both parties that aren't listening to the American people\"", "title": "Cruz: I Take Pride That 'Washington Elites Despise Me,' 'Both Parties' Don't Listen - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/Cruz-DC-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/03/23/cruz-i-take-pride-that-washington-elites-despise-me-both-parties-dont-listen/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz (R-TX) expressed pride that \"Washington elites despise me\" because \"it's both parties that aren't listening to the American people\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/Cruz-DC-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Cruz: I Take Pride That 'Washington Elites Despise Me,' 'Both Parties' Don't Listen - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Sen.
