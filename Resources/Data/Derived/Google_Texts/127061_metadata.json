In her remarks, Clinton said her mother -- presidential candidate Hillary Clinton -- could use executive action to curb those costs.\n\n\u201cWe can either do that directly or through tax credits. And, kind of figuring out whether she could do that through executive action, or she would need to do that through tax credits working with Congress. She thinks either of those will help solve the challenge of kind of the crushing costs that still exist for too many people who even are part of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said in the video, initially flagged by The Weekly Standard.\n\nThe video appears to be from a Hillary Clinton town hall event this past Tuesday at the Advanced Technology Center at Bates Technical College in Tacoma, Wash.\n\nIt's just the latest controversial comment from a member of the Clinton family; former President Bill Clinton lamented the \u201cawful legacy of the last eight years\u201d earlier this week while stumping for his wife, though a spokesman later said he was referring to Republicans during the Obama administration.\n\nOn health care, Hillary Clinton herself has staunchly defended the Affordable Care Act, while saying she would take any steps necessary to fix problems in the system.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nIn a January debate, she said, \u201cAs president, I'll defend the Affordable Care Act, build on its successes, and go even further to reduce costs. My plan will crack down on drug companies charging excessive prices, slow the growth of out-of-pocket costs, and provide a new credit to those facing high health expenses.\u201d\n\nIn December, Hillary Clinton was asked by a questioner at a town hall event why companies are favoring part-time employment over full-time employment. Clinton responded by saying, \u201cthe Affordable Care Act. You know, we got to change that because we have built in some unfortunate incentives that discourage full-time employment.\u201d\n\nA report from Freedom Partners released earlier this month states that the cost of health care premiums have outgrown both wages and normal inflation, resulting in an average rise of 28 percent from 2009 to 2014.\n\n\u201cWith health care costs still rising faster than inflation six years after passage of the Affordable Care Act, it is clear that the law is not helping lower the burden of health care expenses for American families,\u201d the report states.\n\nFoxNews.com's Danny Jativa contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "elections", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Presidential Primaries,/FOX
