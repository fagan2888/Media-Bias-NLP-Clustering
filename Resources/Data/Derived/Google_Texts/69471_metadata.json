Records obtained by The Associated Press show that Duke and North Carolina environmental regulators have known since 2011 that groundwater samples taken from monitoring wells near several homes in Dukeville contained substances, some that can be toxic, exceeding state standards.\n\nGREENVILLE, N.C. \u2014 As the nation\u2019s largest electricity company prepares to plead guilty to violating the federal Clean Water Act, Duke Energy has started delivering bottled water to people with tainted wells close to its North Carolina coal ash pits.\n\nDuke has long denied its 32 dumps in the state have contaminated the drinking water of its neighbors, suggesting any worrying chemicals found in the wells is likely naturally occurring.\n\nBut recent state-mandated tests found that more than 150 residential wells tested near Duke\u2019s dumps have failed to meet state groundwater standards, and residents have been advised not to use their water for drinking or cooking.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nMany of the results showed troublesome levels of toxic heavy metals like vanadium and hexavalent chromium \u2014 both of which can be contained in coal ash. And some of the residents have retained lawyers.\n\nDuke spokeswoman Erin Culbert told The Associated Press that any homeowner who gets a state letter warning of a tainted well will get safe bottled water from Duke, if they request it.\n\nWhile denying responsibly for the problem, Culbert said Duke simply wants to provide the homeowners \u201cpeace of mind.\u201d\n\nDuke is scheduled to plead guilty Thursday to nine environmental crimes as part of a negotiated settlement with federal prosecutors requiring it to pay $102 million in fines and restitution. The proposed settlement over years of illegal pollution leaking from ash dumps at five of Duke\u2019s plants has been sealed, so it wasn\u2019t clear before the hearing whether people with contaminated well water will benefit.\n\nThe company\u2019s Buck Steam Station is not one of the five plants in the negotiated settlement. But nearly three dozen homes surrounding Buck \u2014 an area called Dukeville \u2014 have received letters warning them not to drink the water.\n\nA year ago, some people in the community held meetings questioning whether the dumps were polluting their wells, causing health problems.\n\nDukeville resident Ted Rary, whose well is being tested next week, said he was willing to give Duke the benefit of the doubt last year, but now? \u201cI don\u2019t trust them anymore,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like the rest of the people. I want my well tested. And if it\u2019s bad, I want Duke to make it right. That\u2019s all. It\u2019s their responsibility. Just make it right,\u201d Rary said\n\nDuke\u2019s pledge to pay for safe water in any case was welcomed by Sherry Gobble, who lives with her husband and two young children on land adjacent to Buck. Her drinking well is about 250 feet from the largest of the three open-air coal ash pits at Buck, which together cover 134 acres and contain more than 5 million tons of ash.\n\nNationally, there are more than 1,100 such dumps, most located near aging coal-fired power plants.\n\nAs The Associated Press reported in June, private tests by Waterkeeper Alliance found worrying levels of heavy metals in the wells of Gobble and several of her neighbors in Dukeville, a close-knit rural hamlet named for the large number Duke power plant employees who live there.\n\nEver since, Gobble has been using bottled water for everything from making coffee to bathing her children. The family goes through about 40 one-gallon plastic jugs each week.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot out of you to haul that water every week \u2014 in and out, in and out,\u201d Gobble said. \u201cI\u2019m so tired of hauling water.\u201d\n\nAccording to the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Gobble\u2019s well contains hexavalent chromium at more than 50 times the threshold set by state health officials, and vanadium at nine times the state\u2019s allowed groundwater limit.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says hexavalent chromium is likely to be carcinogenic when ingested. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has determined that vanadium is \u201cpossibly carcinogenic to humans.\u201d Studies show lab animals exposed to high oral doses of vanadium suffered neurological and developmental problems.\n\nDuke had said its own sampling showed no problems with residential wells in Dukeville until a new state law, passed last year in the wake of a massive spill of coal ash at Duke\u2019s Dan River Steam Station, required independent testing of all residential wells within 1,000 feet of an ash pit.\n\nOf the wells tested through the end of April, more than 93 percent failed to meet state groundwater standards.\n\nEven Duke got a warning letter from state health officials, because the well supplying the Buck plant tested higher than state groundwater standards for antimony, a potentially harmful metal found in coal ash.\n\nDuke has for years supplied bottled water to its employees at the plant.\n\nAfter denying wrongdoing for years, Duke recently conceded in regulatory filings that it had identified about 200 leaks and seeps at its 32 coal ash dumps statewide, which together ooze out more than 3 million gallons of contaminated wastewater each day.\n\nStill, the company insists it is not responsible for contamination in residential wells ringing its coal-fired power plants. Culbert blames natural processes present in local soils and rock, not the company\u2019s ash pits, and says more study is needed.\n\n\u201cBased on the state\u2019s test results we\u2019ve reviewed thus far, we have no indication that Duke Energy plant operations have influenced neighbors\u2019 well water,\u201d Culbert said.\n\nAvner Vengosh, a Duke University geochemist who studies coal ash contamination, agreed that available data does not yet conclusively link or rule out Duke Energy\u2019s leaky pits as the source of the well contamination. But he said \u201cI would be very concerned if I lived there.\u201d\n\nDuke University and Duke Energy \u2014 both named for the same family of North Carolina tobacco barons \u2014 are not affiliated with each other.\n\nWaterkeeper Alliance spokeswoman Donna Lisenby said the state\u2019s results verify what her group found last year \u2014 findings that were waved off by state regulators as well as Duke.\n\n\u201cInstead of disputing our science and our testing, now they have their own results confirming what we\u2019ve said all along: Wells close to Duke\u2019s ash ponds at Buck contain heavy metals and other pollutants that are also in coal ash,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Duke is scheduled to plead guilty Thursday to nine environmental crimes as part of a negotiated settlement with federal prosecutors requiring it to pay $102 million in fines and restitution.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "AP", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Duke is scheduled to plead guilty Thursday to nine environmental crimes as part of a negotiated settlement with federal prosecutors requiring it to pay $102 million in fines and restitution.", "title": "Duke Energy To Face Charges Over Toxic Dumping On Massive Scale", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/duke-energy-to-face-charges-over-toxic-dumping-on-massive-scale/205632/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP197368806919.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Duke is scheduled to plead guilty Thursday to nine environmental crimes as part of a negotiated settlement with federal prosecutors requiring it to pay $102 million in fines and restitution.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP197368806919.jpg", "title": "Duke Energy To Face Charges Over Toxic Dumping On Massive Scale", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "North Carolina", "published_time": "2015-05-14T08:33:19-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Duke Energy To Face Charges Over Toxic Dumping On Massive ScaleResidents have been warned not to use the local water supply.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorMany of the results showed troublesome levels of toxic heavy metals like vanadium and hexavalent chromium \u2014 both of which can be contained in coal ash.\nOf the wells tested through the end of April, more than 93 percent failed to meet state groundwater standards.\nAvner Vengosh, a Duke University geochemist who studies coal ash contamination, agreed that available data does not yet conclusively link or rule out Duke Energy\u2019s leaky pits as the source of the well contamination.\n\u201cBased on the state\u2019s test results we\u2019ve reviewed thus far, we have no indication that Duke Energy plant operations have influenced neighbors\u2019 well water,\u201d Culbert said."}
