Rick Scott sued the federal government. The compromise was a gradual phase out of LIP funding.\n\nThe issue also brought the 2015 Legislative session to a halt.\n\nJim Burkhart, CEO of Tampa General Hospital,\u201d was in Tallahassee this week with other members of the Safety Net Hospital Alliance of Florida to show their support for the Senate proposal.\n\n\"We think this is a good way to put some money towards where it's intended, which is those that are in the most need and I think that we would all agree that in our state, we'd want children and neonates (infants) to be a priority,\u201d Burkhart said.\n\nThe measure is how heading into a House-Senate conference committee.\n\nThe Senate version of the 2016-17 budget is nearly $81 billion, roughly $1 billion larger than the House proposal.\n\n--Daylina Miller is a reporter with WUSF in Tampa.
