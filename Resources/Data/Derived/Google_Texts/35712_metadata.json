Entering the labor force or working more hours can lead to a loss in benefits and higher taxes. This is a powerful disincentive to reenter the labor market or work more hours. Since 2007, the government has relaxed eligibility requirements and increased benefit levels. According to research by two George Mason University analysts, most \u201canti-poverty\u201d benefits go to people who are above the poverty line.\n\nThe bibliography in the Federal Reserve study cited in the editorial did not include research by Casey Mulligan, the economist whose work led the Congressional Budget Office to increase substantially its estimate of the decrease in employment associated with Affordable Care Act provisions. Mr. Mulligan recently estimated that by 2017 the ACA will lead to 3 percent fewer hours worked and 3 percent less weekly employment.\n\nThe Fed study was deficient.\n\nJohn A.
