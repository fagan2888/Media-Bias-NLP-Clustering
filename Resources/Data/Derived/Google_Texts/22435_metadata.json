While perceptively characterizing the defects in our GME system, recommendations of the report generated substantial controversy among participants at a recent GME forum hosted by Health Affairs. The IOM proposed limited and gradual changes in Medicare GME financing, but the lack of support for GME expansion was not well received by some.\n\nAt present there are multiple legislative GME proposals, but none has gained broad support among the various stakeholders. Congressional committees responsible for GME funding view this lack of consensus among GME stakeholders as a major obstacle.\n\nWe describe a near-term and attainable pathway to expand GME that could gain consensus among these stakeholders. This approach would sustain and expand Teaching Health Centers (THCs), a recent initiative that directly funds community-based GME sponsoring institutions to train residents in primary care specialties, dentistry and psychiatry. We further propose selectively expanding GME to meet primary care and other demonstrable specialty needs within communities, and building in evaluations to measure effectiveness of innovative training models.\n\nOur proposal includes:\n\nCongressional reauthorization and funding of the THC GME program, administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA); additional primary care and other specialty GME expansion utilizing the new Veterans Affairs (VA) GME positions; strategic primary care and other specialty GME expansion based on state workforce needs using Medicaid GME funds (See Note 1); THC expansion based on the outcome of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) funded study of modified THC demonstrations associated with Community Health Center (CHC)/Academic Medicine (AM) partnerships (CHAMPs). This GME innovation could help sustain CHCs and improve access to care for Medicaid beneficiaries and other low-income patients while preparing residents for 21st Century practice.\n\nOur proposal, and its timeline for implementation, is feasible because it provides near-term GME expansion where most urgently needed; requires simple reauthorization of a current statute; lacks any immediate incursion on Medicare GME funding or changes in Medicare rules; and aligns with the recommendations of the IOM report.\n\nSustaining the HRSA Teaching Health Center GME Program\n\nTHCs generally are located in CHCs, as well as Rural Health Clinics and other safety net settings. They serve a large percentage of Medicaid patients and provide residency training in family medicine, general internal medicine, pediatrics, geriatrics, psychiatry, obstetrics/gynecology and dentistry\u2014all documented shortage specialties for the underserved in many geographic areas. THCs pursue a triple mission of high-value, high-quality care; increased access to primary care for urban and rural underserved; and education for 21st Century practice of clinicians needed for health professional shortage areas.\n\nThe THC GME program is in the fourth year of a five-year authorization and $230 million appropriation under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Without Congressional reauthorization and funding, this program will expire next year, interrupting the training of almost 600 residents in 60 programs across 24 states, and wasting precious infrastructure investment. Recent studies of training in these settings suggest that more than 50 percent of graduates enter practice in underserved areas.\n\nThe IOM GME report recommends creating a Transformation Fund, using existing Medicare GME monies for innovation projects. The THC GME program ultimately could be sustained and expanded by using this Transformation Fund, but implementation of the IOM recommendations will require Congressional action, which may entail substantial delay.\n\nMeanwhile, to avoid a lapse in funding, and to protect the current investment, we propose a contingent reauthorization of the THC program with an appropriation of at least $100 million annually through action by the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee of the Senate and the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House, which have jurisdiction over this program. The George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services is in the third year of a five-year evaluation of THC outcomes which will not be fully measurable for 2 to 3 years.\n\nEmerging evidence demonstrates \u201cimprinting\u201d that occurs during residency training (specifically in safety net settings), which lowers practice costs during future practice. What specific training factors align with these improved outcomes is largely unknown, offering an opportunity for GME innovation research. Such outcomes would likely reduce future medical care costs and utilization, making training in THCs a good investment to reduce long-term Medicare/Medicaid costs. The THC GME outcome study may provide data further elucidating such outcomes. This type of research conforms to the mission of the Transformation Fund.\n\nMedical students are especially important stakeholders in the current GME debate. The THC GME program has demonstrated attractiveness to students, as evidenced by the 800 applicants for eight positions at the Feinberg School of Medicine THC program last year (See Note 1). However, the uncertainty of THC funding reauthorization creates great confusion among students who would otherwise gravitate toward THC training. Therefore, we propose immediate Congressional reauthorization of THC funding so students can apply for first year positions in this academic year, assuring continuity of enrollment and financial and programmatic continuity in the currently established programs.\n\nVeterans Administration (VA) Primary Care GME Expansion\n\nGiven its mission-driven goals to enhance the health care and wellbeing of veterans and assist in preparing the future health professions workforce, the VA is uniquely positioned for a central role in expanding GME. Over the past decade, while Medicare-funded GME has been largely stagnant, the VA has committed significant resources to expanding the number of GME positions (See Note 2). However, the bulk of these positions have been in medical subspecialties rather than primary care and mental health specialties, which are now in short supply in VA and nationally.\n\nMore recently, the VA has implemented a pilot program (Centers of Excellence in Primary Care Education) to explore the inter-professional redesign of clinical education in concert with the transformation of its primary care delivery system and has focused on expanding mental health positions across several different professions as well. The initial successes of these models suggest that innovation in VA GME could thrive with the expansion of existing, and creation of new, collaborations to enhance ambulatory community-based training. Consequently, we focus on two such opportunities: expansion of the VA Centers of Excellence in Primary Care Education program and the development of an entirely new community-based pathway for primary care GME training. The goals of both of these initiatives would be closely aligned with those of HRSA\u2019s THC program.\n\nLike THCs, the five VA Centers of Excellence in Primary Care Education seek to prepare graduates to work in and lead inter-professional primary care teams. Their proliferation could provide ideal settings for training of some of the 1,500 new GME positions authorized in the recently enacted VA health care act to expand primary care and mental health training. The VA should consider implementing at least one such Center in each of the 21 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), with the goal of developing the clinical and educational infrastructure necessary to support the implementation of this model in community-based or rural settings. Investments in inter-professional, team-based training of medical residents, nurse practitioner students, and others would represent an initial pipeline for the types of new professionals needed to lead the VA and national health care systems in the future.\n\nWe also propose that the VA develop an entirely new community-based pathway for primary care GME training modeled on HRSA\u2019s successful THC initiative. In order to achieve timely implementation of such a program, the VA should establish a special VA THC track in conjunction with the agency\u2019s affiliated academic medicine partners. Optimally, these new programs, which would complement rather than compete with existing VA GME programs, would be established as educational consortia. This would facilitate accreditation and provide the VA and the primary care and mental health communities with enhanced voices in program design, management, and oversight (See Note 3).\n\nIf these programs were established by early summer 2015, they could be included in the 2016 residency match. The VA\u2019s Office of Academic Affiliations has recently released a request for proposals targeted predominantly at primary care, mental health, and community-based residency training for activation in July 2015. It contains many of these provisions, and could be readily modified to accommodate the THC consortia model in 2016.\n\nTrainees in both programs, incentivized by the VA\u2019s already existing debt reduction program, could continue to practice in VA facilities, including community or rural health clinics, once their training is completed. In addition, Congress could make service in these programs eligible for the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program. These would be excellent incentives for students to select VA residencies and to remain in clinics that care for the underserved, including veterans.\n\nGME Expansion to Target State\u2019s Workforce Needs via Medicaid Support\n\nForty-two states use Medicaid funds to support GME; state and matching federal funds total nearly $4 billion annually (See Note 1). Medicaid allows states flexibility in GME funding, but only 10 states direct these funds strategically for specific workforce needs. States could seek additional Medicaid GME funds and exercise greater oversight on how these payments are applied. By devoting Medicaid GME funds to documented areas of need, states could expand primary care programs via THCs, and could also expand other specialty GME programs based on the unique workforce needs of their state or region.\n\nStates that don\u2019t support GME currently with Medicaid funds could begin to do so and thus gain matching Federal funds for GME expansion. For example, Illinois recently applied for a CMS waiver that would reinstate GME support (that had lapsed for years) directed toward geographic and specialty shortages. Other states have also pursued more strategic use of GME funding, including a few states that have expanded Medicaid GME or appropriated funds to expand GME (NM, GA, WI, ND).\n\nWe also encourage states (or multiple-state regions) to form \u201chealth workforce commissions\u201d that would monitor the need for physicians by both geography and specialty, test workforce innovations, and evaluate the outcomes of GME training for their state or region.\n\nExpanding THC GME via Innovative Workforce Demonstrations\n\nIn addition to sustaining the current THC GME program through Congressional renewal of funding, policymakers should expand the THC GME program into established US residency programs. THCs could partner with Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) to create CHC/Academic Medicine partnerships (CHAMPS); these partnerships could test new workforce training programs to prepare physicians to lead the transformed delivery systems of the future. Proposed modifications to the THC program and the Medicaid CHAMP THC model would appeal to urban and rural THCs, their teaching hospital partners, and prospective primary care residents.\n\nWe propose taking advantage of the creative opportunity of expanding GME into CHAMPs. CHAMPS combine AMC subspecialist expertise, medical technology, and inpatient care with the robust primary care and behavioral health services of CHCs, and thus can provide high-quality, cost-effective care for low-income Americans while teaching the skills that the next generation of health care providers need.\n\nBy training in CHAMPs, residents would learn how to provide high-quality primary care in low-resource environments. In addition to providing specialty care, inpatient care, and diagnostic services, the AMCs would serve as training sites for the residents\u2019 inpatient rotations. This would enhance opportunities for shared electronic medical records enabling communication between CHC and AMC providers, the lack of which has been cited as a barrier to care coordination with AMCs.\n\nThis collaborative CHAMP approach offers several strengths as an innovative workforce training model, and can be incorporated into delivery system and payment models such as ACOs. Integrating CHCs into organized delivery systems can improve access to subspecialty care. This is important to address the high prevalence of complex chronic medical diseases and behavioral health conditions among CHC patients. A recent national survey documented that 28 percent of ACOs have teamed up with CHCs, indicating that ACOs view these safety-net providers as valuable partners.\n\nACOs that embrace CHCs are likely to have more success in implementing the chronic disease management, care coordination, and quality improvement programs that promise to lower costs. One of the greatest advantages of CHC/ACO partnerships are the improved care transitions as primary care residents and faculty care for their own patients in the inpatient setting, allowing for enhanced communication and primary care follow-up that could decrease readmissions.\n\nCHAMPs piloted in ACO settings could also build on the existing integrated behavioral health treatment and care coordination offered by CHCs. They could test workforce innovations such as training behavioral health providers alongside primary care residents, and inter-professional teams that work to coordinate care and reduce costs for the highest Medicaid utilizers. Training in environments fostering delivery system innovation, interdisciplinary care models, and continuous measurement of quality and costs would prepare these residents to thrive as ACO clinical leaders.\n\nThe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) has the authority to develop and test innovative GME demonstrations in addition to its current portfolio of innovative delivery system and payment models. Because CHAMP THCs represent innovations to both health care delivery and workforce training, CMMI would be an appropriate source to evaluate outcomes of these innovative models. CMMI could establish ten demonstrations throughout the country with up to ten residents at each site. Academic Medical Centers that are already participating in or considering joining the Medicare Pioneer ACO or Medicare Shared Savings programs could be promising sites to test CHAMPs because of their clinical innovation.\n\nIn order for CHAMP Medicaid THC programs to be included by primary care residencies in the 2016 residency match, support for demonstration programs should be awarded by the summer of 2015. For tracks of established programs, accreditation could be rapid. With the recent development of a single GME accreditation system for residency training in the United States, all programs will be governed by the same accreditation standards and processes, and comparability of programs will be enhanced. Administrative processes for extension of existing accreditation programs, or creation of new ones, will be clear.\n\nMost importantly, all potential residents will be eligible for every funded program. Because the first year of residency training would occur predominantly within teaching hospitals, recruitment of ambulatory faculty and expansion of ambulatory training sites could occur concurrently with recruitment of residents.\n\nCMMI is already investing billions of dollars to support demonstrations testing new delivery system and payment models. Investing in educational innovations such as CHAMPs is essential to producing the workforce that will lead tomorrow\u2019s transformed delivery system. If the CMMI pilot programs are effective, these innovative GME models could be supported in the future by the Transformation Fund proposed by the IOM.\n\nAn Attainable Pathway to GME Expansion\n\nIn conjunction with a proposal aligning GME expansion with IOM recommendations for GME reform (See Note 3), we offer a near term and attainable pathway to GME expansion. The urgency of targeted GME expansion is highlighted by a recent report from the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services indicating that there is wide variability in States\u2019 monitoring Medicaid patients\u2019 access to services. A forthcoming companion report will address substantial problems in timeliness of care. Due to a surge of ACA supported Medicaid patients, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that 1 in 4 Americans will be on Medicaid at some time during the coming year.\n\nAn expansion of CHCs to enhance access to primary care for new ACA Medicaid beneficiaries is already underway. Further expansion of CHCs will require a ready health care workforce that could be greatly enhanced via an expanded THC GME pipeline. Thus, this attainable pathway for targeted immediate expansion of GME should be implemented quickly to meet the rapid increase in health access demand, to prevent that demand from showing up in emergency rooms and other expensive settings, and to initiate some of the recommendations of the IOM GME Report without delay.\n\nWe have proposed the continued support of the almost 600 primary care positions established by the THC GME program, as well as developing additional VA-, Medicaid- and CMMI-supported positions. These positions represent a magnitude of expansion similar to that proposed in current GME legislation. However, our proposals seek to solve most urgent workforce needs, offer more limited and less controversial Congressional action, and lack any immediate incursion on Medicaid GME funding. They are therefore more likely to serve as a foundation for Allopathic and Osteopathic medical schools, multiple professional societies, and other essential GME stakeholders to forge the necessary consensus regarding targeted expansion of GME.\n\nBecause implementation of GME expansion will require substantial time and planning, building a consensus among GME stakeholders around a feasible and attainable pathway for GME expansion must be pursued immediately. Following on the Health Affairs event, an expanded GME forum organized by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and sponsored by foundations committed to the quality of GME should be convened as soon as possible to develop a consensus, utilizing this proposal as a foundation for discussion.\n\nNote 1\n\nRockey PH, Rieselbach RE, Neuhausen K, Nasca TJ, Phillips RL, Sundwall DN, Philibert I, Yaghnour NA.
