Usually, Sunday afternoons are quiet and easy going for staff at the bar, but this Sunday was just as busy as a rowdy Saturday night.\n\nUnfortunately for the bar owner, sales did not reach the $10,000 mark like he would have liked, but they still were well above normal.\n\nIn the mix of people were two stay-at-home moms; they saw the game as an opportunity to make a little money. \"We had the idea on our patio,\" said Desi Connor, one of the moms, \"everyone is a shocker fan right now.\" Connor and her friend Sarah Buell made headbands out of t-shirt fabric, printed on them was the word \"angry\" with a shock of wheat next to it.\n\nIt was very opportunistic for these ladies to sell the WSU apparel at a WSU game, and even better for them, each band was selling for $10 a piece. Neither women had a figure for how much money they had made, but they did say they were selling them so fast it was hard to keep up.\n\nToday is the last day these women will be able to sell the headbands with much success.
