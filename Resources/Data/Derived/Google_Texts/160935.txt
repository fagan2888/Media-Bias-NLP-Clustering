Young Americans for Liberty, a college activist group with some 500 chapters and 162,000 members, has rolled out a new educational tool to teach young people about how policies pushed by the Obama administration and some Republicans are robbing them of opportunity.

What the group has done is taken beer pong, a drinking game ordinarily reserved for college parties and spring break, and put a brilliant new spin on it as part of its “War on Youth Activism Kit.”

Young Americans for Liberty’s version of the game, “Giant Debt Pong,” gives student activists a chance to teach their fellow classmates about their $150,289 share of the national debt. Students who participate in the same will need to hit six buckets labeled with “solution stickers” that they have to hit to pay off their share of the debt. These policies are part of what the group calls the “War on Youth.”

But it’s not as easy as it sounds. Included in the “War on Youth Activism Kit” is a Barack Obama Fathead that a Young Americans for Liberty activist will use to try to knock away your attempt to rid yourself of your share of the national debt.

Young Americans for Liberty is encouraging student activists to “[u]se this opportunity to make the connection between the disconnect the government has with our generation,” through the Obamacare, warfare state, cronyism, and other misguided policies that are tantamount to generational theft.
