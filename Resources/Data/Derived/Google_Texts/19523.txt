A year after elect­or­al de­feat, sev­en months after an am­bi­tious blue­print to mod­ern­ize, ex­pand, and win back the White House, the Re­pub­lic­an brand is still dam­aged goods.

Re­pub­lic­ans are get­ting the brunt of the blame for a gov­ern­ment shut­down that re­in­forces the neg­at­ive im­age laced through the 2012 exit polling of a party that’s ex­treme and out of touch. Im­mig­ra­tion re­form, viewed as pivotal to keep­ing pace with an in­creas­ingly di­verse elect­or­ate, is stalled in the Re­pub­lic­an-con­trolled House. As the shut­down per­sists and the debt ceil­ing crisis looms, the di­vide is widen­ing between a con­ser­vat­ive grass­roots that rel­ishes the show­down over Obama­care and a polit­ic­al es­tab­lish­ment that be­lieves the stan­doff is hinder­ing its goal of be­com­ing the gov­ern­ing party.

In its latest party-build­ing ef­fort, the RNC hos­ted a His­pan­ic Her­it­age month re­cep­tion Tues­day amid plans to dis­patch field op­er­at­ives to sev­en states with grow­ing His­pan­ic pop­u­la­tions. But against the back­drop of thou­sands of protest­ors on the Na­tion­al Mall de­mand­ing con­gres­sion­al Re­pub­lic­ans take up im­mig­ra­tion re­form, it was the latest ex­ample of the na­tion­al party mak­ing pro­gress on mech­an­ics, not mes­saging.

“It’s like one step for­ward, two steps back,” said Flor­ida-based Re­pub­lic­an con­sult­ant Sally Brad­shaw, one of the co-chairs of the RNC re­view of the 2012 elec­tion. “The RNC is com­mit­ted to the is­sues we raised, but I feel per­son­ally frus­trated be­cause I still see some mem­bers of our party who just don’t get it.”

There are early signs of fal­lout in the 2013-2014 elec­tion cycle. Though Re­pub­lic­an gubernat­ori­al can­did­ate Ken Cuc­cinelli spent the last 10 days try­ing to dis­tance him­self from the shut­down, two polls re­leased Tues­day showed him fall­ing be­hind Demo­crat Terry McAul­iffe in the Vir­gin­ia gov­ernor’s race.

“He’s the first cas­u­alty,” whis­pers one prom­in­ent na­tion­al party lead­er.

Demo­crats run­ning for statewide of­fice in 2014, from likely Flor­ida gubernat­ori­al con­tender Charlie Crist to Geor­gia Sen­ate can­did­ate Michelle Nunn, are po­s­i­tion­ing them­selves to cap­it­al­ize on the shut­down with bi-par­tis­an ap­peals in main­stream me­dia.

Three of Nunn’s Re­pub­lic­an rivals, Reps. Paul Broun, Phil Gin­grey and Jack King­ston, are Re­pub­lic­an House mem­bers who voted to fund the gov­ern­ment only if the health care law was delayed. So did some of the GOP’s oth­er prom­ising Sen­ate can­did­ates, in­clud­ing Reps. Shel­ley Moore Capito of West Vir­gin­ia, Tom Cot­ton of Arkan­sas, and Bill Cas­sidy of Louisi­ana. It’s “Bill Cas­sidy’s Gov­ern­ment Shut­down,” de­clared the Louisi­ana Demo­crat­ic Party in an e-mail blast on Tues­day as­sign­ing ex­clus­ive blame.

The Demo­crat­ic Na­tion­al Com­mit­tee and Or­gan­iz­ing for Ac­tion, the ad­vocacy arm of Pres­id­ent Obama’s cam­paign, are us­ing the shut­down to ham­mer Re­pub­lic­ans in tele­vi­sion spots, on-line ads, auto­mated calls, and so­cial me­dia. “Tell the tea party, enough already!” says the OFA ad.

A string of Re­pub­lic­an-weary polls is lay­ing the ground­work for the me­dia blitz. The latest United Tech­no­lo­gies/Na­tion­al Journ­al Con­gres­sion­al Con­nec­tion Poll finds two out of three Amer­ic­ans dis­agree with the Re­pub­lic­an strategy of ty­ing the health care law to fund­ing the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment. A re­cent CNN poll re­por­ted 69 per­cent of Amer­ic­ans think con­gres­sion­al Re­pub­lic­ans are “act­ing like spoiled chil­dren.” Re­pub­lic­ans in Con­gress hit new lows in a re­cent Quin­nipi­ac Uni­versity sur­vey that looked at ap­prov­al rat­ing and a gen­er­ic match-up against a Demo­crat­ic can­did­ate.

The Demo­crat­ic Party and Pres­id­ent Obama also are los­ing ground, but sur­vey after sur­vey shows Re­pub­lic­ans get­ting the li­on’s share of the blame.

Even Cuc­cinelli, who as the state at­tor­ney gen­er­al cru­saded to re­peal the health care law, has found him­self do­ing dam­age con­trol over the shut­down. He’s called for mem­bers of Con­gress to de­cline paychecks and for fur­loughed work­ers to get paid. He also aired a ra­dio spot de­clar­ing he “op­poses a gov­ern­ment shut­down” and made sure he was not pho­to­graphed at a re­cent event with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, whose 21-hour speech on the Sen­ate floor pre­cip­it­ated the budget im­passe.

It isn’t help­ing, said Quentin Kidd, dir­ect­or of the Wason Cen­ter for Pub­lic Policy at Chris­toph­er New­port Uni­versity, which found McAul­iffe lead­ing Cuc­cinelli by nine points in a new poll. More than one out of 10 Re­pub­lic­ans who cite the state’s busi­ness cli­mate is their biggest con­cern say they won’t vote for Cuc­cinelli.

“I think the shut­down does hurt Cuc­cinelli be­cause it’s con­sist­ent with a lar­ger nar­rat­ive that McAul­iffe has en­cour­aged, which is that he wants to force his views on people,” Kidd said. “Even though Cruz didn’t stand on stage with Cuc­cinelli, the cov­er­age linked Cuc­cinelli’s cam­paign to what’s go­ing on in Wash­ing­ton in a way that con­firms some people’s sus­pi­cions about him.”

The shut­down is also cast­ing Con­gress’s few ac­com­plish­ments this year in­to sharp re­lief. Law­makers re­newed the Vi­ol­ence Against Wo­men Act and ap­proved aid to Hur­ricane Sandy vic­tims only after over­com­ing fierce res­ist­ance from Re­pub­lic­an con­ser­vat­ives. Slash­ing food stamp fund­ing by $40 bil­lion and out­law­ing abor­tion after 20 weeks were among the only oth­er ma­jor bills that cleared the Re­pub­lic­an-led House. As mil­lions of un­in­sured Amer­ic­ans start sign­ing up un­der the new health care law, the shut­down looks like a lost cause that’s done little to pro­mote Re­pub­lic­an pri­or­it­ies of cut­ting fed­er­al spend­ing, re­form­ing en­ti­tle­ment pro­grams, and re­du­cing the na­tion­al debt.

“It’s im­per­at­ive for Re­pub­lic­ans in Wash­ing­ton to talk more about what we’re for,” said Ed Gillespie, a former chair­man of the Re­pub­lic­an Na­tion­al Com­mit­tee. “Giv­ing voice to an­ger and frus­tra­tion helps en­er­gize our core voters, but it doesn’t en­er­gize voters in the middle who are go­ing to re­spond more to hope and op­tim­ism than to talk of de­fund­ing, re­peal­ing and block­ing things.”

Gillespie now leads the Re­pub­lic­an State Lead­er­ship Com­mit­tee, which aims to re­cruit hun­dreds of minor­ity and fe­male can­did­ates by 2014. On Tues­day, the RSLC an­nounced that one of the most prom­in­ent His­pan­ic Re­pub­lic­ans in the coun­try, former Pu­erto Rico Gov. Lu­is For­tuno, was join­ing its board. For­tuno, who head­lined the RNC’s His­pan­ic Her­it­age re­cep­tion on Tues­day, said the party’s out­reach to the fast­est-grow­ing slice of the elect­or­ate will fall short without im­mig­ra­tion re­form passing Con­gress. Ac­cord­ing to a re­cent on-line sur­vey by the Pub­lic Re­li­gion Re­search In­sti­tute, less than three in ten His­pan­ics say they feel closer to the Re­pub­lic­an Party than they did in the past.

“If someone feels we don’t want them here, the thrust of our prin­ciples will not get through and it will be very dif­fi­cult to get a Re­pub­lic­an pres­id­ent elec­ted,” For­tuno said.

Mean­while, the of­fi­cial party ap­par­at­us is do­ing what it can to make good on some of the prom­ises made in the 97-page “Growth and Op­por­tun­ity Pro­ject” re­leased in March.

Build­ing a ground game is un­der­way in Vir­gin­ia and New Jer­sey, which will hold gubernat­ori­al elec­tions next month. The RNC hired a former Face­book en­gin­eer as its chief tech­no­logy of­ficer and opened a Sil­ic­on Val­ley of­fice. The party is also hir­ing a small army to make in­roads in the Afric­an-Amer­ic­an, His­pan­ic, and Asi­an-Amer­ic­an com­munit­ies, while Chair­man Re­ince Priebus has made a spree of ap­pear­ances be­fore minor­ity audi­ences and me­dia out­lets.

Priebus has also vowed to move up the nom­in­at­ing con­ven­tion and lim­it the num­ber of primary de­bates so the party can in­vest more time and re­sources in­to the 2016 gen­er­al elec­tion.

“At the mech­an­ic­al level there has been a lot of pro­gress and all of that is ter­ribly im­port­ant, but as far as mes­saging it’s fair to say alarm bells are ringing,” said former White House press sec­ret­ary Ari Fleis­cher, an­oth­er co-chair of the RNC re­port. “You can’t reach con­clu­sions about next Novem­ber while we’re in the middle of this fight, but our over­all im­age has still not re­covered.”
