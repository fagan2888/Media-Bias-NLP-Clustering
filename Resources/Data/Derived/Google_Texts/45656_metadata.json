That is, it violates an election law\u2014this isn\u2019t anything related to slander or libel, which has higher standards of proof for public figures\u2014to make \u201cfalse statements\u201d in campaign-related contexts.\n\nDuring the 2010 House Elections, a pro-life advocacy group called the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List), published ads in Ohio claiming that then-Rep. Steven Driehaus, who was running for re-election, had voted to fund abortions with federal money (because he had voted for Obamacare). Rather than contesting the truth of these claims in the court of public opinion, Driehaus filed a complaint with the Ohio Election Commission (OEC) under a state law that makes it a crime to \u201cdisseminate a false statement concerning a candidate, either knowing the same to be false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false.\u201d\n\nWhile the complaint was ultimately dropped, the SBA List took Driehaus and the OEC to federal court, seeking to have this law declared unconstitutional and thus enable advocacy groups to have more freedom going forward. The case has now reached the Supreme Court.\n\nJoined by legendary satirist (and Cato\u2019s H.L. Mencken Research Fellow) P.J. O\u2019Rourke, our brief supports the SBA List and reminds the Court of the important role that \u201ctruthiness\u201d\u2014facts you feel you in heart, not in your head\u2014plays in American politics, and the importance of satire and spin more broadly. We ask the Court a simple yet profound question: Doesn\u2019t the First Amendment\u2019s guarantee of free speech protect one man\u2019s truth even if it happens to be another man\u2019s lie? And who\u2019s to judge\u2014and on what scale\u2014when a statement slides \u201ctoo far\u201d into the realm of falsehood?\n\nHowever well intentioned Ohio legislators may have been, laws that criminalize \u201cfalse\u201d speech don\u2019t replace truthiness and snark with high-minded ideas and \u201cjust the facts.\u201d Instead, they chill speech, replacing the sort of vigorous political dialogue that\u2019s at the core of the democratic process with silence. The Supreme Court of all institutions should understand that just because a statement isn\u2019t fully true, that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t have its place in public discourse. Moreover, pundits and satirists are much-better placed to evaluate and send-up half-truths than government agencies.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear argument in Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus on April 22.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Criminalizing political speech is no laughing matter, so the Supreme Court should strike down an Ohio law banning \u201cfalse\u201d statements.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "Criminalizing political speech is no laughing matter, so the Supreme Court should strike down an Ohio law banning \"false\" statements.", "title": "In Defense of Truthiness", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/defense-truthiness", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/defense-truthiness", "title": "In Defense of Truthiness", "description": "Criminalizing political speech is no laughing matter, so the Supreme Court should strike down an Ohio law banning \"false\" statements.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2014/3/2", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-02T12:39:35-05:00"}, "publication_date": "2014/3/2", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb80e\"", "article_summary": "Believe it or not, it\u2019s illegal in Ohio to lie about politicians, for politicians to lie about other politicians, or for politicians to lie about themselves.\nIf you only read one Cato brief this Supreme Court term, it should be this one.\nThe Supreme Court will hear argument in Susan B.
