That stereotype was pretty accurate for the past century, but times are changing.\n\nCultural and economic shifts over the past decade are realigning the demographics of the world\u2019s 1 percent, and the billionaires of the future will be self-made, younger, and more diverse, according to a new report from UBS and PwC.\n\nLast year, two-thirds of the world\u2019s billionaires were self-made, compared with just 43 percent of billionaires 20 years ago. The report projects that the trend toward more self-made billionaires will continue get stronger over the next 5 to 10 years, peaking at about 70 percent of the billionaire population.\n\nRelated: Playgrounds of the Very Rich and Famous\u2014A 2015 Guide\n\nWhile two-thirds of current billionaires are over age 60, the average age is getting younger, thanks to both wealth transfers from the older generation and the growth of self-made billionaires.\n\nIn addition to getting younger, the report finds that billionaires are also increasingly more diverse. From 2003 to 2013, the number of female billionaires rose from 44 to 116. That\u2019s still less than 10 percent, but it\u2019s a number that\u2019s growing fast.\n\nPart of the trend toward diversity among billionaires is the explosive growth of wealth in Asia. In the first quarter of 2015, China created a new billionaire almost every week. The authors of the report expect that Asia will overtake the United States as the center of billionaire growth in the next decade.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Quick, picture a billionaire.
