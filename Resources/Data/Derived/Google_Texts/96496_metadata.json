Kimberley Fugate, her husband Craig, and Dr. James Bofill anticipated the arrival of three, but when the doctor looked at Fugate and said, \u201cmore feet,\u201d he announced there was a fourth girl on the way. The surprise sister, Kelsey, joined her identical sisters Kenleigh, Kristen, and Kaleigh at the University of Mississippi Medical Center\u2019s (UMC) neonatal intensive unit care (ICU) on Feb. 8.\n\nFugate's husband, Craig, did not know about the fourth child until she showed him the four ID bracelets on her wrist. UMC\n\n\"We\u2019ve seen quadruplets here before, but we\u2019ve never seen identical quadruplets,\u201d Bofill told The Clarion Ledger. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this case so unique and unusual.\u201d Bofill, aware of the odds of spontaneous quadruplets \u2014 one in 729,000 conceived without fertility \u2014 admitted he thought \u201cshe was kidding\u201d when one of his colleagues told him the news. \u201cI was very embarrassed, obviously.\u201d This was the first time in 27 years Bofill discovered an unexpected baby during the delivery.\n\nKristen Fugate in neonatal ICU.

UMC\n\nWhile it is still unknown as to what makes a single zygote separate into identical twins, triplets, or quadruplets, according to Womenshealth.gov, the single egg is fertilized by one single sperm which quickly and evenly divides into four separate zygotes. The formation of these rare set of identical quadruplets means that all four will share the same identical DNA, sex, characteristics, and features. Women pregnant with multiples, along with their newborns, are at risk for a series of health complications.\n\nMost of the time, 60 percent of all twins and more than 90 percent of triplets are born prematurely \u2014 before 37 weeks \u2014 the average quad pregnancy lasts an average of 29 weeks. Fugate\u2019s four baby girls, identical quads, were born just shy of 13 weeks premature, each weighing the following, according to CNN:\n\nKenleigh Rosa was born at 7:55, weighing 2 lbs., 1 ounce.\n\nKristen Sue was born at 7:57 weighing 2 lbs., 4 oz.\n\nKayleigh Pearl was born at 7:58 weighing 2 lbs., 8 oz.\n\nAnd Kelsey Roxanne was born a minute later, weighing 2 lbs., 6 oz.\n\nWhile babies born under 5.5 lbs. are considered to have a low birth weight and often face difficulties breathing on their own, fighting infections, controlling body temperature, and putting on weight, UMMC reassured the girls are doing well in the neonatal ICU. Doctors are taking precautions with the girls because premature babies may have some organs, such as their lungs and brain, not fully developed. Also, their immune system may not be ready to ward off infection, and they may not be able to suck or swallow on their own.\n\nThe Fugate girls original due date was May 2. They are expected to stay in neonatal ICU until this day, according to UMMC hospital spokeswoman Jennifer Hospodor, CNN reported. \"It is possible that some or all of the girls would be stronger enough to go home before that, or have to stay longer. It depends on how they develop over the next 12 weeks,\" she said.\n\nNothing of the 42-year-old mom\u2019s pregnancy was planned, but nonetheless, she considers it a \u201cblessing\u201d and is more than happy that her identical quadruplets are all healthy. Fugate has a 10-year-old daughter Katelyn, who will most likely babysit the bunch, later. Does the mother of five plan on having more children? \u201cThis. Is. It.\u201d she told The Clarion Ledger.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "identical quadruplets, triplets, pregnancy, multiples, twins, triplets, fertility treatment, fertility assistance, kimberly fugate, umc, mississippi", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Kimberly Fugate, 42-year-old mom, delivers identical quadruplets without fertility treatment, after expecting only triplets.", "title": "Woman, 42, Expecting Triplets, Delivers Identical Quadruplets [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/woman-42-delivers-identical-quadruplets-without-fertility-treatment-mom-had-expected-triplets-photos", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/17/kimberly-fugate-delivers-4-identical-quadruplets.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kimberly Fugate, 42-year-old mom, delivers identical quadruplets without fertility treatment, after expecting only triplets.", "title": "Woman, 42, Expecting Triplets, Delivers Identical Quadruplets [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/woman-42-delivers-identical-quadruplets-without-fertility-treatment-mom-had-expected-triplets-photos", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/17/kimberly-fugate-delivers-4-identical-quadruplets.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/17/kimberly-fugate-delivers-4-identical-quadruplets.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-02-17T18:01:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-17T18:01:02-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Kimberly Fugate, 42-year-old mom, delivers identical quadruplets without fertility treatment, after expecting only triplets."}, "article_summary": "UMC\"We\u2019ve seen quadruplets here before, but we\u2019ve never seen identical quadruplets,\u201d Bofill told The Clarion Ledger.\nThe formation of these rare set of identical quadruplets means that all four will share the same identical DNA, sex, characteristics, and features.\nThey are expected to stay in neonatal ICU until this day, according to UMMC hospital spokeswoman Jennifer Hospodor, CNN reported.\nNothing of the 42-year-old mom\u2019s pregnancy was planned, but nonetheless, she considers it a \u201cblessing\u201d and is more than happy that her identical quadruplets are all healthy.\nKristen Fugate in neonatal ICU."}
