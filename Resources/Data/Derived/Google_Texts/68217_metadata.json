But not when that donor is spending $175 million to get Republicans to talk about clean energy and the solutions to the climate crisis.\n\nEntrepreneur Jay Faison founded the ClearPath Foundation in December of last year in part to restore Republicans\u2019 environmental legacy. Tuesday he announced that he will be investing $175 million on a public education campaign that will include a social media and online advertising to get Republicans to talk about market-based solutions to climate change. That includes $40 million through the 2016 cycle, and another $10 million as a seed fund for a political advocacy group. The foundation invested between $1 and $9 million in a few solar energy projects.\n\nFaison, who comes from a wealthy family and made his fortune selling his audio-visual installation company SnapAV, has contributed over $50,000 to various Republican campaigns, according to campaign finance data from the FEC. These include the North Carolina Republican Party, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Rep. Steve Pearce (R-NM), and Sen. Bob Schaffer (R-CO).\n\n\u201cEnvironmental protection has drifted over time from a topic that once united all Americans,\u201d Faison told the International Business Times, \u201cto one that divides us as a symbol of our opposing political parties.\u201d\n\nTo him the debate on climate change should not be about the science, but the solutions. \u201cWe think that there are real Republican solutions to the problem,\u201d he told Politico.\n\nWhile most party leaders are opposed to acting to solve the climate crisis, and many are dismissive of its existence (including 68 percent of those in Congress), 44 percent of registered Republicans think climate change is real and caused by humans. Another poll found that 48 percent said they are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports climate action.\n\nEnvironmental groups welcomed ClearPath to the conversation.\n\n\u201cIt may or may not be enough, but it\u2019s a really good thing,\u201d Debbie Sease, the Sierra Club\u2019s national campaign director, told ThinkProgress. \u201cIf you look at the scale of what we need to do on climate, you can\u2019t do it with one party, you need Republicans too. It would be naive of me to think it\u2019s the one thing that\u2019ll turn it around, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at how the progress on other environmental issues was made in the past, it was done with leadership from both parties.\u201d\n\nFaison, who according to Politico disdains Obamacare and \u201csupports school choice, tort reform and small government,\u201d has a chance to speak directly to other conservatives who are open to clean energy, or energy choice as it is often called in the Green Tea Party.\n\n\u201cI think it is a good thing,\u201d said Debbie Dooley, a solar advocate who is also co-founder of the Atlanta Tea Party and member of the Tea Party Patriots Board of Directors. \u201cMr. Faison has an excellent reputation, I think he will be very successful. It\u2019s a game-changer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of Republicans that are open-minded and believe in a clean energy future, some from a free market perspective, some from an energy choice perspective, some from a climate perspective. There\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t all work together.\u201d\n\nWith the massive amount of spending expected to surround the 2016 presidential race, it is an open question whether ClearPath can break through.\n\n\u201cJay clearly has a huge uphill battle,\u201d said Craig Holman, Public Citizen\u2019s government affairs lobbyist. \u201cHe will be bringing $175 million, but I\u2019m expecting to see $2 billion or more from outside groups. It\u2019s going to be a bit of a drop in the bucket, from the Koch brothers to Sheldon Adelson, most of whom do not share the position that Jay does on climate change.\u201d\n\nCREDIT: ClearPath screenshot\n\nFaison has personally donated $50,000 to Jeb Bush\u2019s PAC and $25,000 to Lindsey Graham\u2019s. According to Politico he has not picked a candidate because \u201cthis is an issue that \u2026 they haven\u2019t clearly articulated yet.\u201d\n\nGraham has been active on efforts to address climate change in the senate, acknowledging it is happening. Since he announced his presidential campaign, he has said his administration would address \u201caddress climate change, CO2 emissions in a business-friendly way.\u201d When he asks people what the environmental policy of the Republican party is, he says \u201cI get a blank stare.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Republican party continues to be seen as anti-environment, I think they will lose in 2016,\u201d said Tea Partier and solar advocate Dooley.\n\nFaison singled out the millennials looking for \u201cforward-thinking leadership that acknowledges the realities of today\u201d in an interview with National Journal, saying \u201chow our party and our presidential candidate talks about it will have a significant impact over voter perception, and I think the Democratic candidates know this.\n\nIf Faison succeeds in convincing large numbers of his party to push for action to solve climate change, they will have to actually work to solve those problems with Democrats and climate advocates that may disagree with them on specifics, such as whether nuclear power is worthwhile.\n\n\u201cThere will be a group of Republicans whose solutions are not necessarily the set of solutions we would prefer, but getting them to think on it is a good step,\u201d said Sease.\n\nFaison has not espoused a particular solution, saying it\u2019s \u201ca little early to talk about which options are right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to elevate the discussion about those menu items,\u201d he said.\n\nSease readily acknowledges that ClearPath will not be able to change the minds of all those skeptical of doing something about climate change, \u201cit\u2019s a step in the right direction. It starts a dialogue.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce you actually accept the fact that climate change is real, it\u2019s caused by man, and controlling greenhouse gases is the way to address it,\u201d Sease says, \u201cit sets you down a clear path of clean energy and energy efficiency.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"It's a good thing,\" said the Sierra Club's Debbie Sease. \"I think it is a good thing,\" said Debbie Dooley, co-founder of the Atlanta Tea Party.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"It's a good thing,\" said the Sierra Club's Debbie Sease. \"I think it is a good thing,\" said Debbie Dooley, co-founder of the Atlanta Tea Party.", "title": "Top Republican Donor To Spend $175 Million To Get His Party To Take Climate Change Seriously", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/06/09/3667477/republican-donor-pushes-gop-on-climate/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/gop-money.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"It's a good thing,\" said the Sierra Club's Debbie Sease. \"I think it is a good thing,\" said Debbie Dooley, co-founder of the Atlanta Tea Party.", "creator": "@koronet", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/gop-money-320x213.png", "title": "Top Republican Donor To Spend $175 Million To Get His Party To Take Climate Change Seriously", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-climate", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/gop-money.png", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/gop-money.png", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-09T17:00:58+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ryankoronowski"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Climate Top Republican Donor To Spend $175 Million To Get His Party To Take Climate Change Seriously CREDIT: Dylan PetrohilosUsually the news that a major Republican donor will be dropping hundreds of millions of dollars on a campaign to influence voters on energy and climate change would make environmentalists worried.\nThese include the North Carolina Republican Party, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Sen.
