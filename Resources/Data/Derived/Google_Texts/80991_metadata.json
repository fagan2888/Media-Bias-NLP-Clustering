It would bring the number of hotels in the township to 10 \u2014 several other hotels in Marshall are only blocks away from Cranberry.\n\n\u201cWe think it a great use of this property. There is demand for this type of hotel in the area,\u201d said Ron Henshaw, Cranberry's director of community development.\n\nThe township's planning commission is reviewing the developer's plans, which could go before Cranberry supervisors as soon as Aug. 23, Henshaw said.\n\nFormerly known as Value Place hotels, Woodspring Suites has 196 hotels in 32 states.\n\nThe company expects to start work on 30 additional properties by the end of this year, according to its website. Expansion plans through 2017 for the company include the addition of corporate and franchised properties in markets such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Seattle, Miami and Minneapolis.\n\nCranberry would be the hotel chain's second location in Pennsylvania and first in Western Pennsylvania. It will be corporate-owned. The chain's only other Pennsylvania hotel is in Allentown, Lehigh County.\n\nConstruction of the hotel is expected to cost between $6 million and $8 million, Knowles said.\n\nThe hotel will offer only a few rooms for nightly stays, which will be at a different rate than a weekly or monthly stay, Knowles said.\n\nWith the exception of the city of Butler, residential rental properties in the county are scant and expensive \u2014 a condition made worse by job growth and demand for temporary housing from out-of-state natural gas drillers, local officials have said.\n\nIt's also generally not profitable to be a landlord \u2014 at least in southern Butler County, real estate experts have said.\n\nIn the city of Butler, the loss of manufacturing jobs left many homes vacant and up for rent.\n\nOnly 12 percent of Cranberry's residential units are rentals, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nRick Wills is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
