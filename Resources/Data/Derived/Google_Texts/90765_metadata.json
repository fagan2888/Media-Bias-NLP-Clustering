A successful sale would allow P&G to focus on more profitable consumer brands such as its Gillette razors, Tide detergent and Pampers disposable diapers.\n\nHenkel is interested in buying P&G's haircare business, which includes the Wella and Clairol brands, the sources said, declining to be named because the matter is private. The haircare business is worth about $7 billion based on annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around $500 million, the sources said.\n\nRevlon, the owner of makeup brands such as Almay, is eyeing P&G's cosmetics business, which includes drugstore brands CoverGirl and Max Factor. That business has annual EBITDA of around $350 million, the people said.\n\nCoty, which makes perfume for fashion brands Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs and owns nail polish brand OPI and Rimmel mascara, is likely interested in P&G's fragrance unit, though it could also look at buying P&G's cosmetics business as well, the sources said.\n\nP&G's fragrance unit includes brands such as Hugo Boss and Gucci and has EBITDA of around $250 million, they said.\n\nIt remains unclear whether P&G will try to sell its brands as part of a package, whose value could range from $10 billion to $12 billion, or piecemeal. P&G could also decide to scrap the sale entirely and instead look to spin off the unit, the sources added.\n\nRepresentatives for P&G and Revlon declined to comment. Coty and Henkel did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nP&G is looking to sell some of its beauty brands as part of a cost-cutting strategy by Chief Executive Officer A.G. Lafley. Lafley said in August he would reverse the Cincinnati-based company's strategy of aggressive expansion and shed more than half its brands.\n\nP&G said it would concentrate on 70 to 80 brands that have accounted for 90 percent of its sales over the past three years.\n\nP&G has already divested some of its non-core brands. Last year, the company sold its Duracell battery brand to Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $4.7 billion in stock and also sold some of its soap brands to Unilever PLC.\n\n(Reporting by Olivia Oran in New York, Arno Schuetze in Frankfurt and Martinne Geller in London; Additional reporting by Freya Berry in London; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Cynthia Osterman)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - Personal care and cosmetics companies Henkel & Co KGaA AG, Revlon Inc", "title": "Exclusive: Henkel, Revlon, Coty prepare bids for P&G beauty brands -sources", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/04/15/Exclusive-Henkel-Revlon-Coty-prepare-PG-beauty-brand-offers-sources", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/procter_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/04/15/Exclusive-Henkel-Revlon-Coty-prepare-PG-beauty-brand-offers-sources", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/procter_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "(Reuters) - Personal care and cosmetics companies Henkel & Co KGaA AG, Revlon Inc", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08f3\"", "article_summary": "P&G's fragrance unit includes brands such as Hugo Boss and Gucci and has EBITDA of around $250 million, they said.\nRevlon, the owner of makeup brands such as Almay, is eyeing P&G's cosmetics business, which includes drugstore brands CoverGirl and Max Factor.\n(Reuters) - Personal care and cosmetics companies Henkel & Co KGaA AG, Revlon Inc and Coty Inc are preparing bids for parts of Procter & Gamble Co's beauty business, according to sources.\nHenkel is interested in buying P&G's haircare business, which includes the Wella and Clairol brands, the sources said, declining to be named because the matter is private.\nP&G could also decide to scrap the sale entirely and instead look to spin off the unit, the sources added."}
