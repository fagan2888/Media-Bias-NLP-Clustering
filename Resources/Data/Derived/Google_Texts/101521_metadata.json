By releasing more moisture-filled air into your home, these handy gadgets could help you fight the flu, ease dry eye, and combat dry skin and sinuses. Thing is, there\u2019s a chance you\u2019re not cleaning yours properly\u2014and you could be setting yourself up to get seriously sick.\n\nStudies have shown that as many as 75% of swab samples from humidifiers reveal fungal growth, while as many as 87% reveal bacteria growth, says Aileen M. Marty, MD, an infectious diseases professor at Florida International University. \u201cThis happens not only in homes, but also in clinics and hospitals\u2014including ICUs,\u201d she says.\n\nBreathing contaminated air from a dirty humidifier puts you at increased risk for developing pneumonia, asthma attacks, or lung conditions such as Legionnaire\u2019s disease. And if you have a chronic breathing condition, a humidifier can actually aggravate symptoms: \u201cAlthough increased humidity can ease breathing in children and adults who have asthma or allergies, ironically, when the humidifier is releasing dirty mist\u2014mist that may include an increased growth of fungi that act as allergens\u2014they can trigger or worsen asthma and allergy symptoms,\u201d Dr. Marty says.\n\nHere, four important ways to use your humidifier safely.\n\nRELATED: 22 Ways to Survive Cold and Flu Season\n\nChange the water often\n\n\u201cBacteria and fungi thrive in standing water left inside of a humidifier\u2014and a whole lot of them will accumulate in only a couple of days,\u201d Dr. Marty warns. For this reason, you should ideally change the water in your humidifier every day to prevent bacteria and fungus from taking over, especially if you use a \u201ccool mist\u201d or ultrasonic humidifier. Humidifier filters should be replaced every two months.\n\nRELATED: 20 Things You Shouldn\u2019t Do Before Bed\n\nNot all cleaning methods are created equal\n\nSimple cleaning solutions are best here. Dr. Marty recommends using water or an alcohol-based cleaner to refresh your humidifier, being sure to unplug the unit before emptying the water tank, then drying the inside surfaces and refilling with clean water. If there are any mineral deposits or film on the top of the tank, remove them using an ethanol-based cleaner, such as Purell Cottony Soft Sanitizing Wipes ($4; drugstore.com).\n\n\u201cYou should never use chemical cleaners, such as products that contain hydrogen peroxide,\u201d she says. The reason? \u201cThere is a horrible condition that can develop if someone uses the wrong type of humidifier disinfectant called \u2018humidifier disinfectant-associated lung injury.\u2019 It\u2019s characterized by spontaneous air leak in their lungs, rapid progression, lack of response to treatment, and can even be fatal.\u201d\n\nUse the right water\n\nSorry, but tap won\u2019t cut it. \u201cYou should always fill your humidifier with bottled, pre-filtered, or demineralized water,\u201d says Dr. Marty. Demineralized cartridges or filters are also helpful to use if compatible with your unit, he adds. And although you might be tempted to think that using filtered water will let you skip a cleaning or two, that\u2019s not the case: \u201cEven when you use filtered water, you still have to clean and store your humidifier properly every day,\u201d she says.\n\nRELATED: 21 Natural Ways to Prevent and Treat Headaches\n\nReplace it\n\n\u201cOver time, humidifiers eventually build up deposits that are difficult or impossible to remove and encourage growth of bacteria and fungi,\u201d Dr. Marty says. In other words, if your unit is more than a few years old or if you haven\u2019t been cleaning it regularly, it\u2019s better to err on the safe side and invest in a new one. The good news?
