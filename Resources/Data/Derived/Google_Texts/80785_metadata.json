And evidence from an undercover investigation also took away the strip club's beer license.\n\n\u201cWe as a city could not allow it to continue to function in its capacity,\u201d Edwards added.\n\n7/6/2015 Related Story: Arrest Warrants Issued For Two Suspects In Del City Deadly Shooting\n\nIt's a piece of property city officials believe is putting a damper on a prime place for new potential businesses.\n\n\u201cThe Oklahoma River, the Native American Museum, access into Bricktown from the east, it\u2019s right at the crossroads of American, which is I-35 and I-40. It\u2019s an excellent location for redevelopment of retail marketing centers,\u201d Edwards insisted.\n\nThe City of Del City owns 17.5 acres about 400 feet west of Fantasy Island and Edwards said they've been putting out feelers with national and regional retailers about that area.\n\n\u201cThe Wal-Marts, the Family Dollars, they\u2019re small, but people like them. Dollar Trees, obviously the Dairy Queens,\u201d he listed.\n\nAnd as negotiations for that land are underway, the city also plans to use earmarked money from the half-cent sales tax to clean up and preserve the unique neighborhood nearby.\n\nCity officials said they plan to eventually rename Scott Street so they can start fresh and remove the negative association attached to the area from a criminal past.\n\nEdwards said Fantasy Island's owners are trying to get their beer license back as well as reopen for adult entertainment. But he's not aware of a court date for those appeals.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Fantasy Island off Interstate 40 near Scott Street in Del City was forced to close recently, after the City Council ruled it was a public nuisance.", "author": "Christy Lewis", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30532018/fantasy-island-forced-to-close-revitalization-of-del-city-underway", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9263862_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Fantasy Island off Interstate 40 near Scott Street in Del City was forced to close recently, after the City Council ruled it was a public nuisance.", "title": "'Fantasy Island' Forced To Close, Revitalization Of Del City Underway"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9263862_G.jpg", "description": "Fantasy Island off Interstate 40 near Scott Street in Del City was forced to close recently, after the City Council ruled it was a public nuisance.", "card": "summary", "title": "'Fantasy Island' Forced To Close, Revitalization Of Del City Underway"}, "wnreadableurl": "fantasy-island-forced-to-close-revitalization-of-del-city-underway", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/11/16", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,tv,cbs,local,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive, Construction", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS27", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,tv,cbs,local,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive, Construction"}, "article_summary": "Fantasy Island off Interstate 40 near Scott Street in Del City was forced to close recently, after the City Council ruled it was a public nuisance.\nIn a September meeting, city officials agreed it posed a grave and immediate danger to the public.\nCiting criminal activity, and dangerous building conditions, city officials say they were forced to act and put an end to adult entertainment at Fantasy Island.\n7/6/2015 Related Story: Arrest Warrants Issued For Two Suspects In Del City Deadly ShootingIt's a piece of property city officials believe is putting a damper on a prime place for new potential businesses.\nEdwards said Fantasy Island's owners are trying to get their beer license back as well as reopen for adult entertainment."}
