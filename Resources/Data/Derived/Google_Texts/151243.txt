The White House press schedule Tuesday indicated that President Obama would be meeting around 3 p.m. ET with black civil rights groups to discuss criminal justice reform and “Obamacare.”

MSNBC’s Al Sharpton will attend the meeting, according to his Instagram. “Reading the papers on the Acela train to D.C,” read the message on a photo Sharpton posted. “Headed to the White House meeting.”

Sharpton is a regular at the White House. Most recently he attended the state dinner held last week to celebrate French President François Hollande.
