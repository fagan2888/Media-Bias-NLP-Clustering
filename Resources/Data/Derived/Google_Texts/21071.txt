RENO, NV - The Veterans Administration healthcare system has been under intense scrutiny in 2014 with long wait times being exposed in places like Phoenix.

At the VA hospital in Reno they are trying to expedite the registration process. You need to bring a photo ID and a copy of your discharge papers also known as a DD214. If you do not have a copy of your DD214, the hospital can try to pull your records.

“That does take a little bit of time,” said Martin Littlejohn, patient benefits supervisor. “Everything processes through in about 30 minutes.”

But if you are feeling ill or it’s an urgent situation the hospital can try and get you registered even faster.

“Say you have the cold or the flu; we have do have an urgent care and the administrative officers over there can take care of all the paperwork while you are getting checked out,” said Darin Farr with the VA public affairs office.

Once the information is in the computer it goes to a national database. A photo ID will come in the mail that is more secure than previous cards.

“They changed where the bar code is,” said Littlejohn. “Now a member ID number that is issued by the VA has no identifying information on it. Your social security number is nowhere on the card.”

Any cost associated with care is based on income and if you have any service-connected disabilities.Once a veteran is in the system, requirements are met for the Affordable Care Act. In some instances a new or returning patient can start receiving care within a few hours after registering. It’s an effort to take the worry out of going to the VA Hospital.

“You should never hesitate, never take your health care for granted,” said Farr. “You don’t want to take any chances because if you are a veteran eligible for enrollment we have all different ways to serve you and help you out.”
