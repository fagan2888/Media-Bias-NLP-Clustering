John Douglas, was dated July 17 but not submitted until last week. It contended that Carter, a state senator, violated rules barring lawmakers and statewide officers from accepting contributions or pledges for campaign cash while the Legislature is in session.\n\nThe fundraiser in question was held March 23 in New York, three days after the legislative session ended, and featured Carter\u2019s grandfather, former president Jimmy Carter, as well as REM front-man Michael Stipe. The invitation is pictured to your right.\n\nGov. Nathan Deal\u2019s campaign and its allies questioned the timing of the invitation, which was sent out before the session gaveled to a close. The invitation noted that it was \u201cpaid for and authorized by Carter for Governor, Inc.\u201d Douglas, now a Newton County commission member, said that was \u201cclear proof\u201d that the event was intended to benefit Carter.\n\nThe Carter campaign has argued that the invitations were legal because the fundraiser went to benefit the Democratic Party of Georgia and not Carter\u2019s campaign. The event went forward as planned, though it\u2019s not certain how much money it raised.\n\nEthics attorney Robert Lane said in the rejection letter that while legislators are banned from soliciting contributions for their campaigns during the session, \u201cthere is no such prohibition that prevents a member of the General Assembly from soliciting campaign funds for political parties or non-candidate campaign committees during a legislative session.\u201d\n\nCarter spokesman Bryan Thomas welcomed the news.\n\n\u201cIt looks like Gov.
