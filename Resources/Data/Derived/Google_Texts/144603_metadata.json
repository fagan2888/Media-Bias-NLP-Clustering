When, say, a nurse leaves after a few months on the job, the resulting loss of time and investment in new hiring can cost one or even two times the equivalent of the staffer\u2019s salary, according to HealthcareSource.\n\nTo ensure that the first person hired for a position is the right one, some health systems are using a combination of behavior assessments, pre-hiring shadow programs and ongoing cross-department conversations between human resources and clinical. When filling clinical positions, it also helps if HR leaders have worked in patient care.\n\nThose are some of the tactics Virginia Commonwealth University Health System has been using to good effect, said Teri Kuttenkuler, HR service line director for patient care services and a registered nurse.\n\n\u201cMy role is really as a liaison between HR and nursing,\u201d said Kuttenkuler, who\u2019s worked at VCU for 32 years, most of them as a nurse before moving to human resources a decade ago.\n\nOne approach that\u2019s \u201cgathered steam in the last year\u201d is a shadowing program, Kuttenkuler said. Many VCU managers in clinical and other areas have done it for years, but more are seeing the value in addressing the retention and cultural fit problems, she said.\n\n\u201cThe candidate knows what they\u2019re getting into and the unit gets a chance to meet the candidate. They can ask questions at the bedside and work with the team,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother tool they\u2019re using is a candidate screening survey, to include when someone\u2019s applying for leadership positions. In one case, Kuttenkuler said, a nursing director had concerns regarding some weaknesses in teamwork she was aware of with a known external applicant for a leadership position. The interview seemed to go well, but the director\u2019s concerns were partly confirmed in the screening survey.\n\nIn the effort to improve retention, Kuttenkuler said she and colleagues have been trying to expand the professional advancement and education program. For instance, VCU recently added a fifth tier in its advancement program with the hope that master\u2019s trained nurses will continue to work at the bedside rather than move on to other jobs.\n\nStrategies like those used at VCU are essential for attracting and keeping the \u201cright\u201d people on staff, but are also practical processes considering the continued pressure on budgets and the need to do more with less and to deliver services efficiently and cost effectively, said Michael DiPietro, chief marketing officer at HealthcareSource, in an email.\n\nTo better accommodate those pressures, said DiPietro, there has been a growing interest in adopting technology that allows for automating some processes to cut costs and reduce the burden of manual work.\n\n\u201cWhen HR teams succeed in recruiting and retaining the right employees through the right technology solutions, healthcare organizations are in a stronger position to deliver quality care \u2013 translating into high levels of cost efficiency, patient safety and satisfaction, and overall HR excellence,\u201d DiPietro said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/innovating-human-resources", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/employee%20benefits.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The human resources department may not be the first department in a health system that comes to mind in the transition to value-based care, but it is increasingly being seen as a source for potential innovation.", "title": "Innovating human resources"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/employee%20benefits.jpg"}, "description": "The human resources department may not be the first department in a health system that comes to mind in the transition to value-based care, but it is increasingly being seen as a source for potential innovation.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Innovating human resources"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The human resources department may not be the first department in a health system that comes to mind in the transition to value-based care, but it is increasingly being seen as a source for potential innovation.&#13; According to an annual survey by HealthcareSource and the American Society of Healthcare Human Resources Association (ASHHRA), from new screening and shadowing programs to retention and continuing education, human resources is key to managing healthcare reform goals.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "According to an annual survey by HealthcareSource and the American Society of Healthcare Human Resources Association (ASHHRA), from new screening and shadowing programs to retention and continuing education, human resources is key to managing healthcare reform goals.\nThe human resources department may not be the first department in a health system that comes to mind in the transition to value-based care, but it is increasingly being seen as a source for potential innovation.\nIn the effort to improve retention, Kuttenkuler said she and colleagues have been trying to expand the professional advancement and education program.\nTo ensure that the first person hired for a position is the right one, some health systems are using a combination of behavior assessments, pre-hiring shadow programs and ongoing cross-department conversations between human resources and clinical.\n\u201cMy role is really as a liaison between HR and nursing,\u201d said Kuttenkuler, who\u2019s worked at VCU for 32 years, most of them as a nurse before moving to human resources a decade ago."}
