Aquarium and Fort Sumter on Sunday, but got so much more than he bargained for.\n\nThe 11-year-old was all smiles at Liberty Square as he ran around the \u201cKid\u2019s Zone\u201d at Charleston\u2019s First Day Festival, an annual last hurrah of sorts marking the end of summer and the beginning of a new school year. It\u2019s a celebration of education where families gather to get free school supplies and the city encourages parents to get involved in their children\u2019s schooling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool, the activities and all the people,\u201d Walton said. \u201cI can\u2019t explain it, like I feel happy.\u201d\n\nHe said his favorite activity was playing baseball because he won a free ticket to see the Charleston Riverdogs.\n\nThe festival, now in its 13th year, is organized by the city of Charleston through the Mayor\u2019s Office for Children, Youth and Families. Free school supplies are a big draw, as are free admission to the aquarium, free boat rides on the harbor, games and food. Director Mindy Sturm didn\u2019t have an official number for turnout, but said the event draws in about 10,000 people each year.\n\n\u201cThis has stayed really crowded the whole day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a great day.\u201d\n\nShe added that one of her favorite parts of the festival was giving out school supplies.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just so heartening, to be able to give kids what they need to start the school year,\u201d Sturm said.\n\nParents were thrilled to take advantage of the free supplies, but there was another event this year that drew a crowd. Volunteers from the Allstate Foundation and Points of Light worked with families to create free disaster-preparedness kits to have on hand in case of emergency. It was a new, one-time activity as part of a stop an educational tour the foundations are taking this year.\n\n\u201cThat seems to be a very popular thing,\u201d Sturm said.\n\nEven near the end of the festival, there was still a line at the booth, located at the Maritime Center. Kits included a flashlight, first-aid kit and cleaning supplies. Other nearby activities were geared toward health and wellness. Volunteers handed out fresh apple and other fruit juices and spoke to kids about the importance of eating well.\n\nTia Grant brought her daughter, 5-year-old Ayanaa Grant, to the festival this year for the second time. \u201cWe came for the school supplies and to visit the aquarium,\u201d she said. \u201cI like it; it\u2019s good for the community, it\u2019s good for the kids and it relieves a financial burden.\u201d\n\nAyanaa stood nearby eating some mandarin oranges, eager to move on to the next activity.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been to everything yet,\u201d she said when asked about her favorite part of the festival. \u201cBut I liked the playground.\u201d\n\nShe added that the event helped her get ready for school, where she likes to \u201cplay outside and have fun.\u201d\n\nTerry Taylor, 12, of Charleston, said the festival also got him thinking about school.\n\n\u201cIt gets you prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s good too, \u2019cause kids can have fun and it\u2019s free.\u201d\n\nFor the Dankert family, First Day Festival has become an integral part of the back-to-school process.\n\n\u201cWe come every year,\u201d said Jessica Dankert as her 7-year-old daughter, Makenzie, tugged on her hand to head to the aquarium. \u201cI just think it\u2019s awesome that the community does this and so many come together. We\u2019re not going to miss it for a long time.\u201d\n\nMakenzie agreed as she warned that the two were running late.\n\n\u201cI get to go in the aquarium and go on the boat,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "First Day Festival draws big crowds before start of school, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Back to school,Charleston,first day festival,school supplies", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Skylour Walton thought he was just going to visit the S.C.
