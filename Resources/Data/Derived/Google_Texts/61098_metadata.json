(AP) \u2014 It\u2019s been years since the old high school football field in Walsenburg, Colorado, saw much action. There\u2019s still an old score board and a boarded-up concession stand, but otherwise it\u2019s just a big patch of dry weeds.\n\nSoon though, it will be a neighborhood unlike almost any other in the country. Later this month, a developer will break ground on the first of 28 tiny houses planned on the three-acre lot.\n\nWalsenburg Mayor James Eccher played football on the field back in the 1980s, and admits he was hesitant when the idea was broached. Would people really want to live in less than 500 square feet?\n\n\u201cI kind of went, ehhhh,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know, it might be a nice fit.\u201d\n\nUltimately, he decided that more homeowners paying property taxes and utility bills can only be a good thing for his community.\n\n\u201cLong as they\u2019re supporting the city, I have no problem with that,\u201d Eccher said.\n\nHis struggling southern Colorado city has been losing residents for decades and Eccher hopes tiny homes might attract some new ones. Maybe retiring RVers, looking to settle down but still keep things small. Or workers at a planned marijuana greenhouse facility nearby.\n\nTo become tiny-house-friendly, Walsenburg didn\u2019t just greenlight one subdivision. Last year, it became the first city in the state, and one of the first in the nation, to change its land use codes to allow tiny homes on any residential lot. They just have to be on a foundation, not a trailer.\n\nIt helps that Walsenburg started out as a city of miners\u2019 cottages, the tiny homes of their day. That means there\u2019s plenty of small lots that a tiny home would be perfect for, Eccher said.\n\nA developer has ambitious plans to turn the old high school football field in Walsenburg, Colorado, into the state\u2019s first tiny house subdivision. Groundbreaking is expected later this month.\n\nWalsenburg\u2019s embrace of micro-housing stands in sharp contrast to what would-be tiny homeowners face in many other communities. They can easily run afoul of minimum square footage rules and limits on manufactured housing and motor homes, said Diane Graham with Sprout Tiny Homes, the La Junta-based developer behind the Walsenburg project.\n\nPotential customers are often disappointed when they realize they can\u2019t buy a tiny home because of their local laws, Graham said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re looking at communities and changing codes, so that people can live in the space they want to live in,\u201d Graham said.\n\nSprout currently has two other micro-housing communities in the works \u2014 one in Salida, the other in Buena Vista. The company\u2019s main focus is to build tiny homes; it\u2019s gotten into the development game to help ensure a market for its products.\n\nOne place Sprout can\u2019t put tiny houses right now is in its hometown of La Junta. City Administrator Rick Klein said officials are open to making La Junta more tiny house-friendly. But cities have size rules for a reason, he said.\n\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t get the mobile home right next door to the $300,000 house that then they start arguing over land values and property values and who\u2019s bringing who down and who\u2019s bringing who\u2019s up,\u201d Klein said.\n\nFor enthusiasts, tiny houses have a sort of design-magazine cache \u2014 and they\u2019re not cheap. Sprout\u2019s largest model starts at $92,000, more than many traditional mobile homes twice its size.\n\nBut lots of local governments don\u2019t see a difference, and neither does the law.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty,\u201d said Barbara Mariner, managing director of tiny house advocacy group Live Simply Colorado. \u201cThere\u2019s no clarity in definition, which we were trying to tackle.\u201d\n\nMariner\u2019s group has been holding educational forums, hoping to build popular support. And state Sen. Kerry Donovan, D-Vail, is looking into whether to run a bill to make things easier for tiny houses. One possibility would be to create a standard definition under the law.\n\nDonovan is asking members of the public to share their ideas and concerns about tiny homes with her as she explores the possibility of legislation. She\u2019s set up an email account to receive comments at ColoradoTinyHome@gmail.com.\n\nThe city of Walsenburg, though, doesn\u2019t need any more encouragement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why a lot of these other communities aren\u2019t doing the same thing,\u201d Eccher, the mayor, said.\n\nThe Colorado Municipal League says many of its members are watching Walsenburg\u2019s tiny house experiment with interest. If it takes off, the state could see other cities getting on board with going small.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nhttp://www.cpr.org/news", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Walsenburg has big hopes for tiny homes", "title": "Walsenburg has big hopes for tiny homes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/11/walsenburg-has-big-hopes-for-tiny-homes/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-11T10:12:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-11T10:12:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5b9\"", "article_summary": "WALSENBURG, Colo.
