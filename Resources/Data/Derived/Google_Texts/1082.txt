JOLIET – Will County can expect an increase on its health insurance premiums next year, but it’s an anticipated 2018 excise tax that has County Board members worried about ballooning costs.

Kathy Soto, vice president of county consultant Aon Hewitt, told members of the board’s Executive Committee on Thursday the county will see a 10 percent rate increase for active and retiree health plans.

County employees will pay more for health insurance in 2016 as part of the union contract agreement reached in 2013 after a 16-day strike. The four-year contract calls for incremental increases, said Bruce Tidwell, director of human resources for the county.

As part of the Affordable Care Act, the county could be hit with a 40 percent excise tax starting in 2018 on health plan premiums that exceed $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage.

“Most employers are going to get hit with this tax at some point,” Soto said. “It’s just a matter of when.”

The tax could amount to $944,932 for the county in 2018. The bulk of the cost – $637,000 – stems from the county’s health plan for retirees under 65, according to projections by Aon Hewitt.

The county offers free health coverage for retirees under 65, but County Board Chairman Jim Moustis said he’d like to revisit that policy in an effort to bring costs down.

“We don’t really have to offer anything until they are 65. We’re under no contractual agreement. It’s just something we’ve done,” he said.

The county’s Wellness Program, in its second year, has a 93 percent participation rate, up from 86 percent in 2014.

“That’s really unheard of,” Tidwell said.

The program was developed using a custom model that was endorsed by ASFCME, the county’s largest union, in 2013, he said.

The program offers employees biometric screening and health risk assessments, but those who opt out are hit with premium hikes. The county offers incentives for participating and reaching health and fitness goals.

The program is projected to cost the county about $244,965 in 2016, with costs offset by premium surcharges paid by employees who opted out.
