CC By 2.0\n\nOver several years, the former Lund University students developed H\u00f6vding, an \u201cinvisible\u201d bicycle helmet worn like a scarf around the neck, zipping fashionably into place. As described on their website, the pair wanted to invent a helmet \u201cpeople would be happy to wear \u2014 whether they had to or not.\u201d\n\nIn the event of a mishap, the scarf-like device deploys a nylon airbag protecting the cyclist\u2019s head from impact. During those years, Haupt and Alstin staged numerous bicycle crashes to study the movement of man and machine, developing an algorithm that would allow natural movement while reacting instantaneously to sudden danger, like a sideways collision with a bread truck or the downward arc of falling on slippery pavement.\n\nOn the website, Haput and Alstin warn the USB-rechargeable helmet fails to protect the user from only the most unlikely of dangers: an object dropped from above or, presumably, sniper fire in a war zone. However, the helmet should protect the user from most bicycle-related dangers, save a cycling trip through Sarajevo circa 1992 or along the anvil-prone canyons where the cartoon characters Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote duel eternally.\n\nToday, the engineering duo operates a company with 17 employees, manufacturing helmets presently available for sale only in Europe but soon to meet wider distribution worldwide. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be millionaires,\u201d Haupt and Alstin smile in the video. With retailers in Scandinavia and Germany, the product \u2014 with durable nylon shells, interchangeable for fashion \u2014 is available by mail-order throughout Europe.\n\nAlthough retailing for approximately $532 USD, many European insurers would cover the cost of replacement in the event of an accident. No word yet on when the helmet would be available for mail order in the United States, where 89 percent of children in bicycle accidents do not wear helmets.\n\nBelow is a video describing the product:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "invisible helmet, invisible bike helmet, european bicycle helmet, hovding", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A pair of Swedish engineers conjoin fashion and safety with the \"invisible helmet,\" a USB-rechargeable device worn like a scarf around the neck.", "title": "'Invisible' Helmet Offers Cyclists Fashionable Safety Protection", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/invisible-helmet-offers-cyclists-fashionable-safety-protection-262459", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/09/invisible-helmet-offers-fashionable-safety-protection.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A pair of Swedish engineers conjoin fashion and safety with the \"invisible helmet,\" a USB-rechargeable device worn like a scarf around the neck.", "title": "'Invisible' Helmet Offers Cyclists Fashionable Safety Protection", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/invisible-helmet-offers-cyclists-fashionable-safety-protection-262459", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/09/invisible-helmet-offers-fashionable-safety-protection.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/09/invisible-helmet-offers-fashionable-safety-protection.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-11-09T14:52:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-10T14:28:18-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A pair of Swedish engineers conjoin fashion and safety with the \"invisible helmet,\" a USB-rechargeable device worn like a scarf around the neck."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4c5\"", "article_summary": "CC By 2.0Over several years, the former Lund University students developed H\u00f6vding, an \u201cinvisible\u201d bicycle helmet worn like a scarf around the neck, zipping fashionably into place.\n\u201cBicycle helmets have always been the same,\u201d says Anna Haupt and Terese Alstin in a video describing their invention.\nNo word yet on when the helmet would be available for mail order in the United States, where 89 percent of children in bicycle accidents do not wear helmets.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be millionaires,\u201d Haupt and Alstin smile in the video.\nToday, the engineering duo operates a company with 17 employees, manufacturing helmets presently available for sale only in Europe but soon to meet wider distribution worldwide."}
