John McCain, R-Ariz., and Christopher Murphy, D-Conn., to Nick Clegg, deputy prime minister of the United Kingdom, to The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Nile Gardiner, an expert on U.S.-European relations, see some clear advantages to at least considering moving the games.\n\nMcCain questions whether it is \u201cappropriate to have this venue in Russia at this particular time\u201d and whether there are other countries \u201cthat would be far less controversial.\u201d\n\nClegg told the Sunday Times: \u201cYou can\u2019t have this\u2014the beautiful game marred by the ugly aggression of Russia on the Russian-Ukrainian border.\u201d\n\n>>> Who Would Win the World Cup If Measured by Economic Freedom?\n\nAnd Gardiner, director of Heritage\u2019s Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, said, \u201cBasically this is a moment for both the United States and Great Britain to lead the world in condemnation of Russia\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nGardiner called Putin \u201ca typical 1930s-style tyrant who would use the World Cup as a \u201cpropaganda device.\u201d And he said losing it would mean much more to the country than an economic and tourism setback.\n\n>>> Is Brazil Ready for the World Cup?\n\n\u201cThe World Cup really matters to the Russians,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cThis is a huge deal for them, and it would begin to focus minds within Russia about the damage Putin\u2019s aggression is inflicting.\u201d\n\nThere is little official momentum for this at this point.
