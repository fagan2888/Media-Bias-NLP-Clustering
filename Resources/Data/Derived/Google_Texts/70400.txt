WALL â€” Two tree service workers were injured Saturday when one of them made contact with a power line while they worked at a Wall Township home.

Wall police tell the Asbury Park Press that the accident occurred around noon Saturday.

A 39-year-old Toms River man was on a ladder and trimming a tree when he made contact with the power line. He suffered burns and received an electrical shock, which caused him to fall from the ladder.

His co-worker, a 20-year-old Manchester man, was standing on the ground. He suffered leg injuries when he tried to catch his colleague, and the first man received further trauma injuries when he hit the ground.

Both men were taken to a hospital, but further details on their conditions were not disclosed.
