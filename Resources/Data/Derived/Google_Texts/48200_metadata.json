It\u2019s not even past,\u2019 which means with these two candidates likely to lead the race in 2016, the future doesn\u2019t look so different.\n\nAs if we need it, here\u2019s extra proof that contemporary politics is more thoroughly exhausted than adult actress Lisa Sparkxxx must have been at the end of her record-setting roll in the hay at the 2004 \u201cEroticon\u201d in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nThe Washington Post reports, \u201cMany of the Republican Party\u2019s most powerful insiders and financiers have begun a behind-the-scenes campaign to draft former Florida governor Jeb Bush into the 2016 presidential race, courting him and his intimates and starting talks on fundraising strategy.\u201d For once, I found myself agreeing with Jesse Jackson. Can\u2019t we just \u201cstay out the Bushes\u201d this one time at least?\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, it\u2019s a given that Hillary Clinton is not only the presumptive Democratic nominee, but the only possible Democratic nominee anyone can name with a straight face (sorry, Joe Biden, but this just ain\u2019t your century any more than the 20th was). \u201cThere was a Bush or a Clinton in the White House and cabinet for 32 years straight,\u201d notes Maureen Dowd at The New York Times, whose headline writer adds, \u201cBrace Yourself for Hillary and Jeb.\u201d As it was, it shall always be. About the only cause for optimism is that there\u2019s no Kennedy in the mix.\n\nAt least Lisa Sparkxxx participated voluntarily in her own screwing. For the large and growing plurality of Americans who identify as independent, there\u2019s seemingly no way to opt out of the compulsive-repetitive disorder among legacy media types and partisan string-pullers. What is it that Faulkner said in Requiem for a Nun (1950)? \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past.\u201d Who knew that he was talking about politics in the goddamned 21st century, not Yoknapatawpha County after the Civil War?\n\nIt\u2019s not a mystery why elites would totally dig a retro contest between two of the nation\u2019s least-appealing families. It would mean that zombified pundits such as David Gergen, whose lack of cogency is directly proportional to the number of administrations in which he served, could push off retirement a few more years and writers such as Dowd, who peaked in terms of what passes for wit and originality during the Clinton era, could recycle old columns as unashamedly as Cate Blanchet recycles plastic bags at the local Safeway. GOP and Democratic apparatchiks and their big-money enablers wouldn\u2019t have to struggle with the grim and unavoidable fact that fewer and fewer of us are willing to identify with either party - even to strangers on the phone.\n\nBut for the large and growing plurality of us who are independents, there\u2019s simply no advantage in putting up with this politics of exhaustion, of the elite\u2019s fixation on characters and policies from the past. We need a reboot that\u2019s not simply the same-old, same-old.\n\nWhat we need is a politics that is willing to look forward and navigate looming dangers, rather than relitigate and settle old scores. What we need is a politics that is willing to discuss openly and honestly the absolute unsustainability of our entitlement state. Medicare, for example, is unfixable, with the number of enrollees expected to double by 2040 and the annual cost per enrollee to double as well, to around $21,000 per beneficiary. As it stands, payroll taxes, co-pays, and fees already cover less than half the program\u2019s costs. Yet from virtually all Republicans and Democrats, all we get is either denial, avoidance, or demagoguing when it comes to entitlements.\n\nOr worse yet, expansion of same. George W. Bush created the Medicare Part D, a prescription drug benefit that was as expensive as it was unneeded (when it passed, seniors were spending a whopping 3 percent of their income on prescription drugs). And Barack Obama created his signature health-care plan, which recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) research suggests will add more than $6 trillion to long-term debt (recall that the president promised not only that if you liked your plan you could keep your plan but that The Affordable Care Act wouldn\u2019t add \u201cone dime\u201d to the federal deficit).\n\nWe need to discuss openly and honestly the failed foreign policy of both the Bush and Obama administrations. Does anyone seriously think that the Middle East is more stable than it was pre-9/11? Or that the government under either 21st-century president is safeguarding American civil liberties in a way about which we can feel confident? Immigration and tax policy are just as beggared and threadbare and awful. In the areas in which the country is actually breaking with the dead hand of the past\u2014when it comes to pot legalization, say, or marriage equality\u2014the change is coming at the state level and typically from outside traditional party politics.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that discussion of these and other issues will not come from well-ensconced party favorites. As Democratic consultant Joe Trippi put it, \u201cI don\u2019t see Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton having a big fight over the NSA.\u201d Or much of anything else that really matters. If they were willing to stage those sorts of debates, they wouldn\u2019t be the establishment favorites.\n\nNo, change is going to come\u2014if at all\u2014from politicians who don\u2019t fit neatly into their party\u2019s establishments, or perhaps not even into a given party. I don\u2019t share many of Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 (I-Vt.) convictions, but he at least is talking about a presidential run for the right reasons. \u201cI don\u2019t wake up every morning, as some people here in Washington do and say, \u201cYou know, I really have to be president of the United States. I was born to be president of the United States,\u201d he told The Nation recently. \u201cWhat I do wake up every morning feeling is that this country faces more serious problems than at any time since the Great Depression, and there is a horrendous lack of serious political discourse or ideas out there that can address these crises.\u201d\n\nOn a very different part of the political spectrum, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who was originally elected to office over the protests of Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, is shaking up the settled dogmas of deficit spending, government surveillance of innocent people, and bipartisan willingness to deport immigrants who not only travel to America but dare to work for a living. Rand Paul\u2014to the immense displeasure of major GOP funders and leaders\u2014is doing extremely well in his early bid for the 2016 nomination.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "nickgillespie"}, "keywords": "Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201404070945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "For partisan and media elites, \u2018the past is never dead.
