The picture has sparked far too much controversy for just one snap that was likely blown out of proportions.\n\nThe Facebook owner recently snapped a picture with his 2 month-old daughter, Max, at the doctor\u2019s office with the message \u201ctime for vaccines!\u201d. While Zuckerberg likely didn\u2019t meant for it to be a way to promote vaccination or poke at anti-vaccination supporters, it was interpreted that way nonetheless. Anti-vaxxers instantly jumped to criticize the new parent on his decisions.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine that the message was anything other than a father immortalizing a moment with his young daughter. Some believe there was a more subtle message to it, and were quick to jump in, adding fuel to the flames of the popular debate.\n\nWithin hours of it being posted, the photo of Zuckerberg and Max received 650,000 likes and 20,000 comments from some of his 47.5 million followers on Facebook. While most were supportive and positive, there were several that lit the fuse and sparked controversy over the simple photograph. This ranged from criticism to outright accusations.\n\nNumerous people questioned Zuckerberg\u2019s decision on having his daughter vaccinated, citing the unhealthy toxins that will only hurt her later in life. They commented on the medicine as being the cause of autism or other life-crippling conditions. This is in spite of the fact that numerous studies have already stated that there is no link between vaccination and Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\nOthers even doubted the Facebook-owner\u2019s research on the matter. They inquired if he even knew the dangers of having his child vaccinated\u2026 in spite of the fact that his wife, Priscilla, works as a pediatrician.\n\nSome users went as far as accusing Zuckerberg for cashing in on endorsement money from pharmaceutical companies for promoting vaccines. Once again, this is in spite of the fact that the Harvard dropout\u2019s net worth currently stands at around $40 billion.\n\nThe debate has sparked at the heel of numerous conflicts that have been ongoing in the past 10 years. Anti-vaxxers have flooded social media, discouraging people from getting their children vaccinated and stating that \u201cherd immunity\u201d does not exist. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has yet to find any scientific evidence to back their claims.\n\nHowever, a good majority of posters commended Zuckerberg\u2019s decision and praised him for being sensible enough to protect his child from diseases and, in turn, other children.\n\nImage source: wennermedia.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A photo is worth a thousand words, or so it seems, as Mark Zuckerberg gets backlash for vaccinating his daughter and is accused of endorsing vaccination for money.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "Utah People's Post", "description": "A photo is worth a thousand words, or so it seems, as Mark Zuckerberg gets backlash for vaccinating his daughter and is accused of endorsing vaccination for money.", "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Gets Backlash For Vaccinating His Daughter", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.utahpeoplespost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mark-Zuckerberg-Gets-Backlash-For-Vaccinating-His-Daughter.jpg", "url": "http://www.utahpeoplespost.com/2016/01/mark-zuckerberg-gets-backlash-for-vaccinating-his-daughter/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "msvalidate.01": "6958C9AB4F8D0BB7448B21422FA16AD0", "article": {"section": "Health", "published_time": "2016-01-10T10:48:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "zuckerberg takes his daughter to get vaccinated, zuckerberg daughter vaccine, zuckerberg max vaccine"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2cc6\"", "article_summary": "A photo is worth a thousand words, or so it seems, as Mark Zuckerberg gets backlash for vaccinating his daughter and is accused of endorsing vaccination for money.\nNumerous people questioned Zuckerberg\u2019s decision on having his daughter vaccinated, citing the unhealthy toxins that will only hurt her later in life.\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine that the message was anything other than a father immortalizing a moment with his young daughter.\nThe Facebook owner recently snapped a picture with his 2 month-old daughter, Max, at the doctor\u2019s office with the message \u201ctime for vaccines!\u201d.\nSome users went as far as accusing Zuckerberg for cashing in on endorsement money from pharmaceutical companies for promoting vaccines."}
