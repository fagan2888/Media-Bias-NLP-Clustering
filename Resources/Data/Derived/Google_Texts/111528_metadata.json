But child care can be expensive, and it can be tough to tell whether a day care is right for a child.\n\nChildren, Youth and Families Department Secretary Monique Jacobson shared some insight on choosing the right one.\n\nCYFD says parents can get a good sense for whether a day care is right for their child by visiting it in person and asking the right questions. But it's also a good idea to check past safety reports and ratings through the state.\n\n\"As a working mom, it's so important that when I leave my kids in the morning in child care or now the older ones at school, you don't have to be worried about the basic safety and that you actually see they're having a great day and new experiences,\" Jacobson said.\n\nThat's Jacobson's hope for you, too. She says http://CYFD.org was created to help parents find safe, affordable choices.\n\n\"So if you go to our CYFD.org and go to the early childhood section and click right on child care services,\" Jacobson said.\n\nThat's where you can find tips on financial help and safety reports.\n\n\"You can hit 'search' and it will bring up a list of all the centers in Albuquerque and you can go in and see what we've found in the last few years of going in and doing inspections at those centers,\" Jacobson said.\n\nCYFD also shares information on how much education a center provides. If you have any questions, you can contact a CYFD office.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.KOB.com", "description": "A lot of parents need help with child care so they can make it to work every day.
