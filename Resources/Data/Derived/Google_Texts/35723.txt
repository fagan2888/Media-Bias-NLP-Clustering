So, did you hear the one about the president who tried to do comedy?

No joke: President Obama will join Jerry Seinfeld on tonight’s Season 7 premiere of the Crackle series “Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee.”

Seinfeld’s usual guests are actual comedians: Amy Schumer, Larry David, Chris Rock, Sarah Silverman, etc. Obama hardly fits the bill, though some of his ideas are laughable. But Crackle says the two will chat about life in the White House. There’s certainly grounds for a few one-liners there.

Seinfeld said Obama was “easy and fun to be with” and praised “the president’s humor and generosity.” Fair enough: To folks who agree with Obama’s policies, or can at least look past them, he’s a pretty cool dude.

Plus, he’s racked up a fair bit of comedic experience. Early last year, he popped up on Zach Galifianakis’ “Between Two Ferns.”

Obama started off fine, joking about his birth certificate and even offering a self-deprecating zing about being the last black president. But then he started plugging ObamaCare, complete with a whopper about how the law and its Web site were working.

That turns out to be his standard shtick. His wacko selfies for Buzzfeed were part of a drive to nudge folks to go to the ObamaCare site. And this June, he joined Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast to argue for tougher gun laws.

So what will he be selling this time? Let’s pray it’s not another effort to insist his anti-ISIS strategy is a smashing success.

If Obama, in the final year of his tenure, wants to spend some time entertaining the country, it wouldn’t be his worst sin. But please, sir, spare us the lectures — because your agenda is no laughing matter.
