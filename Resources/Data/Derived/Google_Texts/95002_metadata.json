Bob Beauprez, Secretary of State Scott Gessler, former state Senate Republican leader Mike Kopp and former U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo.\n\nThe winner will face Democratic incumbent John Hickenlooper, as the GOP tries to regain the governor\u2019s seat after eight years since Gov. Bill Owens left office.\n\nBeauprez was the GOP nominee in 2006 but lost to Bill Ritter.\n\nIn 2010, Tancredo was a third-party candidate for governor. Although he represented the American Constitution Party, he drained conservative votes from the controversy-prone GOP nominee, Dan Maes. That benefited Hickenlooper but didn\u2019t affect the outcome. Tancredo received 617,030 votes and Maes got just 187,318 for a total of 804,348 votes. Hickenlooper received 851,886.\n\nColorado has almost 1.1 million registered Democrats and more than 1.1 million Republicans among the state\u2019s 3.55 million voters. The largest number of Coloradans \u2014 about 1.3 million \u2014 identify as unaffiliated.\n\nUnaffiliated voters can declare a party preference to the county election office anytime through June 24, but those who are affiliated can no longer switch to another party. The deadline to change affiliation was May 23.\n\nJune 16 is the last day to register to vote online in the primary and still receive a ballot in the mail.\n\nBallots are due back to county election offices before 7 p.m. June 24.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado voters get mail ballots this week for June 24 primary", "title": "Colorado voters get mail ballots this week for June 24 primary", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/01/colorado-voters-get-mail-ballots-this-week-for-june-24-primary/", "image": {"width": 347, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140424__ColoradoGovernorGOPDebate3.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140424__ColoradoGovernorGOPDebate3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-01T18:45:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:08:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f28\"", "article_summary": "Colorado has almost 1.1 million registered Democrats and more than 1.1 million Republicans among the state\u2019s 3.55 million voters.\nColorado takes a giant step into election season this week as ballots are mailed out to millions of voters to help major parties select nominees in the June 24 primary, including four Republicans who are running for governor.\nJune 16 is the last day to register to vote online in the primary and still receive a ballot in the mail.\nNo Democratic or American Constitution Party candidates for state offices are facing primary challengers.\nBallots are due back to county election offices before 7 p.m. June 24."}
