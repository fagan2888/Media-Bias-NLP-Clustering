Related Research Credit Opinion: CHS/Community Health Systems, Inc.: Update to Key Rating Factors Following the Downgrade of Community's CFR to B2 Rating Action: Moody's downgrades Community Health's CFR to B2; secured debt to Ba3; unsecured notes to Caa1; outlook is stable Announcement: Moody's: Community's leverage to increase modestly from Quorum spin-off; no impact on ratings Issuer Comment: CHS/Community Health Systems, Inc.: Community's leverage to increase modestly from Quorum spin-off; no impact on ratings Announcement: Moody's: Community's accounts receivable charge is credit negative, no change to B1 CFR or negative outlook Rating Action: Moody's rates Community's new term loans Ba2; B1 CFR unchanged; outlook is stable Global Credit Research - 07 May 2015 New York, May 07, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service assigned a Ba2 (LGD 2) rating to CHS/Community Health Systems, Inc.'s (Community) new $1.0 billion senior secured term loan G due 2019 and $3.5 billion senior secured term loan H due 2021. Moody's understands that the proceeds of the new terms loans will be used to refinance the company's existing $4.5 billion senior secured term loan D due 2021. While a reduction in interest cost is modestly positive, Community's B1 Corporate Family Rating and B1-PD Probability of Default Rating, are unchanged because the transaction does not meaningfully affect the company's leverage. The stable rating outlook is also unchanged. The following ratings were assigned: Senior Secured Term Loan G due 2019, Ba2 (LGD 2) Senior Secured Term Loan H due 2021, Ba2 (LGD 2) RATINGS RATIONALE Community's B1 Corporate Family Rating reflects Moody's expectation that the company will continue to reduce debt to EBITDA closer to 5.0 times by the end of 2015 as the company focuses on the integrating the acquired Health Management Associates (HMA) operations and drive synergies in lieu of additional debt financed acquisitions or shareholder initiatives. Also supporting the rating is Moody's acknowledgement of Community's scale and market strength, which should help the company weather unfavorable trends, including weak volumes, and adjust to a changing environment during ongoing implementation of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Moody's anticipates that the company will continue to see stable to improving margin performance in the near term from a combination of improvements at the acquired HMA facilities, synergies from the acquisition, and benefits from lower bad debt expense resulting from the expansion of insurance coverage under the ACA. Given high financial leverage, Moody's does not expect an upgrade of the ratings in the near term. However, Moody's could upgrade the ratings if the company materially reduces financial leverage and cash flow coverage of debt metrics improve. Specifically, if Community is able to achieve and sustain adjusted debt to EBITDA closer to 4.0 times, the ratings could be upgraded. If the company is not able to meaningfully reduce debt to EBITDA to closer to 5.0 times over the next twelve months, Moody's could downgrade the ratings. Additionally, liquidity deterioration or a significant debt-financed acquisition or adverse developments beyond Moody's expectations related to ongoing investigations or litigation could result in a downgrade of the ratings. The principal methodology used in these ratings was Global Healthcare Service Providers published in December 2011. Other methodologies used include Loss Given Default for Speculative-Grade Non-Financial Companies in the U.S., Canada and EMEA published in June 2009. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies. CHS/Community Health Services, Inc., headquartered in Franklin, TN, is an operator of general acute care hospitals in non-urban and mid-sized markets throughout the US. In addition, through its subsidiary, Quorum Health Resources, LLC, Community provides management and consulting services to non-affiliated general acute care hospitals throughout the country. Community recognized approximately $19.4 billion in revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2015.
