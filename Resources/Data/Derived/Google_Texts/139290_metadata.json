He poured concrete down the drains and cemented the fuse box shut. He splattered paint and human waste all over the walls.\n\nThe new owners found Houser had it booby-trapped: the gas starter tube in the fireplace was twisted out and ignited, the logs removed. \u201cHe was hoping the house would catch on fire. That\u2019s what the investigators told me,\u201d said Norman Bone, 77, who had bought the house for his daughter.\n\nThe man Bone once knew as a church-going neighbor had grown into someone better known by neighbors and colleagues as an angry provocateur. Police say his anger culminated Thursday night in a slaughter at The Grand 16 theater in Lafayette, Louisiana, leaving two women dead and nine other people hurt.\n\nFor decades, Houser lived and worked in the same area where he owned that home, in Phenix City and the surrounding cities. Since the early \u201990s, he had built a reputation as an oddball. It was then that he regularly appeared on a local television show, appearing opposite a Democrat as a radical Republican railing against women in the workplace and calling for violence against abortion providers.\n\n\u201cHe made a lot of wild accusations,\u201d said Calvin Floyd, who hosted the show on WLTZ-TV in Columbus for more than two decades. \u201cHe could make the phones ring.\u201d\n\nYet Houser had a dark side that went way beyond talk. In 1989, court records say, he was accused of hiring someone to burn down a Columbus lawyer\u2019s law office. His wife and other relatives filed papers accusing him of domestic violence in 2008.\n\n\u201cAs many times as I had him on it was obvious he had a screw loose,\u201d Floyd said.\n\nThe son of a longtime city tax official in Columbus, Houser received degrees in accounting and law but never applied to take the bar exam in Alabama.\n\nHouser posted on an online career website that he was an entrepreneur who owned and operated two nightclubs in Columbus and LaGrange in the 1980s and 1990s. But his stint as a club operator ended sourly when he was accused of selling alcohol to minors at Rusty\u2019s Buckhead Pub.\n\nIn April 2001, the LaGrange mayor and city council voted to revoke all of Houser\u2019s alcoholic beverage pouring licenses based on five convictions of selling alcohol to minors in the span of a year from 1999 to 2000, according to a court filing. Houser appealed, but the court found the mayor and council acted correctly.\n\nHouser put up the swastika banner in protest, according to an April 28, 2001, story in the LaGrange Daily News.\n\nHe told the newspaper he was \u201ccompletely against\u201d the Nazi philosophy but chose the symbol because it represents a government\u2019s ability to do what it wants.\n\n\u201cThe people who used it \u2014 the Nazis \u2014 they did what they damn well pleased,\u201d Houser told the newspaper, accusing police officers of lying on the stand during his trial.\n\nIt was not the last time he\u2019d invoke that type of imagery, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Heidi Beirich, director of the SPLC\u2019s Intelligence Project, said he\u2019d been on the group\u2019s radar since 2005.\n\nLast January, he wrote on one online forum: \u201cHitler is loved for the results of his pragmatism.\u201d\n\nHe also posted on a forum dedicated to the New York chapter of Golden Dawn, Greece\u2019s far-right neo-Nazi political party.\n\nIt was around 2007 that former Phenix City Mayor Jeff Hardin lost touch with Houser. They had a falling-out then after partnering on a project to flip a house. Houser refused to move his belongings after Hardin bought him out, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Theater gunman built reputation as an angry provocateur", "title": "Theater gunman built reputation as an angry provocateur", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Theater gunman built reputation as an angry provocateur", "title": "Theater gunman built reputation as an angry provocateur", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/25/theater_gunman_built_reputation_as_an_angry_provocateur/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/movie-theater-shooting.jpeg15-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Theater gunman built reputation as an angry provocateur", "title": "Theater gunman built reputation as an angry provocateur", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/movie-theater-shooting.jpeg15-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jay Reeves and Kate Brumback", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It was around 2007 that former Phenix City Mayor Jeff Hardin lost touch with Houser.\n\u201cThe people who used it \u2014 the Nazis \u2014 they did what they damn well pleased,\u201d Houser told the newspaper, accusing police officers of lying on the stand during his trial.\nThe man Bone once knew as a church-going neighbor had grown into someone better known by neighbors and colleagues as an angry provocateur.\nIn 1989, court records say, he was accused of hiring someone to burn down a Columbus lawyer\u2019s law office.\nThat\u2019s what the investigators told me,\u201d said Norman Bone, 77, who had bought the house for his daughter."}
