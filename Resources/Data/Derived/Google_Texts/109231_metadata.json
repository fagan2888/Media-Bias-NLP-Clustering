The school also broke previous state records in each of the four tested subjects: English, math, reading and science reasoning.\n\nMORE: PSD outpacing peers on assessments\n\nThe Vanguard School, a charter high school in Colorado Springs, set the previous average composite score record in 2010 with 27.78, the state department of education confirmed Thursday following the release of ACT and TCAP data from the prior school year.\n\nThis is the third year running that Liberty Common posted the highest average composite score among high schools statewide, an achievement that reflects \"a solid classical, college-preparatory curriculum,\" Principal Bob Schaffer said. It's also the third year the school's juniors have taken the test; the high school opened in August 2010.\n\nSchool leaders said such success is a testament to the educational foundation Liberty's juniors build during their formative years, which includes curricula such as Core Knowledge and Singapore math in grades K-8.\n\nThe ACT test, taken by high school juniors, covers four subject areas. Students receive a score out of 36 for each subject; these are averaged to get a composite ACT score.\n\nCentennial, Polaris Expeditionary Learning, Poudre and Ridgeview Classical high schools also experienced gains. Poudre School District as a whole held steady over last year, coming in again with 22.3. That's the highest average tallied by PSD students in the past six years.\n\nStatewide, the average climbed from 20.1 in 2013 to 20.3. Thompson School District saw a dip from 21.1 to 20.6 this year.\n\nHow all PSD high schools fared (scores are average composite score)\n\n2014 2013 State 20.3 20.1 Poudre School District 22.3 22.3 Centennial 17.1 17.3 Fort Collins 21.2 21.4 Fossil Ridge 23.8 23.6 Liberty Common 28.6 27.6 Polaris 21 19.5 Poudre 22.1 21.7 Poudre Community Academy 16.3 Data not available PSD Global Academy Data not available Data not available Ridgeview Classical Schools 27 25 Rocky Mountain 21.5 22.2\n\nNote: The ACT test has four tested subject areas: English, math, reading and science reasoning.
