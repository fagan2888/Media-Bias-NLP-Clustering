The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manage the lake, are required to let 15 cubic feet per second of water out of the lake. In addition, evaporation is taking water away too.\n\n\"We have not been at conservation pool since September of 2011 and essentially the problem is, it remains quite dry,\" said Dan Hays of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Wilson State Lake.\n\nMost of the recharge the lake receives occurs in June.\n\nThere is dirt showing in the middle of the lake because of the receding water.\n\nLocal shops around the lake are not worried about the lake losing tourism. The manager at Knotheads Baitshop says that all of the features the surrounding area of the lake has will keep tourist coming.\n\nHays says that it is not dangerous for people to go boating.\n\nWilson lake has been a stable lake when dealing with water levels. There have been two previous instances when the levels were low, 2006 and in the lat 1980's, but the levels currently are the lowest on record.\n\nThere is the potential that the low water levels might cause environmental issues. Officials will be monitoring changes in wildlife and plants.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Wilson State Lake has record low water levels; it is 8.5 feet below normal.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "Wilson State Lake has record low water levels; it is 8.5 feet below normal.", "title": "Record low water levels at Wilson Lake", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Record-low-water-levels-at-Wilson-Lake-298718741.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/CBB/ED6/CBBED69B895F49DDA2906EB12CF3E661", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/28C/151/28C15185B104438CB2B7ACAE7C500642.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Wilson State Lake has record low water levels; it is 8.5 feet below normal.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Record-low-water-levels-at-Wilson-Lake-298718741.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/WilsonLake.jpg", "title": "Record low water levels at Wilson Lake", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Record low water levels at Wilson Lake", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Record low water levels at"}, "article_summary": "The water level is 8.5 feet below conservation pool at Wilson State Lake, which is a record low.\nWilson lake has been a stable lake when dealing with water levels.\nThere is the potential that the low water levels might cause environmental issues.\nWilson State Lake receives most all of its' water from the Saline River.\nThere have been two previous instances when the levels were low, 2006 and in the lat 1980's, but the levels currently are the lowest on record."}
