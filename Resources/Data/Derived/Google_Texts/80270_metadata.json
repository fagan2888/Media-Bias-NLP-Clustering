In an interview with MSNBC, the Kansas City-area Democrat likened the situation in Ferguson to Iraq: \u201cFerguson resembles Fallujah more than it does Ferguson,\u201d Rep. Cleaver said.\n\nThe congressman\u2019s words come a day after President Barack Obama announced that he was sending Attorney General Eric Holder to Ferguson to continue his Department of Justice investigation in-person into the death of Michael Brown, an African-American teenager and aspiring musician, who was killed by a white Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson. Tensions in the community \u2014 between protesters, police and members of the press \u2014 have swelled.\n\nYesterday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency, calling in reinforcements to deescalate what has become a nine-day period of marching, protesting and unrest in the wake of Brown\u2019s death.\n\nOver the weekend, Rep. Cleaver visited St. Louis to survey the scene, concluding that the entire police department in Ferguson seemed \u201cmonumentally inept\u201d at dealing with the situation. The congressman also condemned the militarized police force.\n\n\u201cHaving military style weaponry moving down the main street of a middle-American town is as un-American as a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat rather than an election,\u201d said Mr. Cleaver. \u201cI think that is obscene. And we\u2019ve got to stop it because the police chief in Ferguson himself said we haven\u2019t had training on this equipment, and yet, the world saw police officers with military helmets sitting in front of machine guns, pointing them at the crowd.\u201d\n\nSome have called for President Obama to travel to Ferguson to pacify some of the angst. But Mr. Cleaver cautioned against that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the president needs to come to Ferguson,\u201d Mr. Cleaver said. \u201cIt adds another distortion. We don\u2019t need that now. We don\u2019t need any more people coming into Ferguson to help the poor people out during this time of trouble. What we need is a sense of calm and anything other than that is going to be dangerous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Military fatigues, heavily armored tanks, sniper rifles?
