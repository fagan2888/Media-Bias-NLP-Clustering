But, though, Republicans could still pass bills to repeal it once they take control of the Senate on top of the House.\n\n\u201cIf I know that guy, he is willing to use it,\u201d Obama-as-Colbert said. \u201cAnd let\u2019s face it, even if Republicans managed to repeal it, they\u2019d have to replace it with their own health-care plan. And once they touch it, they own it. Then, if anything goes wrong, suddenly everybody will be complaining about Mitch McConnellcare.\u201d\n\nWatch Obama fill in for Colbert, as posted online on Monday, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/President-Barack-Obama-on-The-Colbert-Report-on-Dec.-8-2014-youtube-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Obama takes over for Stephen Colbert: Obamacare now \u2018half as popular as Grumpy Cat\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9706\"", "article_summary": "'\u201dThe program, Obama said, had enrolled more than 1 million people within the past few weeks (\u201cSo, half as popular as [a] Grumpy Cat video\u201d).\n\u201cI think that\u2019s where Disney got the idea for Frozen.\u201dObama surprised the Colbert Report host just as he was about to begin the monologue.\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s face it, even if Republicans managed to repeal it, they\u2019d have to replace it with their own health-care plan.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting you here for another three minutes,\u201d Colbert said when Obama took the stage.\nThen, if anything goes wrong, suddenly everybody will be complaining about Mitch McConnellcare.\u201dWatch Obama fill in for Colbert, as posted online on Monday, below."}
