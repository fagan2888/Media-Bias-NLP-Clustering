Ross Brown & Associates.\n\nBrown said these price increases are a result of rising costs of healthcare felt by almost every other plan.\n\n\u201cThe Board has been kind to the employees, but I think it\u2019s time to bring costs closer to what the market rates are and start funding more of the reserves we need to have a healthy plan,\u201d Brown said. \u201c... With the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the increase in the commercial market, folks are making plan changes as well as price increases in the medical plan in order to keep a plan in place and keep up with what\u2019s going on in the market.\n\n\u201cThis has naturally thrown a monkey wrench into the market and most employer plans are just trying to keep up not only with the costs and changes, but also with the regulations and requirements of the (ACA) as well.\u201d\n\nThe proposed changes would include increasing the Aetna Whole Health Plan for each of the four categories. The employee-only plan will go from $104 to $128 a month; employee and children from $384 to $484; employee and spouse from $496 to $790; and employee and family from $808 to $908.\n\nThe benefit plan changes mainly affect those on the Basic Tier 2 plan:\n\n\u2022 Individual deductible will increase from $1,200 to $2,000; family deductible from $2,400 to $4,000.\n\n\u2022 Office visit copay will increase from $45 to $50; specialist copay increases from $75 to $80.\n\n\u2022 The out-of pocket maximum will increase from $6,350 to $6,850 for individuals and from $12,700 to $13,700 for families.\n\nHowever, both the Basic Tier 2 and ACO Tier 1 plans have the same changes to the prescription coverage:\n\n\u2022 A new $200 deductible on prescriptions.\n\n\u2022 Brand copay (formulary) will increase from $45 to $60; brand copay (nonformulary) from $75 to $120; and specialty from $100 to $250.\n\n\u2022 Mail order prescriptions will also increase for both brand copay formulary and non-formulary from $90 to $120 and $150 to $240 respectively.\n\n\u2022 The generic cost will remain $15 and $30 for in-person and mail-order prescriptions.\n\nBrown said the jump in prescription coverage was because of the struggle in that coverage right now.\n\n\u201cWhere (the current plan) isn\u2019t doing well and where nobody is doing well is in the prescription drug coverage,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s exploding. \u2026 Everybody is scrambling nationwide trying to get a handle on the drug cost; this is our attempt to do that.\u201d\n\nSpousal coverage\n\nOne issue problematic for at least one trustee was a proposed policy for spouses of district employees.\n\nBrown recommended the district require spouses that have available coverage through their work to take that plan rather than be on the district\u2019s employee\u2019s plan.\n\nBrown said this was a commonplace policy now that helps keeps costs lower, but that in the end it\u2019s a Board decision.\n\n\u201cForget about the family unit; it\u2019s about business now right?\u201d Trustee Datren Williams asked. \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know how common it is, but I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nCosts for CISD\n\nIn addition to the increase in plan costs, the district is proposing to increase its contribution from $428 to $440 per plan. The premiums listed earlier are after-district-contribution costs.\n\nThe plan changes will reduce the burden on the district from about $6.15 million to $4.47 million, about a $1.6 million savings to the district.\n\nThe insurance costs will total $44.9 million for the district in the 2016-17 school year, up from $40.5 million for this school year.\n\nThe remaining $4.5 million shortfall will be made up through the plan and premium cost changes, as well as the district\u2019s additional contribution.\n\nBrown said he believes the benefit costs to employees will increase again in the future due to rising costs.\n\nComparative coverage\n\nCISD is not a part of the Texas Retirement System used by many districts to fund employee insurance and retirement. CISD never opted into the program, which comparatively saves employees a lot of money in monthly costs.\n\nThe TRS plan has an expected shortfall of $1.6 billion in the next year statewide.\n\n\u201cYou (the Board) strongly agreed not to (join TRS) and, as a result, a lot of TRS plans have gone up,\u201d Brown said. \u201c\u2026 The numbers we are looking at here are grossly underfunded for the TRS plan. I congratulate you for not following the siren\u2019s call of the TRS idea.\u201d\n\nSuperintendent Dr. Don Stockton said he\u2019s fielded calls from other districts to see \u201chow (the district) got out of TRS.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018We never got into it,\u2019\u201d Stockton said.\n\nThe TRS 2 Average premium costs to employees at other local districts \u2014 including Humble, Spring, Cy-Fair, Klein, New Caney and Montgomery \u2014 are as high as triple the costs as Conroe ISD\u2019s non-TRS plan. The TRS Select Average plan is closer to par with CISD\u2019s plan, but still ranges from $42 to $220 a month higher than CISD\u2019s plans.\n\nBoard President John Husbands said CISD\u2019s shortfall is comparable to the TRS shortfall, but on a smaller scale.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve experienced the exact same thing, but it\u2019s just not as impressive a number,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s all for the same reason and certainly nobody\u2019s fault. \u2026 $1.6 billion is a big number, but when you multiply it by the number of people that are in TRS, we\u2019ve encountered the same thing.\u201d\n\nThe Board still has to approve any changes to the plans before they go into effect.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourconroenews.com", "description": "Conroe ISD probably will be among school districts across the nation feeling the rising costs of healthcare coverage.", "title": "Conroe ISD insurance rates may go up", "url": "http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/courier/news/conroe-isd-insurance-rates-may-go-up/article_954e8b4f-04f6-5c19-bfa1-6bfacaea1da0.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/yourhoustonnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/15/f15f1660-4d86-5f17-91eb-04c9b5ac6bb4/5537ad5c5a444.image.jpg?resize=200%2C280", "height": 280}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ScoopHouston", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Conroe ISD probably will be among school districts across the nation feeling the rising costs of healthcare coverage.", "msvalidate.01": "29516177700BA7C06DA5A4D58A12C04C", "fb": {"app_id": 191454774240451}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "lqzy3EyAvgVvWDlrVhCm69f7Q1GER22OmU5rYfmsBh8", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "Conroe ISD probably will be among school districts across the nation feeling the rising costs of healthcare coverage.\nThe TRS plan has an expected shortfall of $1.6 billion in the next year statewide.\nAt a workshop Tuesday night, the Conroe ISD Board of Trustees heard a proposal suggesting higher premiums, plan costs and an increase in the district\u2019s contribution from Terry Brown with T.
