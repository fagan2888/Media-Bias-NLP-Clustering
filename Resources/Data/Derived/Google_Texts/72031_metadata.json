Other companies taking federal small business contracts include Citigroup and Bank of America, as well as Apple and Oracle. Five companies were anomalous, the group said.\n\nVIDEO HERE\n\n\u201cOnce again, large companies are the fraudulent recipients of a large portion of federal small business contracts,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Lloyd Chapman said in a statement. \u201cThis practice is disastrous to our economy and hurting the American people.\u201d\n\nThe government is supposed to award 23 percent of total contracts to small businesses \u2013 though it\u2019s not required to do so by law. And according to the Small Business Administration (SBA), it has missed that target every year since at least 2006. In 2012, for example, the government awarded $89.9 billion in contracts to small businesses, or roughly 22 percent of total contracts, Bloomberg noted. The government awarded small businesses just 21.6 percent of total contracts in 2011.\n\nRelated: Pentagon Has No Idea What 108,000 Contractors Are Doing\n\nThe SBA, however, argued that in some instances, small businesses might not be identified that way in the Federal Procurement Data System. John Shoraka told GovExec that if a contract was awarded to a large business, it doesn\u2019t mean it was taken away from a small business \u201cor that small businesses suffered.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnless a contract was set aside for a small business, the designation as a small business does not benefit that business in receiving the award,\u201d Shoraka said. He added that the designation could be the result of a mistake on the part of the contracting officer, who actually enters the designation in the database, or the firm \u201cwhen filing its representation for that contract.\u201d\n\nThe SBA offers a \u201cprotest\u201d process in case businesses were inaccurately identified.\n\n\u201cSBA cannot alter the federal procurement data that has been [entered] into FPDS,\u201d Shoraka said. \u201cHowever, we are continuously taking steps to improve data integrity. Each agency is responsible for ensuring the quality of its own contracting data.\u201d\n\nRelated: Tax Exempt Groups Owe IRS Nearly $1 Billion\n\nThe concern of big firms snatching small business contracts is nothing new.\n\nLast year, Congress approved legislation within the National Defense Authorization Act aimed at reforming how contracts flowed to small businesses. The measure, signed into law by President Obama, changes the way contractors can count the amount of subtracting dollars they pass onto smaller firms.\n\nHouse Small Business Committee Chairman Sam Graves (R-MO) applauded the passage of his committee\u2019s legislation at the time, saying, \u201cThe purpose of the federal contracting goal is to ensure small businesses get a fair opportunity.\u201d\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the House Committee on Small Business said the SBA is \u201cdragging its feet on finalizing the rule.\u201d\n\nIn the interim, the Defense Department, General Service Administration and NASA have all issued a rule saying the contracting guidelines are at the discretion of federal agencies.\n\n\u201cThe interim rule is nothing more than an egregious attempt on the part of federal regulators to grant federal agencies the authority to decide whether or not to recognize the constitutional rights of small business concerns,\u201d the American Small Business League said in a statement.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Behemoth corporations like Apple, Bank of America and General Electric are scooping up", "title": "Small Business Contracts Flow to Mega Corporations", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/19/Small-Business-Contracts-Flow-Mega-Corporations", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08192014_Business_Chart.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/19/Small-Business-Contracts-Flow-Mega-Corporations", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08192014_Business_Chart.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Behemoth corporations like Apple, Bank of America and General Electric are scooping up", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1e9\"", "article_summary": "John Shoraka told GovExec that if a contract was awarded to a large business, it doesn\u2019t mean it was taken away from a small business \u201cor that small businesses suffered.\u201d\u201cUnless a contract was set aside for a small business, the designation as a small business does not benefit that business in receiving the award,\u201d Shoraka said.\nOther companies taking federal small business contracts include Citigroup and Bank of America, as well as Apple and Oracle.\nBehemoth corporations like Apple, Bank of America and General Electric are scooping up federal contracts that are intended for small businesses, an advocacy group maintains.\nIn 2012, for example, the government awarded $89.9 billion in contracts to small businesses, or roughly 22 percent of total contracts, Bloomberg noted.\nVIDEO HERE\u201cOnce again, large companies are the fraudulent recipients of a large portion of federal small business contracts,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Lloyd Chapman said in a statement."}
