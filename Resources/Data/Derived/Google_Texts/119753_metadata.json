Since then, I have been blessed to live in a community of women who seek to treat every elderly person in our care with love and respect \u2014 as if we were caring for Christ himself.\n\nOver our 175-year history, my charity, the Little Sisters of the Poor, has been focused on service, not advocacy or policy. Nevertheless, we have been forced into the spotlight over our position regarding a regulation issued under the Affordable Care Act, namely that we provide health insurance coverage for birth control. On Dec. 31, 2013, Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a temporary stay against the requirement, just hours before it was to go into effect. Next week, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in our case against the Department of Health and Human Services, Zubik v. Burwell.\n\nWe are grateful to Justice Sotomayor, and to the support we have received over the last two years. But we\u2019ve been saddened this past year to see misinformation about our pending Supreme Court case result in pain and confusion on all sides of this issue.\n\nFirst, given how politicized the Affordable Care Act has become, it\u2019s important to clarify that our case is not a challenge to the act, and winning our case in no way endangers it. We\u2019re merely asking the court to ensure that Health and Human Services adjusts a regulation it developed that would force us to change our religious health plan and start offering benefits that violate our religious beliefs.\n\nSecond, some have mistakenly claimed that we can just sign a piece of paper and receive an exemption. Indeed, Health and Human Services claims it \u201caccommodated\u201d our religious beliefs and offered us an \u201copt-out.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nI wish that were true. In fact, the government has candidly told the Supreme Court that we \u201cdon\u2019t get an exemption\u201d at all. Rather, what Health and Human Services is calling an \u201copt-out\u201d is really an \u201copt-in\u201d \u2014 a permission slip where we authorize the use of our religious health plan to offer services that violate our beliefs and waive our protections under federal civil rights laws. That\u2019s why they need our signature.\n\nThe government says this isn\u2019t a problem because it will pay for the services that violate our religious beliefs. But for us this is not a money question; it is a moral question about what we offer in our plan. It\u2019s similar to high schools that have removed soda machines from their property because they don\u2019t think soda is good for children. It doesn\u2019t matter that the soda companies will pay for the machines. And the school\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t prevent children from getting soda elsewhere. The school simply doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for providing something it believes is bad for its students. It is the same with us.\n\nWe follow Catholic teaching that abortion and contraception are wrong, but it is very important to understand that this case is not about women\u2019s access to contraception. The administration already exempts many secular corporations like Exxon Mobil and Visa from having to provide the services we are objecting to, because those companies never updated their plans and are \u201cgrandfathered.\u201d Add in the exempted plans for military families, the uninsured and cities like New York, and about a third of all Americans don\u2019t have plans covered by this mandate.\n\nWe recognize that not everyone agrees with us, and that the government will make laws and provide services we don\u2019t support. But in a free and diverse society, the American government should not force its citizens to act in violation of their religious beliefs, especially when there are so many exemptions already, and much more effective ways to meet the government\u2019s stated goals.\n\nThe obvious alternative to forcing us to offer these services is for the government to allow our employees to access them through its own health care exchanges. This would both protect our religious freedom and better meet the government\u2019s own goal of providing contraception coverage to women \u2014 those in protected religious plans and the millions of American women in exempted secular plans.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nFinally, some have argued that the Little Sisters aren\u2019t a religious group \u2014 that our willingness to care for the elderly poor regardless of their religious beliefs and hire people to help provide that care who haven\u2019t taken the same vows we have means we\u2019re a social service organization, not a religious one. But Jesus never demanded that the poor demonstrate strict adherence to religious doctrine before helping them. And many religious organizations employ people of diverse backgrounds. Rather than being an indication we aren\u2019t really religious, we believe our willingness to work with and care for anyone is one of the truest ways to live out the religious faith that animates our ministry.\n\nOur goal with this case is to have the freedom to follow our conscience in what we do and offer. The women who take the vows to become Little Sisters of the Poor do so out of deep love and religious conviction. We spend our days caring for, learning from, and serving those whom many in our society would prefer to forget. All we are asking is that the government allow us to continue that work.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160318214305, "twitter": {"description": "Its opt-out provision on birth control violates our faith.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Birth-Control \u2018Exemption\u2019 Still Tramples on Rights", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/19/opinion/obamacaresbirth-control-exemption-still-tramples-on-rights.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004279323"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/19/opinion/19veitWeb/19veitWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/19/opinion/obamacaresbirth-control-exemption-still-tramples-on-rights.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004279323", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/19/opinion/obamacaresbirth-control-exemption-still-tramples-on-rights.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Why We\u2019re Suing Obamacare", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 18, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Roman Catholic Church", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Birth Control and Family Planning,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Freedom of Religion,Little Sisters of the Poor,Roman Catholic Church", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Constance Veit", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/19/opinion/19veitWeb/19veitWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By CONSTANCE VEIT", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Its opt-out provision on birth control violates our faith.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/19/opinion/19veitWeb/19veitWeb-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Its opt-out provision on birth control violates our faith.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 18, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-03-18", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Roman Catholic Church", "published": "2016-03-18", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "19Veit", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160318231805, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/19/opinion/obamacaresbirth-control-exemption-still-tramples-on-rights.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/19/opinion/19veitWeb/19veitWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Its opt-out provision on birth control violates our faith.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Birth-Control \u2018Exemption\u2019 Still Tramples on Rights"}, "pdate": 20160318, "des": "Freedom of Religion", "articleid": 100000004279323, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Obamacare\u2019s Birth-Control \u2018Exemption\u2019 Still Tramples on Rights", "col": "Op-Ed Contributor", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3946\"", "article_summary": "We recognize that not everyone agrees with us, and that the government will make laws and provide services we don\u2019t support.\nThe government says this isn\u2019t a problem because it will pay for the services that violate our religious beliefs.\nIndeed, Health and Human Services claims it \u201caccommodated\u201d our religious beliefs and offered us an \u201copt-out.\u201dAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyI wish that were true.\nNevertheless, we have been forced into the spotlight over our position regarding a regulation issued under the Affordable Care Act, namely that we provide health insurance coverage for birth control.\nSecond, some have mistakenly claimed that we can just sign a piece of paper and receive an exemption."}
