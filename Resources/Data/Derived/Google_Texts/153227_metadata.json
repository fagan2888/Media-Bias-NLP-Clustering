One man was slightly injured and taken to hospital after a group of protesters beat him after apparently mistaking him for a party supporter, police said.\n\nThe formerly fringe Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn is now the third-largest party in Greece, having enjoyed a massive surge in popularity during the harsh austerity of the past five years.\n\nWith living standards dropping and unemployment skyrocketing, many Greeks abandoned the mainstream parties they held responsible for the financial crisis and turned to formerly small parties on the extreme right and left.\n\nMichaloliakos, who is under house arrest after serving the maximum allowable 18 months in pre-trial detention, was not present.\n\nThe trial is to resume on May 12.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trial of Greece's Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn party adjourned - AP News: ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 A court set up in Greece's .05/26/2016 19:36:52PM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 A court set up in Greece's largest prison for the trial", "title": "AP News - Trial of Greece's Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn party adjourned", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/05/07/trial-of-greeces-naziinspired-golden-dawn-party-reopens-n1995628", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\127\\98b02410-5f5a-400d-97ea-280378859590.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 A court set up in Greece's largest prison for the trial", "title": "AP News - Trial of Greece's Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn party adjourned", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/05/07/trial-of-greeces-naziinspired-golden-dawn-party-reopens-n1995628", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/127/98b02410-5f5a-400d-97ea-280378859590.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Trial of Greece's Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn party adjourned, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 A court set up in Greece's largest prison for the trial of dozens of members of Greece's extreme right Golden Dawn party was adjourned on Thursday until next week.\nHundreds of anti-Golden Dawn protesters turned up outside the police cordon near Korydallos prison.\nThe formerly fringe Nazi-inspired Golden Dawn is now the third-largest party in Greece, having enjoyed a massive surge in popularity during the harsh austerity of the past five years.\nOne man was slightly injured and taken to hospital after a group of protesters beat him after apparently mistaking him for a party supporter, police said.\nMichaloliakos, who is under house arrest after serving the maximum allowable 18 months in pre-trial detention, was not present."}
