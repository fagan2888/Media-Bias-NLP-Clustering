So the animal's thriving population is good news for the state's ecosystems, wildlife experts say...Unless you're a road agent dealing with clogged culverts and flooded roads - or a property owner whose backyard, well or septic system is suddenly threatened by rising water.Wildlife biologists say sometimes lethal trapping is the only solution to keep busy beavers from blocking important culverts and flooding roads or trails...But in recent years, some towns have been finding other ways to deal with the animals.Patrick Tate is a wildlife biologist at the state Fish and Game Department.\"Beavers are a very important species,\" Tate explained. \"They create excellent habitat for other wildlife species; they create wetlands that are great for holding water, which helps reduce flooding in the larger river systems; and the dams they create and the ponds they create clean the water.\"..During Colonial times, beaver pelts were the most valuable furs traded and shipped to Europe, Tate said. That popularity led to their disappearance from all but the northernmost parts of the New Hampshire landscape in the 1800s...Then, in the early 1900s, Fish and Game began live-trapping beavers in Coos County and relocating them south. By the 1950s, beavers were once again thriving in New Hampshire - and conflicts with human activities started to rise, Tate said...That's because the places where people build bridges and culverts for roads and trails to cross streams are also prime real estate from a beaver's perspective.\"It's all about energy conservation and putting the least amount of effort into the creation of a wetland,\" Tate said. \"They just block that culvert and they're good to go.\"..Tate said there are ways to try to mitigate the beavers' efforts, such as flow devices, sometimes called beaver pipes, that keep water flowing through a dam or culvert. But he said these intelligent animals are really good at outsmarting - and outworking - humans. \"I've seen beavers turn a beaver pipe into part of the beaver dam in one night,\" he said...\"Sometimes lethal trapping is the only answer.\"Some New Hampshire towns have been investing in systems they hope will allow humans and beavers to coexist more peacefully.Chris Costantino is the coordinator for the Milford Conservation Commission. After spring flooding washed out a section of the popular Rail Trail twice in three years, she said, they knew they had to do something about the beaver dam causing the problems...All last summer, Costantino rode her bike to the area each morning and pulled down parts of the beavers' dam to keep water flowing.Once, she said, \"I came back two hours later and they had filled in what I had pulled out.\"..\"They're very smart. They do one thing and they do it really, really well. And they're very committed.\"So she called in reinforcements, in the person of Skip Lisle of Grafton, Vt., who has invented several beaver flow devices, including one called the Beaver Deceiver...Lisle has been trying to solve human-beaver conflicts for more than 20 years. He said clogged culverts are the most common, and serious, problems.\"They're attractive to beavers because beavers are economists,\" he explained. \"What a road represents is a nice big dam with a little tiny hole in it. So it's easy: Once you clog that culvert, you very easily have a nice big habitat.\"..Milford's Conservation Commission won a grant from the New Hampshire Animal Rights League that paid for Lisle to come in and install three flow devices in culverts along Melendy Road. The last device was installed on Dec. 19, and \"so far they're working great,\" Costantino said...She figures they'll spend about $4,000 for the three areas, but it will be worth it if it both saves the trail system and preserves the habitat many town residents enjoy.Lisle wants more towns to get ahead of such problems, installing flow devices before culverts get clogged and beavers get killed. He said an initial investment between $1,500 and $3,000 can save communities aggravation and costly damage.\"And on top of that, they prevent the unnecessary killing of beavers, so you can keep beavers in the vicinity in the local ecosystem,\" he said. \"And that's such a great thing for thousands of other species that benefit from the wetlands.\"..Adam Jacobs is operations manager for Merrimack's public works department. He said there are four or five sites in town that have had beaver problems for years.Jacobs said it's tough to stay ahead of the creatures. \"The beaver are better workers than we are,\" he said. \"They're pretty hard to beat.\"..The town's conservation commission hired an environmental consultant to map the problem areas. Then, last year, they hired an expert to install flow devices, designed to prevent the beavers from blocking culverts.And so far, Jacobs said, \"Knock on wood, they're all holding up really well.\"..Gene Harrington is vice chairman of the Londonderry Conservation Commission, which also recently paid to install a beaver pipe in a dam within the Musquash Conservation Area, to protect a bridge where a trail crosses water...It's working so far, Harrington said. \"We'll see what happens this spring when the spring flood comes.\"Jack Gleason serves on the conservation commission in Amherst, which has been dealing with road flooding caused by beaver dams for years. When a beaver dam broke on Joppa Hill Road several years ago, the water washed out a section of Route 101 and took out septic tanks at a number of homes, he said...The town hired Lisle to install flow devices in culverts on Joppa Hill, and more recently on Walnut Hill Road. Gleason estimates it has cost Amherst about $4,000 for the work, but he hopes it will save the town costly road repairs in the future...Gleason said he thinks people have to learn to live with beavers and the damage they can cause. He's changed how he thinks about his own land, which includes wetlands and an active beaver colony.\"I tell people all the time this is the beavers' to work in. That is their garden to harvest as they need,\" he said. \"I lose lilacs, and you put wire around the trees that you really want to save.\"..Harrington, too, thinks people need to think differently about dealing with these animals. \"If mankind learns to keep their artificial structures out of harm's way, then we can coexist with the beaver,\" he said...While he's always trying to outsmart beavers, Lisle said he rarely gets angry with them. \"I guess it's because - unlike humans, I'm sorry to say - nothing they do is malicious. They aren't trying to make your life miserable...\"They're just doing what comes natural to them and trying to survive.\"swickham@unionleader.com..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beavers are Mother Nature's environmental engineers, creating the wetlands in which so many other species thrive.
