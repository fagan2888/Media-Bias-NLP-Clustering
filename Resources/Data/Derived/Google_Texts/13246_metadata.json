MD&M has always been about what\u2019s next in medical device designs and this year\u2019s event didn\u2019t disappoint. While still being primarily focused on hardware, many smart device manufacturers came out to MD&M looking for advice on next generation architecture and thinking so that they could point their product roadmaps in the right direction. The questions at the end of keynote were astute and thought provoking. Below is what I shared with the crowd in both the main presentation and through answers to their questions; you can find my presentation deck at SpeakerDeck.com as usual.\n\nToday we\u2019re accustomed to going on the Internet to visit websites, send e-mails, shop online, run mobile apps, and even get up to the second and down to the inches directions from satellites orbiting the earth. We\u2019re seeing medical devices and related hardware moving faster towards the same kinds of consumerization, their sensors switching from analog to digital native, becoming more mobile, and perhaps most importantly, becoming part of the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d (IoT) by generating enormous amounts of coveted clinical data.\n\nWhat\u2019s going to be even more spectacular is that you\u2019ll soon be wearing smart watches that can know your vital signs, electronic \u201cbandaids\u201d that can sense whether wounds are healing, and many other personal medical devices that continuously monitor things going on within and around your body. These kinds of devices will make up what will soon become the \u201cMedical Internet of Things\u201d (mIOT). mIOT devices will generate significant amounts of data and managing this data becomes what\u2019s known as a \u201cbig data\u201d problem. The reason is obvious \u2013 data flowing continuously from your body comes in rapid velocity, large volumes, and many different kinds of variety.\n\nIoT, Big Data, mIOT, and analytics will certainly transform the medical device landscape and those that don\u2019t adapt won\u2019t be around to enjoy the spoils. The way next generation devices will be designed must adapt so that new devices generate the right kinds of data that are easier to analyze and utilize \u2013 the specific traits that buyers of clinically useful equipment will use when making purchasing decisions. New health system purchase decisions will be made era of value-driven decision-making due as the fee for service (FFS) payment models get augmented by outcomes based payments in so-called Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). As our customers of medical devices get paid less for the services they perform and more for the patient outcomes they improve, their expectations of data generated from our devices also gets more sophisticated.\n\nAs we create and upgrade future devices, our designers must realize that they\u2019re no longer just making standalone devices, they\u2019re likely crafting a system component that fits into a larger system of systems ecosystem that is creating and moving around enormous amounts of coveted data. Coveted because that data can be used to improve diagnostics, tailor clinical workflows, improve patient safety, and advance care coordination. All of these kinds of tasks and the data that will make them possible become even more important as payment models move from FFS to outcomes-driven.\n\nIf you\u2019re a company making an analog device living in a digital world, your days are numbered and you need to be worried. If you\u2019re making digital devices and you\u2019re not sharing data with IT systems, your competitors will be selling more products than you will because ACOs and outcomes-driven organizations have an insatiable appetite for data. Because next generation health systems will be paid for outcomes, they will not settle for aging, expensive, stand alone equipment when connected alternatives are available. If you\u2019re selling digital devices that are sharing some data but not capturing enough data to make it useful for analytical purposes, you\u2019ll see limited revenue growth and margin pressure along with loss of sales as your customers phase out your products in favor of those that generate clinically valuable data for improving their workflows.\n\nMost medical devices, like other IOT devices, will be disrupted by the business-value focused Big Data movement at some level. How much your company\u2019s products are disrupted will depend on whether your devices are built around the idea of enabling agile clinical workflows and whether your devices generate patient outcomes improvements in a measurable way. Think about the mobile phone and digital devices world in 2007 vs. 2014 \u2013 almost none of the same players that were big back in 2007 are still big today. Now, think about the world in 2021.
