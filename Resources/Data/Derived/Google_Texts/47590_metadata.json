This may seem like a small or even archaic issue to most, but reality says differently. Agriculture holds an importance in how not only Americans, but the entire world, plans to feed our estimated 9 billion inhabitants by the year 2050.\n\nAdditionally, we saw a $1 billion decrease in the United State Department of Agriculture\u2019s 2015 fiscal budget which is used to run 17 agencies and 18 offices nationally, whose vast works include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Office Tribal Relations respectively.\n\nFortunately, Oklahomans will have the opportunity to vote on agricultural matters this November, by voting on State Question 777, or \u201cRight-to-Farm.\u201d\n\nWritten by Oklahoma\u2019s Attorney General Scott Pruitt, SQ 777 is a constitutional amendment; if passed, would establish a guarantee for Oklahomans to engage in agricultural practices. It would additionally prohibit the Oklahoma Legislature from passing laws \u201cto employ agricultural technology and livestock production and ranching practices\u201d without compelling state interest.\n\nSo far it has garnered support from many agricultural organizations in the state. However, several organizations are opposed to the amendment; they claim 777 would actually be \u201clegal immunity\u201d for foreign corporations, pollution, and unethical practices.\n\nNo matter where you stand on 777, it\u2019s easy to understand that this historical piece of legislation will define Oklahoma\u2019s future. Additionally, proponents argue that its passage would be beneficial to the future of Oklahomans, and agriculture in Oklahoma alike.\n\nIn fact, without this \u201cRight-to-Farm,\" there is a chance Oklahoma\u2019s economic state will be damaged more than it already has been, as agriculture contributes over $8 billion to our economy every year.\n\nAfter learning some of these facts, Red Dirt Report has decided to learn why agricultural interests are urging Oklahomans should say \u201cYes to 777.\u201d\n\nMeet Tom\n\nTom Buchanan is the president of Oklahoma Farm Bureau. He\u2019s a lifelong resident of the southwestern region of Oklahoma. In addition to farming and ranching, Buchanan is active on the Oklahoma Water Resources Board, which regulates the state\u2019s water supply. He has also been a Farm Bureau member for more than three decades.\n\n\u201cI bought my first policy for a pickup from Farm Bureau around 16. From there I\u2019ve been involved at the county board level for more than 30 years, and have served at the state level for six years,\u201d said Buchanan.\n\nHe is currently serving his second term as president for Oklahoma Farm Bureau, after realizing that in order to advocate on behalf of rural Oklahoma, it was important to be involved past the county level.\n\n\u201cGoing to Oklahoma City on a statewide basis has given me the opportunity to work for and with the people I truly love and respect deeply. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here; I hope that I\u2019m effective at what I\u2019m doing, and making a positive change.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s clear to see how Buchanan has made an impact; his positive influence is influenced by his no-nonsense attitude. In the past he has been known to comment that \u201cthe regulatory environment is becoming more restrictive on a daily basis. What we\u2019ve seen, even in the Oklahoma Legislature every year, is legislation that is not friendly to agriculture.\u201d\n\nWhich is why most Oklahomans who have met OKFB\u2019s president will say he\u2019s been a leader and frontrunner in terms of \u201cagvocacy;\u201d his life story above can only confirm that. Buchanan understands these rural and agricultural communities, and their unique lifestyle. He knows how that lifestyle truly is the heart and soul of a town\u2019s economy.\n\nWhy is Oklahoma Farm Bureau saying yes to State Question 777?\n\nWhen asked why exactly OKFB is in support of such a monumental bill, Buchanan put it simply.\n\n\u201cThe number one reason Oklahoma Farm Bureau supports right-to-farm is because in Oklahoma, agriculture is the number two economic industry in the state as a whole, and with what we have seen from the oil and gas industry today, we very well could rival them for number one. So we\u2019re very important to the economy of the state of Oklahoma.\u201d\n\nBuchanan feels AG Scott Pruitt has made the amendment easy to understand for anybody who looks at it, and thinks the language used in 777 is superior to other states who have worked on similar legislation. He noted that this was accomplished with the help of constitutional lawyers, who made sure it complied with Oklahoma\u2019s constitution, and was in the correct constitutional language.\n\n\u201cWe want Oklahomans to have the authority, opportunity, and ability to say what Oklahoma agriculture looks like, not only today, but in the future. So we believe that\u2019s the compelling state interest, we believe that\u2019s the reason to have it constitutional, therefore Oklahomans will decided what their state agriculture will look like now, and in the future,\u201d Buchanan noted.\n\nHe also feels the state\u2019s agricultural future will see a positive reaction, thanks to the concept of compelling state interest because, \u201cfuture legislative bodies will have the opportunity to further regulate, if need be, if it\u2019s in the compelling interest and in the best interest in the state of Oklahoma, and Oklahoma citizens.\u201d\n\nHow is this a consumer choice issue?\n\nOKFB wants Oklahomans to know that SQ 777 encompasses more than just the future of Oklahoma agriculture or compelling interest.\n\n\u201cEven though people may think the focus is on agriculture and farming and ranching, and the protection that it will receive, the reality is this is a consumer choice issue,\u201d Buchanan said, going on to explain this legislation will provide adequate for producers, consumers, and the state of Oklahoma alike.\n\n\u201cBasically, as long as agriculture is successful and continues to produce an abundant and a very safe food supply, then the consumer is the ultimate winner in this.\u201d\n\nBuchanan also noted that modern agricultural practices have been just as good at producing food as ever before. However, he is also aware that not every individual agrees with these traditional practices, and understands why they have voiced their wishes to see production agriculture done differently.\n\nLuckily, 777 will act as a fair balance for all parties, by giving agriculture the opportunity and ability to provide consumers a chance to voice their opinions. In exchange, it allows consumers who prefer to purchase organic, natural production, or traditional production agriculture, to do so, at a safe and affordable price.\n\nWhat perks will \u201cBig Ag\u201d receive from SQ 777?\n\n\u201cThe first thing I would want Oklahomans to know is that current Oklahoma statute prohibits the ownership of agricultural land by foreign corporations. Additionally, this will not give additional protection or expand the authority of corporations doing business in the state of Oklahoma.\u201d\n\nCurrent laws on the books show this includes not only foreign businesses, but any American company not domiciled in the state of Oklahoma. Meaning the claims of \u201cBig Ag\u201d pushing family farmers and ranchers off their land are false.\n\nThe reality is, more farmers are retiring and selling their operations to others in agriculture.\n\nOthers are utilizing advances in technology, which allow a farm or ranch to operate more acreage on a larger scale. Additionally, many farmers and ranchers are creating corporations, which are used for tax purposes. At the end of the day, they\u2019re still family farmers.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not exactly a secret that big business is interested in agriculture. In fact, opportunities for farmers and ranchers to enter a contractual agreement are not uncommon.\n\n\u201cI would hope that most people realize that a family farmer today, while many are taking the opportunity to sell directly to the consumer, the vast majority of our products are sold to the consumers through middlemen, through corporations,\u201d said Buchanan.\n\nThese middlemen are generally brands we trust and purchase; such as Ocean Spray, Del Monte, Campbell\u2019s, and Tyson.\n\nDoes this mean bureaucrats in D.C. will have power to pollute?\n\nConcerns regarding bureaucrats holding all the power to make decisions are also false, and the pollution claims additionally don\u2019t hold true merit, especially when it comes to water. That\u2019s because Buchanan knows water conservation and regulation better than just about anyone else, thanks to a front row seat that allows him to see, understand and watch the water quality in Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cThe state of Oklahoma has a track record to show that the rules and regulations we have on the books today at the Department of Environmental Quality, Oklahoma Water Resources Board, and Environmental Protection Agency are successful, and are productive at cleaning up the waters in our great state,\u201d he says.\n\nBuchanan believes that Oklahoma Farm Bureau, along with farmers, care about water quality because clean water is vital for the income of families active in agriculture.\n\n\u201cI will tell you today that the water qualities across the state of Oklahoma are being cleaned up, and are a higher quality than they were yesterday, a year ago, and even 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nOutreach continuing\n\nCurrently, information is available online through a website and social media platforms, which have proven to be helpful tools in their campaign, especially as a dual promotion and education process is just taking off.\n\nFarm Bureau has begun these more grassroots-based approaches with less than a year to go until election day, in an effort to educate and inform audiences who may not normally be active in agriculture. And like his organization, Buchanan is doing whatever it takes to get the word out.\n\nAn example of his commitment was shown last August, when he travelled 3,200 miles in five days for monthly area meetings alone.\n\nStill, Buchanan is not showing any signs of slowing down, and is more than willing to travel for his fellow Okies. His personal outreach plans are simple- to talk to communities, members of both Rotary Club and Kiwanis Club, churches, and anybody else who is willing to listen.\n\n\u201cI would personally offer to be anywhere at any time that my calendar would allow across Oklahoma to have a discussion with any individual, whether they\u2019re rural folks, ag folks, energy people, urban folks that work downtown in Tulsa or Oklahoma City, whatever that may be, I welcome the opportunity and think that it would be a great thing, and the right thing, to do in the future to educate themselves on the issue and make the correct decision to protect Oklahoma agriculture, which ends up allowing the consumers who follow us, the opportunity to continue to have viable, affordable, abundant foods to feed their families.\u201d\n\nHis response when Red Dirt Report asked just how dedicated he was to meeting every person he could?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to talk to anyone, just so long as my schedule allows it.\u201d\n\nMore information can be found here.\n\nYou can also follow OKFB on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OKLAHOMA CITY- As many of our readers may know, 2016 is shaping up to be an interesting election year, thanks to an oversaturated field of hopeful presidential candidates who seem to continually be visiting Oklahoma.During these stops, hot button discussions have included gun control, Obamacare, immigration reform, and common core.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "Copyright 2007-2013 Red Dirt Report, a division of West Marie Media", "og": {"site_name": "Red Dirt Report", "description": "OKLAHOMA CITY- As many of our readers may know, 2016 is shaping up to be an interesting election year, thanks to an oversaturated field of hopeful presidential candidates who seem to continually be visiting Oklahoma.During these stops, hot button discussions have included gun control, Obamacare, immigration reform, and common core.", "title": "SQ 777: Why Oklahoma Farm Bureau wants you to have the \u201cRight-to-Farm\u201d", "url": "http://www.reddirtreport.com/red-dirt-news/sq-777-why-oklahoma-farm-bureau-wants-you-have-%E2%80%9Cright-farm%E2%80%9D", "image": "http://www.reddirtreport.com/sites/default/files/articles/2016/01/images/okfarmbureau1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-25T10:18:55-06:00", "type": "article"}, "abstract": "Red Dirt Report was launched July 4, 2007 as an informational website covering all manner of news, culture, entertainment and lifestyle stories that affect and interest Oklahoma readers and readers outside of our state.
