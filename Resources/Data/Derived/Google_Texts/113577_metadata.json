Joyner, M.D., department of anesthesiology, Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and Nigel Paneth, M.D., department of epidemiology and biostatistics, College of Human Medicine, Michigan State University.\n\nProponents must answer questions about how personalized medicine will change healthcare and be more realistic about what the public can expect, the authors wrote. The most important question, according to Joynet and Paneth, is: Where is the public health benefit to personalized medicine? If the initiative will not reduce major causes of mortality and morbidity, federal agencies, including the National Insitutes of Health, should question the reasoning behind the big investment in personalized medicine.\n\nPresident Barack Obama introduced the Precision Medicine Initative in his State of the Union address earlier this year, requesting $215 million for various agencies to pursue a wide-reaching effort to use patients' genetic profiles to map out specialized treatment.\n\nAdvocates say personalized or precision medicine will radically transform medical care and public health with prevention and treatment programs more closely targeted to the individual patient, wrote Joyner and Paneth. But they argue that assumptions underpinning personalized medicine have largely escaped questioning. They are not the first to warn the president's initiative may not revitalize medicine as much as proponents advertise; other experts have cautioned that meaningful progress will be a gradual transformation rather than the \"revolution\" of the precision model.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nWill the promise of precision medicine live up to the hype?\n\nObama touts cybersecurity, personalized medicine efforts in State of the Union address\n\nWhat will 'precision medicine' mean for providers?\n\nObama to request $215M for precision medicine plan\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The advocates of personalized or\u00a0precision medicine\u00a0may have set up unrealistic expectations about its promise while leaving many questions unanswered,\u00a0according to\u00a0a viewpoint article in the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The advocates of personalized or\u00a0precision medicine\u00a0may have set up unrealistic expectations about its promise while leaving many questions unanswered,\u00a0according to\u00a0a viewpoint article in the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association.", "title": "Do advocates overestimate the benefits of personalized medicine?", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/do-advocates-overestimate-benefits-personalized-medicine/2015-06-24", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient-centered care,personalized medicine,precision medicine,Precision Medicine Initiative,President Barack Obama,Preventive Care,public health benefit,The Journal Of The American Medical Association JAMA", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6fe\"", "article_summary": "Obama touts cybersecurity, personalized medicine efforts in State of the Union addressWhat will 'precision medicine' mean for providers?\nThe most important question, according to Joynet and Paneth, is: Where is the public health benefit to personalized medicine?\nBut they argue that assumptions underpinning personalized medicine have largely escaped questioning.\nProponents must answer questions about how personalized medicine will change healthcare and be more realistic about what the public can expect, the authors wrote.\nTo learn more:- read the articleRelated Articles:Will the promise of precision medicine live up to the hype?"}
