In essence, he suggested that the terror realized in Brussels \u2014 which claimed the lives of 34 innocents and injured scores more \u2014 mandates greater vigilance to prevent similar horror in the United States, in the form of special \u201cMuslim Police\u201d units.\n\nCruz\u2019s \u201cMuslim Police\u201d proposal spurred immediate alarm within the media and criticism from law enforcement leaders. For many, the very notion that specialized law enforcement manpower and resources could be exclusively dedicated to patrolling Muslim neighborhoods seemed absurd in modern America, and more specifically, a patent infringement of core civil liberties protections.\n\nNot far behind Trump in both delegates and rhetorical bluster, Cruz\u2019s \u201cMuslim Police\u201d proposal was expectedly derided by elements on both sides of the political divide. However, closer inspection of prevailing national security strategy \u2014 and specifically, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s expansion of counter-radicalization policing, also dubbed \u201ccountering violent extremism,\u201d reveals that Cruz\u2019s \u201cMuslim Police\u201d idea is hardly the brainchild of a polemicist on the far right, but a program already piloted by the Obama administration.\n\nThe \u201cMuslim Police\u201d are not only coming, but firmly patrolling and monitoring Muslim neighborhoods in several cities across America. Cruz\u2019s post-Belgium attack idea is hardly unprecedented \u2014 it is already installed policy.\n\nIn \u201cPolicing Radicalization,\u201d a critical study outlining the structure and strategy of American counter-radicalization policing, Ohio State law professor Amna Akbar writes, \u201cRadicalization and counter-radicalization are primarily if not almost exclusively concerned with Muslim communities.\u201d Radicalization theory contends that the more steeped in religion a Muslim becomes, the more he or she is likely to adopt an extremist ideology.\n\nTherefore, Islamic piety is the signal of radicalization. Nothing else, whether it be racist ideology or the militant nativism and xenophobia we see sweeping throughout the country, is linked to radicalization. Mirroring Cruz, DHS believes radicalization is a purely Muslim phenomenon, unfolding in Muslim neighborhoods.\n\nCounter-radicalization policing, piloted in Boston, Los Angeles and Minneapolis in 2014, seeks to prevent this process, particularly in Muslim-concentrated neighborhoods, mosques, community centers and virtual spaces. In conjunction with DHS, which provides resources and direction to city police departments, counter-radicalization seeks to build relationships with informants within Muslim American communities. In turn, this has empowered interlocutors within Muslim neighborhoods to patrol and police members of their mosques, community organizations and city blocks. It has extended the role of Muslim Police beyond just official city policemen and -women, but also private citizens residing within Muslim neighborhoods.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz and Donald Trump came under fire for awful plans to over-police Muslim communities.
