They don\u2019t see a need for it.\u201d\n\nWithin six months of acquiring its properties from Wells Fargo in foreclosure sales, Equity raised the attention of city officials by issuing 706 three-day eviction notices from January to June 2012. Equity\u2019s notices warned tenants who were late on rent that they had three days to pay before they would face eviction.\n\nAfter the city Rent Stabilization Board made those figures public, Equity stopped reporting the notices. Company executive John Hyjer said it was not required by law to notify the city of three-day eviction notices, only of unlawful detainers\u2014eviction cases filed in court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less onerous on the City of East Palo Alto\u2019s already stretched resources,\u201d Hyjer, Equity\u2019s first vice president of investments, said in an email.\n\nShirley Gibson, a lawyer for LegalAid San Mateo, said when the city is not told of all eviction notices, it becomes difficult for organizations like hers to direct tenants toward programs that assist with rent payment.\n\nIn June 2010, East Palo Alto voters passed the Rent Stabilization and Eviction for Good Cause Ordinance, designed to protect tenants from \u201cunreasonable rent increases\u201d and \u201carbitrary, discriminatory or retaliatory evictions,\u201d and to guarantee landlords the \u201cright to fair return.\u201d The proposed law, known as the Tenant Protection Ordinance, would expand tenant rights.\n\nSince Equity Residential objected to the proposed ordinance, city officials have been working with landlord and tenant representatives to make revisions. Equity views the proposed changes as a violation of local and state laws. Larisa Bowman, a lawyer for Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, called such concerns \u201cunfounded.\u201d\n\nEquity Residential has opposed other tenant protection efforts in California. Sam Zell, the company chairman, donated $50,000 to Proposition 98, a ballot measure that would have phased out rent control throughout California had it passed in June 2008. He is also the chairman of Equity Lifestyle Properties, which has filed lawsuits challenging city rent control laws in Santa Cruz and San Rafael. Both companies are real estate investment trusts and are publicly traded.\n\nSince Equity Residential\u2019s purchase of its East Palo Alto properties, some tenants have complained about difficulty paying rent \u2014 one type of complaint is that a person will be told by a rent collector to come back the next day and then will be informed the rent is late.\n\nBowman, the community legal representative, said some of the confusion over rent payments is because of the portfolio\u2019s change in ownership, from Page Mill Properties to Wells Fargo to Equity Residential. However, she still remains concerned. \u201cThe amount of rent a person is being evicted over is $47,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you after $47 or are you after this unit? I can\u2019t prove that [but] for tenants it certainly feels that way.\u201d\n\nWilliam Webster, a long-time advocate for affordable housing in East Palo Alto and member of the Rent Stabilization Board, said he believes Equity Residential wants to replace long-term tenants paying rent under market rate. \u201cThey\u2019re going to exploit every angle that is legally permissible in order to [extract] profits,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a vested interest at this point in making life miserable for long-term tenants, under the Rent Stabilization Program.\u201d\n\nEquity Residential said it does not intend to displace residents. But Hyjer noted \u201cthere has been a lot of discussion with the city that a significant amount of housing in Woodland Park has and is becoming functionally obsolete. Equity Residential has no intention of displacing current residents if and when this housing gets replaced.\u201d\n\nEast Palo Alto officials will present the newly drafted protection ordinance at a City Council meeting March 18. Councilman Abrica said officials are aware of Equity\u2019s reputation for playing hardball but added that the city would not be intimidated.\n\n\u201cIf they are determined to fight you, they will use every weapon at their disposal,\u201d Abrica said. \u201cWe have demonstrated that we\u2019re not going to roll over. If we have to fight, we will fight. But ultimately that becomes the decision of the council.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "affordable housing,bay area,East Palo Alto,Equity Residential,eviction,Housing,Marianne Levine,Proposition 98,Sam Zell,tenant rights,Business & Money,Frontpage Featured,Politics & Gov,Real Estate", "description": "Equity Residential is opposing a proposed city law that would provide relocation benefits to displaced tenants, tighten restrictions on demolishing buildings\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe158a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe have a history of offering protection for tenants because they\u2019re vulnerable,\u201d said Councilman Ruben Abrica, a former East Palo Alto mayor.\n\u201cIt\u2019s less onerous on the City of East Palo Alto\u2019s already stretched resources,\u201d Hyjer, Equity\u2019s first vice president of investments, said in an email.\nLarisa Bowman, a lawyer for Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, called such concerns \u201cunfounded.\u201dEquity Residential has opposed other tenant protection efforts in California.\nSince Equity Residential objected to the proposed ordinance, city officials have been working with landlord and tenant representatives to make revisions.\nAfter the city Rent Stabilization Board made those figures public, Equity stopped reporting the notices."}
