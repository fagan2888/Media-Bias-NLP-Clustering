George moves one floor down, becoming a lodger in the apartment occupied by two party-hardy gay cops (Cheyenne Jackson of Behind the Candelabra and Manny Perez of Pride and Glory). Ben persuades his nephew Elliot (Darren Burrows, so laconically wise as Ed in Northern Exposure) to let him crash at the Brooklyn home he shares with his writer wife, Kate (three-time Oscar nominee Marisa Tomei). There Ben is relegated to sleeping in the bunk bed below their son, Joey (Charlie Tahan, recently in Blue Jasmine). These make-do measures spark tensions within both sets of guests and hosts, while George and Ben struggle with the sadness of their separation.

Sachs, who wrote the script for Love Is Strange with Mauricio Zacharias (also his collaborator on 2012's Keep the Lights On), admirably avoids preaching to the audience or striking an overtly political stance. Instead he keeps the focus on the characters and their relationships. Scenes unfold organically, sometimes jumping subtly forward in time, the cityscapes made even more beautiful by the Chopin études playing beneath them.

I have to say that Sachs' casting choices are brilliant here: Lithgow and Molina, social acquaintances for years in real life, display a tender — and utterly believable — intimacy on screen. Tomei is equally convincing as a working mother dealing with an inattentive husband and an often surly teen (that would be Tahan, who portrays the agony and ecstasy of adolescence to perfection).

Though Love Is Strange overflows with modern-day hot buttons — marriage equality, orientation prejudice, income disparity — those issues are never allowed to crowd out the movingly genuine people at the heart of this timeless love story. Sachs has given us a delightful film that exquisitely demonstrates how, despite our differences, we are inexorably drawn to one another.
