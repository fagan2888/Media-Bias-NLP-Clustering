But the grant was late in coming and Towson kicked him out. (John Kelly/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen Teddy Boumboulis started at Towson University last fall, he became the first person in his family to go to college. Unfortunately, last month, he became the first person in his family to be thrown out of college for not paying his bills.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Teddy\u2019s fault. It was the fault of adults who didn\u2019t do enough to help him navigate the tricky shoals of the college-financing process.\n\nTeddy is one of nine children. His father died two years ago. His mother is on disability. He was a good student at Wheaton High, playing on the football and lacrosse teams and graduating with a 3.21 grade-point average. He was accepted at McDaniel College in Westminster, Md., but had his heart set on going to Towson, north of Baltimore. He rejoiced when he got in.\n\nMoney was going to be a problem, but Meghan Lynch of CollegeTracks, a nonprofit that works with students from low-income families in Montgomery County, helped Teddy and his mother fill out the necessary forms to apply for a guaranteed-access grant from the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC).\n\n\u201cShe told me that college was affordable through the grant,\u201d said Teddy, 19. \u201cI did whatever I had to do to make sure I would qualify and get accepted.\u201d\n\nAnd he was. Promised the $14,000 grant and some Pell money, Teddy registered for classes at Towson, moved into a dorm with a roommate and starting doing what no one else in his family had done. He had once bought and sold sneakers on eBay, so he decided to major in business administration. For the fall semester, Teddy earned three A\u2019s, a B-minus and a C-plus.\n\nBut when it came time to register for spring classes, Towson wouldn\u2019t let him. The school said he hadn\u2019t paid his bill from the previous semester.\n\nOf course, it was MHEC that was supposed to pay the bill. Teddy got in touch with it.\n\n\u201cEvery time I would call MHEC, they would tell me just to continue waiting for the grant, for my verification,\u201d Teddy said. \u201cThey said it\u2019s just a matter of time, it usually doesn\u2019t take this long. It will be solved soon, just keep waiting.\u201d\n\nSo Teddy did. He had gone to the financial aid office at Towson to try to resolve the overdue-bill issue. He says he was told that because he was an MHEC-financed student, there was nothing Towson could do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the nature of the conversation was,\u201d said David Horne, director of financial aid at Towson. \u201cThe standard response is, \u2018You\u2019re having an issue with MHEC, you have to resolve it with MHEC.\u2019 Unfortunately, that was difficult.\u201d\n\nTowson did not offer to help.\n\nThe MHEC grant wasn\u2019t disbursed until February, weeks after classes had started and after Towson ordered Teddy to vacate his room. His mother, Laura, said Teddy was mortified as he packed his belongings.\n\nMHEC sent me a statement in which Donna E. Thomas, director of the Office of Student Financial Assistance, apologized \u201cfor any inconvenience or confusion\u201d that Teddy endured. In an interview, she said Teddy had failed to provide a necessary financial document. Teddy and his mother insist that MHEC had the document. CollegeTracks says its records indicate that the document was faxed to MHEC the previous summer.\n\nI understand that when it comes to financial aid, every i must be dotted, every t crossed. But even if that document was missing, someone \u2014 at MHEC and at Towson \u2014 should have worked with Teddy to straighten things out.\n\nSaid Nancy Leopold, executive director of CollegeTracks: \u201cWe would hope that colleges would understand that these first-generation-to-go-to-college, low-income students who have worked so hard to get admitted deserve and require a higher level of care and compassion because the barriers they inevitably face can cut their college journey short. That doesn\u2019t work for anybody. Not for the kid, not for the college, not for society.\u201d\n\nTowson didn\u2019t treat Teddy like someone who needed extra care. It didn\u2019t act like a compassionate learning community eager to share its resources with someone who had gone to great lengths to attend \u2014 and whom it had accepted. It acted like a cable company dealing with a delinquent customer, and it treated Teddy accordingly. It cut him off.\n\nRemarkably, Teddy bears no ill will toward the university. \u201cI want to resume classes at Towson as soon as I can,\u201d he said. \u201cI love the school. I love everything about it. I just didn\u2019t love what happened to me.\u201d\n\nMHEC\u2019s Thomas said mechanisms are now in place to process grant disbursements more quickly. She confirmed Teddy\u2019s eligibility for the 2015-2016 academic year. Teddy has spent the past few weeks moving furniture. He is going to try to get a job until classes start in the fall.\n\nHere\u2019s an idea: Towson should hire Teddy to work at the front desk of the financial aid office. That way, there will be someone there who can show a little empathy.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/johnkelly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Through no fault of his own, Teddy Boumboulis\u2019s college dream was cut short.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/johnfranciskelly", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Through no fault of his own, Teddy Boumboulis\u2019s college dream was cut short.", "title": "For one Towson University student, a hard lesson in financial aid", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/for-one-towson-university-student-a-hard-lesson-in-financial-aid/2015/03/29/9317b61c-d3e6-11e4-8fce-3941fc548f1c_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/26/Local/Images/teddy-141427407810.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JohnKelly"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "college financial aid, maryland higher education commission, guaranteed access grant, towson university financial aid", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/johnfranciskelly"}, "eomportal-uuid": "9317b61c-d3e6-11e4-8fce-3941fc548f1c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "college financial aid, maryland higher education commission, guaranteed access grant, towson university financial aid"}, "article_summary": "But when it came time to register for spring classes, Towson wouldn\u2019t let him.\nHere\u2019s an idea: Towson should hire Teddy to work at the front desk of the financial aid office.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the nature of the conversation was,\u201d said David Horne, director of financial aid at Towson.\nThe MHEC grant wasn\u2019t disbursed until February, weeks after classes had started and after Towson ordered Teddy to vacate his room.\nHe had gone to the financial aid office at Towson to try to resolve the overdue-bill issue."}
