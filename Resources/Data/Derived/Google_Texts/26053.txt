The former delta state and Pittsburgh Steeler player has recently had a book published that tells about his life and how he got to where he is today. Rozzell was signing copies of his book at the Quitman Depot as well as offering words of wisdom to those who came out to see him

"The thing that I learned is that the hardships, and I really believe this, the hardships that you go through when you're young will determine how you can survive, and you just can't give up,‚Äù Rozzell says.
