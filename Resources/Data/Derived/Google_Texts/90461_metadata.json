In a Company position paper released today, ATLAS says the \u201cGolden Age of Diagnostics\u201d is a time when labs need to respond to healthcare market forces instead of being swept aside by them.\n\nThe Company\u2019s new white paper \u2014 \u201cThrive Amid Healthcare Pressures by Leveraging Laboratory Value \u2014 Embracing 8 Strategic Solutions Powered by the ATLAS Coordinated Diagnostics Platform\u2122\u201d \u2014 shares how labs become the epicenter and shake off perception of being a cost center. Lab and other diagnostic data (as well as information technology to track them) are vital to stakeholders that have financial incentives, propelled by the Affordable Care Act, to coordinate patient care and slow healthcare cost growth.\n\nIn the paper, ATLAS explains how healthcare pressures \u2014 mergers, hospital closures, reimbursement constrictions and others \u2014 threaten a lab\u2019s operations and even the ability to stay in business. Strategic labs leverage diagnostic data to improve healthcare outcomes and reduce costs, according to ATLAS. \u201cStrategic labs deliver knowledge and insight across individuals and populations, and now payers are in the mix. They manage the diagnostics process at a different level, because they are concerned with improving outcomes in healthcare and decreasing healthcare spending,\u201d said Rob Atlas, founder of Atlas Medical.\n\nExplored in the Company\u2019s white paper are the eight Platform solutions including those focused on \u201cclean\u201d test orders and results reporting; faster and more advanced electronic medical record connectivity and multi-lab connectivity; and enhanced workflow at patient service centers. Newer ATLAS Platform solutions aid labs in embracing consumerism, achieving patient-centricity, optimizing test utilization and enabling actionable intelligence.\n\n\u201cThe Platform is a strategic solution that connects outside the four walls of the healthcare organization to the care continuum,\u201d said Rob Atlas. With powerful adjunct technology, the Platform seamlessly and elegantly melds with enterprise EHR, LIS and other third-party middleware and outreach solutions.\n\nFor more information on Coordinated Diagnostics, or to request a complimentary copy of the white paper \u201cThrive Amid Healthcare Pressures by Leveraging Laboratory Value \u2014 Embracing 8 Strategic Solutions Powered by the ATLAS Coordinated Diagnostics Platform\u2122\u201d, visit http://atlasmedical.com/coordinated-diagnostics/.\n\nAbout Atlas Medical\n\nAtlas Medical is a trusted provider of industry leading, configurable software that is changing how healthcare is coordinated across the care continuum.
