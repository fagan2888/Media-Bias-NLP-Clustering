But they do care about special breaks for big business and the influence big money has on policy.\n\n\u201cPeople are very worried about the idea that money in politics is getting special privileges, and to the extent they ever see that actual connection between political favors and any kind of contribution, they are very upset about it,\u201d Steyer said.\n\nSteyer failed to mention that Americans won\u2019t see much impact on policy from the nearly $67 million he spent on the 2014 cycle because most of his favored candidates lost.\n\nPart of it is that voters don\u2019t much care about his issues. Just 1 percent of Americans in a Gallup poll taken Nov. 6-9 said climate or pollution is the greatest issue facing the United States.\n\nSteyer had a different take. He said Democrats lost because they didn\u2019t step up for the environment and make it important to more voters.\n\n\u201cI think that my interpretation of the 2014 elections is, not standing up for the things you deeply believe in is not really a great idea,\u201d he said, echoing the sentiments of many progressives following the Democrats\u2019 idrubbng at the polls.\n\nSteyer said \u201cin this case, particularly given the way that activist Democrats and young people across the country feel about this, not standing up for the things you really believe in, in an attempt to protect yourself, doesn\u2019t feel like a winning strategy.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Steyer didn't mention that there won\u2019t be much impact from the nearly $67 million he spent on the 2014 cycle because most of his favored candidates lost.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Steyer didn't mention that there won\u2019t be much impact from the nearly $67 million he spent on the 2014 cycle because most of his favored candidates lost.", "title": "Tom Steyer, Largest 2014 Donor, Says Americans Worry Big Political Donors Get \u2018Special Privileges\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/tomsteyer.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-20T23:36:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zGGRUf"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Steyer didn't mention that there won\u2019t be much impact from the nearly $67 million he spent on the 2014 cycle because most of his favored candidates lost.", "title": "Tom Steyer, Largest 2014 Donor, Says Americans Worry Big Political Donors Get \u2018Special Privileges\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/tomsteyer.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "politics", "published_time": "2014-11-21T03:01:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-20T23:36:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "steyer, tom steyer, enviroment, enviromental issues, campaigns, elections, politics, political donations"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb6b\"", "article_summary": "But they do care about special breaks for big business and the influence big money has on policy.\nHe said Democrats lost because they didn\u2019t step up for the environment and make it important to more voters.\nPeople may not inherently care about big-picture ideas, he said at a panel discussion on climate change Wednesday sponsored by the Center for American Progress.\nJust 1 percent of Americans in a Gallup poll taken Nov. 6-9 said climate or pollution is the greatest issue facing the United States.\nPart of it is that voters don\u2019t much care about his issues."}
