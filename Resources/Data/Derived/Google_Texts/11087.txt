Patients in Alabama wait an average of 23 minutes and 25 seconds to see the doctor, which is more than four minutes longer than the national average, according to the sixth Annual Vitals Index.

The report is compiled from about four million patient-reported wait times, which varied significantly across different cities and states. Patients reported thier experiences to the website Vitals.com. New Hampshire patients have the shortest average wait time at just 15 minutes and four seconds.

Overall, wait times decreased compared to last year. The national average was down by more than a minute by comparison. The average wait time in Alabama decreased by almost a minute compared to last year.

That comes as a surprise for experts who predicted longer wait times and more crowded waiting rooms in the first year of the Affordable Care Act.

Reasons for the decrease could include increased use of urgent care and retail clinics. Physician assistants and nurse practitioners could also be taking the load off primary care doctors, said Vitals.com founder Mitch Rothschild.

"If you look at the number of urgent care centers, I guarantee you there are probably twenty-five percent more than there were a few years ago."

The differences in wait times between states and cities might boil down to the number of medical providers, Rothschild said. Sixty of the state's 67 counties are classified as having a shortage of primary care physicians, according to the Alabama Rural Health Association.

"Probably the doctor-patient ratio is the main reason," Rothschild said.

The amount of time patients wait for doctors depends on more than just geography. Different specialties have different average wait times. Unfortunately for those who dread the drill, dentists have the shortest wait time at 13 minutes and 31 seconds. Pain specialists have the most agonizing wait at 24 minutes and 52 seconds.
