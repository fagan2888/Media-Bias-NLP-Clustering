Residents are graduates of U.S. accredited medical schools.\n\nLANSING \u2014 Once a week, Mike Dosch typically works out of an operating room at Dearborn's Beaumont Hospital, formerly Oakwood Hospital, delivering anesthesia to his patients.\n\n\n\nDosch, a certified registered nurse anesthetist for 25 years, works as part of what's known in the industry as an anesthesia care team. A physician who supervises as many as four registered nurses will order an anesthetic, he said, and the nurse anesthetist will decide the best way to give it.\n\n\n\n\"(Physicians) help start cases; they are there available for consultation,\" said Dosch, also chairman of and an associate professor in the nurse anesthesiology department at the University of Detroit Mercy.\n\n\n\n\"Generally speaking, particularly with cases that are sort of routine, we don't see them much during the day.\"\n\n\n\nMore than 30 miles away, in Ann Arbor, Kevin Tremper, M.D., manages a team of 150 faculty anesthesiologists, 140 anesthesiology residents and roughly 120 nurse anesthetists as chairman of the anesthesiology department at the University of Michigan.\n\n\n\nDoctors and nurses who give anesthesia care are battling over an important part of the treatment: which member of the health care team should be delivering the medicine.\n\n\n\nA bill pending in the state Senate would remove Michigan's requirement that physicians supervise nurse anesthetists, effectively allowing registered nurses to order and administer anesthesia on their own before, during and after surgery. The bill also would allow nurse anesthetists to practice independently during obstetrics and diagnostic procedures.\n\n\n\nThe bill remains in the Senate's Health Policy Committee; it has not come up for a vote since testimony was heard in May.\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirement 'on paper'?\n\nNurse anesthetists are registered nurses who have gone through advanced training in anesthesia care. They are licensed under Michigan's public health code.\n\n\n\nA 1989 decision by then-Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley further outlined the requirement that nurse anesthetists can give anesthesia under the delegation and supervision of a physician. That isn't limited to anesthesiologists; surgeons or other doctors on staff are able to sign off on the treatment plan.\n\n\n\n\"It's really just a supervision requirement on paper,\" said Anna Polyak, senior director of state government affairs for the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists. \"Surgeons, they don't like to be a supervising physician if they don't have to be because, again, it's not their area of expertise.\"\n\n\n\nThe Michigan Association of Nurse Anesthetists says it has 2,300 members, with another 150 students and 400 more registered nurse anesthetists in Michigan who don't belong to the association. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, however, estimated 1,780 were working in Michigan as of May 2014, the most recent data available.\n\n\n\nUnder Kowall's bill, Senate Bill 320, nurse anesthetists would be allowed to develop a patient's treatment plan; perform all tests and procedures related to treatment; order, prescribe and administer anesthesia, including prescription drugs or other controlled substances; and handle any patient emergencies that might arise during the procedure.\n\n\n\nNurse anesthetists only would be allowed to give anesthesia in a licensed health facility or other medical setting during surgery, obstetrical or interventional procedures or for diagnostic imaging purposes. Those services would not include chronic pain management, although nurses could give anesthesia to manage pain if delegated the authority by a physician.\n\n\n\nKowall said he plans to revise the bill to specifically exclude dental clinics from the list of facilities in which nurse anesthetists could practice without supervision.\n\n\n\n\"They're helping to keep the cost of health care down,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSupporters, including the Michigan nurse anesthetists association, say that's one of the main reasons they're pushing the bill. Anesthetists are less expensive. (See box, above right.)\n\n\n\n\n\nNo opt-out\n\nOne number readily available is 17 \u2014 the number of states that have opted out of a Medicare physician supervision requirement since 2001, when a federal rule change first gave states the choice. Minnesota and Wisconsin are the only neighboring states to have done so.\n\n\n\nMichigan can't opt out of the Medicare requirement because the state's definition of nursing practice doesn't include nurses giving anesthesia independently, the state's hospital association said in testimony. That would change if the bill becomes law, it said, although hospitals will continue to be able to adopt supervision requirements if they wish.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, the Institute of Medicine, a unit of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, issued a report that called for nurses to play a larger role in the delivery of health care as the U.S. looks to lower costs and increase efficiency \u2014 all while its population grays. Requirements under the Affordable Care Act also mean more Americans now have health insurance, which adds to the potential patient load.\n\n\n\nA study that year in the journal Nursing Economics found that nurse anesthetists practicing without a doctor's supervision was the most cost-effective form of care and \"the only model likely to have positive net revenue in venues of low demand.\" That study was paid for by the national nurse anesthetists' association.\n\n\n\nSince they are capable of giving the same anesthesia services, including on complicated cardiac or pediatric cases, its authors wrote, \"anesthesiologists and CRNAs are interchangeable.\"\n\n\n\nThe supervision requirement isn't so much to dictate how the anesthesia is given, but to address other medical issues that arise, said Tom George, M.D., a physician anesthesiologist who practices in Kalamazoo and a past president of the Michigan Society of Anesthesiologists.\n\n\n\nWhat happens, George said, if a patient wakes up from surgery and his left arm is numb? The medical issues, he said, are outside the realm of the nurse anesthetist.\n\nVarying views\n\nWhether anesthesia is safer when given by a nurse anesthetist or an anesthesiologist also depends on whom you ask \u2014 and who is funding the study.\n\n\n\nA 2010 study in the journal Health Affairs found no significant increase in patient risk when anesthesia was given by a nurse anesthetist working without supervision. That study was funded by the national nurse anesthetists' group.\n\n\n\nSeparately, a 2000 study found that both the 30-day mortality rate among patients and the mortality rate after complications arise were less when anesthesiologists led the treatment. That study was mostly funded by the researchers, they wrote, with grants from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the American Board of Anesthesiology in Raleigh, N.C.\n\n\n\nThe Cochrane Library, a collection of databases specializing in health care research, concluded in a 2014 review of available research that no definitive answer is possible when it comes to which method of anesthesia delivery is best.\n\n\n\nNurse anesthetists, said Tremper, are \"the \u2014 by far \u2014 best-trained, most-skilled nurses, period.\"\n\n\n\n\"They do a great job,\" he added. \"We think working with us has been very effective in providing very safe care, and we think we have a lot of room to improve in improving postoperative outcomes, but just to avoid having a physician involved seems like not a good idea.\"\n\n\n\nLindsay VanHulle: (517) 657-2204.
