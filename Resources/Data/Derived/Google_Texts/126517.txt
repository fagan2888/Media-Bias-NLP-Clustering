In this interactive map of racial segregation in our capital, Washington D.C., it is quite remarkable to think our country’s leaders are living in one of the most racially segregated big cities in the United States.

More from the Washington Post:

What sets D.C. apart from many Metro areas that rank ahead of it, though, is that it has very large populations of both black and white residents. The D.C. Metro area is about one-quarter black, and the city proper is about half African American, with more blacks than whites. Only a few other major metropolitan areas that rank ahead of D.C. on the dissimilarity index — Detroit, New Orleans, Memphis and Atlanta — are as heavily African American.

Plenty of cities are similarily segregated, in fact, the D.C. Metro area scores 88th out of 318 metropolitan areas on the University of Michigan’s dissimilarity index, when you compare the black and white populations. What is interesting about the above image however, is the clear line down the middle of the city dividing the two races.
