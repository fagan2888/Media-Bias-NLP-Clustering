It is known as the \u201cHoliday Heart Syndrome\u201d and the cause of it can be attributed to overloading on alcohol. The syndrome is most commonly referred to as the association between alcohol use and rhythm disturbances.\n\n\u201cHoliday heart syndrome should be particularly considered as a diagnosis in patients without structural heart disease and with new-onset atrial fibrillation,\u201d according to Medscape.\n\n\u201cMost studies investigating holiday heart trends have found a statistical increase in heart attacks and other problems \u2014 not a giant surge but worth noting just the same,\u201d said Dr. Richard Stein, a cardiologist at New York University's Medical Center and a spokesperson for the American Heart Association, Health24 reported.\n\nTreating and preventing \u201cHoliday Heart Syndrome\u201d is important as heart-related problems linked with Christmas and New Year\u2019s account for 2,000 extra deaths per year, said David Phillips a sociologist at the University of California's San Diego campus.\n\nThere are other risk factors for heart disease that for many are common knowledge such as smoking, diabetes, and lack of exercise, but there is also evidence that the time of year might contribute to this as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also learning that there are certain triggers for cardiovascular events, including time of the year and seasons,\u201d said, Robert A. Kloner, M.D., Ph.D., a researcher at Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, \u201cIf we can get a true handle on the seasonal variation, we could knock down death from coronary disease.\u201d\n\nSo understanding the causes and symptoms is important. Not only does alcohol contribute to \u201cHoliday Heart Syndrome,\u201d but strenuous activities in the cold-weather, and a lack of exercise can exacerbate the problem as well.\n\nPreventive care is the best advice. According to Dr. Stein, \u201cflu shots, avoiding excessive eating and drinking, and getting enough exercise throughout the season,\u201d are all helpful steps in preventing yourself from landing in the emergency room. However, in the case that mild symptoms such as chest pains, heavy breathing, and heart attack-like symptoms do appear, they should not be ignored.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "holiday heart syndrome", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A rise in heart attacks during the holiday season could be linked to alcohol as \"Holiday Heart Syndrome\" is common during this time of year.", "title": "'Holiday Heart Syndrome' Responsible For An Estimated 2,000 Deaths Each Year", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/holiday-heart-syndrome-might-be-good-reason-go-easy-eggnog-year-265780", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/24/shutterstock167257241.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A rise in heart attacks during the holiday season could be linked to alcohol as \"Holiday Heart Syndrome\" is common during this time of year.", "title": "'Holiday Heart Syndrome' Responsible For An Estimated 2,000 Deaths Each Year", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/holiday-heart-syndrome-might-be-good-reason-go-easy-eggnog-year-265780", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/24/shutterstock167257241.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/24/shutterstock167257241.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-12-24T15:51:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-24T15:53:53-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A rise in heart attacks during the holiday season could be linked to alcohol as \"Holiday Heart Syndrome\" is common during this time of year."}, "article_summary": "A rise in heart attacks during the holiday season could be linked to alcohol as \"Holiday Heart Syndrome\" is common during this time of year.\n\u201cHoliday heart syndrome should be particularly considered as a diagnosis in patients without structural heart disease and with new-onset atrial fibrillation,\u201d according to Medscape.\nIt is known as the \u201cHoliday Heart Syndrome\u201d and the cause of it can be attributed to overloading on alcohol.\nAlthough the season to be jolly is here, throwing back the holiday wines and beers can increase heart troubles during the holiday season.\nNot only does alcohol contribute to \u201cHoliday Heart Syndrome,\u201d but strenuous activities in the cold-weather, and a lack of exercise can exacerbate the problem as well."}
