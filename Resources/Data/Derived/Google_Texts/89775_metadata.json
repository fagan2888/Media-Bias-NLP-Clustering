By associating the entrepreneurial free market with \u201ccorporate greed,\u201d the Left frames conservatives as being against middle class America. It\u2019s a strategy that has a long record of success. Recall that in 2009, Democrats approved another massive entitlement program \u2013 ObamaCare \u2013 in part by rallying behind a false narrative: that millions of Americans were uninsured because \u201cselfish\u201d insurers were swimming in massive profits. In truth, insurers were operating on a 2% profit margin. Democrats knew their PR stunt was a lie, but they successfully swayed public perception at a pivotal moment. Indeed, every progressive cause has traces of gross distortion, and, similar to how leftists overhauled the health care industry, they\u2019re fabricating the war on corporate America. The American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Mark J. Perry writes, \u201cWhen a random sample of American adults were asked the question \u2018Just a rough guess, what percent profit on each dollar of sales do you think the average company makes after taxes?\u2019 for the Reason-Rupe poll in May 2013, the average response was 36%!\u201d The reality? Memo to Occupy Wall Street: \u201cNot surprisingly they are off by a huge margin,\u201d Perry notes. \u201cAccording to [a] Yahoo!Finance database for 212 different industries, the average profit margin for the most recent quarter was 7.5% and the median profit margin was 6.5%.\u201d If this teaches us anything, it\u2019s that Republicans must dismantle the Left\u2019s big lies. The propaganda machine is not conquered by twiddling thumbs.
