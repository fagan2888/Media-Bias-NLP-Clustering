And so, I appreciate his kind words. We're very proud of our work, but I think women in this country and families and men are going to be very concerned about a president who wants to roll back access to affordable health care in America.\"\n\nTrump's previous support for partial-birth abortion and an interview from the 1990s, where he described himself as \"very pro-choice,\" have been a thorn in his side throughout the Republican presidential race. His leading critic on the issue has been fellow GOP hopeful Ted Cruz, whose campaign was targeting by Trump's attorney recently after releasing an ad that questioned the billionaire's opposition to abortion.\n\nAfter waffling on the issue for months, the real estate mogul firmed up his support for ending Planned Parenthood's federal funding during his interview with CBN News last week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood head Cecile Richards thanked Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump Wednesday for his kind words about the organization.\nIn an interview last week with CBN News, Trump said of Planned Parenthood: As long as they do abortion, I am not for funding Planned Parenthood.
