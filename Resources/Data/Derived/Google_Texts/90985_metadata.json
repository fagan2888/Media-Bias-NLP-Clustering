Among them, according to a new study, is a longer-lasting, more functional body. The study found that older people who enjoy life maintain a better physical function later into life.\n\n\u201cThe study shows that older people who are happier and enjoy life more show slower declines in physical function as they age,\u201d said Dr. Andrew Steptoe, of University College London, in a press release. \u201cThey are less likely to develop impairments in activities of daily living such as dressing or getting in or out of bed, and their walking speed declines at a slower rate than those who enjoy life less.\u201d\n\nThe findings fall in line with many previous studies that have found that an active, outgoing, and optimistic person is more likely to be happy and healthy into old age. The catch though, may be that happiness has to come from young age first. A July 2013 study, for example, found that people who were more outgoing and emotionally stable during young adulthood were more likely to carry those traits as they aged. This in turn could affect physical well-being, as evidenced by the current study.\n\nThe current study looked followed 3,199 men and women over eight years. The participants were split into three age groups (60-69, 70-79, and 80 and over), and asked to assess their enjoyment of life on a four-point scale. Specifically, they were asked to rate their happiness based on the following statements: \u201cI enjoy the things that I do,\u201d \u201cI enjoy being in the company of others,\u201d \u201cOn balance, I look back on my life with a sense of happiness,\u201d and \u201cI feel full of energy these days.\u201d\n\nTheir answers were compared to interviews in which the participants reported on how well they carried out daily tasks, such as getting dressed, getting in and out of bed, and bathing. Their walking speed was also determined with a gait test. Overall, the researchers found that happiness correlated to better physical function. Unsurprisingly, they also found that participants in the youngest age group were most likely to report and exhibit well-being. Besides them, participants with higher socioeconomic status, an education, and who were married were also better able to function.\n\nConversely, the participants who suffered from chronic illness \u2014 heart diseases, diabetes, and depression, for example \u2014 were more likely to be unhappy with life. People with low well-being were more than three times as likely to develop problems that affected their physical function. \u201cThis is not because happier people are in better health, or younger, or richer, or have more healthy lifestyles at the outset, since even when we take these factors into account, the relationship persists,\u201d Steptoe said in the release.\n\nThere are many factors that contribute to happiness, well-being, and physical and mental health, and they\u2019re all interrelated. A study from last June found that volunteering, which meant remaining active and social, reduced the risk of hypertension \u2014 a factor leading to unhappiness \u2014 by 40 percent. For retired people, the risk of unhappiness could even rise, as social interaction and physical activity lessens. A study from May found that well-being gradually decreased as a person spent more time retired. \u201cIt is possible that health will initially improve when somebody retires and then, after a while, start to deteriorate due to reduced physical activity and social interaction,\u201d one of the study\u2019s authors, Gabriel Sahlgren, said at the time.\n\nLooking into ways to prolong well-being in older adults \u201cmay have benefits to society and health care systems,\u201d Steptoe said in the press release. \u201cOur results provide further evidence that enjoyment of life is relevant to the future disability and mobility of older people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "physical health, physical function, older adults physical health, aging, happiness, enjoyment of life,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Older adults who are happier with life were more likely to be physically healthy as well, meaning that they could carry out daily activities without difficulty.", "title": "Enjoy Life And Maintain Physical Health For Longer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/adults-who-enjoy-life-could-be-physically-healthy-longer-267470", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/19/old-man-walking.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Older adults who are happier with life were more likely to be physically healthy as well, meaning that they could carry out daily activities without difficulty.", "title": "Enjoy Life And Maintain Physical Health For Longer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/adults-who-enjoy-life-could-be-physically-healthy-longer-267470", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/19/old-man-walking.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/19/old-man-walking.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-01-20T12:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-20T12:00:02-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Older adults who are happier with life were more likely to be physically healthy as well, meaning that they could carry out daily activities without difficulty."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceeb5\"", "article_summary": "The study found that older people who enjoy life maintain a better physical function later into life.\nOlder adults who are happier with life were more likely to be physically healthy as well, meaning that they could carry out daily activities without difficulty.\nThere are many factors that contribute to happiness, well-being, and physical and mental health, and they\u2019re all interrelated.\n\u201cOur results provide further evidence that enjoyment of life is relevant to the future disability and mobility of older people.\u201d\nLooking into ways to prolong well-being in older adults \u201cmay have benefits to society and health care systems,\u201d Steptoe said in the press release."}
