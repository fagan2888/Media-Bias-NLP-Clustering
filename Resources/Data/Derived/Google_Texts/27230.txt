Here's Republican logic for you.





@SenJohnThune Six million people risk losing their health care subsidies, yet @POTUS continues to deny that Obamacare is bad for the American people.

No, it doesn't make any sense, from the part where it's not exactly President Obama's fault that the Supreme Court could destroy subsidies for those six million people to the part where he's somehow suggesting that it's a bad thing that this law is bad for American people is now threatened? It's a bad law and bad for Americans and bad it's going away, apparently.

He followed up with this.





@SenJohnThune A "one-sentence" Band-Aid can't fix flawed Obamacare, riddled with #BrokenPromises from skyrocketing costs to failing state exchanges.



@SenJohnThune .@Senate_GOPs are working hard to help those hurt by Obamacare, which is a fundamentally flawed system. #BrokenPromises

A one-sentence fix could certainly take care of Thune's supposed initial concern, that six million people are going to lose their subsidies. I guess that's quibbling. He finishes big. Stupid, but big. asked him to show us his work on that one, but no response so far.
