Direct-lending funds are in the midst of a fundraising bonanza with the amount of capital raised by such funds quadrupling over the past three years, according to a report by Preqin.

U.S. firm Crescent Capital is one such firm making headway with its first Europe-focused direct lending fund, according regulatory filings and a person familiar with the matter. The firm is above the 375 million euro ($395 million) mark for the EUR500 million vehicle, which is expected to close by the end of summer.

Private equity firms including CVC Capital Partners , EQT Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Permira have all established lending arms in recent years.

Direct-lending funds raised $29.1 billion for deals last year, compared with $24.9 billion in 2013 and $7.1 billion in 2012, according to Preqin.

“This is a market that arose because you had a pullback by traditional lenders, albeit they are back strongly now,” said David Parker, a partner at debt advisory boutique Marlborough Partners, who added that these debt funds have been helped by low interest rates and investors search for yield.
