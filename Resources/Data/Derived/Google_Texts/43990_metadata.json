Um, and the people that \u2014 and I understand it. They\u2019re very, very angry because the GOP did not listen the first time around. They didn\u2019t listen to the Ron Paul people who are way ahead of the curve. Then the Tea Party people they rubbed our nose in it, and they are tired, and they have created Donald Trump. The people are speaking clearly. And there\u2019s two ways to go. Anger and nationalism. Nationalism has been done before in history. You can go for nationalism. You can go for anger.\n\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Trump is Adolf Hitler?\n\nBECK: If you look what is happening with Donald Trump and his playing to the lowest common denominator and the anger in us. You know, Adolf Hitler \u2014 we all look at Adolf Hitler in 1940. We should look at him in 1929. He was the kind of funny, character that said the things that people were thinking. Where Donald Trump takes it, I have absolutely no idea. But, Donald Trump is a dangerous man with the things he\u2019s been saying. Now, the GOP is playing unbelievable games right now. Trying to make sure they get their way. And they\u2019re trying to go for a brokered convention. I\u2019m against Donald Trump. But I\u2019ll tell you one thing, if he gets close enough, and the GOP tries to play games, I won\u2019t vote for Donald Trump ever, but I\u2019ll stand with his right because the people have spoken. And what the GOP is doing, they\u2019re stirring things up because they\u2019re more afraid of Ted Cruz than Donald Trump.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Glenn Beck: Trump Is Like Adolf Hitler in 1929", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Glenn Beck: Trump Is Like Adolf Hitler in 1929", "title": "Glenn Beck: Trump Is Like Adolf Hitler in 1929 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/glenn-beck-hitler-salute.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-03-06T11:42:33-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/03/06/glenn-beck-on-donald-trump/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Glenn Beck: Trump Is Like Adolf Hitler in 1929", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/glenn-beck-hitler-salute.jpg", "title": "Glenn Beck: Trump Is Like Adolf Hitler in 1929 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Glenn Beck,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Glenn Beck", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-03-06T08:34:21-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-03-06T11:42:33-07:00", "tag": "Glenn Beck", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "You know, Adolf Hitler \u2014 we all look at Adolf Hitler in 1940.\nSunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d radio talk show host Glenn Beck likened Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler in an interview with host George Stephanopoulos.\nThen the Tea Party people they rubbed our nose in it, and they are tired, and they have created Donald Trump.\nSTEPHANOPOULOS: Trump is Adolf Hitler?\nBECK: If you look what is happening with Donald Trump and his playing to the lowest common denominator and the anger in us."}
