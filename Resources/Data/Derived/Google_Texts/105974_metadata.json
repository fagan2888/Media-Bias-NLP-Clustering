She does not qualify for the tax subsidies because her income is greater than 400 percent of poverty. She does not have to do anything.\n\n2) \"John\"\n\n25-year-old man\n\nHas never purchased or had health insurance and doesn\u2019t understand why he would\n\nHousehold income less than $60,000\n\nQualifies for a subsidy\n\nHPC: John should ask his parents to see if they could add him to their policy because the Affordable Care Act allows for dependents to be covered up to the age of 26.\n\nJohn could also consider purchasing catastrophic coverage only available to individuals 30-years-old and younger through the marketplace, which would provide health insurance with low premiums and a high deductible.\n\nWith an income of approximately $60,000 per year, John does not qualify for a subsidy because this is greater than 400 percent of poverty.\n\n3) \"Maria\"\n\n30 year old woman\n\nSelf-employed, Currently purchases her own insurance\n\nHousehold income of less than $60,000\n\nQualifies for a subsidy\n\nHas a child with another child on the way\n\nHPC: The Health Insurance Marketplace offers many options for Maria.\n\nBeing self employed with no employees, Maria could purchase an individual plan that may prove to be equal to or better that what she currently has and quite possibly at a cost savings.\n\nHer children may also qualify for Medicaid or CHIPS, which would be at no additional charge to Maria.\n\nSince Maria currently has an insurance plan, it is likely that she has an insurance agent. If so, the insurance agent could assist Maria with any questions she may have about the Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\n4) \"Adam\"\n\n56-year-old man\n\nCurrently has insurance through his employer, but employer is dropping coverage.\n\nHas never purchased his own insurance\n\nHousehold income of less than $60,000\n\nDoes not qualify for a subsidy\n\nHas diabetes\n\nHPC: The Health Insurance Marketplace is available to everyone, including those individuals who don\u2019t qualify for a tax subsidy.\n\nAdam will be able to purchase a health insurance policy despite his pre-existing condition of diabetes. He should review the plans on the marketplace and pay close attention to the provider networks each plan offers.\n\nIf Adam has a specific endocrinologist that he is currently seeing for his diabetes, he will want to make sure that the plan he picks has his provider. Adam may want to find a Navigator and ask for assistance.\n\nEmail us your questions on getting coverage using the health exchanges and we may feature them in a future post.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "With health insurance exchanges now open across the country, including here in Florida, there are still questions as to if and how people can get and", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.wjct.org/post/making-sense-health-insurance-exchange-health-planning-council", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wjct/files/styles/medium/public/201310/caduceus_on_white_question_mark.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With health insurance exchanges now open across the country, including here in Florida, there are still questions as to if and how people can get and", "title": "Making Sense Of The Health Insurance Exchange: Health Planning Council"}, "story_id": 230125718, "twitter": {"site": "@WJCTJax", "card": "summary", "creator": "@patrickhdonges"}, "author": "Patrick Donges", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Making Sense Of The Health Insurance Exchange: Health Planning Council"}, "nid": 6651, "datePublished": "2013-10-07", "keywords": "Making Sense Of The Health Insurance Exchange, Health, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare", "wordCount": 746, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Agencies across the country have received grants and training as \"Navigators\" to assist those seeking health insurance using the new Health Insurance Marketplace.\nIf so, the insurance agent could assist Maria with any questions she may have about the Health Insurance Marketplace.\nAdam will be able to purchase a health insurance policy despite his pre-existing condition of diabetes.\nWe asked HPC's navigators what they would tell the following four people about enrolling using the state's health exchange given their current health coverage and other factors.\nSince Maria currently has an insurance plan, it is likely that she has an insurance agent."}
