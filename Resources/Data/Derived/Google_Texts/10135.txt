CNBC's Betha Coombs reports close to 365,000 people have enrolled nationally for health insurance plans through the exchanges in November. More than 4 times as many people signed up for plans in November than in October.

ACA enrollment on the rise but still short of goal

The Obama administration boldly vowed to hit its ambitious target of enrolling 7 million through the Obamacare health exchanges, despite new sign-up numbers that show it has a very long way to go to meet this goal.

A total of 364,682 people were enrolled in private Obamacare insurance plans nationwide by the end of November, according to federal figures released Wednesday.

Officials maintained that number, combined with other new statistics, shows there is a "tremendous demand" for affordable, comprehensive health coverage.

Separately, 803,077 people have been deemed eligible for the government-run Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Plan programs through the Obamacare marketplaces. That was up from nearly 400,000 in the first month.



Together, nearly 1.2 million people have enrolled in private plans or been deemed eligible for government-run insurance programs through the Obamacare marketplaces.

The two-month tally in private Obamacare health plans—which came after October saw just 106,185 enrollments nationwide—was dramatically lower than the 1.2 million people that officials had predicted just before the troubled Oct. 1 launch of the government-run marketplaces.
