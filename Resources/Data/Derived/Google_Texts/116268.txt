A 16-year-old boy is in custody after officials say he brought a homemade explosive device to a Wichita alternative school Friday afternoon.

USD 259 spokeswoman Susan Arensman said officers were called to Sowers Alternative High School at 2400 East Wassall around 2 p.m. on the report of a student with a suspicious package.

Arensman said the student was taken into custody without incident and that the bomb squad was not called. The device was composed of fireworks powder, dispatchers said.

The student's name has not been released. He faces charges of possessing an explosive device and making criminal threats.

The school's website says, "Sowers Alternative High School serves qualifying regular and special education students, grades 9-12, in a variety of specialized programs. Students attending the school either have significant social/emotional needs or are placed through the district's suspension/expulsion hearing process."
