It wasn\u2019t covered?\u201d Brzezinski followed. \u201cI think there was a huge firestorm, I believe.\u201d\n\nWhen Howard Dean answered in the affirmative, Brzezinski shouted, \u201cExactly, that\u2019s my point!\u201d\n\nEven though Barnicle and Dean attempted to downplay the Gruber incident, Brzezinski pressed on later during the show to suggest that the mainstream media is ignoring the story because Gruber is a liberal.\n\n\u201cThat was a huge gaffe, right?\u201d she said. \u201cWe can all agree on that.
