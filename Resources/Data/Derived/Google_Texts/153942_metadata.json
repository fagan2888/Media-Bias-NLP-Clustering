Some readers wrote me asking about what the previous crises were and how they\u2019re defined, so here\u2019s some more detail.\n\nCarmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, the study\u2019s authors, use a previously established definition of modern systemic crises as \u201cepisodes where there are bank runs, a significant share of nonperforming assets, bank liquidations and large-scale policy intervention to support banks.\u201d The authors argued that the subprime crisis that began in 2007 was a systemic crisis by this definition \u2014 and that it was the first such crisis the United States had suffered since the Great Depression.\n\nThe table below, taking from a presentation Professor Reinhart gave last Friday, shows the track record of the nine systemic financial crises the United States has experienced in the last two centuries. It lists total peak-to-trough decline in per-capita gross domestic product following a systemic financial crisis, the time it takes for a country to \u201csnap back\u201d to its precrisis peak and whether there was a double-dip recession, among other data points.\n\nPhoto\n\nA couple of observations: This definition of recovery does not capture what the economy \u201cshould\u201d look like if it were performing at its full potential. It just shows when the economy returned to its previous peak.\n\nIt also does not capture other areas in which the American economy has still not fully recovered \u2014 perhaps most saliently, in the job market. Professor Reinhart said historical employment data were spottier, which was why the study focused on per-capita output trends. But her presentation did include some unemployment trends from a smaller sample of systemic crises:\n\nPhoto\n\nAs you can see, on average, it has taken 12.8 years before the unemployment rate returned to its precrisis level. We are six years out from the most recent financial crisis, and the unemployment rate is not projected to return to its precrisis level for at least a few years.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140107124736, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "per": "Reinhart, Carmen M;Rogoff, Kenneth S", "keywords": "Reinhart Carmen M,Rogoff Kenneth S,Gross Domestic Product,Recession and Depression,Subprime Mortgage Crisis,United States Economy,Uncategorized", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/200 Years of American Financial Crises ( 20140107 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Catherine Rampell", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Catherine Rampell", "byl": "Catherine Rampell", "twitter": {"description": "Detail on the nine systemic financial crises the United States has suffered since 1814, taken from a new paper about post-crisis recoveries.", "title": "200 Years of American Financial Crises", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/200-years-of-american-financial-crises/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "creator": "@crampell", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002636897, "description": "Detail on the nine systemic financial crises the United States has suffered since 1814, taken from a new paper about post-crisis recoveries.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 7, 2014", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1389116856, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-01-07T17:47:36-05:00"}, "utime": 20140107174736, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140107, "pdate": 20140107, "des": "Gross Domestic Product;Recession and Depression;Subprime Mortgage Crisis;United States Economy", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "Detail on the nine systemic financial crises the United States has suffered since 1814, taken from a new paper about post-crisis recoveries.", "title": "200 Years of American Financial Crises", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/200-years-of-american-financial-crises/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/07/200-years-of-american-financial-crises/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "200 Years of American Financial Crises", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 7, 2014"}, "article_summary": "Shaila Dewan and I had an article on Monday about a study suggesting the American economy was doing reasonably well \u2014 at least compared with the aftermath of previous systemic financial crises.\nSome readers wrote me asking about what the previous crises were and how they\u2019re defined, so here\u2019s some more detail.\nThe table below, taking from a presentation Professor Reinhart gave last Friday, shows the track record of the nine systemic financial crises the United States has experienced in the last two centuries.\nWe are six years out from the most recent financial crisis, and the unemployment rate is not projected to return to its precrisis level for at least a few years.\nIt also does not capture other areas in which the American economy has still not fully recovered \u2014 perhaps most saliently, in the job market."}
