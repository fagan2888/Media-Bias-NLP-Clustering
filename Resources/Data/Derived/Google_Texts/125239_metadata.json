And as of now, that data will be retained forever.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, anyone who sets up an account on Healthcare.gov, even if he doesn\u2019t end up buying coverage there, will have his personal information stored in the Multidimensional Insurance Data Analytics System (MIDAS), a database owned by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\n\u201cMIDAS contains at least the following data elements: name, address, email, phone, date of birth, Social Security number, self-reported income, financial accounts information, ethnicity, citizenship status, military status, employment status, passport number, and taxpayer identification number,\u201d former federal official Michael Astrue wrote in an op-ed for the Cleveland Plain Dealer. \u201cThere are conflicting accounts as to what extent contractors create and retain records in MIDAS \u2026 about their phone conversations with Americans who call www.healthcare.gov.\u201d\n\nAstrue, who served as general counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) from 1989 to 1992 and commissioner of the Social Security Administration from 2007 to 2013, harshly criticized the lack of concern by the CMS about Americans\u2019 privacy.\n\nTo begin with, he cited a September 2014 Government Accountability Office report that found MIDAS was launched with \u201cincomplete security plans and privacy documentation.\u201d \u201cThe same report documents that HHS disclosed the data of millions of Americans to Equifax, a corporate credit bureau, without any finalized agreement protecting the privacy rights of the individuals whose data HHS disclosed \u2014 a clear violation of the Privacy Act,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen the privacy assessment was finally completed in January, well into the enrollment period for ObamaCare\u2019s second year, it was \u201cvague on key details,\u201d reported the AP. In particular, it states merely that there are \u201c1 million or more\u201d individuals with personal information in MIDAS. The actual number, needless to say, is considerably higher. \u201cIn addition to the 10 million currently enrolled,\u201d the AP wrote, \u201cMIDAS also keeps information on former customers, on consumers who started applications but never finished them and on people determined eligible for Medicaid.\u201d The administration won\u2019t reveal the exact number of people in the database, which \u201craises a red flag,\u201d Electronic Frontier Foundation senior staff attorney Lee Tien told the AP.\n\nAstrue pointed to further actual or potential Privacy Act violations. \u201cHHS,\u201d he stated, \u201cis illegally expanding MIDAS by adding data from state-run health care exchanges without the consents required by the Privacy Act.\u201d In addition, he suggested the department might be \u201cenforcing a nondisclosure policy of MIDAS data,\u201d though he couldn\u2019t confirm that since \u201csenior officials of both CACI [the contractor that operates the database] and HHS refused to respond to [his] written questions about the public\u2019s right to access MIDAS data.\u201d (CACI, by the way, is now set to rake in more than $110 million in taxpayer cash through 2017 \u2014 more than 85 percent higher than the value of the contract when it was awarded in 2011.)\n\nMIDAS isn\u2019t even mentioned in the Healthcare.gov privacy policy, Michelle De Mooy, deputy director for consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology, told the AP. The administration countered that the general functions of the database are described even if its name isn\u2019t.\n\nPrior to the implementation of Healthcare.gov, of course, the Obama administration tried to convince Americans that very little of their personal information would be stored and that it would be safe. Then-CMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner told a congressional hearing in 2013 that CMS was \u201cespecially focused on storing the minimum amount of personal data possible\u201d and sought \u201cto minimize all possible security vulnerability.\u201d\n\nBut not only are vast amounts of data being retained; they are also being made available to a wide variety of entities, from HHS to state agencies, private insurers, and contractors. MIDAS also \u201cgathers information from many other systems, including federal and state insurance exchanges, the federal \u2018data hub\u2019 that verifies eligibility for benefits, insurance companies and the government\u2019s casework system for consumer complaints,\u201d according to the AP. \u201cThe MIDAS privacy assessment says policies about personal data have changed over time to allow additional uses and disclosures beyond what is needed for the minimum functions of the insurance exchanges. The scope of data collected also has been widened.\u201d As per standard procedure, the administration isn\u2019t saying how many people actually have direct access to MIDAS.\n\n\u201cThe sheer number of contract research organizations that now access MIDAS data increases exponentially the security risk of every American with data in the system,\u201d averred Astrue.\n\nThe feds\u2019 record on data security is hardly reassuring. Just recently, Chinese hackers managed to obtain the personnel records for four million federal employees and contractors, including background data for their security clearances. Last summer, Healthcare.gov was infected by malware that went undetected for weeks, though officials claim no one\u2019s personal data was compromised. Moreover, the federal data hub to which MIDAS is connected is itself a security disaster waiting to happen.\n\nSome of these security fears could be mitigated if the data were retained only for as long as necessary to verify eligibility for Medicaid or insurance subsidies.\n\n\u201cA basic privacy principle is that you don\u2019t retain data any longer than you have to,\u201d Tien told the AP. \u201cThe more data you keep, the more harm an attacker or unauthorized person can do.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, given the federal government\u2019s typical disregard for Americans\u2019 privacy, MIDAS does not adhere to this principle; it keeps data forever. One of the official documents for the MIDAS project describes it as \u201cthe perpetual central repository for capturing, aggregating, and analyzing information on health insurance coverage.\u201d The January privacy assessment confirms this, stating, \u201cData in MIDAS is maintained indefinitely at this time.\u201d\n\nBased on the fact that \u201clongitudinal studies\u201d of MIDAS data have already begun, \u201cit will be years before HHS even considers destruction of our personal data,\u201d warned Astrue.\n\n\u201cHHS,\u201d he declared, \u201cstill does not take its role of protecting privacy seriously.\u201d\n\nDespite all promises to the contrary, ObamaCare is sapping Americans\u2019 privacy at a fast clip. Vast amounts of personal data are being stored indefinitely with countless individuals having access to the data \u2014 and all of it sitting there in MIDAS, waiting for hackers to exploit it. Considering this is but one of ObamaCare\u2019s numerous negative outcomes, is it any wonder that just five years after it became law, only half the Democrats who voted for it are still in office?", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ObamaCare, data, information, privacy, MIDAS", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/21069-obamacare-s-massive-perpetual-data-warehouse", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/12a4e4568afccdca5d162b89d571f71b_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The federal government is storing large amounts of personal information about Healthcare.gov users in perpetuity, raising serious privacy concerns. by Michael Tennant", "title": "ObamaCare\u2019s Massive, \u201cPerpetual\u201d Data Warehouse"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/12a4e4568afccdca5d162b89d571f71b_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Last summer, Healthcare.gov was infected by malware that went undetected for weeks, though officials claim no one\u2019s personal data was compromised.\nThe feds\u2019 record on data security is hardly reassuring.\n\u201cThe sheer number of contract research organizations that now access MIDAS data increases exponentially the security risk of every American with data in the system,\u201d averred Astrue.\nVast amounts of personal data are being stored indefinitely with countless individuals having access to the data \u2014 and all of it sitting there in MIDAS, waiting for hackers to exploit it.\nIn particular, it states merely that there are \u201c1 million or more\u201d individuals with personal information in MIDAS."}
