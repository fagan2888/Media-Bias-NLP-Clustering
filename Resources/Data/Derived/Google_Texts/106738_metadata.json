Tech giants move to shield wearables\n\nTechnology giants poised to reap billions from selling \u201cwearables\u201d and other personal health technology are furiously lobbying Capitol Hill with a strong message: Don\u2019t regulate our Fitbits.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act calls for patients to become bigger players in their own health, and companies that make personal health devices want Medicare to incentivize doctors who encourage patients to use them.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs the market for the devices grows, however, the companies that make them and collect the data are coming under increasing scrutiny over privacy and security issues, because everything from heartbeats to insulin deficiencies will be stored on the devices and possibly on the cloud. Under the old Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), these devices \u2013 Fitbits, Jawbones and the like \u2013 aren\u2019t covered. But some regulators and lawmakers believe that at least some of them should be regulated like other medical devices.\n\nThe tech industry is trying to stay one step ahead of the regulators, and Apple is leading the way.\n\n( POLITICO Pro: Insurers\u2019 bigger role suggests confidence in Obamacare)\n\nApple drew attention to the burgeoning consumer-generated health data scene this month with the introduction of HealthKit, which serves as an iPhone dashboard for consumer health and medical apps. Over the summer, Apple\u2019s top lobbyist Amber Cottle called on members of the Senate and the House on \u201cissues related to consumer health data,\u201d according to a disclosure filed in late July.\n\nEarlier this month Bud Tribble, Apple\u2019s chief technology officer, and Afshad Mistri, its health product manager, briefed the House Energy and Commerce Committee on how the company intends to store and use consumer health data.\n\nApple has tried to assure Congress and consumers that the health information passing through its software won\u2019t be sold and will be tremendously difficult to hack. But studies of existing wearable health apps have shown they frequently share information with data brokers and in most cases have few privacy controls.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is worried about consumer-generated health data. On Sept. 15, FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez reiterated a call she has made since 2012 for Congress to pass baseline privacy legislation that would cover wearables and consumer health data.\n\n\u201cWearable devices can help consumers stay fit and healthy,\u201d Ramirez told POLITICO. \u201cBut as these devices become more popular, it\u2019s especially important that they keep our health information private and secure.\u201d\n\n( POLITICO Pro: Comcast accuses Time Warner Cable deal critics of \u2018extortion\u2019)\n\nApple\u2019s entry made a splash but other companies have lobbied for months to make the regulatory environment friendly for their products and services.\n\nIntel Corp., which makes the chips that power many devices and recently purchased Basis Science, which makes wearable technologies for health and wellness. Intel spent $1.45 million lobbying earlier this year, according to a Senate filing. The topics included telehealth wearables, remote patient monitoring and the inclusion of patient-generated data in meaningful use Stage 3. HHS\u2019 Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT says it will issue the requirements for that stage of the electronic health records stimulus program this winter.\n\nIntel also lobbied for programs that incentivize researchers to use personalized medicine and genetic profiles in their drug studies. A major Obamacare-created program called the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute is incorporating this type of data in the programs it funds.\n\nAlice Borrelli, director of global health care policy for Intel, said that although privacy is a \u201chuge concern\u201d for patient-generated data, she doesn\u2019t see the need for legislation just yet.\n\n\u201cRight now, we need to collect more information and see how it\u2019s being used, and if there are violations, to address those, rather than have a preemptive lawmaking,\u201d Borrelli said.\n\nOthers argue that FTC and FDA should keep their hands off wearable data because it doesn\u2019t require the same level of protection as traditional medical records, which are protected by HIPAA.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t treat FitBit health data the same way you treat your BlueCross BlueShield data,\u201d said Carl M.
