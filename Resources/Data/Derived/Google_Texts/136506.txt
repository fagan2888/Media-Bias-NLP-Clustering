Crews made quick work of a fire at an abandoned apartment building in downtown Wichita.

Firefighters were called around 5:30 p.m. to the old Ellington Apartment Building on Main Street just north of Kellogg. When they arrived on scene, they found fire on the second floor.

The fire was brought under control about 20 minutes later. No one was hurt.

Investigators are still trying to determine how it happened.

The apartments were built in the 1920s. Earlier this year, the Wichita City Council voted to demolish the building along with two other properties. There's no word on demolition will begin.
