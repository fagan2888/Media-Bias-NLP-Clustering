Intraparty disputes and partisan rancor will ensure that Congress remains as impotent as ever. \u201cThis Congress is shaping up to be the least productive in history,\u201d Oliver said . \u201cAlthough to be fair, Congress is like jazz \u2014 it\u2019s really about the bills it\u2019s not passing. It\u2019s also like jazz in that most people hate it and anyone who says they don\u2019t are lying.

You\u2019re damn straight that \u201cCongress is like jazz \u2014 it\u2019s really about the bills it\u2019s not passing.\u201d It\u2019s a representative body; not a rule factory. The reason we have a political system at all is that people disagree as to what the government should do, and we aren\u2019t wild about those people resolving their disagreements violently. Whatever John Oliver might believe, then, it is not only acceptable for one part of the system to refuse to acquiesce to the demands of another, it\u2019s downright routine. This is what happened when George W. Bush wanted to privatize Social Security; it\u2019s what happened when Barack Obama wanted to institute a carbon tax; and it\u2019s what will likely happen when a Republican Congress tries to repeal Obamacare or amend the tax code or do anything else that does not meet the approval of around half the country. This tendency isn\u2019t a \u201cproblem\u201d or a \u201cbug.\u201d It\u2019s how the structure was explicitly designed. In America, the system yields competing mandates, and, when they come into conflict, nothing happens. As David Harsanyi puts it this morning, \u201ctwo forces slamming into each other is not inaction.\u201d What is it? It\u2019s balance.\n\nSecond, we should not be surprised or horrified that state-level elections are important, nor that \u201cdown at the local level, everything is happening.\u201d This, too, is how the system is supposed to work. The United States are just that: united states. There is a federal government, to which certain enumerated powers have been delegated. This government is powerful, in its own way, yes. But it was ultimately intended to be neither a national behemoth nor a replacement for local governments. Instead, it was supposed to fill a certain role and to leave everything else to the states. Of late, Washington D.C. has become increasingly powerful and intrusive, the most effective practical check on its authority being that those would exercise the levers cannot agree when and how to pull them.
