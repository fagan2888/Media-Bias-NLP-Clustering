We deeply value the con\u00adtri\u00adbu\u00adtions to our com\u00admu\u00adnity made by all faculty \u2013 part-time, full-\u200b\u200btime, tenured and non-\u200b\u200btenure track.\u201d\n\nFourth-year health science and political science major Casey Liston does not believe the university handled the adjuncts demands well.\n\n\u201cGenerally, I stay optimistic and believe the best of administrations or institutions and the people leading them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the steps the university has taken against unionization and, until very recently, implementing fair contracts for such a large percentage of the faculty is absolutely shocking to me.\u201d\n\nStill, adjuncts say that further discussion is warranted.\n\n\u201cAs with all negotiations, we did not get everything we wanted. One major concession was health insurance,\u201d Malm said. \u201cNortheastern is offering us more or less the minimum they are required to in order to be in compliance with the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe negotiation also extends to students, some of whom stood in solidarity with the part-times by blocking the Green Line in November to raise attention to the adjunct\u2019s cause. As a result, visibility for the part-time staff grew.\n\n\u201cMore than 1,000 emails were sent to the president and provost from within and beyond the Northeastern community,\u201d Malm said. \u201cAll of this was essential to pointing out that adjuncts are essential to the Northeastern community and that our allies would support us.\u201d\n\nRick Faletto, a sophomore cultural anthropology major and adjunct activist, showed fervent support for the cause.\n\n\u201cHearing directly from our own professors of their demeaning treatment at the hands of our administration brought tears to my eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cHow could our educators, my role models and the foundation of our university, be treated with such disrespect for the sake of profit?\u201d\n\nSuch activism would have culminated in a university-wide walkout and picketing on Jan. 19, which the university has insisted did not impact and would not have impacted their final offer for the negotiations. The strike was called off once the agreement was finalized.\n\n\u201cThis contract shows a marked departure from the status quo,\u201d Halm said. \u201cWhen we start to negotiate a second contract, it is my hope that a stronger, more trusting relationship between union and administration will have developed which will lead to a less acrimonious process.\u201d\n\nBut the contract is, for many, an undeniable success. Joanna Gattuso, a masters of public health graduate student, expressed praise for the agreement.\n\n\u201cThis shift is a true testament to what we can accomplish when our university community comes together for an important cause,\u201d Gattuso wrote in a letter to supporters of TrueNortheastern.org, a domain unaffiliated with the university that supported the adjuncts. \u201cWe let the administration know that we were prepared to support a strike if they refused to take action. And we won.\u201d\n\nPhoto by Brian Bae", "article_metadata": {"language": "en", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "The Huntington News", "description": "The Northeastern University (NU) administration reached a tentative contract settlement with its 900 adjunct faculty members on Jan. 14, concluding more than a year of negotiations just five days b\u2026", "title": "NU adjuncts win contract for next three years", "url": "http://huntnewsnu.com/2016/01/nu-adjuncts-win-contract-for-next-three-years/", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://huntnewsnu.com/files/2016/01/AdjunctColor.jpg", "height": 853}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://huntnewsnu.com/files/2016/01/AdjunctColor.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-21T14:38:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-22T16:42:39+00:00"}, "distribution": "global", "verify-v1": "7XvBEj6Tw9dyXjHST/9sgRGxGymxFdHIZsM6Ob/xo5E="}, "article_summary": "\u201cMore than 1,000 emails were sent to the president and provost from within and beyond the Northeastern community,\u201d Malm said.\nBy Jason Ritchey, news correspondentThe Northeastern University (NU) administration reached a tentative contract settlement with its 900 adjunct faculty members on Jan. 14, concluding more than a year of negotiations just five days before a planned walkout and strike.\n\u201cIt often felt as though the administration was uninterested in improving working conditions or inclusion of the adjuncts who are part of the bargaining unit,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe let the administration know that we were prepared to support a strike if they refused to take action.\n\u201cThis shift is a true testament to what we can accomplish when our university community comes together for an important cause,\u201d Gattuso wrote in a letter to supporters of TrueNortheastern.org, a domain unaffiliated with the university that supported the adjuncts."}
