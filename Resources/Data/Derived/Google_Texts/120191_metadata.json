Courtesy: The Block/Nine Network\n\nSHAYNNA Blaze has defended the low score she gave Block twins Lysandra and Alisa last night and hit back at accusations from viewers that she is jealous of the twins because they have started up a rival interior design firm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big supporter of women so for them (viewers) to say I\u2019m jealous of them (twins) is laughable,\u201d Blaze says.\n\n\u201cFor people to say I\u2019m being mean to the twins is just not true. I judge it from what I see.\n\n\u201cLast year I was battered for giving them favouritism but this year I\u2019m being pounded because I\u2019m the total opposite and jealous of them \u2014 which is hilarious.\n\n\u201cIt is ridiculous to have that small a bathroom in that size and apartment. If people know what I\u2019ve been doing for 25 years, it is about practicality. These girls have really let slip what a practical bathroom is.\u201d\n\nMore: Shaynna Blaze defends her harsh score\n\nThe feisty twins Alisa and Lysandra threatened to walk off the show in an explosive F-bomb laden rant after receiving harsh feedback on their latest room reveal.\n\nThe duo, once labelled the \u201cbathroom queens\u201d, were so furious at being awarded a score of five for their room that they accused the judges of favouritism and said they \u201cshould never have come on this show\u201d.\n\nMore: Lysandra\u2019s ex-husband blindsided by end of marriage\n\nTheir controversial bathroom was slammed as \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable\u201d by the judges, with Shaynna Blaze adding that it wouldn\u2019t sell their property.\n\nMore: War of words breaks out between The Block\u2019s Steve and producers\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying too hard. Sometimes when you try too hard it comes across as try-hard.\u201d\u201d Blaze said.\n\nWhile Neale Whittaker described it as \u201cbizarre\u201d and he felt \u201cboxed in\u201d and \u201cuncomfortable\u201d.\n\nAdded Darren Palmer: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been planned well. That\u2019s something you can\u2019t fix.\u201d\n\nAnd as the scores 6.5, 5 and 7 were revealed, Alisa only had two words; \u201cthat\u2019s bulls***\u201d.\n\nKyle and Kara received three perfect tens which only added to their fury as they stormed out of the building in tears.\n\n\u201cAny more and I\u2019ll be f***ing walking, I\u2019ll be f***ing walking,\u201d said an enraged Alisa.\n\n\u201cF*** them, F*** them, F*** them, you know F*** them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m f***ing sick of it, enough is enough, if you\u2019re (producers) going to be like this then we may as well go home.\n\n\u201cKyle and Kara produced probably the worst room of The Block and they get 6.5, is that really f***ing fair? Is it? It\u2019s not.\n\n\u201cThat is not a five bathroom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about fairness and it\u2019s f***ing so obvious what\u2019s happening and it\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nAdded Lysandra: \u201cIt doesn't matter how hard we work to produce anything anymore, it doesn't matter.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re halfway and we\u2019ve been pretty good about it.\u201d\n\nWhen a producer asked the twins if they were serious about walking off, Alisa replied: \u201cIf they keep up this f***ing five bulls**t, then f***ing oath, we\u2019ve got a reputation to uphold.\u201d\n\nAs the girls got into their car and drove away one of them was heard saying: \u201cWe should never have come on this show. Ever. That\u2019s my biggest regret.\u201d\n\nThe comments came after host Scotty Cam questioned the girls commitment to the project, saying they were acting more like Geordie Shore-style reality stars that live in a share house and \u201cparty too hard\u201d, than contestants on The Block.\n\nThe twins had been out the night before only to confess the next day that they were still drunk, spending more time debating which McMuffin to eat than thinking about their room reveal.\n\nForeman Keith Schleiger also said the twins were \u201cin trouble at the moment\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think the girls aren\u2019t going 100 per cent,\u201d Schleiger said. \u201cIf you take it easy it\u2019s just not going to happen. They\u2019re not winning challenges so they\u2019re low on money.\u201d\n\nBut despite the criticism, the girls said they felt they were in with a chance of winning and loved their room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple, nice, understated and we\u2019re happy with it,\u201d they said.\n\nthe twins were not judged fairly on their bathroom!! #TheBlock #alisaandlysandra \u2014 Emma Hirth (@minihirthy) March 2, 2014\n\nWe will just have to try even harder to impress our judges. Fingers crossed we can knock all their socks off next week! #TheBlock \u2014 Alisa and Lysandra (@Alisa_Lysandra) March 2, 2014\n\nThe twins need to suck it up, it looked like spongebob got busy with some algae. #TheBlock #RoomReveals \u2014 Josh Fox (@josh_fox23) March 2, 2014\n\n@Alisa_Lysandra are just being sore losers, cop it on the chin and get over it! Well done @KyalAndKara you deserved to win! #TheBlock \u2014 Jordy Simms (@jordanasimmss) March 2, 2014\n\nI agree with the constructive comments for the twins' bathroom but \"try hard\" is not constructive it's personal and rude. #TheBlock \u2014 Sarah Smith (@generic1stname) March 2, 2014\n\nScotty Cam, great show tonight, logie in the bag mate #TheBlock #ScottyCamRulez \u2014 Joel McInnes (@JFlava) March 2, 2014\n\nI feel for the twins. It must be confidence shattering to get such a low score. @Alisa_Lysandra @TheBlock9 #TheBlock #RoomReveal \u2014 Momma G (@Oh_Glorious_One) March 2, 2014\n\nHave the girls fallen from their Sky High heights or are the judges being unfair?
