With his presidential campaign facing new-found Texas competition in billionaire Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz returns home to Houston Tuesday to address the region's chamber of commerce.

Cruz's "State of the Senate" speech at the Greater Houston Partnership annual luncheon precedes a three-stop trip through the Lone Star State on Thursday, when the Republican presidential candidate is slated to appear at a series of rallies in Fort Worth, Tyler and Kingwood â€” part of a "Texas is Cruz Country" tour.

Tuesday's event at the Omni Hotel in west Houston, however, promises to be a more formal affair, aimed at an influential group of business leaders.

Cruz, who is running on an anti-establishment platform, first spoke to the full Partnership two years ago, when he discussed economic growth and his role in forcing a 2013 government shutdown over the Affordable Care Act.

The Partnership's lunch is scheduled to begin at noon, with 30 minutes allotted for Cruz's speech.
