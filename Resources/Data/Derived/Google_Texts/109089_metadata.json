Courtesy Channel Ten\n\nPROTESTERS say that the controversial McDonald\u2019s outlet in Tecoma will fail - but locals have lined up for hours to be the first in the store on opening day.\n\nCustomers were let into the restaurant in small groups just after 11am, as angry protesters continued to chant their disapproval.\n\nFirst customer Jake Pancutt, of Upwey, had been waiting outside the outlet for four hours, and ordered a large Quarter Pounder meal with extra meat and cheese.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting here since seven o\u2019clock this morning. It\u2019s awesome,\u201d the 16-year-old said.\n\n\u201cWe all live around here and the protesters have to understand we all want it.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an ideal first meal for Jake though \u2013 he also became the first person to spill his drink in the store.\n\nOwner James Currie \u2013 a Yarra Ranges resident who owns two other McDonald\u2019s franchises in the area \u2013 said he would not take issue with the protesters as long as they stuck to \u201cpeaceful and legal\u201d demonstration and did not harass customers.\n\nMr Currie, 53, told the Herald Sun he was confident Tecoma residents would embrace the controversial restaurant, which will employ 100 locals, despite sustained opposition from the Shire of Yarra Ranges and months of angry demonstrations at its construction site.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about giving those people (staff) the opportunity that I\u2019ve had in McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Mr Currie said today.\n\n\u201cThe protesters have the right to have their opinion; I respect that absolutely.\n\n\u201cThey have committed to doing that peacefully and lawfully, and as long as they continue doing that I don\u2019t have a problem with it.\u201d\n\nMr Currie said security would remain on site until protests died down. The tab for the security bill will be picked up by McDonald\u2019s.\n\nProtesters say their bunfight against the \u201cunwanted\u201d Burwood Hwy outlet is not over.\n\nBut they insist action will not involve vandalising the store or physically preventing people from entering it.\n\nA march is expected to be held outside the store today.\n\nLeader understands protesters will be marching holding ladders to symbolise their protest against the proverbial corporate ladder in business.\n\nMr Currie, a Lilydale resident said protesters\u2019 objection that the fast food store would disrupt the Yarra Ranges\u2019 way of life was unfounded, as Tecoma was not the \u201csleepy little hollow\u201d it had been painted as.\n\n\u201c(The outlet) is on a highway. There\u2019s a chicken shop, a pizza shop, a fish and chip shop and even a bottle shop nearby,\u201d Mr Currie said.\n\n\u201cEverybody we\u2019ve spoken to is excited about us coming here.\u201d\n\nMr Currie said he hoped the Yarra Ranges-flavoured store - which is dressed with local stone to ensure it fits with the Tecoma streetscape and features a Puffing Billy mural inside - would encourage passers-by to stop in the town and support other local businesses.\n\nMr Currie - who started working at McDonald\u2019s 39 years ago and also runs stores in Boronia and Wantirna said protesters had picketed his Boronia franchise for months after he took on the Tecoma store and had not affected business.\n\n\u2018No Maccas in Tecoma\u2019 spokesman Garry Muratore said the group had not been disheartened by the store\u2019s opening, and would continue fighting by working with local tourism operators and brandishing banners on the Burwood Hwy to encourage would-be customers to support local businesses instead.\n\nIllegal action, such as blockading the store to prevent people going inside, would not be tolerated by the protest group, Mr Muratore said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s patently obvious McDonald\u2019s will fail in Tecoma,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019ve struck a chord here. McDonald\u2019s is going to have a hard time trying to turn that around.\u201d\n\nMr Muratore said protesters were also hopeful of preventing fast food chains from expanding further into the Yarra Ranges by gaining State Government support for a planning amendment to outlaw drive-throughs in the area.\n\nHe said Yarra Ranges council had submitted the request, which was waiting for Matthew Guy\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cIt would mean this type of thing cannot happen again in the Dandenong Ranges,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c(McDonald\u2019s) may have won this battle, but they haven\u2019t won the war.\u201d\n\nThe Yarra Ranges council rejected McDonald\u2019s application for a Tecoma outlet in October 2011 after receiving hundreds of objections, largely sparked by noise, traffic, litter and health concerns.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s appealed to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which overturned the decision in October 2012.\n\nsamantha.landy@news.com.au", "article_metadata": {"description": "PROTESTERS say that the controversial McDonald&#8217;s outlet in Tecoma will fail - but locals have lined up for hours to be the first in the store on opening day.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "HeraldSun", "description": "PROTESTERS say that the controversial McDonald&#8217;s outlet in Tecoma will fail - but locals have lined up for hours to be the first in the store on opening day.", "title": "Locals line up for hours to get a taste of controversial McDonald\u2019s in Tecoma", "url": "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/locals-line-up-for-hours-to-get-a-taste-of-controversial-mcdonalds-in-tecoma/story-fni0fit3-1226876131271", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://content6.video.news.com.au/o5cjFzbDovOFNvxt9Nhe5e4Nef1yoW-Y/promo221103355&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@theheraldsun", "id": "@theheraldsun"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135469303148773}, "articleid": 1226876131271, "keywords": "fast food, anti-Maccas activists, controversial restaurant, State Government support, construction site, tourism operators, ,Yarra Ranges,Victoria,Australia, ,Boronia,Victoria,Australia, ,Melbourne,Victoria,Australia, State Government, Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, Garry Muratore, angry demonstrations, fast food chains, Illegal action, planning amendment, health concerns, bottle shop, James Currie, Samantha Landy, Matthew Guy", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Mon Apr 07 14:20:19 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Mon Apr 07 14:20:19 EST 2014", "author": "Therese Allaoui, Samantha Landy"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1067\"", "article_summary": "Locals line up for hours to get a taste of controversial McDonald\u2019s in TecomaTecoma McDonalds opens 1:05 Play video The Tecoma McDonalds has opened in the face of community protests.\nCourtesy Channel TenPROTESTERS say that the controversial McDonald\u2019s outlet in Tecoma will fail - but locals have lined up for hours to be the first in the store on opening day.\nHe said Yarra Ranges council had submitted the request, which was waiting for Matthew Guy\u2019s ruling.\n\u201c(McDonald\u2019s) may have won this battle, but they haven\u2019t won the war.\u201dThe Yarra Ranges council rejected McDonald\u2019s application for a Tecoma outlet in October 2011 after receiving hundreds of objections, largely sparked by noise, traffic, litter and health concerns.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about giving those people (staff) the opportunity that I\u2019ve had in McDonald\u2019s,\u201d Mr Currie said today."}
