The original plan was to use Medicaid expansion as part of a comprehensive Obamacare effort to provide all Americans with health coverage.Starting in 2014, in all states, Medicaid will no longer factor personal savings\u2014 except for those in long-term care\u2014 in determining eligibility.Medicaid presently covers more Americans than Medicare.
