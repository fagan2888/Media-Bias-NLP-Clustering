Now users can do that.\n\nPart D\u2019s signup site is quite different. Medicare beneficiaries do not have to provide any information about themselves or verify their eligibility to get detailed cost estimates.\n\nBelow are screenshots that show how simple the user interface is for those trying to register for a Part D plan (although if you are a senior with health problems or disabled, this too may seem complicated.)\n\nThe beginning: Go to the Plan Finder page. While you have the option to enter your personal information, the first choice is to perform a general search in which you simply enter your zip code.\n\nStep 1: The system relies on the user to indicate the type of coverage he or she wants. There\u2019s no complicated verification system at this point.\n\nStep 2: You begin by entering the drugs you take. The website has a search tool that helps correct possible spelling errors and suggest similar drugs.\n\nStep 3: Next you pick the pharmacies you use. Notice at the top how the page generates a drug list ID and password, which lets you come back later and make changes without having to start all over.\n\nStep 4: You get to refine your results based on what\u2019s important to you \u2014 for example, your desire to limit your premium or limit your deductible.\n\nFinally: The results. That was fast. Once you find a plan you like, you can go through the enrollment process.\n\nCould the federal exchange have been modeled off the Part D plan finder? Perhaps it will be in the future.\n\nLike this story?
