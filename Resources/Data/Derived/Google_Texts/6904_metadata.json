A little thought soon sparked a lot of concern among the youngsters \u2013 and they decided to do something about it.\n\nNow, teachers at St. Rose Elementary say their fifth grade class is learning that people around the globe aren\u2019t as far off as they thought, and that even small gestures can mean a lot to those in need.\n\nFor the students, the push to get involved in the Nepal relief effort started when they were asked to write personal journal entries on how they could make a difference in the tragedy that\u2019s cost an estimated 7,500 lives. Under the direction of the school\u2019s religion teacher, Darlene Carlson, and fifth grade teacher Christie Mounkes, the students then held a group brainstorming session on how their own class could come up with an immediate action plan. After an initial ideal to host a bake sale ran into snags, the fifth graders settled on an inter-school fundraising effort that involved breaking the school\u2019s strict dress code for a day. For one calendar date, every student who brought a dollar or more could wear jeans or shorts to school.\n\nCarlson was not expecting just how much cash this fun, well-meaning push would bring in.\n\n\u201cThey made posters and announcements to all the students, and our small school of 290 students raised more than $400,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cThey have studied and learned about the people of Nepal, the connections we have with these people who are suffering, and they now know that they can make a difference.\u201d\n\nThis week, the fifth graders were all smiles with the knowledge the money they raised was on its way to help those in Nepal. And they had no difficulty explaining to the Press Tribune why it was important to them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important because anything could happen to us, and we could get hit with an earthquake, and we would want other people to help us if we were in trouble,\u201d observed a student named Jaden.\n\n\u201cHelping them is what God called us to do,\u201d chimed in another student named Collin, alluding to his Catholic faith.\n\nA student named Breanna told the Press Tribune she and her classmates were finding out that they weren\u2019t helpless when it comes to hearing about bad news headlines.\n\n\u201cWe can learn a lesson from what we did,\u201d Breanna said, \u201cespecially that we can make a difference in the world.\u201d\n\nThe teachers in charge of the class\u2019s education could not agree more.\n\n\u201cIt was a great opportunity for them to learn about some real world things,\u201d Mounkes observed. \u201cAnd in this case they were really able to connect with it.\u201d\n\nScott Thomas Anderson can be reached at scotta@goldcountrymedia.com.
