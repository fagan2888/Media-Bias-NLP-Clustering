Patti Dennis, VP of news at KUSA and regional news executive for Gannett Broadcasting, is adding corporate recruiting responsibilities while cutting back day-to-day newsroom duties, according to an announcement from the parent company.

Rob Mennie, Gannett Broadcasting’s SVP of News, told the staff on March 10 that Dennis is adding the title of Director of Recruiting for Gannett Broadcasting.

“In her new role, Patti will work directly with our stations to help recruit both on and off air candidates. She will create an online database of potential employees and work with a small team of people in order to find the best and brightest for our properties. She will also work closely with Virgil Smith and his team in our convention and university recruiting,” Mennie said.

“Patti will continue to be VP/News at KUSA but will have less involvement in the day to day operations of the newsroom. She will also continue to work with KPNX (Phoenix) in her role as Regional News Executive.”

Mark Cornetta, general manager for KUSA, told the staff, “The good news is that Patti will still be here and still play a role in our news organization.” By phone he added, “she is a wonderful ambassador for the industry.”

Dennis, who has been with 9News for more than 30 years, confirmed via email Monday, “I am working on the new assignment as well as working with the newsroom in Denver for a while.”
