Former WNBA player Jenni Benningfield has been named an assistant women's basketball coach at the University of Colorado, head coach Linda Lappe announced on Saturday.

Benningfield served the last two seasons as the director of operations for the program. With hiring of Jamie Carey last month, Colorado has two former WNBA veterans on its staff.

"I'm very honored and grateful to have this opportunity to continue to share my knowledge, passion, and experiences with this program, now in a different role as an assistant coach," Benningfield said. "I am eager to work alongside an amazing staff who all bring something different to make our program better, and who also share the competitive drive and vision to be the best."

In her two seasons as director of operations, Benningfield handled a variety of duties including scheduling, team travel, monitoring the budget and coordinating community service efforts. She was also co-director for Colorado's summer basketball camps.

During her first season she organized the Buffs' 10-day tour of Italy which took place in August 2013.

"Jenni has been an integral part of our team during the past two seasons and now we are excited that she will get to be on the floor coaching," Lappe said. "She has a very high basketball IQ and is a proven winner so there is no doubt she will help our team and staff get better."

She was also the head varsity girls basketball coach at Pomona High School for the 2011-12 season and in that same role at Nederland High School in 2010-11.
