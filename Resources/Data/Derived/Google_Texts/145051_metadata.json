Six of the studies were randomized controlled trials, considered the gold-standard in research.\n\nNurses in all the studies were able to change the dosages of medications that were originally prescribed by physicians. Nurses in 11 of the studies could also initiate new medications independently.\n\nShaw and his team found the nurse-managed protocols had a positive effect on chronically ill patients.\n\nThe patients who were managed by nurses overall had better blood sugar management, slightly lower blood pressure readings and larger decreases in total and LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol levels, when compared to patients under usual care.\n\n\u201cThe findings were that it was relatively safe. We didn't really find any adverse outcomes, and it did seem to improve patient outcomes,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nHe noted that nurses would go through training for this type of care and explained that the nurses would be working as part of a team that includes physicians, pharmacists and other health professionals, and not as individual practitioners.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not practicing by themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're just extending the care that you might get from a physician.\u201d\n\nThe study team acknowledges limitations in their analysis. The studies they looked at had limited descriptions of the treatments given and the training levels of the nurses. In addition, 11 of the 18 studies were done in Western Europe, which could limit the applicability of the findings to U.S. health care practices.\n\nNevertheless, write Drs. Sandeep Jauhar and David Battinelli in an editorial published along with the study, \u201cLike it or not, outpatient medicine has become too complicated for physicians to handle by themselves. We need new models of primary care, and enlisting nurses will be central to this effort.\u201d\n\nJauhar and Battinelli are both with Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine in New York, and were not involved in the new research.\n\nThe United States has approximately 200,000 primary care physicians and 2.8 million registered nurses, they note.\n\nJauhar told Reuters Health that some conditions, such as hypertension and high cholesterol, could be treated with a relatively straightforward approach.\n\n\u201cThese are conditions for which there are pretty well-defined flowcharts for how to manage the conditions, so for those relatively straightforward conditions, I think that nurse-managed protocols are perfectly acceptable,\u201d he said.\n\nJauhar said that a physician\u2019s judgment is required for more complex conditions where there is some degree of judgment or subjectivity in deciding how to treat the patient.\n\n\u201cI think those are conditions where you want to be seen by a doctor,\u201d he said.\n\nJauhar pointed out that the nurses described in the review paper were conferring and collaborating with doctors and discussing the cases with their supervising physicians.\n\n\u201cThere's a dearth of primary care physicians, so for relatively straightforward conditions like hypertension I think it's better to be seen by a nurse following a protocol than it is not to be seen by a physician for several weeks because of availability,\u201d he said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/U7fMd7 Annals of Internal Medicine, online July 14, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKBN0FK2FX20140715", "sailthru.author": "Shereen Lehman", "Author": "Shereen Lehman", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "NEW YORK (Reuters Health) -
