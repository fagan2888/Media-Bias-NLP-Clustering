Since America\u2019s health care system has a price tag of nearly $3 trillion, the impulse is understandable.\n\nOne tactic insurers are frequently implementing requires that patients \u201cstep\u201d through older, less expensive therapies before being given access to more expensive drugs when two medications are equivalent.\n\nInsurers benignly call this \u201cstep therapy,\u201d but millions of people in need of prescription therapies call it something far more sinister: \u201cfail first.\u201d And a national movement is under way to stop it from California to New York.\n\nOn the surface, the idea might make sense: patients are getting essentially the same drugs and insurers save millions of dollars a year on drug costs.\n\nTrouble is, only one of those things is true. And for cancer patients specifically, their experience with this widespread policy is not only unfair, it\u2019s downright unsafe.\n\nFirst, medications are rarely, if ever, equivalent. Substituting one for another is not the same as swapping out a Coke for a Pepsi and then having an RC Cola. Even the difference of a few nanoparticles can have profound consequences for a patient.\n\nOncologists also say step therapy often doesn\u2019t take into account a patient\u2019s full medical history. Although that may not always be decisive, you don\u2019t need a medical degree to realize the obvious risks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taking the decision away from the physicians and the patient,\u201d said Stacey Worthy, director of public policy for the Alliance for the Adoption of Innovations in Medicine. She recently told a Vital Options panel discussion, \u201cThat means 20 percent of patients don\u2019t ever get the treatment they were actually prescribed.\u201d\n\nImagine 20 percent of broken arms not getting a cast and sling as prescribed by an orthopedist, or 20 percent of root canals performed using a different, cheaper procedure that may or may not leave with you an abscess.\n\nA recent study published by the International Society For Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) found that safety was ignored in 18 insurance formularies covering 45 percent of patients taking immunological agents and biologics, typically for inflammatory conditions such as arthritis or psoriasis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe analysis also found it actually exposes patients to medications with potential side effects so serious the Food and Drug Administration imposes what are widely known as \u201cblack box\u201d warnings.\n\nThe publication Drug Watch describes it this way: the Food and Drug Administration requires a black label \u201cif serious or life-threatening risks are associated with the drug.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlack box\u201d medications are not banned, nor should they be. Sometimes they are the only treatment option a doctor will make available to a patient. But now that newer, safer treatments with no such warnings are available, how or why does an insurance company get to save money at the patients\u2019 expense by forcing them to try a treatment with known life-threatening risks?\n\nWorthy describes an emerging \u201ctriumvirate of trouble\u201d from contemporary insurance practices: the \u201cFail first\u201d requirement; high copays for cancer drugs, and lower levels of reimbursement for medications given by mouth instead of by needle.\n\nIn 2009, Oregon began considering a requirement that insurance companies provide equal reimbursement for oral cancer medications and drugs delivered intravenously. Six years later, 39 states and the District of Columbia have passed oral drug parity laws.\n\nLast month, California\u2019s Obamacare exchange issued a new regulation making it the eighth state to cap patient copays for prescription drugs and the third in 2015. Other states are following suit.\n\nThis month, the California Assembly overwhelmingly passed AB 374, which allows a doctor to request a step therapy override from a health plan or insurer. The bill\u2019s author, Assemblyman Adrin Nazarian, D-Sherman Oaks, said, \u201cKeeping healthcare costs down is important, but we must not allow cost-cutting to become more important than a patient\u2019s well-being.\u201d\n\nLast month, New York\u2019s State Legislature heard from Suzanne Carrow, who has been fighting cancer for 16 years: \u201cI had been on a drug for a long time and then all the sudden, the insurance company is saying no, you can\u2019t, you\u2019re going to have to be on all of these different drugs.\u201d\n\nPatients like Suzanne Carrow aren\u2019t just in New York. They\u2019re everywhere. Now, they are finding their voice. If they are heard widely enough, \u201cstep therapy\u201d can be stopped in its tracks.\n\nJonathan Wilcox is policy director of Vital Options International, a nonprofit cancer communication, education and advocacy organization. www.vitaloptions.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health insurance companies are constantly looking for ways to hold down costs.
