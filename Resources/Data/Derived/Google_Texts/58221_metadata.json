There is a webinar today at noon on the topic (if you can\u2019t make it, you can always listen to it on demand) and an accompanying white paper that details the study\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to understand the difference between good and great physician executives,\u201d says Richard Metheny, head of Witt/Kieffer's Leadership Solutions practice, and a project leader on the study, in a news release.\n\nSo, what are the traits that separate the good from the great when it comes to physician executives? The study highlights three key points:\n\nHigh-performing physician leaders can be differentiated from lower-performing leaders by characteristics such as resiliency, even temper and a willingness to share successes.\n\nStrong physician leadership fosters patient loyalty in a health system.\n\nPhysician and nonphysician health care leaders operate differently and can learn about, and from, each other by understanding competency differences.\n\nThe results also indicate that patient-preferred physicians are persistent, self-confident, creative and open to new ideas.\n\nNow, \u201ccreative\u201d and \u201copen to new ideas\u201d might not be the very first things that leap to mind when thinking about physician leaders \u2014 but perhaps they should be. The challenges health care executives face require physician leaders who are capable of looking at issues in ways that, well, aren\u2019t ossified (so rare you get to use that word outside of the Sunday crossword puzzle). In a world where the pharmacy down the street is getting into the retail clinic business, having someone who is unafraid to try new concepts and focused on keeping current with the changes in the field are valuable assets on any hospital\u2019s leadership team.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As Peter Angood, M.D., president and CEO of the American Association for Physician Leadership, told my colleague Lee Ann Jarousse in April, \u201cPhysician leaders must be able to build, collaborate, motivate and move strategy in the right direction.\u201d You might be thinking at this point, \u201cWell, that\u2019s obvious.
