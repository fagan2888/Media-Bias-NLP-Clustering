The White House announced today that President Obama will nominate Jane Chu as the next chair of the National Endowment for the Arts.

Chu currently is the president and CEO of the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City.

Although Chu is not well-known nationally, she has a long history in the civic and cultural life of the Missouri city, serving previously as an executive with the philathropic Kauffman Fund for Kansas City and Union Station Kansas City.

The Kauffman Center is the jewel of Kansas City culture and a successful enterprise by all accounts. The building, designed by renowned architect Moshe Safdie, opened in 2011 as home to the city’s ballet and orchestra.

If confirmed, Chu would fill a job that’s been vacant since the last chair, Rocco Landesman, stepped down in December 2012.
