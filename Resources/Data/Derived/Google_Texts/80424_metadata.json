Numerous education researchers and academics have reservations about greater classroom standardization\u2014particularly in the early grades, where excessive testing and homework is most deleterious for kids.\n\nWalton writes:\n\nDavid Elkind, long-time child development expert at Tufts University and author ofThe Hurried Child, says that a related problem with the Common Core standards is that \u201cchildren are not standardized.\u201d Between ages 4 to 7, he says, kids are undergoing especially rapid changes in cognitive ability, but this neurological and psychological development occurs at all different rates. \u201cSome children attain these abilities\u2014which enable them to learn verbal rules, the essence of formal instruction\u2014at different ages.\n\nSome of the experts cited by Walton argued the long hours of standardized testing that kindergartners must endure under Common Core are wholly inappropriate:\n\nDiane Ravitch, education historian at NYU and vocal criticof the Common Core, says that in particular, \u201cthe early grades are developmentally inappropriate. Children of 5 and 6 and 7 need time for play, not a forced academic march. They will have 6-hour, 8-hour tests. That is nuts\u2026. The American ideal was always a well-rounded child prepared for citizenship and life. Now it is all test prep.\u201d\n\nWhile others disputed the notion\u2014vehemently asserted by Core supporters\u2014that the standards are internationally benchmarked:\n\n[2013 New York High School Principal of the Year Carol Burris] adds that exactly which countries to which the Common Core is benchmarked remains a mystery. \u201cWhat\u2019s so fascinating is that many of the high-performing countries children start much later. In some countries, like Singapore, there are two years of Kindergarten. In Finland, another high performing nation, students start much later. In Canada, which uses provincial standards, the early years are a time for play and exploration. No one can find to what country these Standards are benchmarked.\u201d\n\nFull article here.\n\nThere are of course many experts who dispute the above notions and believe that Common Core is an improvement over what is being offered in many American schools. They may even be right; it's perfectly possible that Common Core is bad and what it's replacing is worse. This is the public school system we are talking about, after all.\n\nBut why waste tons of time, money, and effort enacting an across-the-board reform that makes kids miserable, relies on deeply unsettled science, has no demonstrable benefit, and deals a death blow to federalism (at least as far as national education policy is concerned)?\n\nMore choice, not less, is what will save public education. As Elkin observed, kids don't come standard.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Forbes contributor Alice Walton has written a terrific roundup of the anti-Common Core expert consensus.
