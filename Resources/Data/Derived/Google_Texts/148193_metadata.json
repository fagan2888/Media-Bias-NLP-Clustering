Currently the U.S. government voluntarily imports 1.05 million foreigners on green cards alone each year. Green card holders will outnumber the populations of Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina combined within only ten years if existing levels of immigration are allowed, a prospect which alarms some Americans concerned about highly unnatural and extreme population increases. Pew asked respondents to which word comes to mind when they think of immigrants:\n\nWhen asked what one word first comes to mind when thinking about immigrants in the U.S. today, the word \u201cillegal\u201d is offered by 12 percent of American adults\u2014more than any other word. Other respondents offered words such as \u201coverpopulation\u201d (5 percent), \u201clegality\u201d (4 percent), \u201cjobs\u201d (3 percent), \u201cdeportation\u201d (3 percent) and \u201cwork ethic\u201d (3 percent).\n\nNoticeably absent are the supposed virtues of immigration touted by the elite: \u201cdiversity,\u201d \u201cenrichment,\u201d \u201cvibrancy.\u201d In Chapter Four of its report under the heading, \u201cRelatively Little Knowledge About U.S. Immigration Facts,\u201d Pew snootily reports \u201c35 percent of Americans say that the U.S. foreign-born share is actually higher [than 13 percent, or 41.45 million foreigners]: 28 percent say about four-in-ten Americans are foreign-born, and seven percent say that more than half of the U.S. population is foreign born.\u201d Maybe Pew stumbled on Americans who lived in historically black neighborhoods which became entirely Hispanic almost overnight.\n\nThese results are unsurprising, considering:\n\n1) media members and law enforcement work furiously to cover up mass immigration\u2019s destabilizing effect on every aspect of American life,\n\n2) the government does not keep track of any immigrant crime statistics, and\n\n3) when a flood washes away your home, you don\u2019t spend time counting out individual droplets that wiped out the foundation.\n\nThe 28 percent of respondents who said four-in-ten Americans are foreign-born are on the mark. By 2060, one-fifth of all Americans will be foreign-born, and only non-Hispanic, native-born whites will suffer a population decline, a decline of 16 million in a mere 45 years \u2014 in a country founded by George Washington and built by European settlers and pioneers. In less than 100 years after the government took steps that could destroy its traditional demography, Hispanics will be 29 percent of the population, numbering over 110 million.\n\nThat prospect doesn\u2019t excite all Hispanics, however: 20 percent of them told Pew that immigrants make America worse off. As Breitbart News previously reported, current policies admitting huge numbers of immigrants \u201ccontinues unaltered at a time when automation is reducing hiring, and when a record share of our own workers here in America are not employed,\u201d a terrible deal for everyone living here except Democrats and the super-rich:\n\nUnemployment stands at 5.6 percent and outstanding student loan debt at over $1.2 trillion, both the Bush and Obama administration\u2019s immigration policies have shut Americans out of the growing job market. Between 2000 and 2014, every new job created went to legal and illegal immigrant workers. Furthermore, for every new job created, two immigrants arrived in America: That\u2019s 18 million foreign-born workers for 9.3 million American jobs. Within the next five years, Hispanic foreigners alone will take 75 percent of newly-created American jobs.\n\nRespondents sense that taking in tens of millions of immigrants from countries such as Mexico is making America less safe, especially for women and children cherished by America\u2019s historic Anglo-Saxon culture. Breitbart News has exposed many, many crimes committed by immigrants that the media did its best to cover up. While the murder of Kathryn Steinle, allegedly at the hands of a five-times deported Mexican illegal alien, elicited nationwide outrage (and a blank stare from the Obama administration), other crimes are buried. For example:\n\nMichigan police arrested Mexican illegal alien Aurelio Hernandez-Gomez, 23, for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 13-year-old Florida girl.\n\nIllegal alien sex offender Keane Dean, 26, allegedly raped a mentally-challenged 14-year-old girl in Santa Clarita after luring her into a garage \u2014 while free on bond. Since he was arrested in Los Angeles county, a \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdiction, there\u2019s a 99 percent chance he\u2019ll never be deported even if he serves time.\n\nPakistani immigrant Sohail Khan, 42, kidnapped and raped a drunk passenger who passed out in his cab. Illustrating why perhaps Pakistan doesn\u2019t have its own Silicon Valley, Khan couldn\u2019t figure out how to erase footage from his cab\u2019s camera. He\u2019ll serve less than five years in jail and will never be deported back to his native Pakistan.\n\nOhio police booked Mexican illegal alien Juan Emmanual Razo after he went on a crime spree, murdering 60-year-old Margaret Kostelnick in her home, trying to rape his 14-year-old niece, and shooting another woman who was walking with children. Local authorities found Razo was in the country illegally a few weeks before, but Border Patrol told him to stand down; at that point, Kostelnick\u2019s days were numbered.\n\nU.S. Marshals booked a Hispanic man with U.S. citizenship, 45-year-old Robert Guardiola, accused of years-long child sex abuse after he fled to Mexico.\n\nMissouri police arrested illegal alien Marvin Castellanos for attempting to rape a woman at knifepoint. \u201cDon\u2019t look at my face,\u201d he told his screaming victim, before punching her. Castellanos admitted to police he had previously been deported.\n\nIllegal alien Victor Aureliano Martinez Ramirez broke into Marilyn Pharis\u2019s home in the dead of night, beat her so savagely he broke her neck and both eye sockets, strangled her, raped her with a foreign object, and left her for dead \u2014 as he broke into another home. Pharis succumbed to her injuries eight days later. Santa Maria Police Chief Ralph Martin attacked Democrats for protecting violent immigrants: \u201cI am not remiss to say that, from Washington, D.C., to Sacramento, there is a blood trail into the bedroom of Marilyn Pharis.\u201d Ramirez was on probation during his rampage. Local police said they \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d he\u2019s an illegal alien.\n\nPreviously-deported Honduran illegal alien Nelson Ochoa-Puentes, 33, pulled a gun on a cop after fleeing from a traffic stop. Allowing foreigners who don\u2019t speak or read English to drive on American roads seems like a poor policy. But at least this story has a happy ending: The cop shot the alien menacing him.\n\nMexican national and previously-deported illegal alien Francisco Javier Chavez skipped his August court appearance after smashing a toddler\u2019s limbs. Despite racking up multiple felonies and savagely beating his 2-year-old victim nearly to death, police released him only 24 hours after arresting him, despite an ICE request to detain him. Predictably, he disappeared, and now there\u2019s a child beater running free with a $600,000 warrant out for his arrest.\n\nCue complete radio silence from the media: Jose Andres-Jose, an illegal alien from Guatemala, allegedly raped a child in Pennsylvania on July 18. Despite the shocking nature of the crime and the high bail of $9.5 million, no other national news outlet besides Breitbart News even noticed the crime.\n\nMexican illegal alien Juan Jimenez-Olivera, pled guilty to strangling 30-year-old Sviatlana Dranko in her home, stealing $6,000 from her, setting her body on fire, and lying to police. He also raped her, but those charges were dropped in exchange for his plea deal. If Mexico refuses to take him back , he\u2019ll remain in the U.S. for the rest of his life and will be free to roam unsuspecting American neighborhoods after serving his sentence. His law-breaking employer has blood on his hands, but at least he got a bargain on Obamacare\n\nIllegal alien sex offender Jesus Atrian allegedly raped a 16-year-old girl with Downs Syndrome, having previously been convicted of a similar attack on an eight-year-old victim.\n\nIllegal alien Ala Asaf \u2014 known as \u201cman\u201d to journalists \u2014 allegedly lured a woman into his New Orleans apartment before raping her. In January, he was arrested for a DWI but was never identified as an immigrant, let alone an illegal alien.\n\nA traumatized motel clerk was repeatedly stalked by an illegal alien who attempted to rape her. \u201cHe was waiting, he was waiting and he was sober this time. He was ready to hurt me,\u201d the victim told the one news outlet in the entire country (besides Breitbart News) who reported on the case. \u201cNo one helped me. No one helped me. They left me there to be attacked again, the police, my manager, Extended Stay America with no cameras. Everyone left me.\u201d\n\nA Republican party that promised to crack down on crime and curb immigration would thrill and motivate its base. The Pew survey shows how at odds the GOP establishment is with its base on immigration.\n\nIn 2013, establishment darling Sen. Marco Rubio, still pushing to hand out U.S. citizenship like candy, then pushed the Gang of Eight bill, which would have ramped up the green card giveaway to 30 million in only ten years, tripling already unpopular levels of immigration. But 67 percent of Republicans want immigration levels decreased \u2014 and don\u2019t want their children to live in a poorer and more dangerous country where foreigners and their descendants, who have no affection for or attachment to traditional America, account for 88 percent of population growth within only 50 years. Control of the economy and government will by then be neatly transferred into the hands of an imported population if Republicans spit on or ignore their base.\n\nEmail Katie at kmchugh@breitbart.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Half of all U.S. adults believe mass immigration has driven up crime rates while hurting the economy, according to Pew Research Center.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Half of all U.S. adults believe mass immigration has driven up crime rates while hurting the economy, according to Pew Research Center.", "title": "Pew: Half of All US Adults Believe Immigrants Drive Up Crime While Hurting The Economy", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Immigrants-line-up-for-delayed-deport-and-work-permits-AP-DAMIAN-DOVARGANES.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/28/pew-half-us-adults-believe-immigrants-drive-crime-hurting-economy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Half of all U.S. adults believe mass immigration has driven up crime rates while hurting the economy, according to Pew Research Center.", "creator": "@k_mcq", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Immigrants-line-up-for-delayed-deport-and-work-permits-AP-DAMIAN-DOVARGANES.jpg", "title": "Pew: Half of All US Adults Believe Immigrants Drive Up Crime While Hurting The Economy", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Hispanic immigration, Marco Rubio,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Immigration,Pew", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Marco Rubio", "published_time": "2015-09-28T13:59:23-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Furthermore, for every new job created, two immigrants arrived in America: That\u2019s 18 million foreign-born workers for 9.3 million American jobs.\nIn January, he was arrested for a DWI but was never identified as an immigrant, let alone an illegal alien.\nFor example:Michigan police arrested Mexican illegal alien Aurelio Hernandez-Gomez, 23, for kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 13-year-old Florida girl.\nMexican national and previously-deported illegal alien Francisco Javier Chavez skipped his August court appearance after smashing a toddler\u2019s limbs.\nPreviously-deported Honduran illegal alien Nelson Ochoa-Puentes, 33, pulled a gun on a cop after fleeing from a traffic stop."}
