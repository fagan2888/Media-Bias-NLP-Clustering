Several Bay County venues were treated Saturday to a unique flash mob and it was all for a good cause.

Belly dancers from Bay County performed in "Shimmy Mobs" to raise awareness for domestic violence and to raise donations.

This is part of an international effort where more than 2,000 dancers in 181 cities will perform to raise money for charity.

All proceeds from the local "Shimmy Mobs" are donated to the Panama City Salvation Army's Domestic Violence Prevention Program.

Kathy Bedford from Newschannel 7's "Mom's Everyday" was one of the dancers in the "Shimmy Mob."

"The support was fantastic we did it here at Pier Park and there were other locations around Panama City and Panama City Beach," explained Bedford. "Just to raise awareness for domestic abuse and raise money for the Salvation Army Domestic Women's Shelter for abuse is just a privilege, it truly is."

The next "Shimmy Mob" will be at the Lynn Haven Block Party on May 30th.
