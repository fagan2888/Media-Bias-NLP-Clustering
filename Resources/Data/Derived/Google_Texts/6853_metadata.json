He made his statement\u2014which might once have seemed shocking, but now likely strikes residents of the post-Snowden world as a grim but realistic assessment\u2014on July 5 at a conference put on by the Centre for Investigative Journalism in Britain.\n\nReports The Guardian:\n\n\"At least 80% of fibre-optic cables globally go via the US\", Binney said. \"This is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in. At least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores.\" The NSA will soon be able to collect 966 exabytes a year, the total of internet traffic annually.
