In New York City alone, the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center has become the David H. Koch Theater. As you enter the Metropolitan Museum of Art, signs tell you you\u2019re standing on the new David H. Koch Plaza. David Koch\u2019s name had also been elevated by his contributions to WNET, the city\u2019s PBS affiliate. That ended last year, however, when WNET ran an independent documentary critical of him. To placate Koch, they axed a second similar film, but Koch resigned from the board and took his money with him.\n\nBut by emphasizing the Kochs\u2019 philanthropy\u2014which, come on, is the least two men worth $40 billion each and tied at number four on the Forbes rich people list, can do\u2014Scarborough was providing exactly what their largesse was intended to produce: praise and a media force field that can deflect political criticism. Not that Joe is terribly adverse to their politics, but the point of his outrage in the Morning Joe banter was to shift focus away from Koch policies to Reid\u2019s breach of polite discourse. Willie Geist said that the \u201caddicted to Koch\u201d line \u201cseems beneath the office.\u201d Former congressman and nominal Democrat Harold Ford sniffed, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that kind of vitriol.\u201d Only Donnie Deutsch got close to the heart of the matter, asking whether the \u201cKoch brothers spending a billion on advertising is good for democracy.\u201d\n\nTraining your eyes on an oligarch\u2019s philanthropy and away from what it camouflages is to accept in some way the essential justness of great wealth. As if to second that notion, Governor Chris Christie said at CPAC last week that Reid was \u201crail[ing] against two American entrepreneurs who have built a business, created jobs, and created wealth and philanthropy in this country. Harry Reid should get back to work and stop picking on great Americans who are creating great things in our country.\u201d Some of those great things include millions in donations to the Republican Governors Association, which Christie (still) heads. Ad Policy\n\nReid\u2019s attacks are part of a larger Democratic pushback, which includes TV spots (see below) and sites like KochAddiction.com and StopTheGreedAgenda. The strategy is transparent: link GOP candidates to the Kochs and make the Kochs into villains.\n\nCreating a visible villain is, of course, a time-honored political activity. The Dems have vilified Newt Gingrich and more recently Mitt Romney\u2019s Bain Capital, while the Republicans\u2019 demons include Nancy Pelosi, the Rev. Wright and Bill Ayers. As for \u201cun-American,\u201d a few years ago Glenn Beck falsely portrayed George Soros, the closest big-time funder progressives have to the Kochs, as a Nazi collaborator.\n\nBut beyond a bunch of liberals who follow the Koch trail, will voters know or care about what the billionaire brothers do with their money?\n\nPaul Waldman in The American Prospect doubts it. And so far, he says, the Democratic ads aren\u2019t up to the job. In the very busy spot below, running in Michigan, the Koch brothers appear as barely identified ghosts amid a jumble of hard-to-follow words.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the things-don\u2019t-go-better-with-Koch message is getting across, at least with focus groups. Democratic pollster Geoff Garin told the Times, \u201cOur research has shown pretty clearly that once voters recognize the source of the attacks [on Democratic candidates], they tend to discount them substantially.\u201d Focus groups, he said, had an \u201coverwhelmingly negative\u201d reaction to the Kochs\u2019 political involvement and believed that the Kochs\u2019 \u201cagenda will hurt average people and the undermine the middle class.\u2019\u201d\n\nBillionaire venture capitalist Tom Perkins might have been only kidding when he said that democracies should be run more like corporations: \u201cYou pay a million dollars in taxes, you get a million votes.\u201d\n\nBut if you pay for enough misleading ads, that is, in effect, what a million bucks can do. And the more the media unthinkingly hail your charitable giving, the more mileage a million dollars will get you.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/charles_koch_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Leslie Savan", "description": "Will the Koch brothers sweet-talk the media with their philanthropy?", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Will the Koch brothers sweet-talk the media with their philanthropy?", "title": "Washing Koch As White As Snow", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/washing-koch-white-snow/", "image": {"width": 615, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/charles_koch_ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 407}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T11:06:34+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Will the Koch brothers sweet-talk the media with their philanthropy?", "title": "Washing Koch As White As Snow", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/washing-koch-white-snow/", "image": {"height": 407, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/charles_koch_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/charles_koch_ap_img.jpg", "width": 615}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "March 10th, 2014", "sailthru.title": "Washing Koch As White As Snow", "keywords": "the nation, koch industries, alec, affordable care act, harry reid, americans for prosperity, campaign finance", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 110506, "sailthru.tags": "Campaign Finance,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "campaign finance", "published_time": "2014-03-10T21:25:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T11:06:34+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/savan_leslie/"}, "sailthru.description": "Will the Koch brothers sweet-talk the media with their philanthropy?", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/charles_koch_ap_img.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd59\"", "article_summary": "In the very busy spot below, running in Michigan, the Koch brothers appear as barely identified ghosts amid a jumble of hard-to-follow words.\nDavid Koch\u2019s name had also been elevated by his contributions to WNET, the city\u2019s PBS affiliate.\nTo placate Koch, they axed a second similar film, but Koch resigned from the board and took his money with him.\nAs you enter the Metropolitan Museum of Art, signs tell you you\u2019re standing on the new David H.
