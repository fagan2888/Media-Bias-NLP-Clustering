But the \u201cnever-ending saga\u201d of anti-Obamacare litigation, as Justice Elena Kagan put it, presses on. On August 7th two federal appellate courts turned back separate challenges to Barack Obama\u2019s signature health-care law. The rulings are more bad news for litigants who have approached the courts to try to undermine the law, but either or both cases could eventually be heard by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe first challenge goes after the law\u2019s individual mandate, the provision that requires most Americans to buy a health-insurance policy (subsidised by the feds, for lower-income people, in states that expanded Medicaid) in order to expand coverage while keeping insurance companies solvent. This part of the law was upheld in 2012 by a 5-4 vote, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing the opinion. This ruling, in National Federation of Independent Business v Sebelius, determined that the individual mandate, backed by a penalty for non-compliance, was within Congress\u2019s power, under Article I of the constitution, to \u201clay and collect taxes\u201d. Now the plaintiffs are taking a new tack, pointing to the so-called \u201corigination clause\u201d, one section back in that same article. The clause requires that \u201call bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills.\u201d\n\nThe trouble, the plaintiffs say, is that Obamacare was initiated in the Senate, not the House. So as a \u201cbill for raising revenue\u201d, the ACA was thus improperly enacted. The complaint comes from Matt Sissel, a hale and hearty artist from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Mr Sissel says he has no use for health insurance and prefers to pay for occasional doctor visits out of pocket rather than be conscripted to buy a policy. Thirteen months ago, three judges on the circuit court for the District of Columbia held for the government. Obamacare was not designed as a revenue-raising bill, they ruled, but as a reform of America\u2019s health-care system. The origination clause doesn\u2019t apply. Undeterred, Mr Sissel sought an \u201cen banc\u201d review of this decision by all 11 judges at the DC circuit court. Last week, after a long delay, the court declined, by a 7-4 vote, to re-hear Mr Sissel\u2019s case.\n\nThe four judges who would have granted en-banc review do indeed believe that any bill raising revenue needs to originate in the House; the seven who denied it maintain that the origination clause applies only to bills whose \u201cprimary purpose\u201d is to bring money into the government\u2019s coffers. Since the point of the ACA was \u201cto overhaul the national healthcare system, not to raise revenue\u201d, it did not run afoul of the constitution, they ruled. But in the end, this judicial tiff makes little practical difference. The full slate of appellate judges still concurred that Mr Sissel was barking up the wrong tree. The four dissenters say that they would have voted in favour of the ACA too, though on the theory that the bill did originate in the House after all.\n\nOpponents of Obamacare\u2019s so-called \u201ccontraceptive mandate\u201d also got a thrashing last week. In a 42-page decision from the Second Circuit appellate court in New York, three judges rebuffed complaints from several Catholic non-profit organisations that the ACA forces them to violate their conscience by permitting their employees to receive free birth control.\n\nReligious bodies like churches and synagogues have always been exempt from the mandate, and last year the Supreme Court ruled in Burwell v Hobby Lobby that some types of religious corporations can be released as well. Adding religiously affiliated non-profits to this list would deny birth-control coverage to tens of thousands of women who do not necessarily share their employers\u2019 religious beliefs. So the Obama administration hatched a sympathetic compromise: organisations can sign a form or write a letter opting out of contraceptive coverage on religious grounds, which clears the way for a third-party insurer to provide birth control instead. The groups who have brought this complaint are still not satisfied, however, as they argue that the mere act of filling out the form or writing the letter still implicates them in the sordid business of contraception and curtails their religious liberty.\n\nNo way, the Second Circuit held. Echoing recent rulings from six other circuit courts, Judge Rosemary Pooler wrote that the accommodation does not impose a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on the plaintiffs\u2019 religious freedom in violation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. To the contrary,\u201d it \u201crelieves\u201d them of this burden. Just because a plaintiff \u201cconsiders a regulatory burden substantial does not make it a substantial burden,\u201d the court held. \u201cWere it otherwise, no burden would be insubstantial.\u201d\n\nLawyers for Mr Sissel have already indicated they will ask the Supreme Court to review their case; the Catholic organisations are mulling their options. Will the Supreme Court agree to step in to resolve either of these fights? Not likely. But then again, few expected the court to hear the frivolous semantic complaint known as King v Burwell last year. If four of the nine justices think either complaint against Obamacare has merit, we may see the ACA back on the Supremes' docket when they return to work in October.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/2015/08/blogs/democracy-america/20150815_usp504_apple_news.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "The Affordable Care Act in court", "description": "Tenacious opponents of the law are angling to get it back before the Supreme Court", "pubdate": 20150812, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "Tenacious opponents of the law are angling to get it back before the Supreme Court", "title": "Obamacare's haters won't stop hating", "url": "http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/08/affordable-care-act-court", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/08/blogs/democracy-america/20150815_usp504_apple_news.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "Tenacious opponents of the law are angling to get it back before the Supreme Court", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-12 10:00:31", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/08/blogs/democracy-america/20150815_usp504_apple_news.jpg", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.tags": "The Affordable Care Act in court", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/2015/08/blogs/democracy-america/20150815_usp504_apple_news.jpg", "articleid": 21660889, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/2015/08/blogs/democracy-america/20150815_usp504_apple_news.jpg", "sailthru.web_section": "Blogs", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/08/blogs/democracy-america/20150815_usp504_apple_news.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@EconUS"}, "news_keywords": "The Affordable Care Act in court"}, "article_summary": "Will the Supreme Court agree to step in to resolve either of these fights?\nUndeterred, Mr Sissel sought an \u201cen banc\u201d review of this decision by all 11 judges at the DC circuit court.\nThirteen months ago, three judges on the circuit court for the District of Columbia held for the government.\nAT THE end of June, when the Supreme Court saved the Affordable Care Act from a technical challenge in King v Burwell, it seemed the legal battles over Obamacare were finally over.\nThe rulings are more bad news for litigants who have approached the courts to try to undermine the law, but either or both cases could eventually be heard by the Supreme Court."}
