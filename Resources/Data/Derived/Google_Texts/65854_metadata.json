Selected highlights of revenue cycle-based speakers, talks, and keynotes are included.\n\nThe future of value-based care\n\nSylvia M. Burwell, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will deliver one of HIMSS16's keynote addresses.\n\nNearly one year ago, Burwell announced HHS\u2019s goal to tie 30 percent of fee-for-service Medicare payments to value-based payment models.\n\nBurwell's future objective, which builds off of the basics of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is to tie 85 percent of traditional Medicare payments to quality by 2016 and 90 percent by 2018.\n\n\u201cWe believe these goals can drive transformative change, help us manage and track progress, and create accountability for measurable improvement,\u201d Burwell said.\n\n\u201cWhether you are a patient, a provider, a business, a health plan, or a taxpayer, it is in our common interest to build a health care system that delivers better care, spends health care dollars more wisely and results in healthier people.\"\n\nHealthcare providers operating under the value-based reimbursement model are reportedly seeing many benefits compared to the fee-for-service system.\n\nThere was an 18 percent dip in costs among over 1 million members treated by providers under a value-based reimbursement model, according to research from Humana.\n\n\u201cThe positive impact of the value-based model in Medicare Advantage also reflects Humana\u2019s support of the goal of the Department of Health and Human Services of tying 50 percent of traditional, or fee-for-service, Medicare payments to quality or value by 2018,\u201d Humana stated within a press release.\n\n\u201cThe provider community\u2019s embrace of the value-based reimbursement model and continued dedication to patient care, combined with the population health capabilities from health plans, is proving to produce better outcomes for patients, physicians, health plans and society as a whole,\u201d said Roy A. Beveridge, MD, Humana\u2019s Chief Medical Officer.\n\n\u201cAs a physician who has practiced for more than 20 years, the value-based model supports the holistic approach to care that is necessary for effective population health management.\u201d\n\nAccountable care organizations\n\nBurwell\u2019s aforementioned announcement also described an action plan of sorts regarding the relatively new accountable care organization (ACO). Key objectives include the reduction of unnecessary spending, stronger outcomes, and greater levels of coordinated care.\n\n\u201cThe setting of target dates for the transition from pay-for-volume to pay-for-value means that provider organizations must ramp up their own preparations for adopting an approach that emphasizes population health management. But the infrastructure to do that is largely nonexistent in most current ACOs,\u201d says David Wennberg, MD, MPH, CEO of the Northern New England Accountable Care Collaborative (NNEACC).\n\nSuccessful healthcare providers must grow accustomed to delivering high quality care within tight budgetary restrictions.\n\nValue-based incentives are a top focus to help get the ACO ball rolling and promote low cost, high-quality care, states a report from the Health Technology Transformation.\n\n\u201cWhether an ACO is hospital-led or physician-led, it needs deep pockets to build the necessary infrastructure and hire sufficient care managers,\u201d said the report.\n\nPay-for-performance incentives are positively impacting physician behavior, according to a recent JAMA Pediatrics study.\n\n\u201cACOs are responsible for healthcare costs and quality across a defined population. To succeed, the ACO must improve value by reducing costs while either maintaining or improving the quality and outcomes of care,\u201d stated researchers.\n\nLooking back (and ahead) at ICD-10 implementation\n\nRevenue cycle management is a big post-ICD-10 implementation focus.\n\nNinety-nine percent of healthcare organizations said they were well prepared for ICD-10 implementation switchover on October 1, 2015, confirmed recent data from Porter Research and Navicure.\n\nReflection upon the first 180 days of ICD-10 implementation will nonetheless likely be a third hot topic at HIMSS16. Claims denial rated and pended claims rates related to revenue neutrality will be discussed.\n\nBonnie Sunday, MD, for instance, will be speaking on March 1 at a State of the Union presentation entitled, \u201cICD-10: The First 180 Days \u2013 HIMSS ICD-10 Task Force Perspective.\u201d\n\nIn another chat on March 2, \u201cICD-10: Celebrating Success? A Conversation with HIMSS ICD-10 Task Force,\u201d ICD-10 Task Force members will discuss ICD-10\u2019s struggles and opportunities.\n\nMACRA\u2019s greater influence\n\nHow is the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) of 2015 affecting the healthcare industry? This will be one of many discussions unfolding at HIMSS16.\n\nMACRA\u2019s influence on Meaningful Use changes was a concern for providers as last year came to a close.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released a quality measurement draft plan under MACRA last December.\n\nMACRA fee adjustments tied to a $200 billion Medicare reform package were expected to financially hurt physicians and healthcare providers.\n\nMACRA is a key discussion point within one March 2 HIMSS16 session featuring speaker Robert Jarin, JD, BA.\n\nThe shift to value-based medicine, alternative payment models (APMs), and the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) will be one of many key discussion points. Rulemaking for both APMs and MIPS begins this year with implementation kicking off in 2019.\n\nIn light of such developments, CMS recently posted a Measure Development Plan for APMs and MIPs to help alleviate physician burden.\n\nCMS said goals to tie 30 percent of Medicare payments to value via alternative payment models by the end of this year, and half by the end of 2018, are indeed \u201cmeasurable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe passage of the Medicare Access and Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) supports the ongoing transformation of healthcare delivery by furthering the development of new Medicare payment and delivery models for physicians and other clinicians,\u201d CMS stated.\n\n\u201cCMS is committed to reducing provider burden through the use of measures aligned across federal and private-payer quality reporting programs. We stress harmonization of data elements and specifications among measure developers, whose cooperation and sharing are essential to creating aligned measures.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The topics of revenue cycle management innovation, value-based care, ICD-10, and claims management transparency will likely be of key importance at HIMSS16.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/4-himss16-revenue-cycle-management-value-based-care-focuses", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_5_5735475700.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "4 HIMSS16 Revenue Cycle Management, Value-Based Care Focuses"}, "twitter": {"description": "The topics of revenue cycle management innovation, value-based care, ICD-10, and claims management transparency will likely be of key importance at HIMSS16.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_5_5735475700.jpg"}, "title": "4 HIMSS16 Revenue Cycle Management, Value-Based Care Focuses", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "A successful revenue cycle is patient-centric, said Stuart Hanson, Chair and Senior Vice President of the HIMSS Revenue Cycle Improvement Task Force.\n\u201cWhether you are a patient, a provider, a business, a health plan, or a taxpayer, it is in our common interest to build a health care system that delivers better care, spends health care dollars more wisely and results in healthier people.\"\n\"Providers and plans have recognized the need to collaborate to provide a more consumer-friendly revenue cycle experience,\u201d he stated.\nThe topics of revenue cycle management innovation and value-based care will be of key importance at HIMSS16, one of the largest healthcare information technology (IT) conferences of the year, held next month in Las Vegas.\nThe new future of revenue cycle management is perhaps about the evolving role of the healthcare consumer \u2013 one who is a consumer, patient, and payer."}
