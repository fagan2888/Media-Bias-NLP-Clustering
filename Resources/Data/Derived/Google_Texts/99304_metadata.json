But they do have the power to investigate it.\n\nRecent weeks have seen the meltdown of the Obamacare national online marketplace, reported to have cost between $400 million and $600 million so far. There are also indications the administration knew serious problems were coming and hid them from lawmakers who have a responsibility to oversee the program.\n\nThe episode has prompted a lot of questions on Capitol Hill. Just how many people have tried to purchase coverage on the exchanges? How many have succeeded? Is the level of interest sufficient for Obamacare to reach its goal of seven million enrollees? Why is the administration being so secretive about it?\n\nAlso, what about the security of Americans\u2019 confidential health and financial information? Does the struggling system have adequate protections for that?\n\nAnd once the administration finally gets its website working, will millions of Americans experience sticker shock, discovering that they will have to pay higher premiums and deductibles for coverage? What were the administration\u2019s in-house estimates on that?\n\nAs House Republicans see it, there is much to talk about. Last Thursday, Rep. Fred Upton, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, sent letters to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, as well as some major Obamacare contractors, wanting to know why HHS officials were painting a rosy picture of the exchanges just weeks before it all came crashing down.\n\n\u201cStaff from your agency who briefed committee staff in August 2013 explained that testing of the [exchanges] was proceeding on schedule and did not identify any problems like the ones now being experienced on HealthCare.gov,\u201d Upton told Sebelius. In addition, Upton said a top Obamacare official told the committee on Sept. 19 that consumers would have immediate and full access to Obamacare\u2019s programs, \u201cand they will be able to choose a plan and get enrolled in coverage beginning Oct. 1.\u201d\n\nThat certainly didn\u2019t happen. Citing what he calls \u201ca host of broken promises\u201d from the Obama administration, Upton is preparing to call those officials back for more testimony. \u201cWe want to look at the rollout, and what they said this summer,\u201d Upton told me, \u201cwhen they absolutely verified that everything was fine and dandy.\u201d\n\nIn addition to testimony, Upton wants internal documents relating to the exchange\u2019s design and testing, plus documents from outside experts involved.\n\nAnd there are still more questions. How did the Obama team select the contractors involved in the (so far, disastrous) rollout? The Washington Examiner\u2019s Richard Pollock has reported that federal officials relied on just one company to design the system. \u201cRather than open the contracting process to a competitive public solicitation with multiple bidders,\u201d Pollock reported, \u201cofficials in the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid accepted a sole bidder, CGI Federal, the U.S. subsidiary of a Canadian company with an uneven record of IT pricing and contract performance.\u201d\n\nThat is a classic subject for congressional investigation. And so is the subject of cost: Just how much has the administration spent on the exchanges so far versus its original estimates, and how much will it cost to fix the system now? And what about the administration\u2019s story that the exchanges\u2019 early problems were due simply to an enormous amount of traffic from people wanting to sign up? Where did that come from?\n\nIn addition to Upton, Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Sen. Lamar Alexander, the ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, are seeking answers from the administration. In a letter to Sebelius on Thursday, the lawmakers demanded a wide range of information from HHS, \u201cfor us to better determine whether any corrective legislative actions are necessary.\u201d\n\nThe number of Obamacare investigations on Capitol Hill is likely to grow in coming weeks. There\u2019s no denying the probes will have a political element, as Republican chairmen in the House lead the charge. And if Obamacare\u2019s problems continue, and perhaps expand, the situation could be politically advantageous for the GOP. No one should be surprised if a White House on the defensive accuses Republicans of playing politics.\n\nBut the fact is, the investigations are necessary and appropriate; Obamacare is a massive, and massively expensive, federal undertaking that could bring about major changes in the lives of millions of Americans. It must have congressional supervision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be pursuing this with a lot of vigor,\u201d said Upton. \u201cThis issue is not going away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "The number of Obamacare investigations on Capitol Hill is likely to grow in coming weeks.", "title": "Obamacare meltdown triggers congressional investigations", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/upton-fred-480x356.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/10/15/obamacare-meltdown-triggers-congressional-investigations/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "The number of Obamacare investigations on Capitol Hill is likely to grow in coming weeks.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/upton-fred-480x356.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "The number of Obamacare investigations on Capitol Hill is likely to grow in coming weeks."}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15c5\"", "article_summary": "Recent weeks have seen the meltdown of the Obamacare national online marketplace, reported to have cost between $400 million and $600 million so far.\nCiting what he calls \u201ca host of broken promises\u201d from the Obama administration, Upton is preparing to call those officials back for more testimony.\nIs the level of interest sufficient for Obamacare to reach its goal of seven million enrollees?\nThere are also indications the administration knew serious problems were coming and hid them from lawmakers who have a responsibility to oversee the program.\nBut the fact is, the investigations are necessary and appropriate; Obamacare is a massive, and massively expensive, federal undertaking that could bring about major changes in the lives of millions of Americans."}
