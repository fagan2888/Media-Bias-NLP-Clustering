Barack Obama, delivering his last State of the Union address, outlined a vision of the future that relied a lot on the past. Laying out an optimistic vision of America five and ten years from now, the President deftly avoided speaking out on pressing, controversial short-term issues such as gun control and the unfolding hostage crisis in Iran. Instead, Obama went big, taking a victory lap for his presidency, touting the “spirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible.”

Obama’s greatest hits, he reminded the country, includes saving the U.S. economy from the 2008 crash, improving No Child Left Behind, reforming the student loan repayment system, passing the Affordable Care Act, cheap and clean energy (“Gas under two bucks a gallon ain’t bad,” he quipped), mending diplomatic relations with Cuba, making progress on climate change reform, and the Iranian nuclear deal. Plus, did you remember how he killed Osama bin Laden?

Because he totally did that:

If you doubt America’s commitment — or mine — to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.

While Obama kept the spotlight on problems like ISIS, climate change, income inequality, and influence of money in politics, the president also avoided several of the issues he hopes to take executive action on in his final year. Unmentioned in Obama’ final State of the Union address were women’s reproductive rights and gun control—not to mention that mildly inconvenient naval hostage crisis playing out in Iran.
