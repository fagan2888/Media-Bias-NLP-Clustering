When he entered the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, he was on track to become a chemist.\n\nHis sophomore year, though, he enrolled in an analytical chemistry lab, a class that veered his course. \u201cI loathed the idea of running basic experiments that had been performed millions of times before by chemistry students of generations past,\u201d he says. \u201cThe fixed cost of spending countless hours collecting data and writing up results on things that were already well understood became too much to bear.\u201d\n\nHe dropped his chemistry major and went all in on economics.\n\nImmediately, he found the social science more interesting and felt encouraged by the \u201crelatively low fixed costs\u201d of contributing to it. \u201cThe process of thinking up an idea, converting an idea to an experiment, and finally to disseminating knowledge is far more accessible in economics than it is in many of the hard sciences,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI believe that life is inherently meaningless. There is no higher power that has put us here or imbued us with some greater purpose that we were meant to figure out. Rather, it is incumbent upon us as individuals to make a leap to action in order to create meaning in our lives.\u201d\n\nWhen he went to graduate school at the University of California-San Diego, where he\u2019ll get his economics Ph.D. this year, he thought he\u2019d focus on the economics of education, \u201cfollowing the clich\u00e9d writers\u2019 advice of writing about what you know,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, at some point, I came to the realization that the largest unexplored frontier exists in health.\u201d\n\nToday, Knepper is working on the economics of health care policy, producing research that his peers call \u201creally innovative and important.\u201d\n\n\u201cA good economist,\u201d he says, \u201cis able to identify real-world problems and to then recognize how to go about studying them with the goal of eliminating them.\u201d\n\nGiven that, Knepper\u2019s quite concerned that though the United States outspends the world\u2019s second most expensive health care system by more than 50 percent per capita, the World Health Organization ranks us at only 37th, right between Costa Rica and Slovenia.\n\n\u201cIn no other sector are we culpable of such inefficiency,\u201d Knepper says. \u201cMy overall body of work is motivated by the puzzle of how the U.S. health care system continues to reap so little return on its investment.\u201d\n\nAnswering this question, he acknowledges, will be \u201ca Herculean task\u201d requiring experts in economics, medicine, epidemiology, public health, and public policy: \u201cMy thinking is that using an interdisciplinary approach to demystifying the link between dollars spent and lives saved would provide me with the best opportunity to help resolve one of the greatest conundrums in the history of the United States.\u201d\n\nOne of Knepper\u2019s papers starts to chip away at the problem: In it, he shows that failing to expand coverage under the Affordable Care Act raises private insurance deductibles \u2014 a finding that runs counter to many of the arguments against the policy.\n\nKnepper is also working on projects that examine the repercussions of closing mental health clinics. After Chicago shut down six of its 12 mental health facilities in 2012, Knepper and a collaborator, Matthew Niedzwiecki, set out to investigate the correlation between the closures with emergency-room admittances, violent-crime rates, and access to psychiatric care.*\n\nKnepper also focuses on labor economics, specifically if the decline of unions has decreased workers\u2019 willingness to report sexual harassment and discrimination.\n\n\u201cMy working hypothesis, which is corroborated largely by anonymous survey evidence,\u201d Knepper says, \u201cis that these types of workplace crimes often go unreported due to the employee\u2019s fear of punishment or retaliation by the offending party,\u201d since unions help their members in disputes with employers via legal advice and other support.\n\nHe plans to confirm whether there\u2019s a link between labor unions and discrimination reports, then to see if successful claims actually do reduce workplace sexism. Eventually, he hopes to influence policy to combat these types of labor offenses.\n\nEven though Knepper graduated college Phi Beta Kappa and won UNC-Chapel Hill\u2019s Chancellor\u2019s Award for Undergraduate Excellence in Economics \u2014 and even though he got a fellowship from the National Science Foundation for his research at UCSD \u2014 he still felt that a \u201csoul-crushing\u201d part of graduate school was transitioning from being the cream of the intellectual crop to being what he calls \u201cjust run of the mill\u201d as compared to peers.\n\n\u201cThis was a hard truth to swallow and one that\u2019s shoved in your face day in and day out during the boot camp phase of graduate school,\u201d Knepper says. \u201cI am not embarrassed to admit that the Ph.D. program has been the most difficult, merciless challenge I have ever experienced.\u201d\n\nThe stress of it made him consider quitting and also, he says, \u201cleft me with an indelible battle scar in the form of shingles on my forehead.\u201d\n\nHe credits his thesis advisor, Julie Cullen, with saving his economics career. In addition to providing encouragement, she focused him on a few ideas and guided him to carry them to fruition. Without her, he says, \u201cit would not have been possible for me to chase and catch up to my own research interests.\u201d\n\nBefore all this, Knepper spent his early childhood in Queens, New York. When he was six, his parents moved the family to Marlboro, New Jersey, so that he and his brother could go to better public schools.\n\nDuring his teenage years, Knepper read Camus and decided that he, too, is an existentialist: \u201cI believe that life is inherently meaningless,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is no higher power that has put us here or imbued us with some greater purpose that we were meant to figure out. Rather, it is incumbent upon us as individuals to make a leap to action in order to create meaning in our lives. We do this by pursuing our passions, working hard to become experts in our craft, and eventually making a contribution to the world around us in order to better the circumstances of future generations.\u201d\n\n*UPDATE \u2014 April 14, 2015: This post has been updated to more accurately reflect the findings of Knepper\u2019s research.\n\nWe\u2019ll be publishing profiles of this year\u2019s list of the 30 top thinkers under 30 throughout the month of April.
