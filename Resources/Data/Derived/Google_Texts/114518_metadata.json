Medicare and Medicaid were both approved with the support of about half the members of the minority. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 passed with the votes of 30 out of 32 members of the Republican minority. Only six senators voted against the Social Security Act. Only eight voted against the Americans With Disabilities Act. None of this happened by throwing these bills together in a back room, then sending them to the floor with a stopwatch running. It happened through a laborious process of persuasion and coalition-building. It took time and patience and hard work. Importantly, it also guaranteed that every one of these laws had stability and wouldn\u2019t be endlessly relitigated. Now compare that to the attitude behind Obamacare. When Democrats couldn\u2019t convince Republicans that this bill was worth supporting as written, they plowed ahead on their own and passed it on a party-line vote. That\u2019s why the chaos this law has visited on our country is not just tragic, it was entirely predictable. Chaos will always be the result if you approach legislation without regard for the views of the other side.\n\nEd Kilgore has a very good response, noting that McConnell and the GOP are forever searching for ways to undermine these very social programs, and that they wouldn\u2019t have passed under today\u2019s GOP.\n\nI\u2019d add one point, though. Guess who has usefully confirmed for us that Republicans actively worked to deny Obama bipartisan support for his proposals for strategic reasons? Mitch McConnell, that\u2019s who. Here is what McConnell said just after the 2010 elections, back when his strategy was looking fearsomely brilliant:\n\n\u201cWe worked very hard to keep our fingerprints off of these proposals,\u201d McConnell says. \u201cBecause we thought \u2014 correctly, I think \u2014 that the only way the American people would know that a great debate was going on was if the measures were not bipartisan. When you hang the \u2018bipartisan\u2019 tag on something, the perception is that differences have been worked out, and there\u2019s a broad agreement that that\u2019s the way forward.\u201d\n\nThe complaint McConnell makes in his Politico op ed is best understood as the goal of what had been his strategy all along. The whole GOP gamble of the Obama era was to do everything possible to deny Obama bipartisan support for anything, not just to make it harder to rack up accomplishments, but also to ideologically insulate Republicans from what they expected would be an epic, never-ending policy catastrophe. That catastrophe would manifest itself in a failure of the economy to turn around fast enough; the inability of Obama to make the system function after vowing to change Washington; and of course, in the epic disaster that was and is Obamacare.\n\nThis would be blamed on apocalyptic levels of philosophical disagreement and on Obama\u2019s radical departure from American governing traditions. The idea wasn\u2019t just that Republicans were opposing Obama for garden variety political or policy reasons, but that they were deeply alarmed at the president\u2019s agenda, which was ideologically unhinged from the country\u2019s founding values and threatened to transform the country into something no longer recognizably American.\n\nMaintaining undiluted Republican opposition to Obama\u2019s agenda was central to maintaining that fiction. (The ongoing assault on Tea Party dogma from Michael Gerson and Michael Strain is interesting because it directly calls out this fiction, as Jonathan Chait has argued.) We know this was the game plan because McConnell told us so himself, though he didn\u2019t put it that way.\n\nThis strategy didn\u2019t work out as planned in 2012, of course. But it remains alive and well all the same. Since the Affordable Care Act cannot turn out to be anything other than an unmitigated catastrophe, blaming the \u201cchaos visited on our country\u201d (as McConnell puts it in Politico) on Obama\u2019s tyrannical flouting of American governing norms will inevitably be enough to hand them the Senate in 2014. This has to work eventually.
