The findings are based on two nationally representative surveys of more than 2,600 American adults conducted between November and January.\n\n\u201cThis whole realm of connotative meaning is actually where most of us live our daily lives. When looking at a menu and deciding what to have for lunch, you see the word \u2018sushi\u2019 \u2013- some people have the reaction, \u2018Oh, delicious, I\u2019ll order that,\u2019 and other people have a reaction of: \u2018Disgusting, raw fish.\u2019 So these terms play out not only in our every day decision making but also in our politics,\u201d Leiserowitz said.\n\n\u201cSo, is it \u2018the estate tax\u2019 or the \u2018death tax?\u2019 Is it \u2018the Affordable Care Act\u2019 or \u2018ObamaCare?\u2019 These terms carry with them all these additional values, images and associations that come up in people\u2019s minds,\u201d he added.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed What\u2019s causing our weather extremes? 1:01 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nBy pure scientific definition, the phrases do differ. In most scientific journals, \u201cglobal warming,\u201d refers to the planet\u2019s surface-temperature increase and \u201cclimate change\u201d refers to the weather impacts wrought by those higher temperatures.\n\nBut even experts often swap those words back and forth.\n\n\u201cScientists tend to prefer using climate change because it encompasses non-heat-related results such as ocean acidification and increases in heavy rain events,\u201d said Suzanne Shaw, director of communications for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a non-partisan group of biologists, physicists and others. \u201cHowever, for public audiences, global warming seems to be better understood as the phenomenon we are experiencing so we tend to use them interchangeably, and it doesn't seem to confuse people.\u201d\n\nThey do, however, carry different weights among variously aligned sub-groups, Yale discovered. For example, according to the report, \u201cglobal warming\u201d is rated as \u201cvery bad\u201d compared to \u201cclimate change\u201d among:\n\n\u2022 Women: (35 percent think it is \u201cvery bad\u201d versus 22 percent who do not).\n\n\u2022 Generation Y: (38 percent versus 24 percent).\n\n\u2022 The Greatest Generation: (35 percent versus 20 percent).\n\n\u2022 African-Americans: (34 percent versus14 percent).\n\n\u2022 Hispanics: (44 percent versus 22 percent).\n\n\u2022 Liberals (45 percent versus 37 percent),\n\n\u2022 Conservatives: (19 percent versus 11 percent).\n\n\u2022 Evangelicals: (30 percent vs. 17 percent).\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed White House Issues Warning to Combat Climate Change 2:53 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\n\u201cThat kind of challenges that common wisdom that maybe we should be using the term \u2018climate change\u2019 because it\u2019s a way of better engaging those audiences,\u201d Leiserowitz said.\n\nBut is one more fair and less pejorative than the other?\n\n\u201cThat is a judgment call. It\u2019s complicated. It depends on who is the messenger. It depends on what your goals are. It depends on who your audiences are. Those are going to differ. The scientific community, for completely accurate and legitimate reasons, generally prefers the term \u2018climate change\u2019 because it captures a wider variety of the dimensions of the issue than does global warming.\n\n\u201cEverybody can make that decision for themselves.
