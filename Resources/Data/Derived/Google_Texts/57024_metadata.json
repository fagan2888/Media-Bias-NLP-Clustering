They are the visible signs Donnie Blizzard says are indicative heat-stressed corn.\n\n\"We need rain and we need it immediately. there's a lot of corn that can't be saved at this point,\" said Blizzard\n\nBlizzard grows crops like tobacco, wheat, and corn on his 3-thousand acres of land. He says he's never seen so many days where the temperatures have stayed around the 100-degree mark, and that its taken a toll on his corn.\n\n\"Most of the plants we grow tend to kind of shut down, it's kind of like a defense mechanism when we get this kind of heat,\" said Blizzard, \"The key to this is the extended period of time, 3 weeks. 1 week might not have been such a big deal but three weeks of it? It's become a very serious situation.\"\n\nRoy Thagard is the field crops agent in Greene County and says although we have had some thunderstorms, that kind of rain doesn't help.\n\n\"All of a sudden it comes, you get more surface water removal than sub-surface penetration from the rain. Even though the rainfall landed on the ground, it's really not benefiting the crop,\" said Thagard.\n\nThagard believes the best thing for the corn is a slow, steady rain that can sink into the soil.\n\n\"Some of our farmers that have 3-4-500 acres of corn, there's not really much they can do, other than pray for rain,\" said Thagard.\n\nEven with rain, Blizzard says at this point, it's already too late for some of the crops. He says he'll lose about half his crop this year.\n\n\"It takes a pretty significant yield, 100 to 120 bushels to break even with today's production cost,\" said Blizzard, \"Again, when you're talking about a 50% yield, you're talking about maybe a 60 or 70 bushel yield.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dry, twisted and browning leaves.
