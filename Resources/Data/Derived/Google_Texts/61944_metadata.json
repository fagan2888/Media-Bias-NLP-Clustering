Writing for Christian Today, Krish Kandiah, president of London School of Theology, said:\n\n\"Should you go and see 'Exodus'? If you are looking for classic Ridley Scott movie along the lines of 'Gladiator' or 'Alien' then sadly, no. 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' is nowhere near as innovative. And if you're hoping for a biblically faithful retelling of the book of Exodus \u2013 then again, no. Scott plays fast and loose with the scriptures, making some huge deviations for artistic effect. But, if you want a talking point movie that will make you gasp, think and wonder then this film is a real treat.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "article_metadata": {"description": "Egypt has banned Hollywood's big screen biblical epic 'Exodus: Gods and Kings,' a 20th Century Fox spokesman said on Friday.", "title": "Screening of 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' banned in Egypt", "og": {"image": "http://d2.christiantoday.com/en/full/22637/exodus-gods-and-kings.jpg", "description": "Egypt has banned Hollywood's big screen biblical epic 'Exodus: Gods and Kings,' a 20th Century Fox spokesman said on Friday.", "title": "Screening of 'Exodus: Gods and Kings' banned in Egypt"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "p": {"domain_verify": "035da258d4370c219fc1e27db5605a75"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "Keywords": "christian news,christianity,evangelical,Exodus,Gods and Kings,Ridley Scott,Christian Bale", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd07a\"", "article_summary": "Egypt has banned Hollywood's big screen biblical epic 'Exodus: Gods and Kings,' a 20th Century Fox spokesman said on Friday.\n'Exodus: Gods and Kings' is nowhere near as innovative.\nIf you are looking for classic Ridley Scott movie along the lines of 'Gladiator' or 'Alien' then sadly, no.\n'Exodus' is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Christian Bale as Moses, a Hebrew leading God's enslaved people out of Egypt and the clutches of Ramses, the Egyptian pharoah.\nAdvertisementMorrocco has also reportedly banned the film, which has so far grossed $107 million in two weeks in worldwide release."}
