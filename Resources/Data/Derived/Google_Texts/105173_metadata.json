Burwell is that it actually puts Obamacare\u2019s opponents in a worse position than they were in before the lawsuit. Pre-King, the IRS had simply promulgated a rule that subsidies must be available to people in every state, regardless of the presence of an exchange. The Obama administration argued that, if the court found the text ambiguous, it should defer to the IRS and allow its rule to go forward. (This is the so-called Chevron deference.) Under that logic, a future administration could revoke the subsidies in states with no exchange just as easily as the Obama administration made the subsidies universally available.\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nBut on Thursday, Roberts held that the Chevron deference doesn\u2019t apply. The subsidy question, he explains, is one of deep \u201ceconomic and political significance\u201d that cuts to the core of the law. Thus, \u201c[t]his is not a case for the IRS. It is instead our task to determine the correct reading of\u201d the disputed section. Roberts then writes that \u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\u201d so the court must hold that the \u201ccorrect reading\u201d of the law required subsidies to be made available in all 50 states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis is a breathtaking holding\u2014and an absolutely devastating defeat for the conservatives who brought this challenge to Obamacare. What might have been an ambiguous portion of the text\u2014and an opportunity for a future president to wreck the law\u2014has now been made unambiguous by the court.\n\nNo wonder, then, that Justice Antonin Scalia was hopping mad, writing in his dissent that the majority\u2019s logic is \u201c[p]ure applesauce\u201d and \u201cinterpretive jiggery-pokery.\u201d The court didn\u2019t just save Obamacare from this challenge; it also saved it from potential future sabotage. The court\u2019s hardcore conservatives may be furious\u2014but the president has a lot of celebrating to do.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The Obamacare ruling is an even bigger victory for the law\u2014and the president\u2014than anybody expected.", "fb-share": "The court just made it much harder for future administrations to revoke Obamacare\u2019s subsidies.", "sailthru.author": "Mark Joseph Stern", "description": "Everybody, To my mind, the most astonishing aspect of Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 opinion in King v.
