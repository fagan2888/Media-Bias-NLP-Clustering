It was a tough debate.\u201d\n\nThis certainly isn\u2019t the first time Obama has been examined for potentially misleading Americans about Obamacare. After all, Obama\u2019s promise that \u201cif you like your insurance plan, you will keep it\u201d proved to be false last year when Americans started losing their health care plans.\n\nUnsurprisingly, though, Obama is now distancing himself from Gruber and his suggestions about the law that were videotaped last year.\n\nOther Democrats, like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), have been even more obvious in their efforts to run from Gruber.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d Pelosi said of the Obamacare architect Thursday despite the fact that she had specifically praised his work and mentioned him by name in a 2009 press conference.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Over a week after video surfaced of Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber alleging that the Affordable Care Act passed thanks to \"lack of transparency\" and the \"stupidity of the American voter,\" President Obama is finally answering questions about the comments.", "title": "Obama addresses Jonathan Gruber's 'stupidity' comments, says he...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 563, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/11/Australia-G20_Chal-563x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/11/16/obama-addresses-jonathan-grubers-stupidity-comments-says-disagrees/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "stupidity-of-american-voter", "published_time": "2014-11-16T10:49:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-16T10:49:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say there was not a provision in the health care law that was not extensively debated and was fully transparent.\nAfter all, Obama\u2019s promise that \u201cif you like your insurance plan, you will keep it\u201d proved to be false last year when Americans started losing their health care plans.\nUnsurprisingly, though, Obama is now distancing himself from Gruber and his suggestions about the law that were videotaped last year.\nIt was a tough debate.\u201dThis certainly isn\u2019t the first time Obama has been examined for potentially misleading Americans about Obamacare.\nOther Democrats, like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), have been even more obvious in their efforts to run from Gruber."}
