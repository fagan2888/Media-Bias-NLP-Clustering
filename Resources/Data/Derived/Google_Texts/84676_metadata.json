Kuster isn\u2019t focused on politics \u2013 she\u2019s focused on bringing people together to ensure that New Hampshire families have access to the quality, affordable health care they need and deserve,\u201d said Rob Friedlander, Kuster\u2019s communications director.\n\nAnd Harrell Kirstein with the New Hampshire Democratic Party said AFP\u2019s ad is in bad taste coming during a holiday season where brotherhood and finding common ground should be the theme.\n\n\u201cRunning this negative attack ad over Christmas proves just how desperate Marilinda Garcia, Gary Lambert, and their allies are to repeal the ACA and bring New Hampshire back to a system where insurance companies had free reign to deny care, drop coverage, and raise costs,\u201d Kirstein said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThey are on a reckless mission to dismantle this law and prevent Granite Staters from getting the health care they need.\u201d\n\nMoore said this was precisely the right time to air the commercial given the most sweeping aspects of the ACA take effect Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cWe hope ads like this helps Congresswoman Annie Kuster see the light and support making changes to a law that is badly flawed.\u201d\n\nMoore offered few details on the ad buy other than it was \u201csignificant\u201d and that all 2nd District voters would see it \u201cseveral times\u201d over its run.\n\nThe Telegraph confirmed through independent sources it will run for three weeks on programing geared towards women voters.\n\nA hefty buy of that length on cable can run $300,000-to-$400,000.\n\nThe ad clearly had the potential to be replicated and used against other, vulnerable Democratic members of Congress.\n\n\u201cUsually when we run an ad it is in multiple district states,\u201d Moore said.\n\nIt comes on the heels of a radio commercial from the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee accusing First District Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter of lying to voters that under Obamacare they could keep their insurance and their doctor.\n\nShea-Porter has aggressively marketed some of the concessions, that lead insurer Anthem agreed to let those with individuals extend their coverage for a year without the consumer protections granted under Obamacare.\n\nAnd she announced before the insurer did that Minuteman Health Plan of Massachusetts secured a $37 million federal loan to join Anthem in offering individual coverage on the ACA exchange starting in 2015.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201cnew, narrower\u201d network for new exchange plans under Anthem closed the market to Southern New Hampshire Medical Center in Nashua and hospitals in Concord, the Monadnock Region and North Country all in Kuster\u2019s district.\n\nEarlier this week, a national CNN poll showed 62 percent disapproval of the new law.\n\nKevin Landrigan can reached at 321-7040 or klandrigan@nashuatelegraph.com.
