Heidi Scheuermann, R-Stowe, said in an interview following the discussions.\n\n\u201c(We need to ensure that) folks who have their own business, do their own work, and work for other people \u2026 are able to continue to do that, and that hiring entities aren\u2019t afraid to hire them as result of some of the labor laws in place.\u201d\n\nUnder the current classifications, some hiring entities worry they are liable for workers\u2019 compensation or unemployment insurance, even though their hired workers are independent contractors.\n\nOne of the bills in question, S.378, proposes to establish a common definition of the term \u201cindependent contractor\u201d for the workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment insurance statutes. Scheuermann and 35 other lawmakers are sponsors of the bill.\n\nAnother bill under consideration, H.773, would amend definitions related to independent contractors in unemployment compensation and workers\u2019 compensation statutes and post the classifications at worksites.\n\nUnder H.773, the Department of Labor could enter an employer\u2019s premises to investigate compliance with workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment compensation statutes, and enforce stop-work orders for workers\u2019 comp violations. The bill also clarifies requirements for debarment consultation for employers who have violated wage and hour, workers\u2019 compensation or unemployment compensation statutes.\n\nA common assumption of the bills is that when someone isn\u2019t covered by worker\u2019s compensation and gets injured on the job, the cost for care falls back on Vermonters. Scheuermann challenged this assumption.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure if all of us are in the same position believing all of this risk, if something were to occur, would go to other Vermonters,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d like to find out where exactly people think the risks can go before we decide that it automatically is (on Vermonters), because I don\u2019t see it, necessarily.\u201d\n\nShe suggested some people may have savings or other medical insurance, so that an injured worker without worker\u2019s compensation is not necessarily a public liability.\n\nState Rep. Warren Kitzmiller, D-Montpelier, ranking member of the committee, doubted that enough independent contractors have savings for such emergencies.\n\n\u201cIn the last few years we\u2019ve sometimes referred to some independent contractors as the guy with the pick-up truck, the ladder and a dog. The guy probably doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of savings,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if he falls off the roof, breaks his back, and he\u2019s in the hospital not paying that bill, that gets put on us.\u201d\n\nCatherine Davis, vice president for strategy and public affairs for the Lake Champlain Chamber of Commerce, offered testimony on the bills.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we are interested in is the common definition,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be nice to provide some kind of clarity \u2014 one definition that everyone can understand. Some of the bills before you do that.\u201d\n\nDavis also stressed the importance of keeping Vermont competitive within the region.\n\n\u201cOur laws should be designed for where we are going in the future, not where we were 50 years ago. I want Vermont to be a place where this kind of thing can thrive, where young people want to come to work here, whether it\u2019s because they can work for multiple clients or because they want a steady job with an employer.\u201d\n\nAnother concern of Scheuermann\u2019s is that not every independent contractor works with equal risks of injury. The panel compared the risks of an office worker developing corporal tunnel versus loggers who face danger daily.\n\nAfter multiple days of hearing testimony on the issues, committee members say they need time to think things over before making a next move.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve sat and listened to a lot of the testimony the last few days, and what I thought was simple wasn\u2019t simple,\u201d said committee chairman Rep. Bill Botzow, D-Bennington.\n\nHe added that the bill might need to be revised to specify different sets of rules for different sectors of the workforce.\n\nContact Michael Bielawski at mbielawski@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The House Commerce Committee met with labor leaders on Thursday to gauge how new bills regarding contractor work can best suit employers and employees.", "title": "Labor laws for contractors under examination in Vermont - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/construction.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-05T08:09:23+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/255948/labor-laws-for-contractors-under-examination/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2016-02-05T05:27:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-05T08:09:23+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The House Commerce Committee met with labor leaders on Thursday to gauge how new bills regarding contractor work can best suit employers and employees.", "title": "Labor laws for contractors under examination in Vermont - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/construction.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The House Commerce Committee met with labor leaders on Thursday to gauge how new bills regarding contractor work can best suit employers and employees."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc482\"", "article_summary": "Under H.773, the Department of Labor could enter an employer\u2019s premises to investigate compliance with workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment compensation statutes, and enforce stop-work orders for workers\u2019 comp violations.\nAnother bill under consideration, H.773, would amend definitions related to independent contractors in unemployment compensation and workers\u2019 compensation statutes and post the classifications at worksites.\n\u201cIn the last few years we\u2019ve sometimes referred to some independent contractors as the guy with the pick-up truck, the ladder and a dog.\nState Rep.
