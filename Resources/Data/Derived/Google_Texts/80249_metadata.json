Testosterone levels among men in the control group were, on average, more than four times as high: 414.74 ng/dl (14.39 nmol/L), with a standard deviation of 141.81 ng/dl (4.92 nmol/L).Testosterone levels among women in the study group, however, were actually higher than those in the control group, though the difference did not rise to the level of statistical significance. The average was 36.61ng/dl for the former pool and 25.93 ng/dl for the latter.Among men in the study group, testosterone levels were inversely associated with the dose of methadone each man received (estimated \u03b2 = \u22120.003; 95% CI \u22120.005 to \u22120.001; p = 0.003) (Figure 2) and positively associated with the number of cigarettes each man smoked per day (estimated \u03b2 = 0.011; 95% CI 0.000, 0.021; p = 0.046).To estimate the magnitude of the effect, the researchers used the exponentiated beta coefficient to reverse the logarithmic transformation and multiplied by 10. They found that for each 10 mg increase in methadone dose, there is a 0.97 ng/dL (0.03 nmol/L) decrease in testosterone level (estimated exp(\u03b2) = 0.969; 95% CI 0.950, 0.989; p = 0.003).The researchers hypothesized that cigarette usage increased testosterone levels by speeding the metabolism of methadone and thus reducing its impact on the hormone. They also speculated that the effect may explain the common observation that men struggle especially hard to quit smoking during methadone treatment.Reported limitations of the study include the relatively small size of the study group for gender specific analyses. The study team calculated that there was adequate power to support the associations found for the 131 men but that the power for the female group (100 patients) was not large enough to assert that any detected correlations were significant.\u201cLarger sample sizes with more sex hormones investigated,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cwould be ideal for future study, as well as implementing a prospective follow-up study design to observe whether testosterone levels change throughout the course of treatment with methadone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A common treatment for opioid addiction significantly reduces testosterone levels in many male patients; researchers suggest that supplementary testosterone might improve outcomes.", "og": {"site_name": "MD Magazine", "description": "A common treatment for opioid addiction significantly reduces testosterone levels in many male patients; researchers suggest that supplementary testosterone might improve outcomes.", "title": "Methadone Treatment Lowers Testosterone Levels in Opioid-addicted Men", "url": "http://www.hcplive.com/medical-news/methadone-treatment-lowers-testosterone-levels-in-opioid-addicted-men", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v1_media/_upload_image/_thumbnails/man-worry-hands.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v2_media/_core/favi/ms-icon-144x144.png", "keywords": "Low-t, Urology, addiction medicine, primary care, internal medicine, family practice, methadone, testosterone, opioids, pain management, hospital medicine", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc70\"", "article_summary": "They also speculated that the effect may explain the common observation that men struggle especially hard to quit smoking during methadone treatment.Reported limitations of the study include the relatively small size of the study group for gender specific analyses.\nThey found that for each 10 mg increase in methadone dose, there is a 0.97 ng/dL (0.03 nmol/L) decrease in testosterone level (estimated exp(\u03b2) = 0.969; 95% CI 0.950, 0.989; p = 0.003).The researchers hypothesized that cigarette usage increased testosterone levels by speeding the metabolism of methadone and thus reducing its impact on the hormone.\nTestosterone levels among men in the control group were, on average, more than four times as high: 414.74 ng/dl (14.39 nmol/L), with a standard deviation of 141.81 ng/dl (4.92 nmol/L).Testosterone levels among women in the study group, however, were actually higher than those in the control group, though the difference did not rise to the level of statistical significance.\nThe study team calculated that there was adequate power to support the associations found for the 131 men but that the power for the female group (100 patients) was not large enough to assert that any detected correlations were significant.\u201cLarger sample sizes with more sex hormones investigated,\u201d the authors wrote, \u201cwould be ideal for future study, as well as implementing a prospective follow-up study design to observe whether testosterone levels change throughout the course of treatment with methadone.\u201d\nThe average was 36.61ng/dl for the former pool and 25.93 ng/dl for the latter.Among men in the study group, testosterone levels were inversely associated with the dose of methadone each man received (estimated \u03b2 = \u22120.003; 95% CI \u22120.005 to \u22120.001; p = 0.003) (Figure 2) and positively associated with the number of cigarettes each man smoked per day (estimated \u03b2 = 0.011; 95% CI 0.000, 0.021; p = 0.046).To estimate the magnitude of the effect, the researchers used the exponentiated beta coefficient to reverse the logarithmic transformation and multiplied by 10."}
