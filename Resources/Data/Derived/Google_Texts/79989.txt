The training took place earlier this week in Owasso.

Over 600 Owasso school teachers and support staff took part in an active shooter drill Monday.

Over 600 Owasso Public Schools teachers and staff took part in an active shooter training with the Owasso Police Department and Oklahoma Highway Patrol.

The training took place at Owasso High School where authorities conducted emergency drills in addition to the active shooter drills.

Owasso Police say staff members got to see the chaos of an active shooter scene and were taught the "mindset" that law enforcement officers would bring to the scene.

"They saw first hand the tactics used to bring such events to quick and decisive ends," said Lieutenant Nick Boatman.

Twelve Owasso officers and nine state troopers made the circumstances as realistic as possible, using assault weapons with blanks.

"It was loud; it was smoky; it was priceless training for our teachers, school staff and first responders," Boatman said.

The shooting took place August 11, 2014.
