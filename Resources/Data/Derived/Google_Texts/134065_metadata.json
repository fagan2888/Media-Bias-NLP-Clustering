Any overt indication that the RNC opposes Trump\u2019s nomination will only further inflame Trump\u2019s supporters and provide him with more proof that the GOP old boy network is out to get him.\n\nSo, Priebus appears on shows like ABC\u2019s This Week, and admits that one of the biggest problems in American politics is\u2026well\u2026institutions like the one he\u2019s currently running. \u201cPeople are just sick and tired of politics in general, sick and tired of Washington, DC and, I think, just actually sick and tired of both parties,\u201d he said.\u201d I think it's just a general feeling out there that's real. I wouldn't deny it.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he promised that whoever voters choose as the nominee, his flawed and hated party apparatus will be there. \u201cIt's our job to support that nominee and we will,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s probably Priebus\u2019s only real choice, said Washington Post columnist and Georgetown University professor E.J. Dionne, who recently published a history of the modern conservative movement, Where the Right Went Wrong: Conservatism from Goldwater to the Tea Party and Beyond.\n\nRelated: Rubio, the Unlikely Establishment Candidate, Is Now Trump\u2019s Main Rival\n\n\u201cI think Priebus\u2019s best option is to say he\u2019ll be nice to Trump and privately pray he loses,\u201d Dionne said.\n\nWhen it comes to the remaining institutions of the Republican establishment, he said, \u201cTrump has them over a barrel. He has basically said that he will bolt and run as a third party candidate if he loses and they don\u2019t want to give him an excuse to do that.\u201d\n\nA large part of the reason why Priebus can\u2019t forestall a Trump rebellion is that the Republican \u201cestablishment\u201d ain\u2019t what it used to be, and he knows it.\n\nThe GOP as a whole, Dionne said, is divided into movement conservatives, traditionalists, and other sub-groups. Even more important to the influence of the RNC could be what Dionne calls the \u201cradical split\u201d in the money that funds political campaigns. Today, the Koch brothers and other large donors, whose priorities may or may not align with the RNC\u2019s, can change the trajectory of a House or Senate race on their own.\n\nRelated: \u2018Trumponomics\u2019 Would Blow a Huge Hole in the Budget\n\nAs a result, the RNC doesn\u2019t have either the raw financial power or the moral authority with a majority of its members to either anoint a favored candidate or sink one that poses a threat.\n\nSo Priebus is reduced to promising that if Trump is nominated, the remaining elements of the old establishment will back him even though \u2013 as ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos reminded him Sunday \u2013 members of that old guard think a Trump nomination would destroy the party.\n\n\u201cYou know what? Winning is the antidote to a lot of things,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cAnd so the name of the game is winning in November. If we win in November, all those armchair quarterbacks will fall in line and they'll obviously be pretty pleased, I think, if we win in November.\u201d\n\nWhat Priebus leaves out is that it\u2019s a long leap from the securing nomination in July to a general election victory in November, and it\u2019s in precisely that little interregnum \u2013 known as the general election \u2013 when the party would have to \u201cfall in line.\u201d\n\nRelated: A Rubio Super PAC Channels Harry Potter to Take on Trump\n\nAnd, according to Dionne, even if Priebus can hang on to the old guard, he might face mass desertions anyway from other elements of the party unwilling to form ranks behind Trump.\n\n\u201cAs Trump goes on, more and more conservatives see positions they disagree with,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a whole lot of issues on which the economic populist side of Trump is antithetical to what conservatives believe.\u201d\n\nIf the billionaire former reality television star is the eventual nominee, Dionne says he sees \u201ctwo streams of defections\u201d from the Party.\n\n\u201cStream one will be the few remaining moderate Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will also be a stream of ideological conservatives who don\u2019t believe Trump is a real conservative.\u201d\n\nFor now, Priebus has little choice but to watch, and hope that as Trump leads the Republican Party toward the edge of a cliff, a critical mass of voters \u2013 with no obvious prompting from the RNC \u2013 will realize where they\u2019re headed and abandon Trump before it\u2019s too late.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When President Trump ships him off to a re-education camp, along with the rest of the displaced hierarchy of old GOP institutions, the one thing Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus will have going for him is a head start on self-criticism and denunciation.", "title": "Is Trump Leading the Republican Party to the Edge of a Cliff?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/22/Trump-Leading-Republican-Party-Edge-Cliff", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/02102016_Donald_Trump_pointing.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/22/Trump-Leading-Republican-Party-Edge-Cliff", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/02102016_Donald_Trump_pointing.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When President Trump ships him off to a re-education camp, along with the rest of the displaced hierarchy of old GOP institutions, the one thing Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus will have going for him is a head start on self-criticism and denunciation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "When it comes to the remaining institutions of the Republican establishment, he said, \u201cTrump has them over a barrel.\nI wouldn't deny it.\u201dNevertheless, he promised that whoever voters choose as the nominee, his flawed and hated party apparatus will be there.\nAny overt indication that the RNC opposes Trump\u2019s nomination will only further inflame Trump\u2019s supporters and provide him with more proof that the GOP old boy network is out to get him.\nDionne, who recently published a history of the modern conservative movement, Where the Right Went Wrong: Conservatism from Goldwater to the Tea Party and Beyond.\nSo Priebus is reduced to promising that if Trump is nominated, the remaining elements of the old establishment will back him even though \u2013 as ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos reminded him Sunday \u2013 members of that old guard think a Trump nomination would destroy the party."}
