The limit protects health insurance companies, but it can hurt consumers if they find a better or cheaper plan outside the season.\n\n\u201cFinding a new one that saves you $600 is not a qualifying reason,\u201d says Kevin Luss, owner of Luss Group. \u201cEven if they are going to save money, they got to stay in it or lose coverage.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nLetting an insurance policy lapse also doesn\u2019t count as a qualifying event, he adds. Neither is a doctor dropping out of network.\n\nPeople (at least two) are still able to bind together to purchase group insurance, but the ACA has made it a little restrictive. A husband and wife can\u2019t be the only ones making up a group of two, and thus can\u2019t get new insurance outside of open enrollment that way. The health care reform \u201creally restricted things a little bit,\u201d says Luss.\n\nWhat Does Get an Exception\n\nWhile restrictions abound, there are many qualifying events that allow consumer to pick up coverage outside of the enrollment period. Some events include, getting married or divorced, a permanent move to a new coverage area, the birth or adoption of a child, change in income or no longer being covered by a parents\u2019 health insurance.\n\nExperts warn being prepared to show proof of the event.\n\n\u201cA lot of the carriers require documentation,\u201d says Carrie Mclean, director of customer care at eHealthInsurance www.ehealthinsurance.com. \u201cFor example, if you have a loss of employer coverage, a lot of carriers want to see a termination letter from your employer.\u201d\n\nEven if the carrier doesn\u2019t require documentation, lying to get a new plan or coverage is not a good idea. According to Mcclean, if an insurer has been paying claims and asks for proof of the life event, lack of documentation allows the company to refuse to pay the medical bills.\n\nSome of the lesser-known life events that will get you qualified include, being released from jail, gaining citizenship or becoming a member of an Indian tribe.\n\nAccording to Luss, if a consumer gets bad advice from an insurance agent during open enrollment, the professional can write a letter to the provider taking the blame. \u201cIt\u2019s really at the discretion of the carrier,\u201d says Luss.\n\nIf all else fails, there\u2019s always the option of taking out short-term insurance, says Mahoney.\n\n\u201cShort-term plans provide a viable solution if you experience a gap in coverage between now and the next open enrollment period in November,\u201d says Mahoney. \u201cWithout insurance, a trip to the emergency room could cost thousands of dollars, but a short-term plan can significantly offset those costs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 11:03:50 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "If you don\u2019t have health insurance, don\u2019t roll the dice and hope you don\u2019t get sick or injured until the next open enrollment period.
