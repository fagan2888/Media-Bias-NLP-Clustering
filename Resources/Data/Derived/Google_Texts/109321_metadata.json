Nothing earth-shattering there \u2014 yet this one small study inspired a nationwide craze. Through something like a national version of the children\u2019s game of telephone, countless Americans glommed on to the idea that playing Mozart to a child in the womb would boost his or her IQ.\n\nA new industry was born. What Amazon now calls the \u201cbaby brain-booster category\u201d of consumer products soon grew crowded. Inevitably, politicians jumped on the bandwagon. Georgia Gov. Zell Miller directed that classical music recordings be sent home with new mothers. Florida mandated that state day care centers play symphonies.\n\nJust one small problem: None of that had any scientific basis. True, babies can recognize music they hear in the womb for several weeks following birth. But this does not boost a child\u2019s IQ. Six years ago, Scientific American reported that a German review by \u201ca cross-disciplinary team of musically inclined scientists ... declared the (Mozart effect) phenomenon nonexistent.\u201d Even Rauscher, author of the original study, called the idea that playing music to a fetus will make it smarter \u201creally a myth.\u201d\n\nStudy after study has reached the same conclusion. Yet companies still pitch the idea of piping tunes into the womb, and parents still lap it up.\n\nSomething similar may be going on now \u2014 with pre-kindergarten.\n\nBack in February, President Obama proposed \u201cworking with states to make high-quality preschool available to every child inAmerica. Every dollar we invest in high-quality early education can save more than seven dollars later on by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime.\u201d\n\nThe claim was bunk. But the president\u2019s proposal enjoys growing support.\n\nVirginia Sen. Tim Kaine recently penned an op/ed supporting the Start Strong forAmerica\u2019s Children Act \u2014 a \u201c10-year federal-state partnership to expand and improve early childhood education.\u201d Virginia Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe favors expanding pre-K, too. The support crosses red-team/blue-team lines: The Virginia Chamber of Commerce would like the state to \u201cimprove access to high-quality early childhood education,\u201d and it was a Republican governor, George Allen, who launched the Virginia Preschool Initiative.\n\nIn his op/ed column, Kaine repeated the standard arguments: \u201cPre-K is good for the economy\u201d; \u201cearly learning programs make it more likely that children will do well in elementary school\u201d; and so on. It would be nice if we had an experiment somewhere to test the validity of those claims.\n\nWe do. It\u2019s called Head Start. The United States has spent more than $160 billion on that early education program for at-risk children. The results are amazing \u2014 as in amazingly poor.\n\nIn 2010, the Department of Health and Human Services reported on a congressionally mandated study of approximately 5,000 3- and 4-year-olds who were randomly assigned to either a control group or a group that had access to a Head Start program. It found that \u201cat the end of kindergarten and first grade . . . the Head Start children and the control group children were at the same level on many of the measures studied.\u201d\n\nLast year, HHS issued the results of another randomized study. It, too, found that Head Start produced \u201clittle evidence of systematic differences\u201d in children\u2019s elementary school experiences through third grade.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty damning when the federal government itself concludes that a federal program doesn\u2019t work. But if you\u2019re still not convinced, consider a recent piece by Grover Whitehurst of the liberal Brookings Institution. Whitehurst is a development psychologist who spent his career \u201cdesigning and evaluating programs intended to enhance the cognitive development of young children.\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric supporting the Start Strong legislation, Whitehurst writes, is \u201centirely predictable and thoroughly misleading. ... If you\u2019re an advocate of strengthening early childhood programs, as I am, you also need to pay careful attention to the evidence \u2014 all of it.\u201d And the evidence, he says, \u201craises doubts on Obama\u2019s preschool for all.\u201d\n\nJust as the baby-Mozart crowd extrapolated wildly from one small and unrelated study, Whitehurst says supporters of universal pre-K \u201chighlight positive long-term outcomes of two boutique programs from 40-50 years ago that served a couple of hundred children\u201d \u2014 the Perry and Abecedarian pre-school projects. Those projects focused intensely on underprivileged children: Perry\u2019s two-year intervention spent $19,000 per student.\n\nMeanwhile, boosters ignore evidence that pre-K isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. That evidence, Whitehurst notes, includes \u201ca newly released study of Tennessee\u2019s Voluntary Pre-K Program (TN-VPK). TN-VPK is a full day pre-K program for four-year-olds from low-income families.\u201d\n\nThe study found that \u201cseven of the outcomes are negative. ... In other words, the group that experienced the Tennessee Voluntary State Pre-K Program performed somewhat less well on cognitive tasks at the end of first grade than the control group.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Education myths can be pervasive and costly.", "title": "Universal Pre-K: Mozart for Babies All Over Again?", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/12/09/universal-pre-k-mozart-for-babies-all-ov", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13866011339642.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13866011339642.jpg", "description": "Two decades ago, psychologist Frances Rauscher conducted an\nexperiment in which she asked 36 college students to listen to\ndifferent kinds of music before visualizing how a folded-up piece\nof paper would look when cut and then unfolded.\nThe results seemed to suggest Mozart might improve spatial\nreasoning.
