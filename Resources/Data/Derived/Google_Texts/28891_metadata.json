Bush.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, under pressure to be more aggressive on terrorism, regularly cites his predecessor\u2019s refusal to demonize Muslims or play into the notion of a clash between Islam and the West. It\u2019s a striking endorsement from a president whose political rise was predicated on opposition to the Iraq war and Bush\u2019s hawkish approach in the Middle East.\n\nAs Hillary Clinton put it, \u201cGeorge W. Bush was right.\u201d\n\nLaying out her plan to fight domestic terrorism, Clinton reminded voters in Minneapolis earlier this month of Bush\u2019s visit to a Muslim center six days after the Sept. 11 attacks. She even quoted his words from that day about those who intimidate Muslim-Americans: \u201cThey represent the worst of humankind, and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior.\u201d\n\nBush, of course, was not referring to the 2016 Republican presidential field. Clinton certainly was.\n\nDonald Trump has called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. \u2014 then enjoyed a bump in the polls. Ben Carson deems traditional Muslims unfit for the presidency. Marco Rubio warns of a \u201ccivilizational struggle against radical, apocalyptic Islam,\u201d making a distinction, at least, between ordinary Muslims and extremists. Ted Cruz berates Clinton and Obama incessantly for refusing to declare war on \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\n\nClinton and Obama argue that rhetoric just helps the Islamic State group and likeminded extremists, whose recruitment pitch is based on the narrative of an apocalyptic battle between Islam and the West. The Democrats warned that proposals like Trump\u2019s Muslim ban jeopardize national security, drawing a contrast with Bush.\n\n\u201cI was very proud after 9/11 when he was adamant and clear about the fact that this is not a war on Islam,\u201d Obama said recently. His message to today\u2019s Republican leaders: \u201cThey should follow his example. It was the right one. It was the right impulse.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton\u2019s top challenger for the Democratic nomination, visited a mosque this month in a show of solidarity that evoked Bush\u2019s after 9/11. And the Democratic National Committee released an ad contrasting comments by the 2016 GOP contenders with footage of Bush declaring that \u201cIslam is peace.\u201d\n\nAll of that marks a rare departure for a party that has spent the last decade slamming the former president \u2014 to much electoral success. After all, even many of the Republican candidates, even if in retrospect, have criticized the war in Iraq, where Islamic State militants now control part of the country and are seeking to export terrorism around the world.\n\nBut Bush\u2019s example has become particularly poignant for Democrats following recent terrorist attacks in Paris and California that have left people more preoccupied with terrorism than at any time since 9/11. Both Clinton and Obama have sought to deflect the critique that they\u2019re too soft on the domestic terrorism threat.\n\n\u201cThere weren\u2019t a lot of policy decisions that I agreed with George W. Bush on, but I was never going to call him weak on terror,\u201d said Mo Elleithee, a longtime Democratic Party official who now runs Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service.\n\nNot all Republican candidates have been as harsh about Muslims as Trump has been. Jeb Bush has joined his GOP challengers in describing the enemy as \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d But he\u2019s also said the U.S. should follow his brother\u2019s lead, arguing in the last GOP debate that \u201cwe can\u2019t dissociate ourselves from peace-loving Muslims.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2001 mosque visit, one of several occasions Bush denounced anti-Muslim bias, he stood alongside Muslim leaders and quoted the Quran about evil-doers being ultimately defeated. He insisted that intimidation against Muslims in America would not stand.\n\n\u201cThe face of terror is not the true faith of Islam,\u201d Bush said.\n\nThe former president has stayed mostly silent throughout the recent debate. His spokesman, Freddy Ford, recently said Bush wouldn\u2019t comment on \u201cTrump\u2019s bluster\u201d but repeated Bush\u2019s insistence that \u201ctrue Islam is peaceful.\u201d Ford declined to discuss what Bush thinks about Democrats quoting him now.\n\nMuslim groups have called on Obama to follow Bush\u2019s example by visiting a mosque, a move that would be risky for a president who has faced longstanding but false claims that he is a Muslim. White House officials didn\u2019t rule out the possibility Obama would visit a mosque, but said there were no imminent plans to do so.\n\n\u201cBush sent a very powerful message to the world and American Muslims that backlash and attacks on this faith community will not be tolerated,\u201d said Ibrahim Cooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. \u201cWe would hope President Obama would make a similar gesture.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President George W.
