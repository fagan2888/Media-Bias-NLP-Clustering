I\u2019ve had to explain to countless friends and relatives lately that you can\u2019t force someone to take medications or see a doctor. Federal and state laws protect the right to remain untreated, unless and until a person becomes a threat to him- or herself, or to another person. These are the rules of the game my sister plays. She\u2019s not a celebrity, but her most recent spiral into darkness has been public all the same. Over the past few months her delusions and paranoia have been chronicled in a way that, just a few years ago, only her closest friends and relatives might have seen. She recently re-emerged on Facebook after years of inactivity. \u201cMiraculously, I have woken up, and puzzlingly I find myself in Kansas,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe \u201cfeds\u201d were after her, she said. Luckily President Obama was on her side, and Larry Page had her back. But assassins were everywhere, and the attempts on her life were almost daily. Soon texts and emails from concerned friends and family began to flood my phone. I cringed when I checked her Facebook profile. Almost 400 friends. Elementary and high school friends. Work friends. Former teachers. Ex-boyfriends. Extended family. Over the past few months her posts have been constant. Hundreds of them, all set to public. \"Facebook's not the best place when it is the ONLY reason I am alive? You are going to get me killed.\" Sure the fog of paranoia would lift eventually, I tried to save her from herself. She wouldn\u2019t talk to me on the phone, but I attempted to reason with her via Facebook instant message. \u201cI want you to know your posts are causing a lot of concern and worry,\u201d I wrote. \u201cI know you feel the urge to write but Facebook is not the best place. At least not anymore.\u201d But she felt compelled to continue the prolific posts for her own safety. \u201cFacebook\u2019s not the best place when it is the ONLY reason I am alive?\u201d she responded. \u201cYou are going to get me killed.\u201d Only a few years ago, things were very different. My beautiful sister made friends quickly, laughing easily and often, her bright brown eyes and long brown hair shining. Despite struggling through grade school and graduating from high school with a solid C average, she managed to rack up some impressive life achievements\u2014a prestigious scholarship abroad, a graduate degree at an Ivy League School, a marriage to a handsome, well-respected professor and author. It was during her grad student years that we first started to worry. Graduate school can be stressful for anyone, and though she made some close friends, her experience was marked by strife and controversies that seemed too personal, too turbulent. Her personality seemed to change. She fought like a teenager with our mother. Long the closest person in my life, she didn't seem to care that I was getting married. She was distant and mistrustful toward my fianc\u00e9. She made odd remarks about people we\u2019d known all our lives, telling stories about them I had a hard time believing, and labeling them jealous or cruel for reasons I couldn\u2019t understand.\n\nThings began to deteriorate the winter after her graduation. Her husband called me with panic in his voice. \u201cShe really needs her family right now,\u201d he said, desperate for someone to do something. \u201cCall her.\u201d He stuck it out for a while, but in the end it was too much for him, and he finally asked for a divorce. She lived with us for a few months when she moved back to the United States, alone. She was depressed, understandably, but we hoped that with the help of therapy and medication she\u2019d pull out of it eventually, meet someone new, and get a job. Ideally one with benefits. Her husband was in no rush to finalize the divorce, so she could continue to access his health care benefits, but that couldn\u2019t last forever. I emailed her doctor many times. Usually there was no response at all. When there was it was just a brief statement: \"She has yet to give me permission to speak with anyone.\" Eventually she moved to San Francisco, renting a big room in a shared apartment. She worked part-time at a yoga studio, took dance classes, wandered the streets smoking cigarettes, attended daily support groups. When she came to visit her nieces and nephew, she was an adoring aunt but not always a kind sister. I had to explain to my kids. \u201cYour aunt is sick,\u201d I told them one day when she suddenly exploded at me after hours of nursing a perceived slight. \u201cHer brain tells her things that aren\u2019t true, so she doesn\u2019t always act right. She can\u2019t help it, and she loves us.\" I needed them to understand that this wasn\u2019t normal adult behavior. They nodded and asked questions, sad but understanding. She became increasingly delusional and paranoid. I emailed her doctor many times, a well-known psychiatrist and professor at a world-class university. Usually there was no response at all. When there was, it was just a brief statement: \u201cShe has yet to give me permission to speak with anyone.\u201d Privacy laws prevent doctors from discussing treatment and diagnosis with family members unless the patient specifically grants them permission to do so. Often the onus is on the patient to call the doctor to grant that permission. And it can be rescinded at any time.\n\nI began hearing about a boyfriend from family members and mutual friends, but she never mentioned him to me. Then one day she sent me an angry text. I had confused her about which train station we were to meet at. He was going to be there, and I had sabotaged his attempt to propose. I denied it, but for almost a year she wouldn\u2019t talk to me. For almost four decades, I had been the closest person to her in the world, but suddenly she no longer trusted me. Though she was less than 40 miles away, I didn\u2019t know what or how she was doing. She ignored my calls and blocked me on Facebook. I realized eventually there was no boyfriend. Though I was now cut off, she would occasionally talk to other family members and a handful of friends. We emailed each other frequently to find out if she had been in touch, grasping for clues about her mental state. At one point, she moved out of her apartment, telling no one where she was going. Though we knew she worked part-time as a receptionist at a yoga studio, we weren\u2019t sure which one. She had stopped checking her email and responding to text messages long ago, and wouldn\u2019t answer her cell phone, if she even had one. I filed a missing person report. Our youngest brother, who lived in her city, was finally able to find her at the yoga studio. He started coming around to her apartment and work to check in on her. Usually she was receptive to his visits, though not always. One day she walked out of work and checked herself in to an emergency room. We learned, when she finally called her ex-husband, that she had been transferred to an in-patient psychiatric ward. The hospital had put her on a \u201c5150\u201d \u2013 an involuntary psychiatric hold. I went to visit the next day, armed with magazines, candy and cards from my children, hoping to regain her trust. To my relief, the \u201cgangsters\u201d were now the enemy, not me, and she let me back in, even agreeing to let her doctors speak with me. But she refused to give the psychiatric ward doctor permission to talk with her \u201cregular\u201d psychiatrist, who was as frustratingly impenetrable as ever.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Laws protect the right to remain untreated, so unless the mentally ill become dangerous to themselves or others, you can&#39;t force them to see a doctor.", "author": "Elizabeth Clare West", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Laws protect the right to remain untreated, so unless the mentally ill become dangerous to themselves or others, you can&#39;t force them to see a doctor.", "title": "Watching Mental Illness Take a Family Member", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/3261104775_78531f5271_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/watching-mental-illness-take-a-family-member/279478/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc047\"", "article_summary": "Work friends.\n\u201cShe really needs her family right now,\u201d he said, desperate for someone to do something.\nBut she refused to give the psychiatric ward doctor permission to talk with her \u201cregular\u201d psychiatrist, who was as frustratingly impenetrable as ever.\nElementary and high school friends.\nSoon texts and emails from concerned friends and family began to flood my phone."}
