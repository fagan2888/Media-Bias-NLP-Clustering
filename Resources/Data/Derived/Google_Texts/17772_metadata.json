Unquestionably, it was confusing.\n\nWhy confusing?\n\nLandrieu is in a tough spot. She has backed the legislation most detested by much of red state Louisiana. She has supported President Obama who is in a tough match with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal for the most unpopular elected official.\n\nHer ad reveals that she is playing defense by trying to play offense.\n\nShe is attacking the Obama administration for the broken healthcare pledge. In doing so, she is admitting that she supported defective legislation of a major kind.\n\nSix years ago, back when the Louisiana Democratic Party had state elected officials with some clout, she won in a squeaker.\n\nThis time around, there are few heavy-hitters that can stand on a platform with her when she engages in her stump politics. There are too few familiar and powerful faces that can brand her commercials with endorsements.\n\nWhy confusing?\n\nThe end of her commercial shows Senator Landrieu with a big cross hanging from around her neck. Not that there is anything wrong or improper with her wearing a cross presumably displaying her deep devotion and love for her religion, her God and for her beliefs.\n\nNonetheless, it is confusing, at least to me, because it is the first time that I personally have seen her wear the cross publically. It raises the question whether she also is engaging in the much-practiced world of pull-the-heart-strings, pander politics.\n\nWe all know that many Christians believe she will boil in hell because she has supported \u201cchoice\u201d in some cases rather than \u201clife\u201d. You don\u2019t have to listen to talk radio to know that she has three major negatives\u2014Obamacare, Obama and the \u201cholier than thou\u201d bunch who disqualify her automatically, only and forever because of her views towards \"abortion\" or women's choice. They will not forgive her for her own personal beliefs and they will always treat her as if she were the wife of Satan.\n\nAssuming the cross around the neck was done for political as well as religious purposes, she absolutely will not be the first Louisiana statewide elected official who has linked \u201csaving\u201d their political careers with the savior.\n\nLet us not forget, Louisiana Senator David Vitter reminded us of his close communications with his own maker when he admitted to that infamous sin without in any way ever publically confessing just what that sin might be.\n\nFor those reasons, her commercial is undoubtedly confusing and for many reasons should answer the ultimate Howard Baker questions--what did she know and when did she know it.\n\nMaking her re-election even more confusing, however, are recent developments out of New Orleans that might give Landrieu supporters many reasons to do some heavy-praying.\n\nHer famous sibling, Mayor Mitch Landrieu, appears to be getting some serious competition with a well-known black and now former Judge, Michael Bagneris, who is taking off the robe and entering into the mayoral competition arena.\n\nThis means, the New Orleans election, which already appears to be a fertile battleground for the so-called and unfortunate emotional debate of \u201cchocolate\u201d or \u201cvanilla\u201d city dominations, could be split once again into warring camps. Political White versus black is not a pretty sight, anywhere. It wasn\u2019t when Ray Nagin launched into his \u201cchocolate city\u201d tirade or when others revolted against him for it.\n\nBack then, Mitch Landrieu made a run again Nagin in the post-Katrina election and the issue of \u201crace\u201d played a significant role in that contest.\n\nNot that Judge Bagneris is a Nagin nor there any evidence he would light the racial powerkeg, but his very existence in the election would be even more troubling given the already existing backdrop of which race will control the city's city council and other elective offices.\n\nAny split in the Landrieu camp based upon race is not good for Mitch and surely not good for his sis, who must depend upon the entire urban Landrieu base to get out and push the button for her only months after what now romises to be races about race.\n\nWhether the New Orleans elections, only a half-year before the senatorial match, undermines the solid coalition of traditional Landrieu family supporters remains to be seen. Regardless, it is another problem neither would like to be facing at this time.\n\nSo, given her recent commercial and the upcoming New Orleans elections, Mary Landrieu, (who will be facing hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars, from outside money and Super Pac\u2019s (who want to control Louisiana\u2019s own elective choice) is in a nasty but pivotal battle for her future political life.\n\nBut let me do my own pivot to that \u201cThe Most Disingenuous Ad of the Year\u201d gang.\n\nIf, the National Republican Senatorial Committee\u2019s own press release slamming Landrieu\u2019s commercial is not my own \u201cmost disingenuous of the year\u201d, it surely is competing for one of the most laughable.\n\nThe headline of the press release states: \"The Most Disingenuous Ad of the Year: Landrieu Can't Stop Lying About ObamaCare\n\nCredibility Crisis Threatens Landrieu\"\n\nThe questionable word here is \u201clying\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s read on. The NRSC release continues in pertinent parts:\n\n\u201cIt's the most disingenuous ad of the year. In a desperate and panicked effort to stop her polls from plummeting and distract from her broken promises to Louisianians, Mary Landrieu has launched an ad that would make Pinocchio blush.\n\nFor years, Mary Landrieu repeatedly promised Louisianians that under ObamaCare: \"If you like the insurance that you have, you\u2019ll be able to keep it.\u201d Landrieu made this promise despite knowing it was blatantly untrue:\n\nThree years ago, Mary Landrieu supported the very ObamaCare rule that's responsible for the health insurance cancellations that have caused so much consternation over the last month (Democrats unanimously supported it). Nearly 93,000 Louisianians' health insurance policies are in jeopardy and Mary Landrieu is directly to blame for that reality.\n\nWhen asked whether President Obama mislead Democrats, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) disclosed: \"He should have just been more specific...No, we all knew.\"\n\n\n\nTop Democratic leaders in Washington admitted that they actually knew middle class Americans would lose their coverage because of ObamaCare: \"House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer conceded to reporters today that Democrats knew people would not be able to keep their current health care plans under Obamacare and expressed qualified contrition for President Obama\u2019s repeated vows to the contrary. 'We knew that there would be some policies that would not qualify and therefore people would be required to get more extensive coverage.'\"\n\nMary Landrieu's latest act of desperation is a stark reminder that one of the following two facts must be true:\n\nMary Landrieu was knowingly dishonest about people keeping their care yet repeatedly promised otherwise? or,\n\nMary Landrieu didn't understand the legislation that she repeatedly championed (and made the centerpiece of her campaign).\n\n\"Mary Landrieu's latest ad is the most disingenuous television ad of the year,\" said NRSC Press Secretary Brook Hougesen. \"Mary Landrieu repeatedly promised that everyone could keep their health care plans and doctors if they liked them despite knowing that it was blatantly untrue.\n\nHow can Louisianians trust anything Mary Landrieu says after she's repeatedly deceived them about ObamaCare for the last four years and continues to do so today? This ad is an insult to the intelligence of every voter in Louisiana.\"\n\nPerhaps so and it is always nice when outside politicos, demos' and gops alike know what is an insult to every Louisiana voter. Well, those are just words. Ah, but that's the point.\n\nThe GOP's own press release accuses the Senator of lying without providing any real supporting evidence is enough for Pinocchio to exclaim Jiminy Cricket!!\n\nThe NRSC does cite Democratic leaders who admit to their own knowledge about this issue and who have also made ambiguous yet unproven allegations about the scienter of other members of their party.\n\nIf this is what Hougesen claims is proof of Landrieu\u2019s knowledge, of her \"lying\" then maybe he should take a course in law and evidence.\n\nNone of the democrats mentioned name Landrieu, specifically. Nor do Steny Hoyer or Kirsten Gillibrand state who \u201cwe\u201d are in detail or at all.\n\nEven more curious is the national GOP\u2019s above assertion that either Landrieu was \"either knowingly dishonest\" or that \"she didn't understand the legislation she repeatedly championed\".\n\nYes, she probably should have known just as President Obama probably should have known what was in the law. But, that does not in any way--under the court of law or the court of public opinion prove that she actually did know and worse, that she knew dishonestly.\n\nIf it is evidence of anything, it is that the NSRC might consider getting off its own high-horse of throwing out unfounded and unproven claims of \u201clies\u201d. Otherwise, that horse of credibility might throw off its rider and trample it with screams of hypocrisy and inconsistency.\n\nI know this is the political arena and politicians and their paid-hacks say what they think the public wants them to say for the game\u2019s advantages.\n\nYet, here the GOP is shouting to the world with the banner of claims that Landrieu is lying, that she deceived and that she \"knowingly dishonest\"--all which goes unproven, raises serious questions as to whether those speaking the words can be trusted.\n\nIn so many ways, the public has a right to possess little confidence in their elected officials for actions they take while in office.\n\nThe public also has a duty to demand that political parties are accountable when they feed us misinformation either they know or should know is not true or not correct or simply laughable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Latest US, Louisiana News, political and business buzz  for New Orleans, Baton Rouge and other Louisiana cities", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Stephen Sabludowsky", "og": {"url": "http://www.bayoubuzz.com/buzz/latest-buzz/item/565001-does-pinocchio-know-if-landrieu-or-nrsc-nose-the-truth", "type": "article", "description": "Latest US, Louisiana News, political and business buzz  for New Orleans, Baton Rouge and other Louisiana cities", "title": "Does Pinocchio know if Landrieu or NRSC nose the truth?"}, "title": "Does Pinocchio know if Landrieu or NRSC nose the truth?", "keywords": "US, Louisiana News, Louisiana political, Louisiana politics, Louisiana business, New Orleans, Baton Rouge,  Louisiana cities, US politics, US news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e1e\"", "article_summary": "Nearly 93,000 Louisianians' health insurance policies are in jeopardy and Mary Landrieu is directly to blame for that reality.\nThe end of her commercial shows Senator Landrieu with a big cross hanging from around her neck.\n\"Mary Landrieu repeatedly promised that everyone could keep their health care plans and doctors if they liked them despite knowing that it was blatantly untrue.\nDemocratic Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu released a television commercial of her own on Monday portraying that she has kept her promise about American insureds\u2019s keeping their health insurance.\nImmediately, the Republican National Senatorial Committee blasted it calling it the most The Most Disingenuous Ad of the Year."}
