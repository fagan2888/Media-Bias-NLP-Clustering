Last year their tour topic was another Democrat favorite -- amnesty for illegal immigrants.\n\nHeading up the travelling sisters is Sr. Simone Campbell -- a lawyer and lobbyist who also led the nuns who defied the US bishops\u2019 condemnation of ObamaCare, signed a letter supporting the law and attended the signing ceremony at which she received a hug from President Obama.\n\nAt that time, the power of the \u201cNuns on the Bus\u201d was limited by their designation as rebels. With a Vatican investigation under way, it made it difficult for the nuns to claim to be the authentic moral voice of Catholicism.\n\nHowever, since then, Pope Francis has taken over and brought with him a certain interpretation of Catholic social teaching which adheres a lot closer to the tenets of the Democratic Party than more universally acknowledged truths pushed by Popes Benedict XVI and John Paul II.\n\nThe results of the probe will no doubt invite speculation that Pope Francis has had heavy influence over the findings of the report, which can comfortably be described as a whitewash.\n\nThe report mentions nothing of the \u201csecularist mentality\u201d and radical feminism that had been given as the reason for the launch of the investigation, and is mostly a document of praise which offers little-to-no criticism, no disciplinary action and says the nuns\u2019 work resonates with Pope Francis\u2019 emphasis on social justice\n\nThe report even manages to take a swipe at the U.S. economy, praising the nuns for working in an economy that too often \u201ccreates inequity and exclusion.\u201d It is better than anything the liberal nuns could have hoped for.\n\nThe liberal orders aren\u2019t out of the woods yet. A separate investigation by the Vatican\u2019s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith into the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR) -- a coalition of predominantly left-wing orders -- is not complete, and the doctrinal watchdog is likely to find something in a group that prides itself in rebelling against Church teaching.\n\nHowever, Monday\u2019s report gives left-wing nuns, and the Democratic Party a big boost for 2016.\n\nThe Catholic vote has been decisive in modern U.S. politics, and Catholic Democrats have often hyped their faith around election time. Joe Biden in particular has stood up as the advocate for liberal nuns, recently attending a \u201cNuns on the Bus\u201d rally and in the past reportedly telling Pope Benedict XVI that he was being too hard on them and that he should \u201clighten up.\u201d\n\nWith a recent Vatican synod appearing to undermine Church teaching on controversial issues, the new report is another blow to more traditional Catholics who, when the radical nuns are talking, have always been able to point out their status as rebels and dissenters ignoring Church teaching.\n\nUnless the CDF does a dramatic about-face with its report, the Democrats\u2019 favorite nuns will now claim to have Vatican approval. With a green light from Rome, expect left-wing nuns and the Democrat Party to be emboldened in their push to present the nuns -- and the Democrats -- as the authentic voice of Catholicism, putting the Democrats in a better position to retain and expand upon the often-decisive Catholic vote in 2016.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter for FoxNews.com.
