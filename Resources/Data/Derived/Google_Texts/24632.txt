Today’s edition of quick hits:

* Greece’s twists and turns : “An unexpected new effort by Greece to compromise with its creditors on a bailout package prompted a cool response from most of the rest of Europe on Wednesday as efforts to find a way out of the financial crisis confronting Athens remained chaotic.”

Egypt : “Militants linked with the Islamic State unleashed a wave of coordinated attacks on security checkpoints in Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula on Wednesday, the latest strike in a global surge in violence by the group’s sympathizers and one that threatened to push Egypt into a wider conflict with the jihadists.”

Investigations continue : “Six predominately black churches have gone up in flames in the last ten days – some likely due to arson, others accidents – in a rash of fires coming at a time when the country is already on edge over the safety and vulnerability of its places of worship.”

Rule of law : “A federal judge has issued an order directed at all probate judges in the state – who are responsible for issuing marriage licenses – that they can no longer decline to issue licenses to gay couples.”

Crunch time : “When the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, lands in Tehran on Thursday for a hastily scheduled meeting with President Hassan Rouhani and Iran’s top national security officials, it will be part of a behind-the-scenes effort to resolve two of the biggest obstacles to a nuclear deal: Whether to force Iran to reveal any evidence about suspected design work on nuclear weapons, and how to assure that inspectors can get inside the country’s most secret nuclear sites.”

* A potentially huge probe: “The Justice Department is investigating whether some of America’s biggest airlines have colluded to keep airfares high, officials familiar with the matter said Wednesday. Justice Department spokesperson Emily Pierce confirmed the probe, saying investigators are looking into ‘possible unlawful coordination by some airlines,’ but would not confirm which carriers.”

* Stuck in the past : “Republican lawmakers on Wednesday skewered President Obama’s announcement that the U.S. and Cuba have agreed to reopen embassies in each other’s capitals – with several vowing to block the confirmation of any U.S. ambassador to the communist country.”

Mississippi : “[State] Attorney General Jim Hood’s office is asking a federal appeals court to let its lawyers stop representing the state’s governor, Phil Bryant, in litigation over the state’s ban on same-sex couples’ marriages.”

* The Kaiser Family Foundation’s latest tracking poll : “Just over six in 10 Americans (62%) say they approve of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last week to continue allowing low- and moderate-income people in all states to be eligible for government subsidies to buy health plans through Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces.” ACA supporters now outnumber critics.

* There is no Pulitzer to be won here: “Why reporters won’t find anything damning in Hillary Clinton’s emails.”
