CREDIT: Shutterstock\n\nThe public loves clean air and clean water and wind power and solar power. The bulk of the conservative movement, not so much.\n\nIn fact, the incoming GOP Senate majority says rolling back EPA clean air standards is their top priority, giving the Democrats a chance to restore their brand as they did when the Gingrich Congress made a similar pro-pollution overreach in the mid-1990s.\n\nBut wait, you say, didn\u2019t Democrats overwhelmingly run on all that stuff this year and get their butts whooped on Election Day? Not quite.\n\nIt\u2019s true that an analysis of Senate ads found that \u201cenergy and the environment are the third-most mentioned issue in political advertisements, behind health care and jobs,\u201d as the New York Times reported. But more of those ads were \u201cpro-coal\u201d or \u201cpro-oil\u201d or \u201canti-E.P.A.\u201d in states like Kentucky, West Virginia, Alaska, and Louisiana than were \u201canti-oil\u201d or \u201cgreen energy\u201d in other states\n\nHeck, the winning candidate in the Colorado Senate race, Republican Cory Gardner, actually ran one of the green energy ads himself, talking up wind turbines. Of course, if you want to know what Senate Republicans are actually going to do about wind, you need to listen to their biggest backers.\n\nPolitico reported Monday that \u201cBrent Gardner of the Koch-linked Americans for Prosperity\u201d made clear they would fight hard against even the modest wind production tax credit (PTC): \u201cA vote for the PTC is a vote in support of President Obama\u2019s destructive climate action plan.\u201d\n\nNot only did a mere four percent of the energy and environmental ads explicitly about climate change, but the candidates themselves generally didn\u2019t follow through on that messaging, thereby undercutting it.\n\nHart Research polled 1,505 likely voters in Colorado, New Hampshire, Michigan, Iowa and North Carolina for three national green groups. In October, they asked voters, \u201cIn the past couple of months, how much have you heard about candidates\u2019 positions on this issue?\u201d Here were some of the voters\u2019 answer for \u201cHave heard a lot.\u201d\n\n57 percent Healthcare/Obamacare\n\n40 percent Jobs/economy\n\n17 percent Climate change\n\n16 percent Environmental protection\n\nSo, no, voters didn\u2019t hear a particularly loud or consistent message on climate and the environment.\n\nIf the lesson some people learn on the basis of this election is that trying to put climate change, clean energy, and the environment on the national agenda won\u2019t ever work, they will be learning the exactly-wrong lesson. Recall that the Koch brothers and the fossil fuel companies and their conservative allies didn\u2019t give up after the 2012 election went far astray for them despite hundreds of millions of dollars of spending. Quite the reverse, team Koch doubled down in 2014 \u2014 and won.\n\nAnd what is the polluters\u2019 reward for their patient victory? The Lexington Herald-Leader interviewed incoming Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) last week and reported that in terms of what he owes Kentucky voters, \u201cthe senator said his top priority is \u201cto try to do whatever I can to get the EPA reined in.\u201d\n\nIt appears that the GOP plans to go after clean air and clean water very hard. The Hill reported Sunday that \u201cRepublican lawmakers are planning an all-out assault on Obama\u2019s environmental agenda, including rules on mercury and other air toxics from power plants, limits on ground-level ozone that causes smog, mountaintop mining restrictions and the EPA\u2019s attempt to redefine its jurisdiction over streams and ponds.\u201d\n\nIf the GOP follows through with this plan, Democrats and progressives will have two choices. First, they can refuse to engage the GOP\u2019s attacks and misinformation, weakly saying that, yes, the EPA efforts to protect clean air and water need fixing and revising.\n\nThat, of course, was basically the response of many Democratic candidates to the loudest message from GOP ads and GOP candidates this election cycle \u2014 on the imaginary failures and horrors of Obamacare. Hardly any mention was made of the 10 million more people who now have health insurance or the fact that employers\u2019 health benefit costs are now growing at a historically low rate.\n\nSo the collective message the public heard about Obamacare was \u201cbad, bad, bad, bad, bad, maybe we can fix it, I won\u2019t say if I voted for Obama.\u201d How could such messaging possibly either energize the progressive base or persuade independents to support Democrats? The answer is that it could not. And, of course, it didn\u2019t.\n\nIf progressives take a similar approach to environmental protection, green energy, and clean-air standards, they will meet the same result. The alternative is for progressives to embrace a very strong defense of EPA\u2019s politically popular efforts to clean the air and rein in carbon pollution \u2014 and the administration\u2019s equally popular efforts to advance clean energy.\n\nSuch a strategy worked for Democrats during the Clinton Administration. Indeed, in 1995, when the newly elected Newt Gingrich Congress tried to kill EPA efforts to protect the environment and tried to zero out a clean energy investments by the Department of Energy, the Clinton administration along with congressional Democrats and progressives and environmentalists pushed back hard. The result was a significant revitalization for Democrats and the worst of Gingrich\u2019s plans were stopped.\n\nIt is time for those who understand what is at stake with the fight against the pro-collapse polluters to speak up!", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "If the lesson some people learn from the 2014 election is that trying to put climate change, clean energy, and the environment on the national agenda won't ever work, they will be learning exactly the wrong lesson.
