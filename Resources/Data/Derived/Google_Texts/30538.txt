The DuPage County Health Department on Tuesday announced the launch of Enroll DuPage, the county's one-stop source of information regarding the Affordable Care Act, and more specifically, the Illinois Health Insurance Marketplace.The Health Insurance Marketplace is the central location where qualifying residents can review and register for affordable health care coverage, according to DuPage County health officials.The two key components of Enroll DuPage are the creation of a website ( enrolldupage.org ) and a call center (888-724-0077). Both of these mediums will be available to help residents learn about how the Marketplace works, as well as provide news and updates about key ACA dates and activities. The call center will be an invaluable resource in providing information and education that will assist residents as they prepare for their upcoming appointments.The Health Department wants to ensure residents know that the call center will not be scheduling appointments at this time. However, DuPage County residents can use the next couple of weeks to learn about how the Health Insurance Marketplace works, pull together the necessary documentation they will need to enroll, and explore what health insurance plans are best for them and their families.To help spread the word about Enroll DuPage, the Health Departmentis partnering with 13 DuPage County organizations to conduct outreach, education and enrollment in the Marketplace. The Health Department received a grant of $1 million from the Illinois Department of Public Health and awarded grants to those organizations.The Health Department plans to leverage this strong network of social service providers to create a more robust opportunity for the nearly 87,000 county residents estimated to be eligible for health coverage under ACA, officials said.



Grants were awarded to the following organizations: DuPage Health Coalition: Access DuPage, DuPage County Community Services, DuPage Federation on Human Services, DuPage PADS, Hamdard Center for Health & Human Services, Northwest Pediatric Services SC, Loaves & Fishes Community Pantry, Naperville Township, Outreach Community Ministries, People's Resource Center, Walk-In Ministry of Hope, Xilin Association, and YWCA Metropolitan Chicago. The Health Department has also trained a team of ACA Ambassadors who will be making presentations to community groups throughout the county to explain Enroll DuPage.
