However, as it became apparent that the healthcare system had inherent flaws and contradictions, such as racial and class disparities, the movement gave way to \"Era 2,\" our current stage. Era 2, Berwick writes, emphasizes measurements, accountability and financial incentives.\n\n\"Era 3\" of healthcare, he writes, must include features of both. To achieve this vision, he says that the industry must require:\n\nLess mandatory measurement: One of the main problems with Era 2, Berwick writes, has been overreliance on measures, many of which are of limited usefulness. In the future, measuring bodies must work to cut the cost and volume of healthcare measures by half over the next three years.\n\nSimplified incentives: Measures must also emphasize standardized triple-aim focused goals and incentives rather than confusing, easily manipulated complex incentives for individual clinicians, Berwick writes.\n\nQuality over revenue: Echoing the federal government's strategies, Berwick calls for healthcare to move away from strategies that focus only on maximizing revenue, which he says is unsustainable in the long term. To properly emphasize care quality, he writes, care improvement must be a core competency for healthcare leaders.\n\nComplete transparency: \"The right rule is: 'Anything professionals know about their work, the people and communities they serve can know, too, without delay, cost, or smokescreens,'\" he writes.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the commentary (subscription may be required)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nFeds speed plans for value-based payments\n\nQuest for healthcare 'measures that matter' raises its own issues\n\n15 'vital signs' to improve healthcare\n\nHow 4 states tackle healthcare cost measurement\n\nCommonwealth Fund: U.S. healthcare is most expensive, but last in quality\n\nACHE 2015: Value-based care models heighten need for science-based measures", "article_metadata": {"description": "To grow and thrive, healthcare must enter a \"third era\" combining the strongest features of previous healthcare landscapes, according to former Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Donald Berwick, M.D.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "To grow and thrive, healthcare must enter a \"third era\" combining the strongest features of previous healthcare landscapes, according to former Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Donald Berwick, M.D.", "title": "4 ways to push healthcare into a new era", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/4-ways-push-healthcare-new-era/2016-04-08", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Donald Berwick,healthcare measures,incentives,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Racial Disparities,transparency,value-based care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "To properly emphasize care quality, he writes, care improvement must be a core competency for healthcare leaders.\nTo grow and thrive, the healthcare industry must enter a \"third era\" combining the strongest features of previous healthcare landscapes, according to former Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Donald Berwick, M.D.\nIn the future, measuring bodies must work to cut the cost and volume of healthcare measures by half over the next three years.\nSimplified incentives: Measures must also emphasize standardized triple-aim focused goals and incentives rather than confusing, easily manipulated complex incentives for individual clinicians, Berwick writes.\n\"Era 3\" of healthcare, he writes, must include features of both."}
