It was on Sept. 27, 2013. That was the day that Mr. Burr voted to approve Obamacare. And I said, 'That's it, I'm going to run against Mr. Burr.'\"\n\nHolmquist has never held political office but said he is running to provide a conservative voice for North Carolinians.\n\n\"I think we've got too many men and women in D.C. who are there for the wrong reasons. They're there for money, or power or ego. And I don't care about any of those three. I'm going because I love my country,\" he said.\n\nHolmquist said his top priority, if elected, would be national defense.\n\n\"If we're either unable or unwilling to defend our nation against terrorism or God forbid some kind of nuclear attack, then nothing else matters. Health care, education, energy, nothing else matters if we can't defend this country.\"", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "36.072635;-79.791975", "description": "GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Greensboro resident Larry Holmquist has entered the 2016 U.S. Senate primary to challenge incumbent Richard Burr. \"We need a good, strong conservative in the United States Senate,\" Holmquist said. \"And that's why I decided to run against Mr. Burr.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "myfox8.com", "description": "GREENSBORO, N.C. \u2014 Greensboro resident Larry Holmquist has entered the 2016 U.S. Senate primary to challenge incumbent Richard Burr. \u201cWe need a good, strong conservative in the United S\u2026", "title": "Larry Holmquist enters Senate race, challenging Richard Burr", "url": "http://myfox8.com/2015/09/24/larry-holmquist-enters-senate-race-challenging-richard-burr/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://localtvwghp.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/promo267403193.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwghp.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/promo267403193.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@myfox8", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@myfox8"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Weather, Sports and more from WGHP Fox 8 Television", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=576468704", "fb": {"pages": 66055982622}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://myfox8.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d6825caa4f715bb372290d2344aae986?s=16", "application-name": "myfox8.com", "ICBM": "36.072635, -79.791975", "keywords": "news, you decide 2016, larry holmquist, richard burr", "google-site-verification": "Yn8rglGvxxL_bChOFSZTPKslhj-7-DDnVf-rpVixhQs", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox8news", "published_time": "2015-09-24T22:44:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-24T22:44:17+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox8news"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\"We need a good, strong conservative in the United States Senate,\" Holmquist said.\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this videoGREENSBORO, N.C. -- Greensboro resident Larry Holmquist has entered the 2016 U.S. Senate primary to challenge incumbent Richard Burr.\nHolmquist said he decided to run because he felt Burr does not vote along conservative lines.\nI'm going because I love my country,\" he said.\nAnd I said, 'That's it, I'm going to run against Mr."}
