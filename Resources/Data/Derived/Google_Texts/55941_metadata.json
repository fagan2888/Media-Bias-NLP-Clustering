His death is such a great loss, and it caught us all by surprise,\u201d said 57-year-old painter and decorator Jose Maria Garcia, also a native of the Mediterranean port town of Algeciras.\n\nNo Spanish guitarist has been held in higher esteem by Spaniards since the death of classically-trained Andres Segovia (1893-1987), Garcia said.\n\nDe Lucia was one of Spain\u2019s greatest musical innovators, winning the admiration of fellow artists and fans alike.\n\nRenowned British guitarist John McLaughlin said that to have worked and played music with De Lucia was one of the greatest blessings in his life.\n\n\u201cIn the place where he lived in my heart, there is now an emptiness that will stay with me till I join him,\u201d McLaughlin told The Associated Press.\n\nEarly on in his career, he adopted a radically different playing technique by crossing his legs and placing the guitar on his right thigh, something that neither his flamenco mentors - Nino Ricardo and Sabicas - nor classical players like Segovia, had done previously.\n\nThis enabled De Lucia to hold the guitar almost horizontally and allowed easier access to the fret-board where his fingers could reach chords previously considered too tough to play.\n\nIn Andalusian towns like Algeciras - where a bronze statue commemorates the player and his hallmark playing position - De Lucia is best remembered for his work with singer Jose Monge Cruz, whose stage name was Camaron de la Isla.\n\nAs a duo, De Lucia and Camaron elevated flamenco music from its roots in small venues and even hillside caves and took it to some of the world\u2019s most famous concert halls. With De Lucia as studio producer, they also left a rich legacy of some of flamenco\u2019s most thrilling recorded music.\n\nDe Lucia\u2019s repertoire also included classical music, and his renditions of compositions by Manuel de Falla and Joaquin Rodrigo won praise.\n\nWhile on one of his world tours, De Lucia became fascinated by the cajon - a box-like percussion instrument used in Peruvian criollo (or creole) coastal music. Today the cajon is as much an integral part of flamenco as is the guitar or staccato hand-clap.\n\nNowhere was the versatility or technical prowess of De Lucia\u2019s style better showcased than in the jazz trios and sextets that he formed with guitarists like McLaughlin, Larry Coryell or Al Di Meola, pianist Chick Corea and jazz fusion percussionist Rubem Dantas.\n\n\u201cWhat I admire most is his total humility in the face of huge success and his human warmth,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nSpain began its formal mourning of De Lucia - who took his stage name from his mother\u2019s first name, literally meaning \u201cPaco, Lucia\u2019s son\u201d - on Friday at Madrid\u2019s National Auditorium music center, where royalty mingled with grieving music fans to pay their last respects before De Lucia\u2019s casket and offer condolences to his family.\n\nDe Lucia\u2019s coffin was visited throughout the night by a stream of people in Algeciras\u2019 town hall before being taken just past noon to church where Pepe de Lucia, the guitarist\u2019s brother, sang a heart-rending flamenco tribute at a funeral Mass.\n\n___\n\nHarold Heckle reported from Madrid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hundreds of people gathered in the rain to mourn the death of virtuoso guitarist Paco de Lucia before a funeral Saturday in his hometown of Algeciras at the heart of flamenco music country in Spain's deep south.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hundreds of people gathered in the rain to mourn the death of virtuoso guitarist Paco de Lucia before a funeral Saturday in his hometown of Algeciras at the heart of flamenco music country in Spain\u2019s deep south.", "title": "Paco de Lucia receives heartfelt funeral in Spain", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/1/paco-de-lucia-receives-heartfelt-funeral-in-spain/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/01/68aa3439731128084d0f6a7067007b3f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/01/68aa3439731128084d0f6a7067007b3f.jpg", "description": "Hundreds of people gathered in the rain to mourn the death of virtuoso guitarist Paco de Lucia before a funeral Saturday in his hometown of Algeciras at the heart of flamenco music country in Spain's", "card": "summary", "title": "Paco de Lucia receives heartfelt funeral in Spain"}, "Author": "HAROLD HECKLE and LAURA LEON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Paco De Lucia, Spain, Jose Maria Garcia, John Mclaughlin"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc789\"", "article_summary": "ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) - Hundreds of people gathered in the rain to mourn the death of virtuoso guitarist Paco de Lucia before a funeral Saturday in his hometown of Algeciras at the heart of flamenco music country in Spain\u2019s deep south.\nWith De Lucia as studio producer, they also left a rich legacy of some of flamenco\u2019s most thrilling recorded music.\nRenowned British guitarist John McLaughlin said that to have worked and played music with De Lucia was one of the greatest blessings in his life.\nAs a duo, De Lucia and Camaron elevated flamenco music from its roots in small venues and even hillside caves and took it to some of the world\u2019s most famous concert halls.\nDe Lucia was one of Spain\u2019s greatest musical innovators, winning the admiration of fellow artists and fans alike."}
