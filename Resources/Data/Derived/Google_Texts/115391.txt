A burning car exploded in Colorado Springs Wednesday afternoon, sending pieces of the car into the air.

Colorado Springs police said the car erupted in flames after it was rear-ended by another car on Highway 115 and Cheyenne Mountain Boulevard.

Shortly after a fire truck arrived to put out the fire, the first explosion happened. A second, smaller explosion occurred shortly after that.

The explosions were caused by oxygen canisters in the trunk of the burning car, police said.
