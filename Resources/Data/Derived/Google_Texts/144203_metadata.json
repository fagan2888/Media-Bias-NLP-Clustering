We chronicled 4.6 hours of stump speeches and press conferences, from a rally in Concord, N.C., on Monday to a rally on Friday in St. Louis.\n\nThe result: more than five dozen statements deemed mischaracterizations, exaggerations, or simply false \u2013 the kind of stuff that would have been stripped from one of our stories, or made the whole thing worthy of the spike. It equates to roughly one misstatement every five minutes on average.\n\nFrom warning of the death of Christianity in America to claiming that he is taking no money from donors, the Manhattan billionaire and reality-show celebrity said something far from truthful many times over to the thousands of people packed into his raucous rallies. His remarks represent an extraordinary mix of inaccurate claims about domestic and foreign policy and personal and professional boasts that rarely measure up when checked against primary sources.\n\nMany were straight-up wrong, such as his claim that the United States has a \u201c$500 billion a year trade deficit with China,\u201d which has been debunked over and over by fact checkers, and his statement that he never settles lawsuits, when in fact he has.\n\nTrump's week of errors, exaggerations and flat-out falsehoods A collection of Donald Trump's remarks over the timespan of a week. Produced by Beatrice Peterson.\n\nIn other instances, Trump stretches the limits of reality to distort the records of his rivals. Marco Rubio was a main target last week and saw Trump twist the truth about his immigration position to warn voters that the senator is \u201ctotally in favor of amnesty.\u201d\n\nThen there are the seemingly small falsehoods, piled one atop another. Trump misstates the timing of things \u2013 an omnibus spending bill, for example, was called \u201cthe craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen six weeks ago\u201d when in fact it was a spending package passed in December. He exaggerates polls and rankings of other things \u2013 such as his position among Hispanics and how he performs in Wall Street Journal polls. He even claims ownership of a successful winery that denies any ownership tie to the GOP front-runner.\n\nThat Trump so frequently ventures so far from the truth perhaps shouldn\u2019t surprise given how much of his campaign is unorthodox. Offensive barbs against Muslims, Mexicans, women and people with disabilities would have quickly sunk the fortunes of other White House candidates but they haven\u2019t hurt the real estate mogul\u2019s standing in the polls, or, more importantly, with Republican voters.\n\nCertainly, many politicians stretch the truth \u2013 the practice of political fact-checking began long before the 2016 election cycle. But none so much as Trump. These untruths \u2013 strung together as they are in all of his speeches \u2013 have helped drive one of the most rapid ascents in modern presidential campaign history. Stephen Colbert once invented a word to define the political discourse of the time. \u201cTruthiness,\u201d the comedian declared on his debut episode in 2005, was the truth as felt in one\u2019s heart and gut, not what was written up in reference books. A decade later, Trump has taken the idea and run (for president) with it.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to attempts to get comment for this story or these individual instances of inaccuracies.\n\nHere\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s run-down of a week in the life of a Donald Trump fact-check:\n\n***\n\n\u201cWE DON\u2019T WIN ANYMORE\u201d: TRADE AND ECONOMICS\n\n\u201c$500 billion a year trade deficit with China.\u201d (March 7 rally in Concord, N.C., and at least four other times last week)\n\nThat\u2019s overstating the case by $134 billion. The imbalance peaked at $366 billion in 2015.\n\n\u201cYou have Japan, where the cars come in by the hundreds of thousands, they pour off the boats. ... [W]e send them like nothing. We send them nothing, by comparison, nothing.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C. and at least one other time)\n\nThe United States exported $62 billion worth of goods to Japan last year.\n\n\u201cWe have a trade deficit with Japan of over $100 billion a year.\u201d (March 8 victory press conference in Jupiter, Fla. and at least one other time)\n\nThe trade deficit with Japan in 2015 was about $69 billion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re losing our jobs and the politicians don\u2019t tell you that.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C.)\n\nPoliticians from both parties rail against unemployment and outsourcing. For example, the Obama White House in 2012 put out a fact sheet with \u201coutsourcing\u201d in the title.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t win at trade. We lose to everybody at trade. Trade we lose to everybody.\u201d (March 11 in St. Louis)\n\nIn 2015, the U.S. had trade surpluses with a number of countries including Hong Kong, the Netherlands, the UAE and Australia.\n\n\u201cRemember we used to have Made in the USA, right? When was the last time you\u2019ve seen it? You don\u2019t see that anymore. You don\u2019t see that anymore.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C.)\n\nThe U.S. Economics and Statistics Administration authored a report called \u201cWhat Is Made In America?\u201d in 2014 that found that U.S. manufacturers sold $4.4 trillion of goods that classify as \u201cMade in the U.S.A.\u201d Manufacturing contributes $2.17 trillion to the U.S. economy and employs 12.33 million Americans.\n\n\u201cWe have lousy health-care, where it\u2019s going up 35, 45, 55 percent.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C.)\n\nPremiums rose by an average of 5.8 percent a year since Obama took office, compared to 13.2 percent in the nine years prior, Politifact found in October.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the jobs reports, which are totally phony, because if you stop looking for a job you are essentially considered employed.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C.)\n\nIn the way the unemployment rate is calculated, discouraged workers who give up on looking for a job leave the workforce so they don\u2019t count toward unemployment, but they don\u2019t count as employed either.\n\n\u201cI know there are some companies where the people were full time for 25 years. Now they\u2019re part-timers and they go out and get another job, and that has to do solely with Obamacare.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C. and at least one other time)\n\nThere are many reasons Americans tend to change jobs more often and work on a part-time basis more than they used to, and the trend predates Obamacare.\n\n***\n\n\u201cLIKE SWISS CHEESE\u201d: IMMIGRATION\n\n\u201cThe migration, they\u2019re coming across. Obama wants to bring thousands and thousands of people in. He has no idea who they are.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C. and at least one other time)\n\nNo one has suggested accepting refugees without screening them for security, a process that refugee advocates currently call daunting and far too time consuming.\n\nAbout Rubio: \u201cHe\u2019s totally in favor of amnesty.\u201d (March 9 in Fayetteville, N.C.)\n\nRubio opposed amnesty while running for Senate but, in an effort to draft compromise legislation, co-sponsored a bill that included a path to citizenship. That\u2019s not the same as blanket amnesty, he said in the Jan. 28 debate.\n\n\u201cReally they\u2019ve shut Christianity down.\u201d (March 7 in Madison, Miss.)\n\nSeven in 10 Americans identify as Christian, according to Pew.\n\n***\n\n\u201cSELF-FUNDING\u201d: CAMPAIGN FINANCE\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent the least money and I\u2019m by far number 1. So I\u2019ve spent the least.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C.)\n\nAs of Jan. 31, Trump\u2019s campaign had spent $23.9 million, more than John Kasich\u2019s campaign, which has spent $7.2 million, or $19.5 million if you include outside groups supporting him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m self-funding my campaign.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C., and at least two other times)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not taking money. ... I\u2019m not taking. I spent a lot of money. I don\u2019t take.\u201d (March 7 in Madison, Miss.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to take any money. I don\u2019t want any money. ... You know, I\u2019ve self-funded my campaign. ... Right now, I\u2019m into, you would know better than me, maybe $30 million, maybe more.\u201d (March 11 press conference in Palm Beach)\n\nThere\u2019s a big blue \u201cDONATE\u201d button in the top right corner of his campaign website. As of Jan. 31, his campaign had accepted $7.5 million from donors not named Donald J. Trump. Trump gave his campaign only $250,318. He lent another $17.5 million, but that\u2019s repayable at any time until shortly after the election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already in for $30 million cash.\u201d (March 7 in Madison, Miss.)\n\nNot unless he\u2019s made a lot more contributions since Jan. 31. As of then he had only contributed $250,318, plus the loan of $17.5 million.\n\n\u201cI think I have $50 million of negative ads against me in Florida. $50 million. Somebody said $50 million.\u201d (March 7 in Madison, Miss.)\n\nAs of last Friday, outside groups had spent $15 million in Florida.\n\n\u201cSo many horrible, horrible things said about me in one week. $38 million worth of horrible lies.\u201d (March 8 in Jupiter, Fla.)\n\nEvery Republican dollar not spent by Trump on TV and radio from March 1 through 7 comes to $10.57 million, according to The Tracking Firm, a service that monitors media buys. And not all of that money was negative against Trump.\n\n\u201cHow many times do you think Marco and Ted and all of them were calling their super PAC? Is that right? It\u2019s called life. ... They talk to their super PAC. They\u2019re not supposed to but that\u2019s the way life works.\u201d (March 8 in Jupiter, Fla.)\n\nTrump provided no evidence that Rubio and Cruz talk to their super PACs. Candidates coordinating with super PACs is against the law; Trump has not filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election Commission.\n\n\u201cIn New Hampshire, as an example, I spent $1.5 million and somebody else spent $48 million. I was one, the other person was number five.\u201d (March 8 in Jupiter, Fla.)\n\nTrump actually spent $3.1 million in New Hampshire, not $1.5 million, according to Politifact. The Bush campaign and super PAC actually spent $36 million in the state, not $48 million. Bush also came in fourth in New Hampshire, not fifth.\n\n\u201cCountries have lobbyists also. They have lobbyists. They have their donors.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C.)\n\nForeign countries can and do hire representatives in Washington, registered under the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act. But foreign nationals are not allowed to contribute to political campaigns.\n\n***\n\n\u201cNASTY GUY\u201d: ATTACKING HIS RIVALS\n\n\u201cI have not even focused on Hillary yet. ... I haven\u2019t even started with her other than four weeks ago.\u201d (March 8 in Jupiter, Fla.)\n\nMonths ago, in December, Trump said Clinton\u2019s bathroom break during a Democratic debate was \u201cdisgusting\u201d and Barack Obama \u201cschlonged\u201d her in the 2008 primaries.\n\n\u201cLittle Marco Rubio. You know, he\u2019s a no-show in the U.S. Senate. He never goes to vote.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C.)\n\nRubio missed 229 of 1,517 votes between January 2011 and March 2016, according to GovTrack.us. That\u2019s 15 percent. The median record for missed votes for senators currently serving is 1.7 percent.\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t that funny last night when Cruz said, \u2018I\u2019m the only one that can beat Donald Trump. I have demonstrated that I can beat him. I won five states.\u2019\u201d (March 11 in St. Louis)\n\nCruz correctly stated he won eight states, not five, according to the debate transcript.\n\n\u201cOhio got lucky because they struck oil. And the budget of Ohio went up more than any budget in the entire United States. Higher than any budget.\u201d (March 11 press conference in Palm Beach)\n\nOhio\u2019s budget increased from $55.9 billion in 2010 to $64 billion in 2015. North Dakota\u2019s increased more in percentage terms, and New York\u2019s in dollar terms, according to data from the National Association of State Budget Officers.\n\n***\n\n\u201cEVERYBODY LIKES ME\u201d: POLLS\n\n\u201cOne of the polls just came out, and a number of them have just come out. I\u2019m beating Hillary Clinton quite easily, thank you.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C. and at least one other time)\n\nTrump is likely referring to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll from mid-February, which showed him two points ahead of Clinton. A clear majority of other polls show she would beat him.\n\n\u201cAfter Paris, all of a sudden it started changing. We started getting polls in. And everybody liked Trump from the standpoint of ISIS, from the standpoint of the military.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C. and at least one other time)\n\nAfter the Paris attacks, fewer than half (42 percent) of GOP respondents in a Washington Post-ABC poll said Trump was the best candidate to best handle the threat of terrorism.\n\n\u201cThey do a poll in South Carolina, [Lindsey Graham] endorses somebody else and the poll in South Carolina has me at 47.\u201d (March 8 in Jupiter, Fla.)\n\nTrump never topped 42 percent in all the polls collected by Real Clear Politics and won the state with 32.5 percent of the vote.\n\n\u201cUpstate New York I poll higher than anybody ever.\u201d (March 8 in Jupiter, Fla.)\n\nHillary Clinton would beat Trump 56 percent to 33 percent in upstate New York, according to a recent Siena College poll. The same poll found that the only region in New York he would win is by 5 points in the state\u2019s suburban areas.\n\n\u201cThey [the WSJ/NBC poll] had me practically dying in South Carolina the day before. ... And it looked like I was really in trouble and then I won in a landslide. The poll was wrong.\u201d (March 8 in Jupiter, Fla.)\n\nThe last South Carolina NBC/WSJ poll had Trump at 28 percent versus Cruz at 23 percent. A national WSJ/NBC poll around the same time had Cruz ahead of Trump 28 percent to 26 percent.\n\n\u201cThen all of a sudden they [WSJ/NBC] come up with this poll that was very close. They put it on the front-page of the Wall Street Journal, front-page. They never do that. ... I never do well in the Wall Street Journal polls; it\u2019s set against me.\u201d (March 11 in St. Louis)\n\nThe Journal routinely covers polls on its front page, and Trump does well in many of them. For example, a headline from mid-January reads: \u201cPoll: Donald Trump Widens His Lead in Republican Presidential Race\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re winning every poll with the Hispanics.\u201d (March 9 in Fayetteville, N.C.)\n\nA Washington Post-Univision poll in February found that 8 in 10 registered Hispanic voters viewed Trump unfavorably.\n\n***\n\n\u201cNOBODY IS GOING TO MESS WITH US\u201d: SECURITY\n\n\u201cWe have tremendous problems with crime and other things.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C.)\n\nCrime rates have declined dramatically since the 1990s and remain at historically low levels.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Iran deal, where we give a terror nation $150 billion\u201d and \u201cgot nothing\u201d. (March 11 in St. Louis and March 7 in Madison, Miss.)\n\nCredible estimates vary for the value of sanctions relief to Iran, topping out at $100 billion. But it\u2019s false to suggest the U.S. gains nothing from the deal. Iran agreed to ship uranium out of the country, dismantle two-thirds of its centrifuges and accept rigorous inspections.\n\n\u201cThe Gulf states aren\u2019t spending. The Gulf states have so much money, they\u2019re not spending anything. By the way, they\u2019re not taking anybody, they\u2019re not taking, they\u2019re not spending.\u201d (March 7 rally in Madison, Miss.)\n\nAt a February London aid conference, Gulf states pledged at least $537 million to help mitigate the Syrian crisis, and the United Arab Emirates has accepted more than 100,000 Syrian nationals since the civil war began in 2011.\n\nISIS drowns \u201cpeople in these massive steel cages where 40, 50, 60 people they dump it and they pull it up half an hour later with 50 people dead.\u201d (March 9 in Fayetteville, N.C.)\n\nLast June, ISIS released video of the group drowning five Iraqis in a cage. There are no reports of 40 to 60 victims.\n\n\u201cEight weeks ago, they signed a budget that is so bad. It funds ISIS.\u201d (March 9 in Fayetteville, N.C.)\n\nThe omnibus spending bill, passed in December, is not strictly a budget, and it\u2019s not clear what part of it Trump thinks gives money to ISIS. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for a reference on this specific claim.\n\n***\n\n\u201cBIGGEST,\u201d \u201cBEST,\u201d \u201cMOST BEAUTIFUL\u201d: PERSONAL BOASTS\n\n\u201cIt turned out I\u2019m much richer than people think.\u201d (March 7 in Madison, Miss.)\n\nTrump says he\u2019s worth more than $10 billion. Forbes Magazine says he\u2019s worth $4.5 billion. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimated his net worth at $2.9 billion.\n\n\u201cBy the way, four times on the cover of Time Magazine over the last number of months. ... I think I was on the cover of Time twice over 30 years and now I think I\u2019ve been almost, I think it\u2019s four times in the last three or four months.\u201d (March 7 in Concord, N.C.)\n\n\u201cIt is a movement. It\u2019s been covered on Time magazine covers many many times.\u201d (March 11 in St. Louis)\n\nTrump has been on the cover of Time three times since he started running for president nine months ago, not four times over the last three or four months. Before his presidential run, he was on the cover just once, in 1989, not twice. In the last four months, he\u2019s been on the cover twice, not three times.\n\n\u201cI built an unbelievable, some of the greatest assets in the world, very little debt, tremendous cash flow, tremendous. ... Almost all of my businesses work.\u201d (March 7 in Madison, Miss. and at least one other time)\n\nFour of Trump\u2019s companies have declared bankruptcy, meaning they could not repay their debts. For example, the Trump Plaza Hotel declared bankruptcy in 1992 with $550 million in debt. The Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy in 2004 carrying an estimated $1.8 billion in debt. In December 2008, Trump Entertainment Resorts couldn\u2019t pay a $53.1 million interest payment for a bond.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t settle lawsuits. ... I don\u2019t do it.\u201d (March 8 in Jupiter, Fla.)\n\nIn 2013, Trump settled with condo buyers who had sued over a project in Baja California.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the largest winery on the East Coast. I own it 100 percent. No mortgage. No debt. You can all check. You have to go check the records, folks. In fact, the press, I\u2019m asking you, please check.\u201d (March 8 in Jupiter, Fla.)\n\nTrump Winery in Charlottesville is not the largest vineyard or winery on the East Coast, according to the National Association of American Wineries.\n\nAnd the winery\u2019s own website denies that Trump owns it. \u201cTrump Winery is a registered trade name of Eric Trump Wine Manufacturing LLC, which is not owned, managed or affiliated with Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their affiliates.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe make the finest wine. As good a wine as you can get anywhere in the world.\u201d (March 8 in Jupiter, Fla.)\n\nNone of the wines from Trump Winery made the top 100 list of the best wines in 2015 as ranked by Wine Spectator Magazine. Looking at just Virginia wines, none of Trump\u2019s wines were finalists in the flagship 2016 Governors\u2019 Cup.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing from virtually everybody in the Republican Party and they\u2019re congratulating me and they\u2019re saying, we\u2019re going to get together.\u201d (March 11 in Palm Beach)\n\nThere are many Republicans who are not engaging with Trump or congratulating him.\n\n***\n\n\u201cABSOLUTE SLEAZE\u201d: THE PRESS\n\n\u201cThe only way, now everybody\u2019s talking about how massive these crowds are, the only way they find out about the crowds, the only way is with the protestors.\u201d (March 9 in Fayetteville, N.C.)\n\nThe press has long noted the size of Trump\u2019s audiences with or without protestors. For example, last August, CNN covered Trump\u2019s crowd of 30,000 at an Alabama football stadium.\n\n\n\nDaniel Lippman is associate editor for states and a reporter for Politico, working on Politico Playbook and contributing to political coverage.\n\nDarren Samuelsohn is a senior policy reporter for Politico.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "POLITICO Magazine subjected the GOP frontrunner to our fact-checking process.
