House Speaker Steve Crisafulli is scheduled to hold a similar question-and-answer session with news media next Friday.\n\nBut the issue that caused the last Session to implode without a state budget \u2013 health care funding \u2013 is still at play.\n\nFlorida uses a pot of local and federal cash, called the Low Income Pool (LIP), to give to hospitals as reimbursement for the unpaid care they provide to indigent patients.\n\nBut the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) cut its contribution by $1 billion this year, which forced lawmakers to use more than $400 million in state money to help \u201cbackfill\u201d the decreases.\n\nNext year CMS has promised to cut an additional $400 million as it follows through with a planned phaseout of the pool.\n\nThe feds want to nudge Florida into expanding Medicaid to more poor and working poor under the Affordable Care Act, a move staunchly opposed by the House\u2019s GOP leadership.\n\n\u201cThe question next is, do we put more general revenue in? Do we look at the (funding) formulas?\u201d said Gardiner, an Orlando hospital executive.\n\nHe said he has asked state Sen. Rene Garcia, who chairs the Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, to start running numbers early.\n\n\u201cYou have to run all these models; it\u2019s a very detailed, technical process to know what the reimbursements should be,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we eventually do, I think it\u2019s too early to tell. You have to look at what areas will have increased spending \u2026 We\u2019re going to have to make some decisions.\u201d\n\nHe also mentioned other health care topics, such as a move to eliminate \u201ccertificates of need\u201d from the hospital construction and expansion process.\n\nThe process requires hospitals to show state regulators there\u2019s a need in the community before they can build a new facility or expand an existing one.\n\nIt also applies to adding specialty treatment programs, such as organ transplants. Legislation for next year already has cleared some committees.\n\n\u201cWe will take them very, very seriously,\u201d Gardiner said. \u201cThe Senate will be very active on health care.\u201d\n\nThe House and the Senate feuded with each other earlier this year about Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, with the Senate largely in favor.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Senate President Andy Gardiner says he expects a productive 2016 Legislative Session without the turmoil that fractured last session.
