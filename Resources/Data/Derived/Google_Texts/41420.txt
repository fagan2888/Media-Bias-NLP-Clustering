Anemone Hill will be closed starting Monday and continuing through next spring as Boulder's Open Space and Mountain Parks department begins a project that will extend the Anemone Trail west and restore vegetation to many undesignated trails that have developed in the area, city officials said.



The completed trail project will provided about 3.2 miles of designated trail access for hikers and equestrians along the city's mountain backdrop. It will also restore natives grasses, flowers and other plants to more than nine miles of "unsustainable" social trails that crisscross the area.



To protect visitors and allow time for the plants to establish themselves, the Anemone Trail area will be closed until the completion of the project, which is scheduled for April 2015. When the area reopens, visitors will be required to stay on the designated trail.



The Anemone Trail project and closure is part of the West Trail Study Area management plan approved by the City Council in 2011.
