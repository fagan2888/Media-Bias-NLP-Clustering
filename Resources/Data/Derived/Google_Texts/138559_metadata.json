CNBC's Phil Han reports.\n\nThousands of Chinese coal miners have taken to the streets in a city near the Siberian border to protest against unpaid wages, in the first direct challenge to Beijing's plan for orderly downsizing and job cuts in the state-owned coal sector.\n\nBeijing has said it would lay aside Rmb100bn ($15.4bn) to \"resettle\" coal and steel workers as part of a plan to cut unproductive capacity in both sectors, but local governments and the companies themselves are supposed to bear a portion of the costs.\n\nSlowing Chinese growth and the end of the commodities supercycle have turned overcapacity into a pressing economic issue for Beijing. Data published this weekend showed that in the first two months of this year, Chinese production of thermal coal and steel both fell 6 per cent while output of metallurgical, or coking, coal \u2014 the steel ingredient produced by the protesting miners \u2014 dropped 10 per cent.\n\nMiners at state-owned Shuangyashan Mine, one of four mines that make up ailing Longmay Coal, began a third day of protests holding banners that read \"We want to eat, we want our wages\" and \"Lu Hao lies with his eyes open\" referring Mr Lu, the provincial governor of Heilongjiang province.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "partnerstory", "description": "Chinese coal miners have taken to the streets in a city near the Siberian border to protest against unpaid wages, the Financial Times reports.", "author": "Lucy Hornby", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Chinese coal miners have taken to the streets in a city near the Siberian border to protest against unpaid wages, the FT reports.", "title": "Miners' protest the first big challenge to China job cuts", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/13/china-coal-protests-highlight-overcapacity-tensions.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/12/11/103235893-GettyImages-500863138.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chinese coal miners have taken to the streets in a city near the Siberian border to protest against unpaid wages, the FT reports.", "title": "China coal protests highlight overcapacity tensions", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/13/china-coal-protests-highlight-overcapacity-tensions.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/12/11/103235893-GettyImages-500863138.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Commodities, China, Politics, Business, Coal and Consumable Fuels, Economy, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-03-13T23:21:03-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Commodities", "modified_time": "2016-03-14T01:08:05-0400", "tag": "Economy"}, "pageNodeId": 103465652, "news_keywords": "Thousands of Chinese coal workers protest unpaid wages, layoffs, commodities, pay"}, "article_summary": "Thousands of miners took to the streets in China to protest over not being paid and job cuts.\nSlowing Chinese growth and the end of the commodities supercycle have turned overcapacity into a pressing economic issue for Beijing.\nThousands of Chinese coal miners have taken to the streets in a city near the Siberian border to protest against unpaid wages, in the first direct challenge to Beijing's plan for orderly downsizing and job cuts in the state-owned coal sector.\nData published this weekend showed that in the first two months of this year, Chinese production of thermal coal and steel both fell 6 per cent while output of metallurgical, or coking, coal \u2014 the steel ingredient produced by the protesting miners \u2014 dropped 10 per cent.\nMiners at state-owned Shuangyashan Mine, one of four mines that make up ailing Longmay Coal, began a third day of protests holding banners that read \"We want to eat, we want our wages\" and \"Lu Hao lies with his eyes open\" referring Mr Lu, the provincial governor of Heilongjiang province."}
