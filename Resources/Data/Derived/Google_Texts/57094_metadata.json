After several months of work, the Obama administration declared the problems fixed in early 2014, though technical difficulties have continued to plague it and several of the state-based exchanges also set up as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe inspector general examined 60 contracts signed by CMS for the online health insurance site and conducted interviews with \u201chigh level\u201d staff at CMS and HHS about the contracting process.\n\nIn two of those contracts \u2014 including the $93 million contract signed with CGI Federal, the firm responsible for several major elements of the Obamacare federal exchange \u2014 CMS did not conduct a part performance review of their work.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that CMS conduct comprehensive reviews of companies\u2019 past performance to ensure that it contracts with reliable companies,\u201d the inspector general concluded.\n\nHad they done so, CMS may have discovered CGI Federal had essentially been fired by the provincial government in Ontario, Canada, after \u201cthe firm missed three years of deadlines and failed to deliver the province\u2019s flagship online medical registry,\u201d as the Washington Examiner reported in 2013.\n\nAnd had they known about that history, CMS might have done a better job of writing the contract to ensure contractors like CGI Federal would pay for cost overruns.\n\nInstead, five of six \u201ckey contracts\u201d handed out by the department were written on a so-called \u201ccost reimbursement\u201d basis, meaning the government \u2014 ultimately, taxpayers \u2014 would cover any unexpected expenses.\n\n\u201cCMS\u2019s choice of contract type for certain key contracts resulted in the government shouldering the risk for cost increases,\u201d the inspector general concluded.\n\nThose six contracts were initially supposed to cost $464 million. By early 2014, when the inspector general began his review, the cost had ballooned to more than $820 million.\n\nThe contract with CGI Federal tripled during that period, from $58 million to $207 million, the inspector general reported.\n\nOnly two of those six \u201ckey contracts\u201d were reviewed by CMS\u2019 Contract Review Board before they were awarded.\n\n\u201cAlthough the Federal Marketplace was an unprecedented project with unique challenges, the experience of contracting for the Federal Marketplace has broader implications for Federal contracting,\u201d the inspector general wrote. \u201cThe issues raised in this report demonstrate the need for HHS and CMS to make changes to strengthen their contracting processes.\u201d\n\nIn a response to the report, CMS agreed to shut the barn door after the cows had already escaped.\n\nEllen Murray, assistant secretary for financial resources for CMS, wrote that both HHS and CMS were working to implement changes based on the inspector general\u2019s findings.\n\n\u201cCMS is enforcing a strict governance structure for contracts and is training a strong acquisition workforce,\u201d Murray wrote. \u201cThese efforts are yielding positive results.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services failed to conduct background checks on prior work by companies awarded many of the Obamacare contracts and failed to require those same companies to be accountable for cost overruns, leaving taxpayers on the hook instead.", "title": "Audit: HHS failure to screen Obamacare contract recipients cost taxpayers $400M - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/HeathcareGov.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-23T09:53:34+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/194839/obamacare-contracts-cost-taxpayers/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Accountability", "tag": "ACA,Affordable Care Act,CGI Federal,CMS,contracts,federal exchange,Federal Government,Health Care,Heath and Human Services,HHS,Obama,ObamaCare", "published_time": "2015-01-23T07:38:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-23T09:53:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services failed to conduct background checks on prior work by companies awarded many of the Obamacare contracts and failed to require those same companies to be accountable for cost overruns, leaving taxpayers on the hook instead.", "title": "Audit: HHS failure to screen Obamacare contract recipients cost taxpayers $400M - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/HeathcareGov.jpg"}, "creator": "@ericboehm87", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "The Department of Health and Human Services failed to conduct background checks on prior work by companies awarded many of the Obamacare contracts and failed to require those same companies to be accountable for cost overruns, leaving taxpayers on the hook instead."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdfd0\"", "article_summary": "The contract with CGI Federal tripled during that period, from $58 million to $207 million, the inspector general reported.\nOnly two of those six \u201ckey contracts\u201d were reviewed by CMS\u2019 Contract Review Board before they were awarded.\nBy early 2014, when the inspector general began his review, the cost had ballooned to more than $820 million.\n\u201cCMS\u2019s choice of contract type for certain key contracts resulted in the government shouldering the risk for cost increases,\u201d the inspector general concluded.\n\u201cAlthough the Federal Marketplace was an unprecedented project with unique challenges, the experience of contracting for the Federal Marketplace has broader implications for Federal contracting,\u201d the inspector general wrote."}
