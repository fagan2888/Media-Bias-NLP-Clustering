In a note to clients last month, analysts at UBS (UBS) said Walgreens\u2019 tax rate was expected to be 37.5% compared with Boots\u2019 20%. An inversion, they said, could increase earnings per share by 75%.\n\nYet, CtW is not as optimistic. Its chief executive, Dieter Waizenegger, said inversion would be \u201cdetrimental to the interests of long-term shareholders,\u201d especially since most of them are U.S.-based. The investor says reincorporation carries risk of removal from the S&P 500 and other stock indices, citing Ace and Transocean after their respective moves to Switzerland.\n\nMore On This... Philip Morris: 'More Work' Needed to Stop Child Labor in Tobacco Trade\n\n\"We believe that a reincorporation overseas would be decidedly against the interests of Walgreen shareholders, who are overwhelmingly U.S-based, and we strongly urge the company to commit to remaining in the U.S.,\" Waizenegger said.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nCtW alleges that inversion would be a \"step backwards\" for Walgreen's corporate governance, citing the differences between U.S. and Swiss law, and pointing to the fact that Swiss investors typically have \"relatively limited rights\" with respect to voting on non-routine matters.\n\nWalgreen has not yet announced any plans for an inversion. A Walgreen spokesperson last month said that the company regularly meets with its investors and welcomes their input. It declined to comment on Tuesday.\n\nIts shares in recent trade were down 1.3% to $68.69, following a broader market slide.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 09:28:39 EST",
