Bush\u2019s first term.)\n\nThe latest ruling came after months of increasing political pressure by Reid, who in late May organized a letter signed by 50 Senate Democrats urging the team to change its name because it is supposedly offensive to Native Americans.\n\nTo give an idea of the depth of Reid\u2019s sincerity, the letter was not circulated among Senate Republicans, according to the New York Times, meaning the whole exercise is a transparent game of politics.\n\nIn short, because the Obama administration has presided over a moribund economy, thanks in no small part to Reid\u2019s assistance and the passage of the American albatross known as Obamacare, Reid\u2019s Democrats are in serious danger of losing the Senate this year \u2013 which means Reid loses his powerful post.\n\nSo he\u2019s pulling out every stop to ensure that doesn\u2019t happen, including incessant pandering to minority groups with gambits like his sudden loathing for the name of a team that has been there since Reid first arrived in Washington almost three decades ago.\n\nAccording to USA Today, the decision was made by the ostensibly independent Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, an ostensibly independent administrative group within the U.S. Patent Office.\n\nBut if the IRS scandal proves anything, it\u2019s that there\u2019s no such thing as a non-political arm of the administrative state in the Age of Obama.\n\nReid\u2019s statements after the ruling\u2019s announcement have the air of the gloating despot he\u2019s spent years becoming \u2013 with the help of millions of deluded Democratic voters who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re asking for.\n\n\u201cThe writing\u2019s on the wall,\u201d Reid said, according to the Washington Times.\n\n\u201cDan Snyder may be the last person in the world to realize this but it\u2019s just a matter of time until he\u2019s forced to change and do the right thing.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the problem, as always for liberals. When they dismantle the rule of law, when the Redskins can be \u201cforced\u201d to do the right thing, the next Senate majority leader might have different ideas of what the right thing is.\n\nWill the United Negro College Fund lose its trademark under a different regime? Is the NAACP\u2019s trademark secure?\n\nOnly Harry Reid knows for sure \u2013 this year.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s five-year assault on the rule of law advanced on a new front Wednesday when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office revoked six trademarks of the Washington Redskins because Harry Reid doesn\u2019t want to lose his majority leader office.
