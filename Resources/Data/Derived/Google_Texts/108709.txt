Teams of veterans are racing from the Florida Keys to New York City on Jet Skis to raise money for organizations helping veterans and their families.

The Never Quit Challenge began early Friday in Key West. Six teams are using personal watercraft to travel 1,600 miles to the finish line in New York by September 11th.

According to The Miami Herald, singer Gloria Estefan greeted the teams when they arrived on Virginia Key just off downtown Miami on Friday evening. After completing 164 miles on their first day, the teams planned to average 266 miles a day for the rest of their journey.

The challenge was started by Shawn Alladio, whose company K38 Water Safety teaches people how to operate and perform rescues with personal watercraft.
