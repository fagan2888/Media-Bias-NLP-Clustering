Furthering his television presence, Khaled will appear on The Ellen DeGeneres Show later today (Mar. 9) to talk about the positive vibes he emanates though Snapchat and all of social media.\n\nDressed like an iced out Tony Soprano, Khaled offers his usual televised rhetoric, summarizing his many music making roles, saying, \u201cI\u2019m like the hip-hop Quincy Jones. But I\u2019m a CEO, too. I\u2019m an entrepreneur. I\u2019m a young mogul. I\u2019m blessed.\u201d\n\nWhile everyone is aware of Khaled\u2019s many catchphrases, the obvious kick Ellen gets from having him on adds new energy into the ongoing Khaled media storm. \u201cPlease, Ellen, stay away from them,\u201d he advises her, and she seems eager to obey. The talk show host can\u2019t help but laugh every time Khaled asks her if she knows what he\u2019s saying, and is especially giddy when Khaled explains his love of breakfast as, \u201cThey don\u2019t want me to enjoy it, so what I do is I make sure I enjoy it so amazingly.\u201d\n\nKhaled also speaks of his love of apples, his organic process of creating social content and sums up his outlook as, \u201cI\u2019m just grateful for any opportunity that I can get to take my career and my life and also inspire the young world to the next level.\u201d\n\nKhaled\u2019s recent reign as King of Snapchat also includes a letter from President Barack Obama thanking him for his support of the Affordable Care Act as well as starring on the cover of a recent issue of Bloomberg Businessweek. Peep both accolades below, with Khaled\u2019s Ellen spot up top. The Khaled-guested episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show will air on NBC at 4 p.m. EST.\n\nObama wrote a letter to @djkhaled A photo posted by XXL (@xxl) on Mar 9, 2016 at 4:47am PST\n\nTears of joy !
