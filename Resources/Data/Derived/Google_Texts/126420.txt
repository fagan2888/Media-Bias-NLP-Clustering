Authorities in Racine County are searching for a man suspected of firing a gun at a sheriff's deputy in a grocery store parking lot in Union Grove Sunday.

Sheriff Christopher Schmaling said the deputy was lucky he was not hit by the gunfire.

The suspect was identified as Stantavious Armond Sillas, 20, who ran away after the incident in the parking lot. Dozens of law-enforcement officers were searching for Sillas Sunday night.

The shots were fired in the parking lot of Piggly Wiggly in Union Grove, according to Fox6 News, after a man allegedly abducted a woman from a nearby rehabilitation center. The woman was unharmed. The grocery store was on lockdown for two hours.

Residents in the Union Grove area have been asked to be on alert and to contact authorities at (262) 886-2300 if they see anyone or anything suspicious. The Sheriff's Department warned residents via a Facebook post to stay in their homes because Sillas is considered to be armed and dangerous.

Some media outlets tweeted photos showing authorities stationed along roads in the area.
