As the company has expanded and moved to Branchburg into a 15,000-square-foot facility, including a 5,000-square-foot showroom, to provide a better home remodeling experience for its customers, so have they added and promoted staff to enhance the overall customer experience, the company announced in a news release.\n\nSomerville Aluminum has promoted the following team members to Vice President of their respective divisions:\n\n\u2022Joe Kalnas, Outdoor Living\n\n\u2022Frank Herbert, Production\n\n\u2022Dolores Sonia, Kitchens & Baths.\n\n\"We have been very fortunate as a company to have very professional, knowledgeable and loyal members of the Somerville Aluminum team,\" said Gary Shiman, co-owner and executive vice president of Somerville Aluminum. \"We would not be where we are today without their dedication and hard work.
