Christie acknowledged Boehner’s public service as being “outstanding,” but said that Congress needed a reset “really badly” because the House Republicans has not “delivered.”

“Listen, it’s a reset down in Congress in a Congress that needs a reset really badly. You know, first of all, I think the Speaker has been an outstanding public servant over the last 25 years in Congress,” Christie explained. “But this Congress needs a reset. The American people I think are really disappointed. They gave our party majorities in both houses and we have not delivered some of the things that we need to deliver. so this would be an appropriate time for the House Republicans to take a look at themselves and decide what they want to stand for for the rest of this term.”
