Brooks snapped a photo and emailed it to her doctor, who asked to see her as soon as possible. But she couldn\u2019t leave work, so her doctor and a staffer paid her an on-the-job visit, wrote her a prescription and outlined her care for the next 48 hours.\n\n\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThey even asked if I had a tetanus shot recently. Because if not, they would bring one with them.\u201d\n\nBrooks is a member of the recently established Turntable Health, a membership-based primary care provider she found through an insurance plan she purchased on the Nevada Health Co-Op. Brooks\u2019 two-pronged coverage includes Turntable, which opened a 7,000-square-foot medical office in December in downtown Las Vegas, and separate catastrophic\n\ncare. Brooks wouldn\u2019t divulge the monthly cost of her Neighborhood VIP Gold insurance plan, but the San Francisco transplant said so far, Turntable\u2019s service has been excellent, and the plan is about $300 a month less than what she paid for previous coverage.\n\nTurntable is a concierge-style, membership-based primary care practice, and partnering with the co-op is an example of the evolution taking place in health care nationwide as President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act takes effect.\n\nBrooks doesn\u2019t pay Turntable\u2019s $80 monthly fee out of pocket; the provider negotiated a flat rate to be paid by the co-op when customers pay their premiums.\n\nTurntable Health, a newcomer among membership-based practices in the valley, has 400 patients, about a third of whom enrolled through the co-op. It offers unlimited access to a primary care physician (even through text, email or Skype) and his or her team. The team also includes a health advocate, social worker and nurse, and the program offers yoga, cooking, meditation and other health education classes at 701 Bridger Ave.\n\nIts investors are Zappos founder Tony Hsieh and Dr. Zubin Damania, who was a primary care physician at Stanford University Medical Center for a decade before moving to Las Vegas a couple of years ago.\n\nDamania said 10 years laboring under the fee-for-service structure by which insurance companies pay doctors left him a \u201cdisconnected, burned-out zombie.\u201d Now, with Turntable, the focus is on wellness, and that, he said, will ultimately reduce hospital visits and the overall cost of patient care.\n\nIn its first four months, Damania said patient surveys show a 97 percent positive rating.\n\nPotential to grow\n\nDamania admits that co-op enrollees can help drive Turntable\u2019s growth. Turntable currently has two salaried physicians. His goal is to grow to 5,000 patients and expand into the suburbs. Damania expects to need four physicians and more support staff to maintain the quality of care when Turntable hits its growth goal.\n\nAnother relative newcomer in membership-based primary care medicine in Las Vegas has taken an opposite approach \u2014 it hasn\u2019t partnered with Obamacare exchanges or co-ops \u2014 yet.\n\nMedLion Management, whose direct primary care model is similar to Turntable\u2019s and costs $59 per month, has grown to 5,000 patients in Nevada since opening its doors a year ago.\n\nCEO Dr. Samir Qamar said about 75 percent of its business comes as a tie-in with insurance plans similar to those offered by the Nevada Health Co-Op, but they are employer-sponsored.\n\n\u201cWe thought because the rollout for exchanges was so shaky, we wanted to take a big step back and let the dust settle,\u201d Qamar said.\n\nMedLion operates in almost a dozen states, with 15 doctors in nine Nevada locations, growing its practice through the suburbs first. It will likely add a downtown clinic this year.\n\nQamar and Damania agree that their business model is poised for growth.\n\nQamar said more plans are being created for business owners with 50 or more employees in anticipation of the Jan. 1, 2015, compliance deadline mandated by the Affordable Care Act. By then, these employers will need to offer some form of insurance to employees, and it\u2019s likely plans with membership-based primary care coupled with catastrophic care will be popular, Qamar said.\n\nMaintaining the personal touch\n\nCan a membership-based, primary care practice offering concierge-style services like Turntable keep up its availability to and personal treatment of its patients as its enrollment grows and as it expands into new business models?\n\nMDVIP, a long-time concierge-like practice with a national reach and nine affiliate doctors in Nevada, has a 600-member cap for doctors in its network. Eschewing the concierge label, the model is described as a \u201cpersonalized and preventive care practice\u201d by one local MDVIP physician, Dr. Michael Gunter.\n\nAs with Turntable and MedLion, patients have increased access to their primary care doctors. MDVIP, owned by Procter and Gamble, also emphasizes a wellness plan and other perks such as affiliations with centers of excellence, including UCLA and MD Anderson Cancer Centers. Members pay between $1,500 and $1,800 per year.\n\nDamania emphasized that the ability to \u201cleverage the team\u201d is key to maintaining the quality of care as Turntable grows.\n\nQamar was slightly skeptical, however.\n\n\u201cPromising everyone Skype and email when you get to 3,000 patients becomes a little difficult,\u201d he said.\n\nMarya Shegog, director of health programs at UNLV\u2019s Lincy Institute, has studied Turntable\u2019s business model and said keeping costs down by having fewer doctors and more health coaches and other support staff makes sense and could help maintain the kinds of wellness perks Turntable offers.\n\nGunter isn\u2019t concerned about increased competition from lower-cost providers such as Turntable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about the competition at all, really. It\u2019s how you take care of the patients and rapport,\u201d Gunter said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s on us to show value\u2019\n\nAs the new kid on the block, Turntable\u2019s success will largely hinge on its ability to play well within the changing insurance landscape. It has aligned with the co-op, and time will tell if it can work with other insurance providers and employers, as MedLion has.\n\nShegog said the co-op arrangement is a positive, even if the reimbursement Turntable gets is probably not as high as its standard $80 monthly retail rate.\n\n\u201cPart of (business) sustainability is constant and regular payment. Then if you also have lower overhead because there are fewer clinical practitioners and more preventive health people, the model is sustainable,\u201d she said.\n\nTurntable\u2019s partnership with Iora Healthcare, which developed Turntable\u2019s electronic medical records program and other internal processes, will monitor results to show if patients are indeed getting healthier and if overall health care costs stay down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on us to show value. If we don\u2019t, they walk away. It\u2019s a good incentive to do the right thing,\u201d Damania said.\n\nFor Brooks, the downtown Las Vegan and Turntable member, the partnership with the Nevada Health Co-Op couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.\n\n\u201cI was getting great care before, but I paid through the nose for it,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Featured,The Sunday", "og": {"site_name": "VegasInc.com", "description": "The concierge-style business model, which is growing in Las Vegas, is getting positive reviews from patients, but how it will fare in sync with Obamacare remains to be seen ...", "title": "Turning the tables on health care", "url": "//vegasinc.com/business/2014/apr/13/turning-tables-health-care/", "image": "//media.vegasinc.com/media/img/photos/2014/04/11/scaled.0404_vi_turntable001_t378.jpg?42670983c634e7c20626cc4856c543752c0d8b2f", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "//media.vegasinc.com/media/img/photos/2014/04/11/scaled.0404_vi_turntable001_r100x100.jpg?b3c07ccb2170322b6086abdb714037205a461b06", "account_id": 29825057, "card": "summary", "site": "@VegasINC"}, "fb": {"app_id": 199953030039639}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-13T02:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "E1BCF7923471E63B3CC7DDA3DE4A41FB", "google-site-verification": "bxp1knjJzNHgVqXi0tkBFqhiRQYP6Xmg5IYDJk824_c", "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQ76jIbcG_lJjmaPhfMbLI5tEWvABRborWeQmxtOOd3YJzakYNqhBoeFQ", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Sunday, April 13, 2014 | 2 a.m. - The concierge-style business model, which is growing in Las Vegas, is getting positive reviews from patients, but how it will fare in sync with Obamacare ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1763\"", "article_summary": "Turntable is a concierge-style, membership-based primary care practice, and partnering with the co-op is an example of the evolution taking place in health care nationwide as President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act takes effect.\nIt offers unlimited access to a primary care physician (even through text, email or Skype) and his or her team.\nBecause if not, they would bring one with them.\u201dBrooks is a member of the recently established Turntable Health, a membership-based primary care provider she found through an insurance plan she purchased on the Nevada Health Co-Op.\nFor Brooks, the downtown Las Vegan and Turntable member, the partnership with the Nevada Health Co-Op couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.\nAnother relative newcomer in membership-based primary care medicine in Las Vegas has taken an opposite approach \u2014 it hasn\u2019t partnered with Obamacare exchanges or co-ops \u2014 yet."}
