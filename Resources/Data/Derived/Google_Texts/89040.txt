New Yorkers may soon not be able to smoke in their own homes, if Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio gets his way.

The New York Post reported on de Blasio’s new initiative to partner with health groups that will “pressure landlords” into banning smoking in apartment buildings.

“That means smokers would be barred from lighting up in one of their last sanctuaries: their own living quarters,” the paper said. “Smoking is already banned in public places, including bars and restaurants, workplaces, sports venues, and parks.”

De Blasio released a “sustainability blueprint” that outlined the initiative, which is paying organizations $9,000 to get apartment complexes to agree to ban smoking. The blueprint, “One New York: The Plan for a Strong and Just City,” said that de Blasio is seeking legislation that would require apartment buildings to have a “smoking policy” to “disclose it to residents and prospective residents.”

De Blasio’s effort is the latest in the Democratic crusade against smoking throughout the country. Senate Democrats in California recently voted to raise the minimum smoking age to 21, and New Orleans passed a sweeping smoking ban earlier this year that included not allowing residents to light up while they wait in line at drive-throughs.
