MIA’s 100th birthday

Thursday-next Sunday: Yep. The forever-young Minneapolis Institute of Arts is turning 100, having opened with a trumpet flourish and speeches on Jan. 7, 1915. Instead of trumpets and talk, the modern MIA is touting special brunches (Jan. 1-4, $20 adults), a free display of glorious art-inspired cakes from eight local bakeries, pop-up performances by the Twin Cities Gay Men’s Chorus and theater troupe Savage Umbrella, birthday-themed gallery tours, discounts at the shop, do-it-yourself New Year’s resolution fun and a surprise exhibition of all-American treasures. Like this charming 1887 “Birthday Party” painting by John Singer Sargent that’s part of the MIA collection (but currently on loan), the four-day festivities are a sweet beginning to a year of celebrations. So grab a party hat and join the fun. (10 a.m.-9 p.m. Thu., 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Fri.-Sat., 11 a.m.-5 p.m. next Sun. Free unless noted. 2400 3rd Av. S., Mpls. 612-870-3000, www.artsmia.org)
