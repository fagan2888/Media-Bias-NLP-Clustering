What is the alternative test?!\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the quick background: Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer killer in the U.S. A colonoscopy is an excellent screening tool. But more than one-third of people who are supposed to get it (that\u2019s people ages 50-75) don\u2019t.\n\nWhy? I think you can guess.\n\nA colonoscopy is an invasive screening test that can involve missing one to two days of work, an inconvenient preparation process and then a \u201ccolonoscope is gently eased inside the colon and sends pictures to a TV screen,\u201d the American Cancer Society says.\n\nBut it turns out that there\u2019s a less invasive option. It\u2019s called FIT \u2014 fecal immunochemical test \u2014 and essentially, you are taking a stool sample at home, in the privacy of your own bathroom. There\u2019s no preparation and there are no dietary restrictions. FIT will detect hidden blood in the stool, a sign of colon cancer or large polyps that could become cancerous.\n\nThe American Cancer Society explains how it works:\n\n\u2026 blood vessels at the surface of larger colorectal polyps or cancers are often fragile and easily damaged by the passage of feces. The damaged vessels usually release a small amount of blood into the feces, but only rarely is there enough bleeding for blood to be visible in the stool.\n\nFIT is not new \u2014 it\u2019s already a recommended screening test from both the American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, but few people know about it.\n\nThe doctors behind a study published Monday \u2014 from UCSF and Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Division of Research \u2014 are hoping their research will change that. The researchers conducted what\u2019s called a meta-analysis, a review of existing studies, to reach their conclusion.\n\nIn their review, doctors found that FIT correctly identified 80 percent of people who have cancer, and FIT correctly identified more than 94 percent of people who did not have cancer.\n\nNow, you might be thinking the inverse \u2014 that 20 percent of people with cancer were missed. But FIT is a test that\u2019s meant to be done annually, and colon cancers generally are slow-growing. \u201cYou will be tested (again) after a year goes by,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Lee, lead author of the study who works at both Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Division of Research and UCSF. \u201cDuring year two, the chances that the FIT test will detect it is much higher.\u201d\n\nIn addition, if non-cancerous polyps are removed, then patients may well be avoiding a later cancer diagnosis.\n\nDr. Theodore Levin, another of the study\u2019s authors, heads up colorectal screening for the Permanente Medical Group. Kaiser instituted a coordinated screening approach for its members several years ago, which includes mailing FITs to its members who are not up-to-date on screening. Kaiser\u2019s screening rate is going up and the incidence of colorectal cancer is going down.\n\n\u201cFIT represents a really easy-to-use option for colon screening,\u201d Levin says. \u201cIt\u2019s a much easier sell to get people to do the FIT test\u201d than undergo a colonoscopy. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it.\u201d\n\nThe study was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you're like most of my colleagues in the newsroom, you read that headline and thought, \"GREAT!
