But the federal government announced a special enrollment period that extended the deadline until April 30 because many people did not understand that they would have to pay a penalty for failure to get coverage before the deadline.\n\nThe reality hit home only when they filed their 2014 income taxes, which asked about health coverage and, for the first time, assessed a penalty.\n\nThousands of people took advantage of the extended deadline, which was available through HealthCare.gov \u2014 the federal marketplace \u2014 as well as through most state-run marketplaces. Some state marketplaces set different deadlines \u2014 Vermont\u2019s isn\u2019t until May 31, for instance \u2014 so it is best to check with the exchange in your state, according to the health care enrollment coalition Enroll America.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees the federal exchange, said that as of April 13, about 68,000 people had signed up under the extension.\n\nAmong other reasons for eligibility for a special enrollment exception are a change in income or a release from prison. Cathy Kaufmann, enrollment program director for Families USA, an advocacy group, said that many people did not realize that moving to a state that does not offer your current plan also qualifies as reason for signing up outside the open enrollment period.\n\nIf you do become eligible for coverage for any reason during the remainder of the year, it makes sense to take a look at available plans. Penalties for not having coverage are getting stiffer, said Karen Pollitz, a health policy expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan research group\n\nFor instance, in 2014, the penalty for a single person was a minimum of $95 or 1 percent of income (income over a threshold of about $10,000 is used to calculate the penalty), whichever is larger. For someone making $40,000, that means a penalty of about $300.\n\nFor 2015, the penalty based on the same salary increases to at least $325 per person or 2 percent of income, totaling about $600.\n\n(The penalty is capped, based on the average cost of a bronze-level insurance plan \u2014 about $2,400 for a single person for 2014.)\n\nMs. Kaufmann of Families USA suggested that consumers try an online tool created by the Tax Policy Center to estimate their penalty.\n\nShe also noted that applications for Medicaid, the federal-state health plan for people with low incomes, are accepted year round.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt is possible that a few insurers may sell individual plans outside the exchange and without a special eligibility requirement, said Nate Purpura, a spokesman for web-based insurance broker eHealth. One example is Meritus, he said, a cooperative nonprofit insurer that offers the plans in Arizona.\n\nHere are some questions about coverage and enrollment periods:\n\n\u25a0 If I didn\u2019t sign up for coverage by April 30, will I owe a penalty for 2015?\n\nYou\u2019ll generally owe a penalty at tax time next year for each month of this year that you lacked coverage. The penalty is prorated. You\u2019ll owe one-twelfth of the penalty for each month you went without health insurance. If you qualify for enrollment because of a special circumstance and sign up for coverage, your penalty will be reduced.\n\n\u25a0 Are there any exemptions to the requirement to have health insurance?\n\nYes. You can avoid the penalty if you qualify for an exemption like having very low income or being a member of an Indian tribe. A complete list is available on HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u25a0 When is the next open enrollment period?\n\nThe next open enrollment period begins Nov. 1, 2015, and ends Jan. 31, 2016.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150501093320, "twitter": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act\u2019s open enrollment period for health insurance expired on April 30, but people with special circumstances can still get coverage.", "title": "Health Insurance Deadline Passes for Most, but There Are Exceptions", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/your-money/health-insurance-deadline-passes-for-most-but-there-are-exceptions.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003659076"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/your-money/health-insurance-deadline-passes-for-most-but-there-are-exceptions.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003659076", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/your-money/health-insurance-deadline-passes-for-most-but-there-are-exceptions.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "yourmoney", "hdl_p": "Health Insurance Deadline Passes for Most, but There Are Exceptions", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/your-money/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 1, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Ann Carrns", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By ANN CARRNS", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Affordable Care Act\u2019s open enrollment period for health insurance expired on April 30, but people with special circumstances can still get coverage.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The Affordable Care Act\u2019s open enrollment period for health insurance expired on April 30, but people with special circumstances can still get coverage.", "CG": "your-money", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 1, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/ann_carrns/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/your-money/index.html", "section": "Your Money", "modified": "2015-05-11", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/your-money/index.jsonp", "tag": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "published": "2015-05-01", "section-taxonomy-id": "ED7B8594-44CE-4D37-A58B-1CDAA19774E4"}, "slug": "02adviser", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150511162628, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/your-money/health-insurance-deadline-passes-for-most-but-there-are-exceptions.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Affordable Care Act\u2019s open enrollment period for health insurance expired on April 30, but people with special circumstances can still get coverage.", "title": "Health Insurance Deadline Passes for Most, but There Are Exceptions"}, "pdate": 20150501, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000003659076, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Health Insurance Deadline Passes for Most, but There Are Exceptions", "col": "Your Money Adviser", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "PhotoTHE last chance to sign up for health insurance this year under the Affordable Care Act passed on Thursday, when an extended deadline for enrollment expired.\n\u25a0 Are there any exemptions to the requirement to have health insurance?\nThe next open enrollment period begins Nov. 1, 2015, and ends Jan. 31, 2016.\nYou\u2019ll owe one-twelfth of the penalty for each month you went without health insurance.\n\u25a0 When is the next open enrollment period?"}
