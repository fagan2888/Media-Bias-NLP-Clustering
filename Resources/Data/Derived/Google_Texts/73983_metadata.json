We get an opportunity to play another one, but it\u2019s disappointing because how this game started and where it ended.\u201d\n\nWith former Terps coach Ralph Friedgen directing the Rutgers attack as its offensive coordinator, the Scarlet Knights (7-5, 3-5) rallied from a 35-10 deficit to pull off the biggest comeback in school history.\n\n\u201cObviously it\u2019s a special win, but I think it\u2019s an even better win for our program,\u201d said Friedgen, who coached at Maryland for 10 years before being replaced by Edsall after the 2010 season.\n\nWith Friedgen leading the way, Rutgers outscored the Terrapins (7-5, 4-4) 31-3 over the final 31 minutes.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s on us,\u201d linebacker L.A. Goree said. \u201cWe usually play real good football, but we couldn\u2019t stop them when we needed to stop them.\u201d\n\nRutgers took its first lead when Kyle Federico kicked a 25-yard field goal with 6:14 left, and Maryland couldn\u2019t come back.\n\nAfter Brad Craddock failed on a 54-yard field goal attempt, his first miss in 19 tries this season, the Terrapins recovered a fumble at the Rutgers 45 with 2:54 remaining. But Brandon Ross was stuffed for no gain on a fourth-and-1, dooming the Terrapins to an unsightly defeat on Senior Day.\n\n\u201cWe will live with it,\u201d Edsall said, \u201cbut we will get better from it.\u201d\n\nFriedgen\u2019s offense amassed 491 yards, Gary Nova completed 28 of 42 passes for 347 yards and four touchdowns, and three receivers finished with more than 100 yards. Janarion Grant had eight catches for 105 yards; Andre Patton had eight receptions for 101 yards and two touchdowns; and Leonte Carroo caught six passes for 104 yards and two scores.\n\nPlaying his final home game at Maryland, sixth-year quarterback C.J. Brown went 14 for 24 for 195 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for 107 yards and a score.\n\n\u201cFor all the seniors, including myself, to go out with a loss, it hurts,\u201d Brown said. \u201cTo be up 35-10 and for them to come back at home on senior night, it\u2019s not a good feeling.\u201d\n\nRoss had 108 yards rushing on 10 carries and scored twice.\n\n\u201cIt just hurts,\u201d Ross said. \u201cAs an offense we scored only three points in the second half so we feel like it\u2019s on us.\u201d\n\nDown 35-10, Rutgers began its comeback when a roughing-the-kicker call extended a drive that produced a 1-yard touchdown pass from Nova to Patton just before halftime.\n\nGrant returned the opening kickoff of the second half 71 yards to set up a 1-yard touchdown run Robert Martin. Then, after a Maryland punt, Nova threw an 8-yard TD pass to Carroo to make it 35-31.\n\nA 50-yard field goal by Craddock interrupted the surge, but Nova tied it with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Patton with 14:55 to go.\n\nThe victory was only the second for Rutgers in its last six games. It did, however, assure the Scarlet Knights a winning record overall in their first season in the Big Ten.\n\nMoments after honoring 22 seniors before their final home game, the Terrapins took the opening kickoff and put together a drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Brown.\n\nAfter Rutgers kicked a field goal, Brown opened the second quarter with a quick pass to Amba Etta-Tawo, who made the catch in stride while cutting across the middle and pulled away for a 71-yard score.\n\nNova responded with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Carroo, and the back-and-forth continued when Brown directed a 82-yard march that lasted less than two minutes and ended with a 9-yard TD run by Ross.\n\nThe game\u2019s lone turnover followed. Sean Davis caused Nova to fumble, Cole Farrand recovered on the Rutgers 40 and Ross scored on the next play to make it 28-10.\n\nMinutes later, Brown threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Deon Long.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With former Terps coach Ralph Friedgen directing the Rutgers attack as its offensive coordinator, the Scarlet Knights rallied from a 35-10 deficit to pull off the biggest comeback in school history.", "Author": "David Ginsburg", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With former Terps coach Ralph Friedgen directing the Rutgers attack as its offensive coordinator, the Scarlet Knights rallied from a 35-10 deficit to pull off the biggest comeback in school history.", "title": "Maryland blows 25-point lead, falls to Rutgers in regular-season finale", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/29/maryland-blows-25-point-lead-falls-rutgers-regular/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/29/rutgers-maryland-foot_lanc1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/29/rutgers-maryland-foot_lanc1.jpg", "title": "Maryland blows 25-point lead, falls to Rutgers in regular-season final", "description": "With former Terps coach Ralph Friedgen directing the Rutgers attack as its offensive coordinator, the Scarlet Knights rallied from a 35-10 deficit to pull off the biggest comeback in school history.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Rutgers, Brandon Ross, Randy Edsall, Gary Nova"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde18\"", "article_summary": "Minutes later, Brown threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Deon Long.\nA 50-yard field goal by Craddock interrupted the surge, but Nova tied it with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Patton with 14:55 to go.\nThen, after a Maryland punt, Nova threw an 8-yard TD pass to Carroo to make it 35-31.\nWith Friedgen leading the way, Rutgers outscored the Terrapins (7-5, 4-4) 31-3 over the final 31 minutes.\nThe game couldn\u2019t have started much better for Maryland, its fans and the 22 seniors playing at home for the final time."}
