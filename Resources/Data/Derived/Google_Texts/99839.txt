The White House recognized two Latino "Champions of Change" for their significant contributions signing members in their communities up for Obamacare.

"[Twenty million people] are covered because of people like Rudy Gonzales, who developed Latino engagement strategies that are still being used statewide by the marketplace in Colorado," said White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough. "They're covered because of people like Ana Maria Garza Cortez, a leader in enrolling uninsured San Antonians using culturally and linguistically responsive education and materials."

Rudy Gonzales is the executive director of Servicios de La Raza in Denver, Colorado, which sponsors services that affect 30,000 people in eight different program areas.

"We have a program that serves victims and survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, human trafficking and general crime; full blown mental health services and youth programs that serve employment and leadership education for Latino youth," said Gonzales, who spoke to NBC Latino via phone.

HIs organization is a one-stop-shop for people who need help combating substance abuse, working to reenter the workforce after serving prison time and struggling to sign up for health insurance.

Garza Cortez serves as the Vice President of Development and Marketing for CentroMed, a federally qualified health center in San Antonio, Texas. She designed programs specifically catered to Latinos who need health insurance or help finding medical care.

It's been six years since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. The uninsured rate has fallen below 10 percent.
