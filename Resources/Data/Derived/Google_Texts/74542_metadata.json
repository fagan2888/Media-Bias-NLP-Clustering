Perhaps you\u2019ve read about it online, seen it discussed in your favorite fitness magazine, or simply heard others talking about it at your local gym. Whatever the case may be, there\u2019s a good chance what you heard sounded something like, \u201cHIIT is the only way to burn fat\u201d or \u201cIf you aren\u2019t doing HIIT, you\u2019re wasting your time in the gym.\u201d Or maybe it said, \u201cSteady-state cardio doesn\u2019t burn fat \u2014 HIIT does, and there\u2019s no other way to train.\u201d\n\nWe are being bombarded with statements like these, and they\u2019ve led everyone to jump on the HIIT bandwagon. If you\u2019re going to the gym, you\u2019re doing HIIT. It\u2019s that simple. But, is HIIT right for you?\n\nIt\u2019s important to question what you read and hear about HIIT, because most of these sources don\u2019t have your best interests in mind. Is HIIT really worth the hype? Let\u2019s look at a few factors that may make you think otherwise.\n\nHIIT Is Extremely Intense\n\nLet\u2019s get one thing straight. HIIT is the most intense form of exercise you can do. This is what brings forth the benefits it has to offer. For some people, this is great. Intensity is the name of their game and they are fully prepared to go that extra mile and put in that level of work.\n\nFor others, it\u2019s a recipe for disaster. Take your average gym-goer as an example. They\u2019ve just started their workout routine. They likely went to the gym because they have 20 pounds to lose \u2014 or more \u2014 and are ready to finally do something about it. Prior to joining, their activity level consisted of little more than getting up to look for food in the fridge or going for a walk here and there, but only when they found a burst of motivation.\n\nThese are usually the type of people who love instant gratification. After all, instant gratification is what got them in this position in the first place. The cake was tastier than the apple, and therefore it\u2019s what they ate. Now, they have this excess weight and are looking to get it off pronto. They aren\u2019t looking to take the long journey to weight loss. So, when they hear that HIIT is the fastest way to burn fat, they jump onboard.\n\nThe issue with this is they aren\u2019t actually ready to jump onboard. They\u2019re out of shape and need a slow and steady approach, not one that calls for 110 percent of their effort at a near-maximal pace. Unaware of this fact, many attempt HIIT anyway \u2014 and then one of three things happens:\n\n1. They become injured \u2014 HIIT will put you at a higher risk of injury if it\u2019s not done properly.\n\n2. They don\u2019t perform it correctly, preventing them from reaching the intensity levels that characterize HIIT. Thus, it\u2019s not HIIT.\n\n3. Or, they try it, hit those intensity levels, and hate it so much they leave the gym forever.\n\nFor these reasons, a person who wishes to lose weight shouldn\u2019t go down the HIIT route. Instead, they should get started on the exact type of exercise they\u2019re apprehensive about: steady-state cardio training. This type of exercise will help them build up their fitness levels to the point that they feel comfortable moving on to HIIT sessions successfully.\n\nHIIT Is Taxing On the Central Nervous System\n\nAnother often unaddressed issue with HIIT is that it\u2019s very taxing on the central nervous system. Any form of high-intensity exercise, whether it\u2019s HIIT cardio training or weight lifting activities, is going to wear you down.\n\nThe problem with this is HIIT is often emphasized as being the only way to burn fat, so people who are highly motivated attempt three to four sessions per week. Then, they pair that with three to four sessions of intense weightlifting per week. While they might sustain this regimen for a few weeks, their body will eventually grow tired. Some people will even see this fatigue as a sign they aren\u2019t training hard enough and begin upping the intensity even more.\n\nPeople who overdo their workouts may injure themselves.

Pushing forward too much can lead to full-blown overtraining, which often causes symptoms such as an altered resting heart rate, muscle soreness, sickness, loss of concentration, insatiable thirst, and even personality changes. It can also cause injuries bad enough that they\u2019ll be sidelined, not doing much of anything.\n\nHIIT can be good if you are at a fitness level where it\u2019s possible, and even then, it should be performed in moderation. A balance between rest, recovery, and intense training will lead to optimal results, but many people aren\u2019t able to do this successfully.\n\nHIIT Requires the Presence of Glucose\n\nFinally, you might want to forgo HIIT training if you\u2019re on a low-carb diet. When it comes to weight loss, diet will always trump exercise in terms of the results that can be seen. It\u2019s just far easier to cut calories than it is to burn them off in the gym.\n\nTherefore, diet should be priority number one. But if you happen to be on a reduced-carb diet \u2014 one that\u2019s been proven effective in burning fat \u2014 you might not have the necessary fuel to complete HIIT.\n\nHIIT is an anaerobic form of exercise, meaning that the body needs fuel in the form of glucose to get through it. If you are taking in a limited amount of carbohydrates, there simply won\u2019t be enough glucose to fuel your workout, especially if you\u2019re doing strength training too.\n\nThis will cause your performance to falter and you won\u2019t hit the intensity levels you\u2019re aiming for, even if you have the best intentions. When this happens, you have two options: you can either add more carbs to your diet plan or replace HIIT with a lower intensity form of aerobic cardio that uses fat as a fuel source. For many people, the likelier option to choose is the second one. It\u2019ll keep their low-carb diet intact and they\u2019ll only have to adjust their exercise plan.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that HIIT can be highly beneficial when performed under the right circumstances. Unfortunately, it simply isn\u2019t ideal for everyone. Don\u2019t fall for the hype that HIIT is the only right way to train. That just isn\u2019t the case.\n\nShannon Clark holds a degree in Exercise Science from the University of Alberta, where she specialized in sports performance and psychology.
