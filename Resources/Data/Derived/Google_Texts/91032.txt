Diabetic Macular Edema Drugs Compared

Aflibercept (Eylea/Regeneron) did better in treating diabetic macular edema (DME) than a far cheaper alternative bevacizumab (Avastin/Genentech) in a subset of patients who started treatment when their vision was 20/50 or worse.The finding was made in a three-year National Institutes of Health-funded clinical tria in whichl researchers compared three drugs, aflibercept, bevacizumab and ranibizumab (Lucentis /Genentech)Gains after two years were about the same for aflibercept and ranibizumab, though at the one-year point, aflibercept had shown a clear advantage.In patients whose vision was better at the start of treatment (20/32 or 20/40) the three drugs were about equal in effectiveness.The trial was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, funded by the NIH’s National Eye Institute.In a news release describing the results, NEI’s Paul Sieving, MD, PhD, said “eye care providers and patients can have confidence in all three drugs.Based on Medicare allowable charges, the per-injection costs of each drug in the doses used in the study were only $60 for Avastin but $1,200 for Lucentis and $1,850 for Eylea.The trial involved 660 patients with DME and ws done in 89 sites across the US.The study results were published in Ophthalmology .
