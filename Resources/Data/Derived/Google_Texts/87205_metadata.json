Some devout Muslim athletes choose to fast during training or competition, but it can create selection difficulties for the coaches in team sports.\n\nHalilhodzic, who has testy relations with sections of the Algerian media and its football association, threatened to leave a news conference Sunday if questions persisted on the topic. He said critics were using the issue to \u201ctry and raise hatred of me and my family. This is really disgusting.\u201d\n\nThe national football association released a statement denying a report in Algeria\u2019s leading football newspaper suggesting that Halilhodzic, a Muslim, had ordered players not to fast. It\u2019s a potentially sensitive allegation in the mostly Muslim country.\n\nThe federation said Halilhodzic had been \u201cvery respectful\u201d of the religion in his three years at the helm of the national team.\n\nThe veteran coach, a French-Bosnian, said fasting was a \u201cprivate issue and players will do exactly as they wish.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you ask this question you lack respect and ethics. I would like this to stop. Stop this controversy. Talk about football,\u201d he said, in response to repeated questions at the official pre-match news conference. \u201cAnd stop asking me about Ramadan, otherwise I will get up and leave.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Algeria coach: fasting up to players at World Cup", "title": "Algeria coach: fasting up to players at World Cup", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Algeria coach: fasting up to players at World Cup", "title": "Algeria coach: fasting up to players at World Cup", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/30/algeria_coach_fasting_up_to_players_at_world_cup/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-soccer-wcup-germany-algeria.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Algeria coach: fasting up to players at World Cup", "title": "Algeria coach: fasting up to players at World Cup", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-soccer-wcup-germany-algeria.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chris Brummitt", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsPORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (AP) \u2014 Algeria\u2019s players are being left to decide whether or not they observe the Ramadan fast during Monday\u2019s World Cup game against Germany, with coach Vahid Halilhodzic saying it\u2019s not a divisive issue.\nThe veteran coach, a French-Bosnian, said fasting was a \u201cprivate issue and players will do exactly as they wish.\u201d\u201cWhen you ask this question you lack respect and ethics.\nThis is really disgusting.\u201dThe national football association released a statement denying a report in Algeria\u2019s leading football newspaper suggesting that Halilhodzic, a Muslim, had ordered players not to fast.\nSome devout Muslim athletes choose to fast during training or competition, but it can create selection difficulties for the coaches in team sports.\nTalk about football,\u201d he said, in response to repeated questions at the official pre-match news conference."}
