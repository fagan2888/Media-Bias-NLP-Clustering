Bobby Brown is insisting that doctors at an Atlanta hospital keep his comatose daughter Bobbi Kristina on life support, believing that a miracle can save her, TMZ reports.

Bobbi Kristina, 21, has been in a medically induced coma since she was found submerged in a bathtub in her home Saturday â€” and doctors have reportedly told the family there's nothing more they can do to save her.

But Brown, 46, was refusing to say farewell to his stricken daughter and was praying for divine intervention, TMZ said.

However, family sources told the website he could change his mind, but simply wasn't able to handle making such a tragic decision on his birthday, which was on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod Brown said on social media things did not look optimistic.

"Though it seems the odds are against her, though doctors don't see any hope for change ... though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK," Jerod Brown said on Instagram, where he posts as yfkennedy.

The painful ordeal involving his only daughter with late pop diva Whitney Houston unfolded against another bit of news for Brown; his wife, Alicia Etheridge, is four months pregnant.

The pair already has one son together, 5-year-old Cassius.

According to E!, Brown and some 20 family members took a brief break from the vigil they were holding at Emory University Hospital on Thursday night to celebrate his birthday and the pregnancy at a nearby restaurant.

A police officer met the grieving New Edition singer at the door of the unidentified eatery and escorted him and his guests to a table in a private room, which was shielded by a large curtain, E! said.
