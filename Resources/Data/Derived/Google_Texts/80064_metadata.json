That figure was almost three percent of the state\u2019s GDP in that same year.\n\nThe study was commissioned by New Futures, a drug and alcohol advocacy group, and conducted by PolEcon Research.\n\nThe study\u2019s author, Brian Gottlob, says he was surprised by that figure.\n\n\u201cWhen you start calculating all the ways in which it has negative impacts on productivity, on the work force, and the way it directly costs citizens and government money, it becomes believable that it\u2019s $1.8 billion,\u201d says Gottlob.\n\nPut another way, that\u2019s roughly $1,393 per New Hampshire resident.\n\nSo how do we get to that $1.84 billion figure?\n\nThe study estimates nine percent of residents age 12 and up misused drugs or alcohol in 2012. That misuse translates into an economic toll when a person\u2019s behavior has a measurable impact \u2013 when they miss a day of work, get arrested, or enter treatment.\n\nAlcohol was responsible for the biggest portion of the societal cost: $1.15 billion came from lost productivity \u2013 people missing work or being unable to work \u2013 and 80 percent of that figure was directly from alcohol misuse and abuse.\n\nOn the treatment end, drug use \u2013 specifically opioid abuse \u2013 accounted for the fastest growing portion of the pie. Yet, the report finds addicts in New Hampshire are among the least likely in the country to get treatment.\n\n\u201cA 2011 study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicated that in only one state (Texas) is an individual in need of substance misuse treatment less likely to receive treatment than in New Hampshire,\u201d concluded the study.\n\nGottlob said that could change now that the state has expanded its Medicaid program, which covers treatment for addiction, and as more people enroll in insurance through the federal health insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cOne impact likely is that more individuals in need of treatment will be able to get it without having to pay for it themselves, and I think that will\u2026reduce the cost of substance abuse in the state down the line,\u201d says Gottlob\n\nNew Hampshire is among 27 states that expanded Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Drug and alcohol abuse put a $1.84 billion strain on the New Hampshire economy in 2012, according to a new study.
