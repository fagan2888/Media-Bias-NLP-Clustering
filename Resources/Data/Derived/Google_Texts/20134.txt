A man was found unconscious Monday on the ground below the second-floor window of his room at an assisted living facility, according to township police.

Detectives interviewed staff at Meridian Nursing & Rehab at Bayshore located at 715 North Beers St.

Rob Cavanaugh, a spokesman for Meridian, had no comment about the incident.

“At this time, I can’t go into any details because there is currently a police investigation,” Cavanaugh said.

Police Lt. Michael Smith said the 58-year-old patient was discovered at 5:45 a.m. outside the building after he apparently fell from the second-floor window. The identity of the victim and his hometown were not released Monday, as his family had not been notified.

Medical staff had last checked on the man at 4 a.m. in his room and it was not clear what had happened, Smith said.

“We’re currently looking into it,” Smith said.

The complex is located on the campus of Bayshore Community Hospital. The facility is a Medicare- and Medicaid-approved skilled nursing facility with 221 total licensed beds, including 121 long-term nursing care beds, 37 Alzheimer’s/dementia unit beds, 52 subacute rehabilitation beds and a separate 11-bed ventilator unit. The center’s central location on the hospital’s campus offers residents immediate access to acute care and diagnostic services.
