Now, users are turning to heroin and a synthetic drug called fentanyl sometimes with deadly results.\n\nThe crisis is putting a strain on community agencies from law enforcement to treatment centers.\n\n\n\nBrandilyn Karnehmof Bradenton said she got involved with pills as a way to make money around 2009.\n\nShe said doctors in Tampa were more than willing to hand them out at time.\n\n\u201cThey really just cared about the money. You just went there, paid your money and they would see you and they\u2019d be like \u2018Oh, yeah you need this. You have all of these problems\u2019 when in reality we didn\u2019t. And they would prescribe you over 300 pills a month,\u201d she said\n\nSomeone she knew would get them and Karnehm would help sell them.\n\n\u201cEverybody was doing them. Every person I went to school with, older people I knew, people\u2019s parents that I went to school with. Everybody was doing these pills,\u201d she said.\n\nThen pills started to get harder to find. Florida\u2019s pill problem was attracting attention. In 2011, the legislature passed reforms to address the problem.\n\nAs pills disappeared, Karnehm said people turned to heroin \u2013 including herself.\n\n\u201cIf I couldn\u2019t find any pills, I would dread having to buy heroin because it was horrible\u2026 It was either going to be good and take my sickness away or it was going to be complete garbage and then I was going to be just on that wild goose chase trying to find more money to either try to find a pill or find somebody else who had heroin,\u201d she said.\n\nKarnehm was arrested in 2011. That led down a windy road including jail, drug court and treatment. Now, she\u2019s clean.\n\nReminders of her past still creep up. Maybe it\u2019s through a notice on social media that someone she knew just died from an overdose.\n\n\u201cPeople weren\u2019t dying like this with prescription pills,\u201d she said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t and now this specific heroin, it's killing our whole generation.\u201d\n\nChief medical examiner for Sarasota, Manatee and DeSoto Counties Dr. Russell Vega said, for a while, he saw overdose death rates across all three counties in the single digits. Then, in 2013, it rose to 16.\n\nThat rate marinated through the start of 2014. By the summer, Vega said things were different.\n\n\u201cThey start to explode essentially, we went from 16 deaths in 2013 to really 70 deaths or probably a little bit more in 2014 and we're on course to be double that amount for 2015,\u201d he said.\n\nHe says there\u2019s really no pattern to who is dying of opioid overdoses.\n\n\u201cThe deaths are occurring not just in one little age range or one small socio-economic group\u2026 we\u2019ve had deaths occurring in the teen years we\u2019ve had deaths occurring in the 60s.\u201d\n\nManatee County EMS officials said they mostly run across white males when responding to calls.\n\nThey administer a drug called NARCAN to snap people out of overdoses.\n\nCaptain Todd Shear is with the Manatee County Sheriff\u2019s Office. He said EMS gave 710 doses of NARCAN last year. By the end of August this year, that number was at more than 1,000.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s their total times that they\u2019ve administered it so they may have gone on the scene and administered it to one person three times because the drug is so potent, the first administration of it didn\u2019t work. Sometimes it takes the second or third time because the drug is so strong and fentanyl is strong,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said heroin by itself is deadly \u2013 but the arrival of drugs like fentanyl, which people either mix with heroin or ingest by itself \u2013 can make the situation even riskier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same as it used to be in times past. When you add into it the fentanyl, then you\u2019re dealing with a very dangerous drug,\u201d he said.\n\nShear said fentanyl is 40 to 50 times more potent than heroin. The Sheriff\u2019s Office thinks fentanyl is being produced in homemade labs in Mexico. He said one of the main reasons opioids are making their way into Manatee County is because of how close it is to the Tampa Bay region.\n\nShear said they want to catch traffickers and not necessarily those addicted to opioids.\n\nLocal treatment centers are also feeling the pressure of the epidemic.\n\nDr. Jessica Crosby works at Centerstone, a Manatee County treatment center. She said she noticed an increasing number of heroin users coming into the addiction center about two years.\n\n\u201cI just remember looking at our list of individuals that we had in here and their diagnosis and thinking \u2018Wow.\u2019 I was so used to seeing opiate in pill form and I was seeing heroin, heroin, heroin, heroin and I remember thinking this is the most heroin I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she said.\n\nCrosby said Centerstone only has 30 beds for its residential treatment program.\n\n\u201cIf we were able to provide more, we would be able to get I think this problem under control a bit more, but right now 30 at this time is like a drop in the bucket,\u201d she said.\n\nCenterstone is one of the only residential programs of any kind in Manatee County. Crosby said users often reject the idea of outpatient treatment.\n\nShe said she hopes the legislature will provide them more funding during the next session.\n\nBrandilyn Karnehm, who recovered from opioid addiction, now has a young child and lives with her boyfriend in their Bradenton apartment.\n\nShe said things are good.\n\n\u201cLife has been, it\u2019s been great. It\u2019s like once you subtract the drugs and the chaos, life can be good. I guess this is how normally people live every day,\u201d she said.\n\nShe calls it life after addiction - one person who put it behind her as the rest of the county remains in its grip.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/manatee-county-agencies-pressured-rising-opioid-use", "image": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/sites/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201605/456340574.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Manatee County Agencies Pressured By Rising Opioid Use"}, "story_id": 456207347, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Topher Forhecz", "org_id": 399, "dc": {"title": "Manatee County Agencies Pressured By Rising Opioid Use"}, "nid": 12698, "datePublished": "2015-11-17", "keywords": "heroin", "wordCount": 1184, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI just remember looking at our list of individuals that we had in here and their diagnosis and thinking \u2018Wow.\u2019 I was so used to seeing opiate in pill form and I was seeing heroin, heroin, heroin, heroin and I remember thinking this is the most heroin I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d she said.\nOpioid deaths in Manatee County are on track to double by the end of the year.\nDr. Jessica Crosby works at Centerstone, a Manatee County treatment center.\nCenterstone is one of the only residential programs of any kind in Manatee County.\nHe said one of the main reasons opioids are making their way into Manatee County is because of how close it is to the Tampa Bay region."}
