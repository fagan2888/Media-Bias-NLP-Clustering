Strengthened by member support, the organization is poised to make significant strides in advancing healthcare consumerism this year.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to build on the major gains ECFC has made in our advocacy and education efforts last year to legislative and regulatory initiatives, certifications, publications and industry networking events,\u201d said William Short, ECFC\u2019s Board of Directors Chair. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way in 35 years by listening to our members, focusing our efforts and putting muscle behind our vision. Today, we are the vital voice in preserving, protecting and defending tax-advantaged benefits programs for working families, helping to put more of their hard-earned cash in their pockets.\u201d\n\nThis month the organization rolled out a brand refresh with an updated logo and tagline, \u201cAdvancing Healthcare Consumerism.\u201d This brand promise celebrates significant accomplishments and matches the organization\u2019s value proposition to be the leading nonprofit organization promoting choice in benefits solutions by working together through education and advocacy to put a consumer-driven account into the hands of everyone.\n\nECFC, an organization of nearly 200 employer members, champions tax-advantaged benefit programs, such as flexible spending accounts (FSAs), health savings accounts (HSAs) and health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs). This year\u2019s Annual Conference March 16-18 in Washington, D.C., will amplify its voice in the ongoing debate on employer-provided benefit plans, tax reform and the Affordable Care Act. Building on its successes with the use-it-or-lose-it provision for health FSAs, the organization will continue its position as the thought leaders on these issues.\n\nAccelerating its momentum, the organization bolstered its influence by recently recruiting two 30-year industry veterans: Martin Trussell joined this month to serve as Executive Director and William Sweetnam joined in June to serve as Legislative and Technical Director.\n\nECFC\u2019s My Money, My Health campaign, which launched in November, continues to give voice to millions of healthcare consumers who will be negatively impacted by the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax, a 40 percent excise tax on employer-based health plans. Feeling the pressure, last month, both the House or Representatives and the Senate passed end-of-year legislation providing a two-year delay and welcome \u2013 albeit only temporary \u2013 relief to millions of Americans.\n\n\u201cECFC\u2019s core purpose is to promote choice in benefit solutions,\u201d Trussell said. \u201cIf the preservation, protection and defense of tax-advantaged benefits programs for working families is important to you, you need to become a member of ECFC.\u201d\n\nECFC has scheduled several networking, advocacy and educational events throughout 2016, including its annual Administrator\u2019s Symposium in August, to provide employers, plan sponsors, third-party administrators, and other service providers in the consumer-directed benefits industry with practical advice, technical education and updates on lobbying efforts with Congress and on the regulatory front.
