It was only after massive, coordinated pressure applied by gay-rights groups that the FDA made partial and selective exceptions to its lengthy and widely criticized drug-approval processes. Worse still, the FDA continues to choke down the supply of life-saving and life-enhancing drugs that will everyone agrees will play a massive role not just in reducing future health care costs but in improving the quality of all our lives (in 2000, Columbia University\u2019s economist Frank Lichtenberg estimated that\"increased drug approvals and health expenditure per person jointly explain just about 100 percent\u201d of the seven-year increase in life expectancy at birth between 1960 and 1997). Little wonder, then, that the movie is \u201cthe libertarian favorite of the year,\u201d in the words of film critic Kyle Smith.... ...the FDA\u2019s often arbitrary but always time-intensive requirements have created a system in which new drugs take somewhere around 10 to 15 years to come to market, at a typical cost of $800 million or more. As my Reason colleague Ronald Bailey has written, this means the FDA\u2019s caution \u201cmay be killing more people than it saves.\u201d How\u2019s that? \u201cIf it takes the FDA ten years to approve a drug that saves 20,000 lives per year that means that 200,000 people died in the meantime.\u201d\n\nMore, including lots of links to Reason.com stories, here.\n\nRelated in Reason: Peter Huber (interviewed here) lays out how to overcome \"20th-century regulations to allow 21st-century cures.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "If you haven't seen The Dallas Buyers Club, which took home three Oscars last Sunday, you should.
