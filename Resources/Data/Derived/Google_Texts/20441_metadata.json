Timberlake, who has released \u201cSuit & Tie\u201d, \u201cMirrors\u201d, and \u201cTKO,\u201d looked like he was getting ready to release \u201cDrink You Away\u201d as a single after his rousing American Music Awards performance. When no word came we figured maybe we would have to wait, and then Timberlake gave a great performance of \u201cOnly When I Walk Away\u201d on Saturday Night Live in January and then we thought for sure that would be his next single, and still, no word. Now we finally have word and its neither of those songs off of Timberlake\u2019s latest release.\n\nAccording to All Access \u201cNot a Bad Thing,\u201d a mellow mid tempo groove, has been released to Top 40 radio, Rhythmic and other Adult Contemporary stations. Although the acoustic featured song is a great choice, it\u2019s odd considering what Timberlake has put out in the past. While he has grown as a musician, Timberlake\u2019s singles like \u201cSexy Back\u201d \u201cCry Me A River\u201d \u201cSenorita\u201d \u201cSuit & Tie\u201d are just some examples of the uptempo, sometimes gritty R&B sound the entertainer markets himself as. Timberlake\u2019s next single, \u201cNot a Bad Thing\u201d will be his first acoustic driven single. It will be interesting to see what his demo does with the song.\n\nIf anything the choice of song is just another symbol for Timberlake\u2019s latest release. In 2013 Timberlake announced that he was releasing a whole album of new material a few months before the release date. This was a move which shocked everyone seeing as it came before Beyonce\u2019s surprise album. His second announcement about his second album release in 2013 also came as another unorthodox way of announcing to fans his plans. Perhaps this odd choice of single will work in Timberlake\u2019s favor like the rest.\n\nSo far Justin Timberlake hasn\u2019t hit a wrong turn as far as his music goes. He\u2019s been awarded AMAs, Grammys, has been called the new King of Pop, and his albums The 20/20 Experience is the best-selling album of 2013.\n\nIn total The 20/20 Experience sold 2.43 million units in 2013, and was the only album to sell over the 2 million dollar mark. The second best goes to Eminem\u2019s new album The Marshall Mathers LP 2 which sold 1.73 million.\n\nThis week it was announced that after Timberlake makes his stops at Madison Square Garden, he will head to close out Jimmy Fallon\u2019s first week on The Tonight Show. Timberlake will act as both musical performer and guest.\n\n[Image credit: Antonio Scorza / Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Looks like Justin Timberlake has found his next single off of his double disc album The 20/20 Experience.
