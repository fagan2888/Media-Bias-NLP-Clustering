It was a great night for the GOP, especially Matt Bevin\u2019s surprise win in Kentucky. Most had written him off in the weeks prior to Election Day, citing the inability for both him and his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Jack Conway, from getting any sort of traction with the electorate. In the end, Bevin beat Conway by almost ten points. The Republican State Leadership Committee, who serves at the frontlines of state and local races, noted their massive victory during their conference call yesterday. I\u2019ve written previously about how the Obama presidency has left a huge butcher\u2019s bill for the Democratic Party at the state and local level. This is where the fresh faces, and the new blood, comes from for future elections. After Clinton, the bench is quite bare. Given how the post-2015 election map looks, one could wonder if the Democratic Party can still compete at the state and local level.\n\nUnder President Obama, Democrats have lost 900+ state legislature seats, 12 governors, 69 House seats, 13 Senate seats. That\u2019s some legacy. \u2014 Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) November 4, 2015\n\nInsideSources gave a quick rundown of the \u201cbeating\u201d Democrats took Tuesday night. Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post noted the absolute Republican dominance at the state and local level, adding (what we party members have known for a while) that it shows the GOP\u2019s message is far from broken. He also reiterated the fact that this is where the new leaders are found:\n\nThat dominance \u2014 and what it means to the policy and political calculations and prospects for both parties at the national level \u2014 is the single most overlooked and underappreciated story line of President Obama\u2019s time in office. Since 2009, Republicans have made massive and unprecedented gains at the state level, gains that played a central role in, among other things, handing control of the U.S. House back to the GOP in the 2010 election. [\u2026] It\u2019s hard to overstate how important those GOP gains \u2014 and the consolidation of them we\u2019ve seen in the last few years \u2014 are to the relative fates of the two parties. While the story at the national level suggests a Republican Party that is growing increasingly white, old and out of step with the country on social issues, the narrative at the local level is very different. Republicans are prospering at the state level in ways that suggest that the party\u2019s messaging is far from broken. There are other, more pragmatic effects of the GOP dominance in governor\u2019s races and state legislatures, too. Aside from giving the party a major leg up in the decennial redrawing of congressional lines, which has led to a Republican House majority not only today but likely through at least 2020, the GOP\u2019s dominance gives the party fertile ground to incubate policy that makes its way to the national level and to cultivate the future stars of the national party from the ground up.\n\nOver at Commentary, Noah Rothman attributed the party\u2019s losses to their indefatigable defense of Obamacare:\n\nDemocrats have sacrificed a lot for ObamaCare. The party that rode two anti-GOP waves to unqualified power has been decimated. In 2009, Democrats controlled 62 of 99 legislative chambers, 29 governorships, and substantial majorities in both chambers of Congress. Today, the GOP controls 70 percent of all legislative chambers and 32 governorships. Nearly half the population of the United States lives under total Republican control. In the Congress, Republican majorities in the lower chamber appear nearly impossible to oust in this decade and the project of retaking the Senate in 2016 now seems a daunting task despite the number of exposed GOP members in traditionally Democratic states. If Democrats were to lose the presidency in 2017, they would no longer be able to avoid taking stock of the full scale of the party\u2019s decimation. Obama\u2019s hold on the White HoOuse has masked the scope of the party\u2019s truncation.\n\nBeing eaten alive from the inside out\u2013what a David Cronenberg-esque political narrative that would be.\n\nSo, are Democrats still competitive at this level? They know they have problems. Donna Brazile, the DNC\u2019s co-chair, called her party\u2019s extensive losses at this level a \u201ccrime.\u201d Advantage 2020 is the Democrats\u2019 $70 million effort to retake their lost ground. The RSLC has their seven-year, $125 million RedMap effort aimed at defending this territory, along with gaining ground in state legislatures. The problem here is whether Democrats can revive those state party apparatuses that have truly \u201catrophied\u201d after years of neglect, as written in the New Republic last year. Moreover, besides rebuilding, it\u2019s convincing the white working class voters who dot the areas where Democrats have been booted, to vote for them again. Regardless, for Democrats, this has to be done:\n\nThe [Democratic] party could \u201cwrite off\u201d white working class in the South and still win many elections, but it\u2019s impossible to write off working Americans in all of the Red States or in all non-urban areas and still have a stable and enduring Democratic majority. [\u2026] In many Red States, Democrats\u2019 populist rhetoric simply doesn\u2019t penetrate the local political culture, which is dominated by Fox News and conservative radio. In these areas, Democrats have no alternative except to try to rebuild local political organizations and regain the support that has atrophied for several decades. Many Democrats would prefer not to have to face this monumental organization challenge, hoping instead that the existing Obama coalition and demographic changes in America will prove sufficient to elect a president in 2016, hold the Senate, and weaken GOP control over the House of Representatives. But the harsh reality for Democrats is that they cannot achieve all three of these objectives without increasing their support among white working class Americans\u2014and if Democrats keep telling themselves that \u201cthe problem is just the South,\u201d that support may decrease instead.\n\nHillary Clinton has promised to rebuild the dying Democratic state parties, though I\u2019m sure her stellar numbers on personal qualities aren\u2019t going to help the party on that front. Yes, she might get some Democrats excited, but let\u2019s be honest\u2013Hillary isn\u2019t all that popular.\n\nSo, can Democrats be competitive at the state and local level? It remains to be seen, but it\u2019s certainly possible. But given the demographics of some of these areas, which are firmly Republican, and the fact that the local party apparatuses have withered; it\u2019s quite the hurdle indeed. Yet, Republicans won in areas carried by Obama Tuesday night. Maybe Democrats just need to get over Obamamania and think clearly. On the other hand, and I\u2019ll part with this, the Democratic turnaround in these underreported elections could be just one presidential loss away, according to Vox.\n\nLast Note: On Bevin\u2019s win, National Journal\u2019s Josh Kraushaar wrote how the governor-elect reached out to black voters in the state, and how school choice could be a powerful tool in that outreach.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Says Vox\u2026", "title": "Democrats have been decimated at the state level, but a presidential loss could turn things around", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/11/07/democrats-have-been-decimated-at-the-state-level-but-a-presidential-loss-could-turn-things-around/", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/uploads/2015/11/5/1.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-07T18:01:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-07T16:36:58+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016 election, Democrats, local races, Republicans, state races,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Democrats have been decimated at the state level, but a presidential loss could turn things aroundposted at 1:01 pm on November 7, 2015 by Matt VespaFor the most part, Republicans trounced Democrats in state and local races across the country.\nGiven how the post-2015 election map looks, one could wonder if the Democratic Party can still compete at the state and local level.\nI\u2019ve written previously about how the Obama presidency has left a huge butcher\u2019s bill for the Democratic Party at the state and local level.\nThe Republican State Leadership Committee, who serves at the frontlines of state and local races, noted their massive victory during their conference call yesterday.\nRepublicans are prospering at the state level in ways that suggest that the party\u2019s messaging is far from broken."}
