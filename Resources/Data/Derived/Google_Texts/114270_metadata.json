Americans for Prosperity has published a letter they allege to be from Perkins Coie. The letter appears to threaten revocation of FCC licenses to any station airing an Americans for Prosperity anti-Obamacare television commercial.\n\nAddressed Dear Station Manger, the letter says:\n\n\u201cWe write regarding an advertisement with questionable claims sponsored by American for Prosperity (\u201cAFP\u201d) that may be airing on your stations. This ad, entitled \u201cJulie\u2019s Story: It\u2019s Time to Listen,\u201d claims Julie Boonstra had her \u201cinsurance \u2026 cancelled because of Obamacare,\u201d and that now her \u201cout of pocket costs are so high it\u2019s unaffordable.\u201d For the sake of both FCC licensing requirements and the public interest, your station should immediately require AFP to provide the factual documentation for its claims if you are going to continue airing this advertisement.\u201d\n\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpjyr1x7mC0[/youtube]\n\nThe accuracy of claims made by a female cancer patient who appears in the ad were challenged by the Washington Post on February 20, which is when the Perkins Coie letter is dated. The letter includes a reference to the Washington Post article as part of a warning that television stations could run afoul of FCC regulations which prohibit \u201cfalse and misleading advertising.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: It is 1984: Obama \u2013 FCC wants to send investigators into newsrooms\n\nThis letter echoes the FCC\u2019s recently announced plan to conduct news content studies to \u201cidentify and understand the critical information needs of the American public, with special emphasis on vulnerable-disadvantaged populations\u201d in order to insure that the news being developed is in the best interest of the public.\n\nThis is not the first time intimidation has been used to influence the news. In 2008, in a story on supposed \u201ctruth squads,\u201d News Channel 4 Missouri reported that prosecutors and sheriffs from across Missouri were joining Barack Obama truth squads, whose mission was to remind voters that Barack Obama is a Christian and to respond to any political ads that may violate Missouri ethics laws.\n\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fax2lFzkRTQ[/youtube]\n\nPreviously, attorney Judith Corley of Perkins Coie\u2019s Seattle office reportedly retrieved and couriered back to Washington two certified copies of Obama\u2019s long-form Hawaii birth certificate. This was supposedly provided by Hawaii Department of Health Director Loretta Fuddy, who would later perish in the Pacific Ocean after a December 11, 2013 plane crash.\n\nIt remains unclear if Obama\u2019s repeated mantra, \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health care plan\u201d constitutes false and misleading advertising under those same FCC regulations. If so, one may wonder, does that mean that every television station which broadcast Obama making Affordable Care Act promises which were later broken is at risk of FCC license revocation?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The law firm of Perkins Coie now appears to be in the strong embrace of the FCC and the Democratic Party.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Alan Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "The law firm of Perkins Coie now appears to be in the strong embrace of the FCC and the Democratic Party.", "title": "Perkins Coie becomes strong arm for Obama and FCC", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/perkins-coie-becomes-strong-arm-enforcer-for-obama-and-fcc-10480/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/perkin-coie-letter-640.jpg", "height": 427}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The law firm of Perkins Coie now appears to be in the strong embrace of the FCC and the Democratic Party.", "title": "Perkins Coie becomes strong arm for Obama and FCC", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/perkin-coie-letter-640-435x375.jpg", "creator": "@commdiginews", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "fcc,broadcast station,perkins coie", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-25T03:32:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-25T04:09:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Broadcast Station, FCC, Perkins Coie"}, "article_summary": "ORLANDO, February 24, 2014 \u2014 The law firm of Perkins Coie now appears to be the strong arm of the FCC and the Democratic Party.\nThe letter appears to threaten revocation of FCC licenses to any station airing an Americans for Prosperity anti-Obamacare television commercial.\nAmericans for Prosperity has published a letter they allege to be from Perkins Coie.\nIf so, one may wonder, does that mean that every television station which broadcast Obama making Affordable Care Act promises which were later broken is at risk of FCC license revocation?\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fax2lFzkRTQ[/youtube]Previously, attorney Judith Corley of Perkins Coie\u2019s Seattle office reportedly retrieved and couriered back to Washington two certified copies of Obama\u2019s long-form Hawaii birth certificate."}
