Chris Christie is telling audiences in New Hampshire that it\u2019s time for voters to \u201cget serious\u201d about the GOP presidential campaign and realize that \u201cwe\u2019re not casting a TV show. This is real.\u201d\n\nHis message seems to be that voters enamored of former reality TV star Donald Trump need to start doing some soul-searching about whether they really want him as the country\u2019s next commander-in-chief -- or whether it\u2019s time to put an end to the carnival and gravitate towards more experienced and rational candidates. \u201cShowtime is over,\u201d said Christie, one of the dozen Republican candidates trailing Trump with just six weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nRelated: The Top 10 Political Lies of the Year\n\nA year-end national political survey by Quinnipiac University released Tuesday suggests that Christie\u2019s message already has begun to sink in with voters. While Trump continues to lead the GOP field with 28 percent of likely Republican voters, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas closely trails him with 24 percent and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has 12 percent. Cruz, a darling of evangelical Christians, has picked up eight points since last month and may be virtually tied with Trump given the poll\u2019s 4.4-point margin of error.\n\nMore significantly, Trump trails both Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton and Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in hypothetical general election matchups. Voters in the survey back Clinton over Trump by a 47 percent to 40 percent margin.\n\nAnd 50 percent of survey respondents \u2013 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2013 say they would be embarrassed to have Trump as president, compared with 35 percent who say Clinton would be an embarrassment as president. Among Republicans, 28 percent said they \u201cwould definitely not support\u201d Trump, and only 23 percent would be proud to have Trump as president.\n\nAmericans surveyed say that Clinton has the right kind of experience to be president, 63 to 35 percent, while Trump does not have the have the experience, 67 percent to 29 percent.\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Putin Crush Has Grown Into a Long Distance Bromance\n\nThe survey of 1,140 registered voters was conducted Dec. 16 through 20, after the last nationally televised Republican debate in Las Vegas but before Trump\u2019s latest, outrageous remarks Monday night in Grand Rapids, Mich. That\u2019s where Trump used a crude obscenity to describe Clinton\u2019s loss to President Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary election and repeatedly described as \u201cdisgusting\u201d the fact that Clinton used the bathroom during a commercial break during last Saturday night\u2019s Democratic debate and was late getting back to her podium.\n\n\u201cI know where she went \u2013 it\u2019s disgusting, I don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d Trump told a crowd while scrunching up his face like a nasty kid in a school yard.\n\nIt\u2019s always risky to predict voter response to Trump\u2019s antics and outrageous behavior, whether it was his suggestion that Fox News debate moderator Megyn Kelly was menstruating when she posed a critical question about his past misogynistic comments, or his assertion that Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was less of a Vietnam war hero because he was captured and imprisoned by the enemy, or his mocking of the appearance of a physically disabled New York Times reporter.\n\nEvery time his opponents or the media suggest that he has finally gone too far, his poll numbers pick up. He was berated by former Florida governor Jeb Bush and a few other GOP presidential rivals after Trump called for a temporary ban on all Muslims other than U.S. citizens from entering the country as a precaution against another terrorist attack like the one in San Bernardino, Calif., but it didn\u2019t hurt Trump in subsequent polls. As it turned out many Americans \u2013 both Republicans and some Democrats \u2013 agreed with his proposal.\n\nStill, the Quinnipiac University poll included some findings that suggested it won\u2019t be smooth sailing for Trump in the early going of the 2016 GOP presidential campaign.\n\nRelatetd: Why Trump\u2019s Support Is Even Stronger than You Think\n\n\u201cHalf of American voters say they\u2019d be embarrassed to have Donald Trump as their Commander in Chief and most Americans think he doesn\u2019t have a good chance in November, but there he is still at the top of the Republican heap,\u201d said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, in a statement. \u201cHillary Clinton tops him. Sen. Bernie Sanders hammers him and Sen. Ted Cruz is snapping at his heels. Can a candidate that half the American electorate thinks is an embarrassment win in November?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "New Jersey Gov.", "title": "Would You Be Embarrassed to Have Trump as President?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/Would-You-Be-Embarrassed-Have-Trump-President", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11062015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/Would-You-Be-Embarrassed-Have-Trump-President", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11062015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "New Jersey Gov.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "And 50 percent of survey respondents \u2013 Democrats and Republicans alike \u2013 say they would be embarrassed to have Trump as president, compared with 35 percent who say Clinton would be an embarrassment as president.\nAmong Republicans, 28 percent said they \u201cwould definitely not support\u201d Trump, and only 23 percent would be proud to have Trump as president.\nVoters in the survey back Clinton over Trump by a 47 percent to 40 percent margin.\n\u201cShowtime is over,\u201d said Christie, one of the dozen Republican candidates trailing Trump with just six weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses.\nWhile Trump continues to lead the GOP field with 28 percent of likely Republican voters, Sen.
