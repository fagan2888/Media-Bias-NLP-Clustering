That simple acknowledgement by French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in Monday\u2019s address to the nation announcing the appointment of a new prime minister was again an attempt to change the tone of the economic discourse in the euro zone\u2019s second largest economy.\n\nAfter all, Mr. Hollande was elected on a platform of tax increases and the continuation of France\u2019s generous spending on public services.\n\nIt also helps that it is Manuel Valls, the popular Interior Minister, whom Mr. Hollande has picked for the job. Mr. Valls is known as a hard-charging centrist.\n\nStill, the reaction of investors Tuesday has proved suitably muted after the thumping defeat the Socialists suffered at the polls in the two rounds of municipal elections that concluded over the weekend. The French stock market rallied Tuesday morning in line with other European bourses while the price of French government debt barely budged.\n\nThe main problem Mr. Valls faces in trying to kick-start economic growth in France through lower taxes and cutbacks in public spending are the constraints of the Socialists\u2019 electoral promises. They were reflected inevitably in Mr. Hollande\u2019s speech Monday.\n\nWhile Mr. Hollande promised his new government would press ahead with a so-called \u201cresponsibility pact\u201d involving lower taxes for business to help create new jobs and spur investment, he said Mr. Valls would craft \u201ca solidarity pact\u201d to protect those less well-off.\n\nThat suggests that the growth-promoting reform France so badly needs\u2014of the labor market, the unemployment-benefits system, and healthcare spending\u2014will be difficult for Mr. Valls to pull off, said Eric Chaney, chief economist at AXA Investment Managers. \u201cMr. Valls\u2019 appointment is a step in the right direction,\u201d Mr. Chaney said. \u201cBut the new prime minister is in danger of being hamstrung by the promises Mr. Hollande made to get elected in the first place.\u201d\n\nMr. Valls has little economic room for maneuver. The country\u2019s budget deficit fell to 4.3% of gross domestic product in 2013 but that missed the government\u2019s 4.1% target as revenue disappointed despite tax increases. It leaves Paris well short of the 3% target Brussels expects it to have met next year. Meantime, France\u2019s debt is approaching 95% of economic output, up from 86% in 2011.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "France's new prime minister Manuel Valls is set to try and kick-start economic growth through lower taxes and cutbacks in public spending, but faces constraints due to the Socialists\u2019 electoral promises.", "title": "France\u2019s New Prime Minister Faces Tricky Task", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/04/01/frances-new-prime-minister-faces-tricky-task/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CE072_0401va_P_20140401052810.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "France\u2019s New Prime Minister Faces Tricky Task", "description": "France's new prime minister Manuel Valls is set to try and kick-start economic growth through lower taxes and cutbacks in public spending, but faces constraints due to the Socialists\u2019 electoral promises.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Matthew Curtin", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "France's new prime minister Manuel Valls is set to try and kick-start economic growth through lower taxes and cutbacks in public spending, but faces constraints due to the Socialists\u2019 electoral promises.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-04-01T09:29:08-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/04/01/frances-new-prime-minister-faces-tricky-task/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-18911", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "France's new prime minister Manuel Valls is set to try and kick-start economic growth through lower taxes and cutbacks in public spending, but faces constraints due to the Socialists\u2019 electoral promises.", "title": "France\u2019s New Prime Minister Faces Tricky Task", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/04/01/frances-new-prime-minister-faces-tricky-task/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CE072_0401va_P_20140401052810.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-18911", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-04-01T09:29:08-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0cbe\"", "article_summary": "Newly appointed French Prime Minister Manuel Valls Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesIt is companies that create jobs.\nAfter all, Mr. Hollande was elected on a platform of tax increases and the continuation of France\u2019s generous spending on public services.\nIt also helps that it is Manuel Valls, the popular Interior Minister, whom Mr. Hollande has picked for the job.\nMr. Valls is known as a hard-charging centrist.\n\u201cBut the new prime minister is in danger of being hamstrung by the promises Mr. Hollande made to get elected in the first place.\u201dMr. Valls has little economic room for maneuver."}
