Todd Courser is heard on audio recordings trying to concoct a cover-up for his affair with Rep. Cindy Gamrat.\n\nThe Michigan lawmaker who allegedly tried faking a homosexual affair \u2014 to cover up an actual affair he was having with a colleague \u2014 now says he wanted to \u201cexpose\u201d blackmailers who were onto his cheating.\n\n\u201cIt was not my finest moment,\u201d state Rep. Todd Courser (R-Lansing) said in a half-hour recorded statement he released Monday responding to the tryst twist.\n\n\u201cIt was the only option that I felt would be unpredicted by the blackmailer.\u201d\n\nCourser accuses his former aide Ben Graham of working with the blackmailers to leak info about the affair with Rep.

Young/AP)\n\nCourser said he and his wife had been working through the sordid affair for months and it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d the information became public.\n\nHe also says he refuses to resign, as doing so would be \u201csubmitting to the authority of the establishment machine.\u201d\n\nState House officials have seized computers and records from Courser and Gamrat\u2019s offices for an investigation of whether they used taxpayer resources during their affair, the Detroit News reported.\n\nRep. Todd Courser allegedly wrote an email falsely outing himself for an imaginary encounter with a male prostitute. The email was an attempt to divert attention from his actual affair.\n\n\u201cIf we discover anything illegal, that will certainly be turned over for review by the Attorney General\u2019s Office,\u201d Speaker Kevin Cotter said.\n\nCotter also slammed Courser\u2019s statement, telling the Detroit Free Press it is \u201canother in a long series of deflections.\u201d\n\nCourser\u2019s convoluted cover-up emerged last week in audio recordings released to the Detroit News. In the recordings, Courser is heard trying to convince Graham to release an email Courser wrote himself, falsely accusing himself of being caught in a nightclub with a male prostitute. The email called him a \u201cGodless addiction monster\u201d and \u201cbi-sexual porn addicted sex deviant.\u201d\n\nGraham refused, and then was fired last month.\n\nThe emails were an attempt to turn attention from Courser\u2019s ongoing affair with Gamrat, and destroy his reputation in hopes of preserving hers.\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
