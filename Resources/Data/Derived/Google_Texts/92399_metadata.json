He thanks the website for showing him how to do so.\n\nBut when the operators respond, he writes back in more detail, explaining that he is teetering on the verge of a breakdown and fears he might do harm to others.\n\n\u201cI will kill and kill until someone kills me,\u201d he writes, adding that suicide would prevent the violence.\n\nThree months later, on Aug. 25, he reportedly lashed out physically at another boy during an altercation. He then walked home and took his life.\n\nThe Topeka Capital-Journal has decided not to publish the name of the website.\n\nWebsites like the one Michael accessed aren\u2019t run by professionals trained to help people struggling with thoughts of suicide. And for children and adolescents, some say their existence may pose risks.\n\nWalt Thiessen, clinical director of the Kansas Children\u2019s Service League in Wichita, said suicide can seem like an easy way out for adolescents experiencing difficult times.\n\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t able to think about death being forever,\u201d Thiessen said. \u201cAt that point in time, they just think, \u2018I\u2019m in pain and I need to get rid of this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThough the website operators describe the site as neutral, he said the mere act of presenting suicide methods isn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNot for kids, no,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re giving them information that, if a kid wants to hurt themselves, makes it sound like it\u2019s not that big a deal. It minimizes the seriousness.\u201d\n\nMany states have laws against assisting suicide, but prosecutors would have to determine whether a website\u2019s actions fit the definition or fall under the protections of free speech.\n\n\u201cIn Kansas, it requires specifically helping them to do it,\u201d said Todd Hiatt, senior assistant district attorney at the Shawnee County District Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nForcing someone also would count, he said.\n\nIn their emails to Michael, two operators or volunteers calling themselves \u201cG\u201d and \u201cH\u201d recognize that he seems to be young and living with his parents. They suggest he consider seeking help or talking to a friend or professional.\n\nAt the same time, G ends an email with the words, \u201cBest wishes in this life or what follows.\u201d\n\nThe website's stated aim is to be \u201cimpartial\u201d and help readers \u201cmake whatever choice is right\u201d for them. It lists suicide methods and bears suicide-related imagery, but also includes a links page with suicide prevention hotlines, and information about therapy.\n\nAlthough a disclaimer says visitors must be 18 or older to enter the site, the site offers testimonials from what the operators say are children as young as 14, describing it as helpful. The testimonials say the site has repeatedly convinced people not to kill themselves.\n\nThe Pottawatomie County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which investigated Michael\u2019s death, declined this past week to give details of the investigation but said that \u201call aspects\u201d of the case were explored and the investigation is no longer active.\n\nThe website\u2019s operators state on the site that it is based in Great Britain.\n\nTheir site is hosted by ICDSoft Hong Kong. Their registrant information is blocked by a service called WhoIs Privacy Protection Service, with contact information in Bellevue, Wash. Website registrants can pay the service to keep their names out of publicly available databases meant to ensure Internet transparency.\n\nAs The Capital-Journal prepared to go to press, it received a response from the site.\n\nIn an email, H says the site doesn\u2019t encourage people to kill themselves.\n\n\u201cIndeed, we aim to discourage suicide,\u201d H writes.\n\nH writes that there is no evidence that websites like the one in question \u201chave had any significant impact on suicide rates.\u201d\n\nThe site is \u201cdesigned to reach the very desperate, and try to make them think twice before they try and kill themselves. We have strong statistical evidence from a large sample of data that the site achieves this aim.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of help sites out there,\u201d H writes. \u201cBut people feeling suicidal, of which I was once one, do not want to look for help \u2014 they want to search for information.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have asked a number of people, and consistently am told that the information on the site would not push someone over the edge,\u201d H writes. \u201cIt takes a lot of self harm desire to actually go through with suicide, and that sort of desire would not come from this website.\u201d\n\n\u201cMichael emailed us, we told him to get professional help. He emailed us again, and we told him that a second time,\u201d H writes.\n\nH declined to provide a full name or contact information.\n\nFor legal reasons, H said the site can\u2019t encourage minors to visit it, but that based on feedback from readers, teens find the site helpful.\n\nH said the site\u2019s operators hadn\u2019t contacted Michael\u2019s family because the confidentiality of visitors is important and because the site is run by volunteers and draws a high volume of visitors.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Education, Local, Celia Llopis-Jepsen", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "The only people who knew that 13-year-old Michael Kuhn was thinking about suicide were the operators of a website that professes to be neutral on the matter but gives readers detailed instructions on killing themselves.", "title": "Suicide site responds to Capital-Journal questions", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2013-10-19/suicide-site-responds-capital-journal-questions", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/photos/12720471.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "The only people who knew that 13-year-old Michael Kuhn was thinking about suicide were the operators of a website that professes to be neutral on the matter but gives readers detailed instructions on killing themselves.Although Michael wrote to them with his real name and an easily traceable email address, describing his impulses either to kill others or himself, the operators of the site didn't contact authorities or his family."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1ac\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIndeed, we aim to discourage suicide,\u201d H writes.\n\u201cThere\u2019s several cases where children learned to do it through online websites.\u201dIn two emails to the website, Michael indicated he was suicidal.\nHe emailed us again, and we told him that a second time,\u201d H writes.\n\u201cI will kill and kill until someone kills me,\u201d he writes, adding that suicide would prevent the violence.\nIt lists suicide methods and bears suicide-related imagery, but also includes a links page with suicide prevention hotlines, and information about therapy."}
