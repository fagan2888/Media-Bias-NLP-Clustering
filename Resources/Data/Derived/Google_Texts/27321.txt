Ohio Gov. and Republican presidential candidate John Kasich was asked on Meet the Press Sunday morning about his controversial comments regarding Hispanics, telling host Chuck Todd that he believes they play an important role in the U.S.

During a campaign event the day after last Wednesday’s GOP presidential debate, Kasich praised Latinos in a way that many viewed as stereotyping. “A lot of them do jobs that they’re willing to do, and that’s why in the hotel, you leave a little tip,” he said.

The remarks drew the ire of Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, who said in a tweet in Spanish that Kasich is “another product of the Party of Trump.”

Seeking to clarify those comments, Kasich said his position on immigration reform is “very reasonable” — perhaps a swipe at his Republican rivals, some of whom have taken more hardline stances.

“I’ve always said that Hispanics are such a critical part of the fabric of the United States,” he said. “They occupy jobs from top to bottom. They’re so critical to our country. They’re God-fearing. And they’re hard-working. And if I need to clarify what I meant by that, I’m glad to do it.”
