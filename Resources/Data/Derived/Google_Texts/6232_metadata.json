Seven-footers don\u2019t easily disappear. But Gonzaga\u2019s center couldn\u2019t find his antagonist. Then he popped into view.\n\nUtah\u2019s Jakob Poeltl, one of the biggest big men in college basketball, squared up a jump shot. The 7-foot center, a likely NBA lottery pick, was stuck on the perimeter settling for jumpers. And Sabonis tracked him down.\n\nIn a battle of two of the best college centers in America, Sabonis settled the score in one quick second-half transition Saturday night in Denver in a second-round NCAA Tournament game. He blocked Poeltl\u2019s shot, raced down the court, then spun around in the post for an easy layup.\n\nAnd just like that, No. 11 seed Gonzaga stunned No. 3 seed Utah in an impressive 82-59 victory at the Pepsi Center.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very talented,\u201d Sabonis said of his fellow center. \u201cBut our point was to win the game.\u201d\n\nSabonis scored 19 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. And more important, he held Poeltl to five points, his lowest total of the season. Eric McLellan nailed a game-high 22 and wingman Kyle Wiltjer hit 17 for Gonzaga, which shot 55 percent and was never threatened after breaking to a 15-point halftime lead.\n\nSabonis was the last center standing in Colorado after the NCAA plopped three of the best bigs in one corner of the tournament bracket. Purdue\u2019s A.J. Hammons fell away in a first-round upset Thursday. And Poeltl will go home early.\n\n\u201cIf you haven\u2019t faced and felt him up close like that,\u201d Gonzaga coach Mark Few said of Sabonis, \u201cthere\u2019s an adjustment period.\u201d\n\nGonzaga advanced to a second consecutive Sweet 16 and will look to make it consecutive Elite 8 appearances. Every year, they are the loudest whisper in America, the little school from Washington state that can\u2019t possibly play with the best.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of desperation,\u201d Few said. \u201cOur backs have been pressed against the wall. It\u2019s fight or flight.\u201d\n\nAnd this Gonzaga edition barely got into the tournament. The Zags needed to beat top-seeded Saint Mary\u2019s in the West Coast Conference championship game to even qualify for the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really comforting and freeing,\u201d Few said of Gonzaga\u2019s low seed. \u201cWe can go into the games and just let it rip.\u201d\n\nThe Zags made easy work of the first two rounds, winning by a combined 39 points. They routed Seton Hall by 16 points on Thursday.\n\nSabonis was in the middle of each rout. He recorded 21 points and 16 rebounds against Seton Hall, the Big East champion. The sophomore son of Arvydas Sabonis will soon follow his father, the Lithuanian legend and a basketball Hall of Famer, to the NBA.\n\nHis tournament audition should be swinging in Sabonis\u2019 favor. He dominated the paint, outrebounding Poeltl 10-4. When Poeltl drew a second foul and slinked to the bench midway through the first half, Gonzaga took advantage for a 15-2 run before intermission.\n\n\u201cSabonis got the best of Jakob,\u201d Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak said, adding that Poeltl played with an injured ankle.\n\nThe Bulldogs led by as many as 30 in the second half. Utah held a lead for just 20 seconds early in the game. Wiltjer, a 6-10 forward, hassled the Utes on the perimeter, hitting 3-for-4 from 3-point range.\n\nFew left his starters in until the two-minute mark.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they\u2019re in the Final Four,\u201d Krystkowiak said.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Domantas Sabonis stands tall in Gonzaga\u2019s victory over Utah to move to Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament", "title": "Domantas Sabonis stands tall in Gonzaga\u2019s victory over Utah to move to Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/domantas-sabonis-stands-tall-in-gonzagas-victory-over-utah-to-move-to-sweet-16-in-ncaa-tournament/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__516583378p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__516583378p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T20:46:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:42:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "3 seed Utah in an impressive 82-59 victory at the Pepsi Center.\n11 seed Gonzaga stunned No.\n\u201cSabonis got the best of Jakob,\u201d Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak said, adding that Poeltl played with an injured ankle.\nSabonis was the last center standing in Colorado after the NCAA plopped three of the best bigs in one corner of the tournament bracket.\nThe Zags needed to beat top-seeded Saint Mary\u2019s in the West Coast Conference championship game to even qualify for the NCAA Tournament."}
