She came upon several steamer trunks, she said.\n\nTwelve years later, her grandmother died, and she got the trunks.\n\n\u201cThey had been up there for 50 years, they\u2019re covered in mold, they\u2019re disgusting and I go home \u2026 and start unpacking this trunk, which is crammed full of letters, checkbooks, handwritten 19th-century insurance policies.\u201d\n\nMost of the letters are from her great-uncle M.E. Carter Jr. He described for his family in Memphis his life \u2014 and the lives and deaths of his friends and other pilots \u2014 in detailed letters that vividly portray the early days of aviation.\n\nCarter joined the U.S. Air Service shortly after America entered the war on April 6, 1917.\n\nAmong those who joined him was William Howard Stovall, his sister\u2019s husband and Solzan\u2019s grandfather, who went on to become a WWI flying ace credited with six confirmed aerial victories, according to the Aerodrome, a website dedicated to WWI aces and aircraft.\n\nCarter taught fledgling fliers at a base outside Paris, and later became the chief of transfer, making him responsible for sending pilots and planes to the frontlines, Solzan said.\n\nWhen he assigned Stovall and another friend to a battle-ready squadron, \u201cHe writes to his mother that he cried when he parted with them, because he knew he was likely sending them to their death,\u201d Solzan said.\n\nHe describes learning to fly in \u201cflying coffins,\u201d planes loaded with gasoline and constructed of wood covered in cotton canvas that was shellacked with a highly flammable lacquer. Pilots often carried a gun to kill themselves if they were shot down rather than risk burning to death.\n\nSuch documentation can be invaluable to historians, Madigan said.\n\n\u201cSo many times we have the stories of the people in charge or the inventors, but we don\u2019t necessarily have the stories of those who used it day to day,\u201d Madigan said.\n\nThe war was hard on Carter, Solzan said. He died in 1941 an alcoholic and probably had post-traumatic stress disorder, she said.\n\nStovall went on to be deputy chief of staff for personnel for the Eighth Air Force in Britain during WWII.\n\nSolzan hopes to develop a book and documentary based on the letters. She thinks they could provide the underpinnings for a mini-series or film. Ultimately, she said, the collection belongs in an archive where scholars have access to them.\n\nShe added: \u201cWorld War I is so under researched that for scholars to have information like this is really important.\u201d\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee\n\nUpdated May 25, 2015 at 10:00 a.m.: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Marie Solzan\u2019s name.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Letters home from World War I color story of early aviation for Denver woman", "title": "Letters home from World War I color story of early aviation for Denver woman", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/24/letters-home-from-world-war-i-color-story-of-early-aviation-for-denver-woman/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150524__20150525_A4_CDXXLETTERSp1.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150524__20150525_A4_CDXXLETTERSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-24T18:08:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T10:07:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "WATCH: World War I letters discovered in a grandmother\u2019s attic\u201cThis is important, a series of family letters that is not common.\nSolzan first found the letters, along with pictures and other memorabilia, when she was a 10-year-old exploring the attic.\nShe added: \u201cWorld War I is so under researched that for scholars to have information like this is really important.\u201dTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcgheeUpdated May 25, 2015 at 10:00 a.m.: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Marie Solzan\u2019s name.\nStovall went on to be deputy chief of staff for personnel for the Eighth Air Force in Britain during WWII.\nCarter joined the U.S. Air Service shortly after America entered the war on April 6, 1917."}
