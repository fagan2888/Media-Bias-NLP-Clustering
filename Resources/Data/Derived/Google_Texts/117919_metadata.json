Rob Portman's announcement that he will not run for president. A favorite among the media for his studious ways and willingness to engage, he barely registered in national polls of potential voters.\n\nYet Ohioans have had four years to get to know him as a senator, so local reaction was worth observing. Commenters on Cleveland.com, admittedly a selective group, were quick to attach labels to the Ohio Republican, with \"RINO\" being a favorite.\n\nRINO stands for Republican in Name Only, a slur used by conservatives when they believe a Republican has crossed an immovable line or two. It's a subjective standard, and some use it against Portman because he no longer opposes gay marriage, although his preferred method for change \u2013 the ballot box and state legislatures \u2013 is also championed by some conservatives in legal circles.\n\nAnd it's worth noting that in Washington, some Democrats regard Portman as just the opposite of a RINO \u2013 as a lawmaker who talks of compromise and moderation yet manages to vote like a conservative. To them, Portman is a conservative draped in a moderate 's clothing.\n\nSo which is it?\n\nHere is how outside groups regard Portman. Most of their ratings are based on votes, and interest groups pick the votes they consider important and ignore others.\n\nOverall party voting: Portman votes with his party 88 percent of the time, according to Open Congress, a tracking service of the Sunlight Foundation, which examines the actions of lawmakers and politicians. But that's counting all four years of his Senate service. Counting just the last two years, Portman comes in at 93.8 percent. That's so high that only one other senator, Richard Burr of North Carolina, exceeded it, with a party unity score of 94.9 percent.\n\nFor comparison, Rand Paul of Kentucky votes with his party 81 percent of the time, and did so 83 percent of the time in the last two years. Ted Cruz of Texas votes with the GOP 84 percent of the time, or 83.6 percent of the time in the last two years.\n\nBut that's counting every vote the Senate has taken, and not every vote is equal. Some votes are to honor a winning sports team. Some are to defund the Affordable Care Act. That's why the interest group ratings can be more instructive.\n\nFreedomWorks: This group is associated with the Tea Party movement, and it issues points \u2013 from 0 to 100 \u2013 based on votes that comport with its principles. Portman this year has earned a 67, a weak score compared with the perfect 100 won by Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Mike Lee of Utah.\n\nTen more senators scored above 90, including Marco Rubio of Florida, John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona and John Cornyn of Texas. Portman's problem, according to FreedomWorks' methodology, is that he voted for, among other things, a farm and food stamp bill that conservatives consider wasteful. And he voted to extend unemployment benefits that critics say were supposed to be temporary and promoted inverse incentives to stay jobless.\n\nLast year, Portman did slightly worse on the FreedomWorks scorecard, earning a 64. This was partly because he supported certain bills to fund the government, and he voted for a measure that would allow states to collect taxes on some Internet sales.\n\nHeritage Action: This is the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. Portman's score in the current Congress is only 55 percent. That's lower than the 64 percent the group gives to all Senate Republicans on average.\n\nThe error of Portman's ways, according to Heritage Action, stems from such things as voting to reauthorize and expand the Violence Against Women Act, which some conservatives say covers crimes that should be handled by local and state law enforcement rather than federal authorities. Portman also lost points for his support of the Internet sales tax \u2013 an issue likely to come up again in the next week -- and for approving a bill to spend billions on harbors, dams and flood-prevention programs.\n\n\"In a time of record deficits, this is no time to be spending billions more on many activities that would be more appropriately funded and managed by states, localities, or the private sector,\" Heritage Action said at the time of the vote.\n\nSo Portman is a big-government, big-spending liberal \u2013 or is he? Consider:\n\nThe League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, gives Portman a 22 percent lifetime score, and issued him a score of only 8 percent in 2013.\n\nHe voted to extend the Keystone XL pipeline, and supported weakening the EPA's authority. Portman and other Republicans say the EPA keeps passing regulations to reduce emissions, reductions they say will be hard to meet without shuttering coal-burning power plants in states like Ohio or forcing them to make expensive upgrades. Environmentalists and the American Lung Association disagree, saying improved respiratory health will more than compensate for the cost.\n\nAmericans for Democratic Action, a liberal group, gave Portman a 15 percent rating in 2013 \u2013 compared with a 95 percent approval for Ohio's other senator, Democrat Sherrod Brown. Then again, the Republican average was 9 percent, so if you want to nitpick, you can -- although 15 percent is pretty lousy.\n\nThe American Conservative Union, which says it is the oldest and largest conservative grassroots group in the nation, gave Portman a 64 percent score in 2013 and a 76 percent score in 2012. These scores are unquestionably on the moderate \u2013 you might say liberal \u2013 end of the spectrum for Republicans, but consider how things can change: McCain of Arizona got only a 52 in 2013, yet a 92 the year before.\n\nCompare this with the score of Ohio's Brown: 4 in 2013 and 0 in 2012.\n\nDoes this make Portman a RINO, a moderate, a Tea Party Republican?\n\nOn what do you base your opinion?
