This is one of our community based organizations that we do business with. They have a lot of events here and some other areas also. We are always a sponsor at these events. It gives us the opportunity to reach out to the communities and the families and the neighborhoods to offer health insurance to people who might not have or might not know areas that we can offer health insurance to.\n\nTell my audience a little more about the Health & Wellness Fair. What is it really all about?\n\nCrystal: It\u2019s about letting the communities know that health is important and to come out and see all the vendors that are here and go to the tables and see what kind of benefits are available to them. We have people taking blood pressure, we have people doing diabetes screening and we have service organizations offering health insurance. A lot of people don\u2019t know if they might qualify and some of these benefits are free to communities as well, so that is why we are here to let people know that we are available for service.\n\nTell my audience about your company.\n\nCrystal: We are HealthPlus Amerigroup. We have been around for thirty-five years. We are located in Staten Island, Nassau and Suffolk County and throughout the five boroughs including the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan.\n\nIf we want to find out more information about your company, where can we go?\n\nCrystal: http://healthplus.amerigroup.com\n\nI also had the opportunity to speak to the new General Consulate of New York, Maria Isabel Nieto, of the Colombian Consulate.\n\nGeneral Consulate of New York, Maria Isabel Nieto, of the Colombian Consulate (left) with Entertainment Journalist Cognac Wellerlane at the Health And Wellness Fair on Saturday, March 14, 2015, at the Freeport Recreation Center\n\nTell my audience, it is so important for us all to become more aware of our health, as a big supporter what should we all do?\n\nMaria: In order to have good health, eat well, drink plenty of water. Unfortunately there is a problem of obesity, we should pay attention to proper nutrition. Unfortunately a lot of immigrants are not really clear so they are afraid of approaching the health institutions. Coming to fairs like this and taking advantage of the programs of health is something completely different from immigration so they shouldn\u2019t be afraid. Come to these kind of fairs, go to your nearest hospital to get advice on how you can have a healthier life.\n\nPrevent all those health ailments that plague us all.\n\nMaria: Absolutely!\n\nTell my audience where we can go to find out more about the Colombian Consulate?\n\nMaria: the Colombian Consulate is located in Manhattan, 10 East 46th Street between Madison and Fifth Avenue. We have a website http://www.columbianconsulate.com\n\nThe event was promoted by J&A Global Corp.
