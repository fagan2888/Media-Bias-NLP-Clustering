The decision was \u201cbased on the growing radicalization of economic policy over the last two months in the context of a sustained decline in international reserves and the continued high levels of political polarization,\u201d the firm wrote in its report.\n\nMoody\u2019s also downgraded the South American country, saying it\u2019s faced with a \u201cmaterially higher risk of an economic and financial collapse\u201d due to government policies that have \u201cexacerbated\u201d Venezuela\u2019s problems.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThose policies, particularly a strict 2012 labor law that requires companies to seek government approval for to fire employees, are weighing on Venezuela\u2019s economy, said Diego Moya-Ocampos, senior Latin American analyst for IHS Global Insight.\n\nBusinesses are also being forced to limit workers\u2019 hours to 40 a week, down from a previous cap at 44 hours.\n\nThe laws have proven to be a major roadblock for companies that would otherwise be interested in making an investment in Venezuela, which rarely, if ever, gives employers the go-ahead to fire a worker. As a result, companies are forced to pay employees to do little or no work at shuttered factories.\n\n\u201cThe labor law is having a significant impact on the competitiveness of corporations operating in Venezuela,\u201d Moya-Ocampos explained.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s economy has also been beaten down by lower oil prices, as the country relies heavily on oil to drive economic growth. Data from the World Bank shows oil accounts for 96% of Venezuela\u2019s exports and nearly half of its revenue.\n\nS&P also blamed the growing headaches on Maduro\u2019s unwillingness to develop policies in consultation with the private sector. In a move seen as shifting Venezuela\u2019s focus even more toward oil, Maduro named oil minister Rafael Ramirez as the vice president of economic affairs.\n\nCompetitiveness Lacking\n\nWith labor laws and other regulations proving too big of a hurdle, Venezuela\u2019s private sector has continued to shrink from mounting pressure on local businesses.\n\nVenezuela already had the most restrictive hiring and firing policies in the world, according to the Global Economic Forum. In the group\u2019s Global Competitiveness Index for 2013-14, Venezuela dropped eight spots to 134th out of 148 countries.\n\nMoya-Ocampos said the oil-rich nation is \u201cnot favoring local production of goods,\u201d instead driving companies away and relying on imports.\n\nMaduro, who took over the country after the death of Hugo Chavez in March 2013, has hit back at other nations responding to the growing political and economic crisis in the country. After expelling three U.S. diplomats, he broke ties with Panama while Venezuela\u2019s foreign minister claimed the country isn\u2019t responsible for 90% of a $1 billion debt owed to Panama.\n\nVenezuela imports goods from Panama\u2019s Colon free trade zone, from which clothing, electronics and other products are shipped.\n\n\u201cThe stringent regulatory burden is contributing to a shortage of basic goods and the whole economic mess,\u201d Moya-Ocampos said. \u201cIt has played a role in leading Venezuela to three years of economic contraction.\u201d\n\nIn a recent report on the developments in Venezuela, Moya-Ocampos wrote that its economy is projected to contract by 1.7% this year and 0.9% in 2015. The country will also continue to face higher inflation and shortages of goods, while the ongoing protests are likely just the first wave of a political crisis, he added.", "article_metadata":
