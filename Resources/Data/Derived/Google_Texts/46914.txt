Quick Facts About Cover Oregon

With the federal Affordable Care Act, there are changes to the health insurance system that make it easier for people to get insurance. Cover Oregon makes public or private health insurance available to individuals and families who do not have insurance, or who want to find less expensive insurance. Having health coverage protects individuals and families from large medical bills. It also makes it easier to get medical care at a clinic or hospital.

People cannot be denied coverage because of pre-existing health conditions. There is no physical exam required to qualify for insurance.

Recent immigrants and undocumented residents can still qualify for some health insurance (CAWEM).

There is no longer a lottery system for the Oregon Health Plan (OHP). Those eligible for OHP can enroll all year round through Cover Oregon.

Those who do not qualify for OHP may qualify for financial assistance to pay for other health insurance plans.

Starting this year, with a few exemptions, everyone is required to have health insurance.
