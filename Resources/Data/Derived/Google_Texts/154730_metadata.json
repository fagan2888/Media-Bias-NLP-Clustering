He has been very, very strong.'\n\nAsked to return to the original question of how he would interview future justices, Trump would say only: 'We want smart, conservative and we want people that are truly in love with the Constitution.'\n\nDuring later parts of the discussion, Trump attacked Obama's executive order forestalling the deportation of some illegal immigrants from America, promising to gut it.\n\nTrump also blasted government regulation, singling out water regulations in particular.\n\n'There's no water pressure,\" he said. 'The problem is you stand under the shower five times as long wasting more water than if you used the other one.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "The,Donald,attacks,disgraceful,Supreme,Court,chief,calling,disappointment,conservatives,backing,Obamacare", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3357909/The-Donald-attacks-disgraceful-Supreme-Court-chief-calling-disappointment-conservatives-backing-Obamacare.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Quizzed by Attorney General Alan Wilson on how he would vet future Supreme Court Judges, Trump instead took the opportunity to criticize Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.", "title": "Trump attacks 'disgraceful' Supreme Court chief Justice John Roberts", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3357909/The-Donald-attacks-disgraceful-Supreme-Court-chief-calling-disappointment-conservatives-backing-Obamacare.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/13/02/2F529ED700000578-0-image-a-66_1449975412360.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3357909/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3357909/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3357909, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "The,Donald,attacks,disgraceful,Supreme,Court,chief,calling,disappointment,conservatives,backing,Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-12-13T03:10:09.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Chris+Pleasance+For+Dailymail.com", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-12-13T13:03:00.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "The Donald attacks disgraceful Supreme Court chief calling disappointment conservatives backing Obamacare"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Quizzed by Attorney General Alan Wilson on how he would vet future Supreme Court Judges, Trump instead took the opportunity to criticize Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.", "title": "Trump attacks 'disgraceful' Supreme Court chief Justice John Roberts", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3357909/The-Donald-attacks-disgraceful-Supreme-Court-chief-calling-disappointment-conservatives-backing-Obamacare.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/13/02/2F529ED700000578-0-image-a-66_1449975412360.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2015/12/08/5242533474717709929/1024x576_5242533474717709929.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Quizzed by Attorney General Alan Wilson on how he would vet future Supreme Court Judges, Trump instead took the opportunity to criticize Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts."}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump has hit out against Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts over his voting record on Obamacare during a question and answer session.\nSpeaking in front of around 4,000 supporters in South Carolina, Trump told them: 'Justice Roberts really let us down.\nThomas has been a consistent source of irritation for Republicans since being appointed to the top spot at the Supreme Court ten years ago.\nQuizzed by Attorney General Alan Wilson over how he would vet potential future Supreme Court judges, Trump went off topic to give his opinion on the current crop of top legal minds.\nHe branded Roberts 'disgraceful' and a 'disappointment' to conservatives, which adding that Associate Justice Clarence Thomas has been 'strong and consistent' in his voting record."}
