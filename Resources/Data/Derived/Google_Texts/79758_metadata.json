The town needs to put up its arm and say \u2018we are here and we are great\u2019.\u201d\n\nSouthend is already adapting to the demands of London commuters with swanky apartments on offer at Nirvana, in The Leas, Westcliff, and at Eden Point, in Broadway West, Leigh.\n\nSome properties at Eden Point are selling for upwards of \u00a31million, but only three remain.\n\nNirvana hasn\u2019t been so successful as it has been the subject of legal wrangles since it was completed in 2012, but it was given a recent shot in the arm by entrepreneur David Lloyd, who plans to add a sauna, gym, swimming pool and rooftop terrace to it.\n\nMr Pattersson is confident his apartments will be able to compete. He said: \u201cThey will be higher quality, with a robust design, and we can offer apartments next to the sea with secure parking.\u201d\n\nAlso included in the plans is 7,000sq ft of restaurant space.\n\nIf permission is granted in the coming months, demolition will start in November, with the new development taking two years to build.\n\nExpected prices for the new Esplanade development will range from \u00a3600,000 to \u00a3800,000.\n\nOne million to shore up cliffs\n\nRedab properties is putting forward more than \u00a31million to shore up subsiding cliffs behind its development.\n\nThe Swedish firm, which bought the Esplanade pub in September, intends to plough \u00a31.25million into stabilising the cliff slippage behind the building \u2013 a long-term issue.\n\nIt will propose the project as part of a planning sweetener to Southend Council, instead of offering up any social housing.\n\nThe architect behind the design of the building said, if the cliffs were shored up, it could create a tree-lined \u201cwinter garden\u201d for residents, which would act as the entrance to the apartments.\n\nBen Stagg, from Stagg Architects, said: \u201cWe will go for wooden beams on the outside that give a soft edge to the development, and we will put in greenery surrounding it to make it an attractive entrance for tenants.\u201d\n\nRedab boss CG Pattersson added: \u201cAs part of the construction, essential piling will be required to stabilise the cliff area and, subject to planning approval, this will be handled to cause the least amount of disruption to both local residents and wildlife.\u201d\n\nIf agreed by Southend Council, the cliff works will be in tandem with the authority\u2019s own project to stabilise the cliffs below Clifton Drive in Westcliff, with \u00a3460,000 earmarked in the budget.\n\nThe site already has planning approval for a 58-bedroom block of flats, but no operators have come forward and the Echo understands the council has some reservations about losing the site as a hotel.\n\nCGI of the winter gardens entrance to the apartments\n\nSouthend Council\u2019s deputy leader Graham Longley said: \u201cThe council welcomes any development in the town which helps the future of Southend and contributes towards its needs.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working with the developers to ensure we get a development which is acceptable.\u201d\n\nRedab claims its development will also generate up to 35 per cent renewable energy, including solar panels and underground heat pumps.\n\nPearl Jam played first ever European gig at Esplanade\n\nPearl Jam\n\nTHE Esplanade pub was a pillar of the local music scene for many years.\n\nUS grunge titans Pearl Jam, who have sold 60 million records worldwide, are the most stellar name to rock up at the venue.\n\nThe band picked the Southend pub to play their first European gig back in 1992, when they were touring with their seminal Ten album.\n\nThe five-piece grunge band have gone on to play some of the biggest festivals in the world, and have packed out arenas.\n\nSouth Essex pub rockers Dr Feelgood also started gigging there 40 years ago, and played the venue twice in the Nineties.\n\nDesign won't please everyone - architect\n\nTHE architect behind the grandiose plans admits its design won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but said Southend needs to move with the times.\n\nThe new design will replace a 100-year-old building, in another example of the borough losing some of the more traditional parts of its seafront.\n\nThe likes of Marine Plaza, Nirvana, and Adventure Island have all sought to bring Southend into the 21st century, while the area is seeing a rise in fine-dining outlets such as steak and lobster house Bourgee.\n\nBen Stagg, of Londonbased Stagg Architects, said: \u201cThis part of the landscape is very subjective and this might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea.\n\n\u201cSome may want to keep the Victorian look of the building, but I don\u2019t think that will be right. This site gave us an opportunity to build a high-quality contemporary building. A lot of people like that kind of modern look.\u201d\n\nBen Stagg, Coletee Bailey, and CG Petterson outside the existing building\n\nArts group to create landmark mural on side of building\n\nREDAB will give an arts group \u00a340,000 to create a huge mural on the site of its development.\n\nThe firm has asked Metal Culture to come up with a huge 10x5m artwork.\n\nColette Bailey, artistic director at Metal, said: \u201cThis would mean we could create an artwork that would be a landmark piece and attract interest from all over the world.\n\n\u201cRedab is prepared to offer Metal a realistic budget which would allow us to commission a world renowned artist.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "PLUSH apartments will soon become the norm in Southend as more and more Londoners flock to the coast, according to the businessman spending\u2026", "title": "PICTURES: See the dramatic \u00a315million transformation planned for iconic Southend pub", "og": {"site_name": "Echo", "name": "PICTURES: See the dramatic \u00a315million transformation planned for iconic Southend pub", "title": "PICTURES: See the dramatic \u00a315million transformation planned for iconic Southend pub", "url": "http://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/11808848.PICTURES__See_the_dramatic___15million_transformation_planned_for_iconic_Southend_pub/", "image": "http://www.echo-news.co.uk/resources/images/3554833/", "type": "website", "description": "PLUSH apartments will soon become the norm in Southend as more and more Londoners flock to the coast, according to the businessman spending\u2026"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.echo-news.co.uk/resources/images/3554833/"}, "description": "PLUSH apartments will soon become the norm in Southend as more and more Londoners flock to the coast, according to the businessman spending\u2026", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "PICTURES: See the dramatic \u00a315million transformation planned for iconic Southend pub"}, "fb": {"app_id": 129009113837493}, "vr": {"category": "News", "type": "Text"}, "keywords": "Echo, Essex, Southend, Basildon, Canvey, Benfleet, Rayleigh, Wickford, Billericay, Thurrock, Leigh, Rochford, Stanford, Corringham, A127, A13, pier, Castle Point, Hadleigh, Thundersley, Thorpe Bay, Southchurch, Prittlewell, Westcliff, Eastwood, c2c", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "News, Southend News, Plush Apartments To Become The Norm In Southend As Iconic Pub Is Demolished"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfbd1\"", "article_summary": "The band picked the Southend pub to play their first European gig back in 1992, when they were touring with their seminal Ten album.\nPearl Jam played first ever European gig at EsplanadePearl JamTHE Esplanade pub was a pillar of the local music scene for many years.\nPLUSH apartments will soon become the norm in Southend as more and more Londoners flock to the coast, according to the businessman spending \u00a315million on transforming an iconic pub.\nExpected prices for the new Esplanade development will range from \u00a3600,000 to \u00a3800,000.\nThe Swedish firm, which bought the Esplanade pub in September, intends to plough \u00a31.25million into stabilising the cliff slippage behind the building \u2013 a long-term issue."}
