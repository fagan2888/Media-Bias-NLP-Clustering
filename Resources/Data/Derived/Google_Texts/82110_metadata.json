If he had his way, his popular restaurant would be called RiceHaus instead of BaoHaus. But alas, he is resigned to the fact that bread-like foods are the way to coherence, which he wishes Obama knew. Obamacare? Just add bread.\n\nWhen I walked into his talk at the University, I think I expected something more along the lines of a cute powerpoint about his childhood and how it translated into the new ABC sitcom Fresh Off the Boat, based on his memoir of the same name. But he began the presentation with lovingly renaming The Maroon as the Moron, and never looked back from there. He unabashedly opened up the floodgates to a Q&A lasting more than an hour and a half.\n\nAnd, instead of just the chuckles I expected to walk away with (though there were plenty), his honesty, cultural literacy, and individual pursuit of knowledge gave me a sense that I had somehow failed in a role I had long thought I had in the bag\u2014a passionate learner.\n\nHuang was sarcastic, hilarious, and unafraid. Whatever we threw at him, he answered\u2014whether it was about politics, race, corporate America, or even food ethics. Beyond mere eloquence, his ability to answer each question with some ethos, indicates that he had taken the time to form an opinion on each subject; he finds each topic (as random as they may seem to us) important to contemplate.\n\nIt became clear that Huang reads way more than I do, as he referenced minority authors and New York Times articles left and right. Now that I think about it, most of the books I\u2019ve read were written by dead white guys. It\u2019s pretty embarrassing to admit this as a student who probably has more time on her hands than this dynamic guy who spends his days filming hipster food documentaries and his nights in LA trying to convince Lana del Rey to include rapper Cam\u2019ron in her next album.\n\nIf I were Eddie Huang, all that success would impede me from seeking understanding about the unsavory parts of the world that don\u2019t directly relate to me. I\u2019d just hang out with Lana all day and eat some free bao at BaoHaus, instead of doing the independent reading that I\u2019d been meaning to do.\n\nPhoto: Meredith Hyun\n\nIn that sense, Huang embodies the life of the mind much more than I do. He\u2019s not relying on someone else, like a university, to tell him when to use his brain. At the session, he cheekily poked fun at someone, saying, \u201cWhat? You didn\u2019t get into MIT?\u201d Laughter roared as this statement seemed to hit home. Then he quickly added, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I went to Rollins College. That\u2019s, like, the Phoenix University of the South.\u201d\n\nThe reason he\u2019s so comfortable with mocking himself and us, is because he thinks that your educational background shouldn\u2019t define you\u2014a sentiment that is repeated over and over by comforting college counselors. Still, I think his logic is quite different from the norm.\n\nWhen people dismiss rankings as irrelevant, the usual argument is that you should find the school that fits you the best. That\u2019s what I smugly thought too, but that\u2019s still letting an institution drive my intellectual pursuits instead of maintaining them myself. But I\u2019ve come to realize that, as much as hate to admit it, I do need one to.\n\nThe other day, I couldn\u2019t remember how to get to the Med from South Campus. My friend joked that I was a \u201cclassic English major,\u201d and I didn\u2019t even try to defend myself. I\u2019ve come to accept an identity through my major. Even if I\u2019ve never verbalized this, I believe that I can\u2019t be, shouldn\u2019t have to be, good at anything else (namely, directions). I wish I were still a kid, willing to challenge my brain, to wrack it for details in my memory of how I last meandered to the Med.\n\nI only think about the things that I\u2019m supposed to think about now.\n\nOn the other hand, Huang\u2019s way of life seems to involve a preservation of his intellectual identity, regardless of his environment. When someone asked him why UChicago responds so apathetically to student requests, he replied, \u201cI never ask the bureaucracy for anything, because it only has its own interests in mind.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me not to ask and expect, because, all my life, I\u2019ve been told that following the system really well will get me where I want. I am what Yale professor William Deresiewicz calls a really \u201cexcellent sheep.\u201d Sheep are actually pretty dumb\u2014that\u2019s why being a shepherd is a full time job, because you have to constantly run around keeping these stupid animals from wandering off a cliff or something equally obtuse.\n\nClasses are like that for me; my professors shepherd me to what I need to know. In my head, I glorify my education, but it is, in reality, just a cluster of lectures, textbooks, and discussions with peers, things that I can\u2014I should\u2014seek out on my own. But I don\u2019t. At the same time, I complain that classes take up so much time that I never have room for other pursuits.\n\nBut when I am given free time, I have no idea what to do with it. All the self-improvement projects I start, like learning a new language or reading about elders\u2019 rights, all peter out pathetically in favor of watching entertaining Youtube videos. I\u2019m so used to a set curriculum that the vast amount of information in this Internet age terrifies me. Education\u2019s value is not in the quality of information, but the way the information is structured. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but it\u2019s made me lazy.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what you need to know to get by.\u201d\n\nThe real world doesn\u2019t work like that, so I don\u2019t function in the real world, where the shepherds don\u2019t always have my best interests in mind.\n\nOUCH.\n\nThat\u2019s me down there.\n\nThe sheep pancake at the bottom of the cliff.\n\nI\u2019m in such disconnect with the self I aspire to be, someone for whom the relief is in learning rather than muted passivity. I always wondered why my ideal job was to be a student forever, something I used to pat myself on the back for, as if it were a statement about how much I loved to learn. But in reality, it was to keep me from confronting the primary purpose of education: to become a better part of society, not to recline in the ivory tower. I love taking notes about biology, but I hate the idea of research. It\u2019s too active, too endless\u2014and therein lies my problem.\n\nI\u2019m scared of the real world because there, I have to take chances regardless of my prerequisites or qualifications. It\u2019s about learning without a rubric, without a TA telling me what to do. I\u2019m scared of people like Eddie Huang, who was fired from a law firm and kicked out of the TED Fellows Program\u2014his one chance to be all prestigious and intellectual\u2014because he didn\u2019t let an institution facilitate his current success.\n\nIn fact, he\u2019s still actively speaking out against the sitcom Fresh Off the Boat\u2019s deviation from the true message of his story, instead of quietly cashing the checks and enjoying the glory of working with ABC. He\u2019s his own person. He took the life he envisioned in his mind and made something out of it. Maybe I\u2019ll find this true \u201clife of the mind\u201d when I can one day drive the process myself instead of parasitizing an institution.\n\nSophia Chen is a first-year in the College majoring in biology and English", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Chicago Maroon", "description": "If the life of the mind is to actively learn, then why does it leave so many of us feeling passive?", "title": "Confessions from a recovering \u201cexcellent sheep\u201d", "url": "http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/04/14/confessions-from-a-recovering-excellent-sheep/", "image": {"width": 5118, "identifier": "http://chicagomaroon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/040715-VWPT-Sonia-Marta-Bakula.jpg", "height": 3412}, "updated_time": "2015-05-07T23:49:02+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://chicagomaroon.com/wp-content/themes/maroon_bones/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheChicagoMaroon", "section": "Viewpoints", "published_time": "2015-04-14T00:36:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-07T23:49:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde81a\"", "article_summary": "But he began the presentation with lovingly renaming The Maroon as the Moron, and never looked back from there.\nIt became clear that Huang reads way more than I do, as he referenced minority authors and New York Times articles left and right.\nOn the other hand, Huang\u2019s way of life seems to involve a preservation of his intellectual identity, regardless of his environment.\nPhoto: Meredith HyunIn that sense, Huang embodies the life of the mind much more than I do.\nThat\u2019s what I smugly thought too, but that\u2019s still letting an institution drive my intellectual pursuits instead of maintaining them myself."}
