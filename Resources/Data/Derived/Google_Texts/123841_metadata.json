Ted Cruz as a \u201cphony\u201d conservative. In fact, fiscal conservative groups that score congressional votes rank both presidential candidates as among the most conservative in the Senate.\n\nThe ad, from America\u2019s Liberty PAC, a pro-Rand Paul group, starts with an announcer saying that \u201cphony conservatives\u201d have been \u201cexposed.\u201d It displays grainy, black-and-white surveillance-type photos of Paul\u2019s rivals Marco Rubio, Chris Christie and Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe latest? Ted Cruz,\u201d the ad goes on to say. \u201cCruz talks a big game but when the rubber meets the road, we can\u2019t trust him. First, he votes to borrow billions and bust the budget, then skips the crucial vote to audit the federal reserve.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s Liberty is right about these particular votes, but let\u2019s provide some context about the legislation and the senator\u2019s voting record overall.\n\nThe spending vote referenced in the ad involved a budget amendment offered by Sen. Marco Rubio that would have increased the defense budget to $661 billion in fiscal year 2016. The Pentagon requested $661 billion, and Rubio said his amendment would \u201cfully fund\u201d the department. The measure failed 32-68 in a vote on March 26, 2015.\n\nPaul at the time criticized Rubio and Cruz for voting to increase the defense budget without proposing to offset the cost with cuts elsewhere. That\u2019s a fair point. The National Taxpayers Union urged a \u201cno\u201d vote on the amendment for that reason.\n\nBut viewers aren\u2019t told that the bill was on defense spending or that the bill failed \u2014 points that may or may not make a difference to them, but are at least worth knowing.\n\nThe second vote referenced in the ad was a Jan. 12 procedural vote on a bill that would have required a \u201cfull audit\u201d of the federal reserve. Again, the ad accurately says that Cruz missed the vote. He was campaigning in New Hampshire.\n\nBut the bill fell seven votes short of the 60 required to advance, so Cruz\u2019s vote would not have made a difference. Also, the ad doesn\u2019t mention that Cruz is a cosponsor of the bill, which was sponsored by Paul. Cruz obviously supports the bill.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for members of Congress to miss votes while campaigning for president. Cruz missed 24 percent of Senate votes in 2015 \u2014 which was less than Sens. Lindsey Graham (28 percent) and Rubio (35 percent) but much more than Paul, who missed just 6 percent of votes.\n\nMore important, the ad cherry picks two votes out of hundreds that Cruz has cast.\n\nTo put Cruz\u2019s voting record in context, we went to the websites of three fiscal conservative groups \u2014 Club for Growth, the National Taxpayers Union and the American Conservative Union \u2014 that rate members of Congress based on key economic votes. All three rank Cruz and Paul among the most conservative senators. In some cases, Cruz ranks higher than Paul.\n\nClub for Growth says its congressional scorecard \u201crewards free-market champions and exposes big-government, tax-and-spend politicians.\u201d Cruz scored 92 percent in 2014 and 100 percent in 2013 on the Club for Growth scorecard, ranking eighth in 2014 and first in 2013 among senators. By comparison, Paul scored 95 percent and 97 percent, respectively, in the last two years \u2014 ranking fifth in 2014 and third in 2013.\n\nCruz scored 95 percent on the National Taxpayers Union\u2019s 2013 scorecard, ranking the Texas senator third out of 100 senators. That was even slightly higher than Paul, who scored 94 percent and ranked sixth that year. Both received an \u201cA.\u201d (NTU has no 2014 scorecard on its website.)\n\nCruz did even better in the American Conservative Union ratings. Cruz got a perfect score in 2014 and 2013 and has a lifetime rating of 100 percent over his first two years in the Senate. Rand Paul scored 96 percent in both years and has a lifetime score of 98 percent over four years.\n\nBy these measures, Cruz \u2014 who helped engineer a government shutdown in 2013 in a failed effort to defund the Affordable Care Act \u2014 has a conservative voting record, contrary to what the ad says.
