Brooke Jackson. He ruled that CSP violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment by not providing outdoor recreation. His decision came in a case filed by DU\u2019s law clinic on behalf of former CSP inmate Troy Anderson.\n\nDOC addressed the issue by transferring Anderson to Sterling Correctional Facility, Robertson said. But she added that shuffling one or a few inmates from prison to prison won\u2019t solve the problem because all CSP inmates are in the same position. That is why student and faculty attorneys at the clinic filed a second lawsuit against DOC last week, seeking class-action status, she said.\n\nIf certified as a class-action, the lawsuit, which names three inmates as plaintiffs, will represent the interests of all 630 administrative segregation inmates at CSP. The lawsuit says inmates are given an hour of exercise per day in a cell with a barred window only 6 inches wide.\n\n\u201cThe design is the problem,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cIt was unconstitutional when built.\u201d\n\nRaemisch said he hopes proactive moves by his staff will make the CSP lawsuit a moot point.\n\nIn the four months that he has been in office, DOC has revamped its administrative segregation program with the goal of removing all mentally ill inmates from CSP. The number of mentally ill inmates has already been reduced from 140 to eight since 2011, he said.\n\nHis staff is revamping the entire solitary-confinement criteria in ways that will dramatically reduce the total number of inmates in solitary and how long they stay, Raemisch said. Inmates will be told how long they will remain in solitary confinement when they are first sent, he said.\n\nPutting inmates in solitary confinement for long spans of time \u201cmultiplies or manufactures mental illness,\u201d Raemisch said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really time that we take a whole new look at this,\u201d he said.\n\nRaemisch and Robertson said Friday they would prefer to resolve disputes about outdoor recreation at CSP through negotiation, rather than in court.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kmitchelldp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colo. prisons could be running out of room for most-dangerous inmates", "title": "Colo. prisons could be running out of room for most-dangerous inmates", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/24/colo-prisons-could-be-running-out-of-room-for-most-dangerous-inmates/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130514__outside_Colorado_State_Penitentiaryp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130514__outside_Colorado_State_Penitentiaryp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-24T14:12:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T12:41:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1c7\"", "article_summary": "The gravity of the problem DOC faces is underlined by a 2012 decision by U.S. District Judge R.
