Thunder reporter Steve McGehee (@SteveMcGehee) is still on the road as the Thunder are in Denver to take on the Nuggets (32-46) at 9 p.m. With Denver eliminated from playoff contention, and the Thunder sitting securely in the No. 3 spot in the West, there won't be a lot on the line tonight when these two divisional rivals square off. Regardless, Thunder head coach Billy Donovan said he doesn't plan on resting any starters in the game, so it should be a tune-up contest for OKC as they try to click on all cylinders heading into the postseason.

Steve will be tweeting updates throughout the game, so keep checking in to ensure you won't miss out on any of the action.
