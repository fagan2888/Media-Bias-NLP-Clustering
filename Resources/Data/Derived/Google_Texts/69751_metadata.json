Namely, the ambitious twentysomethings best positioned to extract cash from gullible political donors on the promise that they are \u201cdown with the kids\u201d are, in fact, not. Often, when these Great Young Hopes of the political class realize they don\u2019t know how to connect with their generational peers, they resort to dubious social media metrics and hazy claims of \u201cbeing in the conversation\u201d as proof of success. And so political donors, PACs, and partisan operatives of a certain age keep chasing the ever-elusive youth vote with marketing stunts that the Brooks Brothers-clad young strivers who concoct them promise will \u201cgo viral.\u201d\n\nIn the Obamacare marketing war for \u201cmillennials,\u201d as the marketers know them, \u201cvirality\u201d has become an end unto itself.\n\nTake, for example, the \u201cGot Insurance?\u201d campaign launched in October by the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative. Tasked with raising awareness among the 18\u201335 demographic, the nonprofit set about making a series of ads designed, ostensibly, to resonate with young, single people. But the final product was ham-handed and cartoonish, featuring bros in Bermuda shorts saying things like, \u201cYo mom, do I got insurance?\u201d and young women, mouths agape, exclaiming, \u201cOMG, he\u2019s hot! Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s as easy to get as this birth control.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2832653, "userid": 233242}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Why is political advertising for young people so terrible?
