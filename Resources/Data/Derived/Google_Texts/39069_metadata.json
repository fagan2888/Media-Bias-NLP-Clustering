We knew that was an empty promise as the bill stipulated a $1 a month surcharge for plans that covered abortions,\u201d said Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pa., who chairs the House\u2019s Energy and Commerce subcommittee on Health. \u201cOn top of that \u2026 it\u2019s near impossible to decipher which plans include abortion and at what cost!\u201d\n\nTo fix this, a House bill will be introduced this week to demand full disclosure and a separate itemized premium. It also will prohibit federal subsidies for Obamacare insurance plans that cover abortion. That bill, HR-7, or the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,\u201d will be introduced by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.\n\nOn Oct. 9, Rep. Chris Smith, R-NJ, introduced a bill on the disclosure issue, which now has been folded into the broader HR-7. Smith is co-chairman of the Bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus.\n\nAides with both Pitts and Smith have researched numerous Obamacare policies and have yet to find any mention of abortion.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t find any insurance plans where this is disclosed,\u201d said Andrew Wimer, communications director for Pitts.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s section on abortion, 18023(E)(3)(A), mandates that insurance companies \u201cshall provide a notice to enrollees, only as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation, at the time of enrollment, of such coverage.\u201d\n\nSubsection (B) authorizes a \u201ccollect from each enrollee in the plan a separate payment\u201d for abortion services in order to \u201cdeposit all such separate payments into separate allocation accounts.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare regulations allow insurers to disclose the existence and amount of the abortion surcharge only at the time of enrollment \u2014 a warning that may constitute but a single sentence in a massive plan document,\u201d the Heritage Foundation wrote in a report titled, \u201cObamacare\u2019s Many Loopholes: Forcing Individuals and Taxpayers to Fund Elective Abortion Coverage.\u201d\n\nSmith has discovered that the states of Maryland, New York and Washington have flouted the law by telling insurance companies they don\u2019t need to itemize the charge for consumers.\n\n\u201cBetween the failure to disclose abortion coverage at the outset and the failure to bill the surcharge separately, the consumer is left in the day, unknowingly paying into an abortion fund,\u201d Smith said in a statement.\n\nThe ACA also is supposed to give consumers a choice of plans if they opt out of abortion coverage. But research by Smith\u2019s office has revealed that finding an abortion-free plan will be difficult. For example, of the 31 plans in New Jersey offered by three insurance companies, all of them include abortion coverage.\n\n\u201cIt does not surprise me because the Obama administration has shown a pattern of retroactive line-item veto and he thinks he can rewrite any law with impunity,\u201d said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee. \u201cChris Smith tried to survey plans to find out which ones covered abortion and what they found a few weeks back was of 112 plans, 103 cover abortions.\n\nInsurance companies \u201care violating the law every day that they do this,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nContact Tori Richards at tori@newswriter2@aol.com or on twitter @newswriter2.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Obamacare premiums have secret clause, premiums, to fund abortion", "title": "Abortion fees hidden in Obamacare premiums", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/01/Cator-Abortion.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-27T13:17:35+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/125590/hidden-abortion-fees/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "National", "tag": "abortion,Andrew Wimer,Chris Smith,Congress,Eric Cantor,Heritage Foundation,Joe Pitts,ObamaCare,pro-life,Tori Richards", "published_time": "2014-01-27T04:50:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-27T13:17:35+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Obamacare premiums have secret clause, premiums, to fund abortion", "title": "Abortion fees hidden in Obamacare premiums", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/01/Cator-Abortion.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Obamacare premiums have secret clause, premiums, to fund abortion"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc524\"", "article_summary": "It also will prohibit federal subsidies for Obamacare insurance plans that cover abortion.\nFor example, of the 31 plans in New Jersey offered by three insurance companies, all of them include abortion coverage.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t find any insurance plans where this is disclosed,\u201d said Andrew Wimer, communications director for Pitts.\nAides with both Pitts and Smith have researched numerous Obamacare policies and have yet to find any mention of abortion.\nInsurance companies \u201care violating the law every day that they do this,\u201d Johnson said."}
