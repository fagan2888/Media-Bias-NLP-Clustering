More scoring. And more scoring chances.\n\nThose aren\u2019t original thoughts, but I\u2019ve seen and covered 1-0 NHL games that were exhilarating, full of scoring chances and during which you had the feeling you\u2019d better not blink. It doesn\u2019t even necessarily have to be shot after shot and a succession of great saves, posts and crossbars to make a great game. But all of that is about a feeling too.\n\nOne example was when Patrick Roy and Dominik Hasek, then with Buffalo, dueled to a scoreless tie through 65 minutes in Denver on Nov. 2, 1996. They combined for \u201conly\u201d 52 saves \u2014 Hasek made 30, Roy 22 \u2014 but it was an exciting game, albeit in part because it was the two best goaltenders in the world going at it.\n\nYou just don\u2019t get that feeling often enough anymore, even in those low-scoring games. That\u2019s what is missing.\n\nI have a copy of The Denver Post\u2019s April 4, 1982, sports section, jammed with coverage from Woody Paige and me of the Colorado Rockies\u2019 final hockey game in Denver.\n\nThe Rockies beat Calgary 3-1, thanks to goalie Chico Resch, but the NHL Roundup noted that a natural hat trick from Peter McNab led the Bruins to a 5-4 win over the Quebec Nordiques (oh, the ironies), and the other league scores that night were 6-3, 7-4, 6-0, 5-4, 5-4 and 4-3. It\u2019s a single yellowing newsprint snapshot from 33 years ago, of course, but it also is jarring.\n\nSince, we\u2019ve been through the dead puck era, the success and popularization (at least among coaches) of the (yawn) neutral-zone trap, then crackdowns on obstruction and clutching and grabbing \u2026 all of that. The red line has been eliminated. (Well, kind of.) Still, there are too many nights when you feel like you\u2019re watching the players\u2019 pregame fun with a soccer ball in the hallways make it onto the ice.\n\nSo the latest wave of \u201cwhat can be done\u201d talk sounds familiar. But at times, the mind-set issue is underplayed, lost amid the emphasis on equipment.\n\nI\u2019m all for anything that opens up the game. Shave the goalposts down or otherwise widen the nets. Pare down goalie equipment, which is the solution that seems so obvious when you see memory-triggering shots of \u201cunder-equipped\u201d goalies from past eras, or even of Roy early in his career. Yes, work on eliminating the overcoaching mind-set that discourages individual flashiness because you need to finish your checks, give it 110 percent and be responsible at both ends of the ice. (These are the guys who think Pavel Bure should be kicked out of the Hall of Fame.)\n\nI also wonder what the league would be like now if about the time the Rockies fled to New Jersey, the NHL declared that all new league arenas would have to be built to allow for the wider international-sized ice sheet. It would have led to fewer low seats for hockey between the edge of the basketball court configuration and hockey\u2019s front row in the new arenas (including the Pepsi Center), but allowances could have been made in the designs. It\u2019s too late for that now.\n\nSomething has to be done.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nBarclays Center, Brooklyn\n\nWhen: Monday, 5 p.m.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: The Avalanche plays the New York Islanders on the road for the first time since the Islanders moved their home games to Brooklyn this season after a 43-year run in Uniondale, N.Y.\n\nBackground: The Islanders joined the NBA\u2019s Brooklyn Nets, who moved from New Jersey to the new Barclays Center in 2012. A total of 10 arenas, including the Pepsi Center, house both NHL and NBA franchises. Several other metro markets have both NHL and NBA franchises, but the teams play in different buildings.\n\nFrei\u2019s take: When Avalanche attendance slipped after the many years of announced sellouts, it was fashionable to proclaim it demonstrated that Denver \u201cisn\u2019t a real hockey town.\u201d Now, the Avalanche\u2019s average attendance of 16,207 is 21st in the 30-team league, but it represents 90 percent of capacity. Meanwhile, the Nuggets\u2019 average of 13,180 (or 68.8 percent of capacity) is the lowest in the NBA. Does that mean Denver \u201cisn\u2019t a real basketball town\u201d? Of course, it doesn\u2019t. But this Monday matchup is of teams that are part of the worst-drawing, same-building, NHL-NBA combinations. Through Thanksgiving, the Nuggets\u2019 and Avalanche\u2019s combined Pepsi Center average was 14,788; and the Nets\u2019 and Islanders\u2019 average was 13,171. That\u2019s ninth and 10th among the 10.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: NHL must move to increase the action", "title": "Frei: NHL must move to increase the action", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/28/frei-nhl-must-move-to-increase-the-action/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-28T18:00:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:37:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei"}, "article_summary": "Through Thanksgiving, the Nuggets\u2019 and Avalanche\u2019s combined Pepsi Center average was 14,788; and the Nets\u2019 and Islanders\u2019 average was 13,171.\nI have a copy of The Denver Post\u2019s April 4, 1982, sports section, jammed with coverage from Woody Paige and me of the Colorado Rockies\u2019 final hockey game in Denver.\nA total of 10 arenas, including the Pepsi Center, house both NHL and NBA franchises.\nOne example was when Patrick Roy and Dominik Hasek, then with Buffalo, dueled to a scoreless tie through 65 minutes in Denver on Nov. 2, 1996.\nSeveral other metro markets have both NHL and NBA franchises, but the teams play in different buildings."}
