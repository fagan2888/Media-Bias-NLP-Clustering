The complex will be part of a mixed-use development with multifamily residential, office space and retail shops.\n\n\u201cThis is without question the catalytic opportunity we have been waiting for,\u201d Hancock said at a press conference.\n\nIn other words, very good news.\n\nThe company chose Denver out of 22 cities, partially as a result of Hancock\u2019s aerotropolis vision, said Jim Doyle, president of Panasonic Enterprise Solutions.\n\nThe operations base and assembly facility will make large-scale audio-visual displays and solar panels.\n\nDenver and the state of Colorado sweetened the pot with a total of $3 million in incentives.\n\nThe announcement of Panasonic\u2019s move to Denver is occurring while city officials are still in negotiations with Adams County, Aurora and communities around the airport over how the property inside and outside DIA should grow.\n\nHancock told us last week that negotiations on the conflict are going \u201cphenomenally well\u201d and he is \u201cbeyond optimistic\u201d an agreement will be reached. Negotiations are now cloaked in secrecy, but the mayor hopes for an announcement next month.\n\nThat, too, is an important development for Hancock\u2019s vision.\n\nCommunities battling Denver have claimed Hancock\u2019s plans for an \u201cairport city\u201d and aerotropolis would violate a two-decade-old intergovernmental agreement over how the land Denver annexed should develop. Discussions got so strained a year ago that Adams County threatened to take back DIA\u2019s land.\n\nClearly discussions have calmed enough for Panasonic to announce its move into DIA\u2019s shadow.\n\nA reasonable outcome to the squabble was always possible; now, fortunately, it appears inevitable, too.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Panasonic deal to help Denver airport area take off", "title": "Panasonic deal to help Denver airport area take off", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/19/panasonic-deal-to-help-denver-airport-area-take-off/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141219__OP21PANASONICp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141219__OP21PANASONICp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-19T17:09:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:12:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9586\"", "article_summary": "The company chose Denver out of 22 cities, partially as a result of Hancock\u2019s aerotropolis vision, said Jim Doyle, president of Panasonic Enterprise Solutions.\nCommunities battling Denver have claimed Hancock\u2019s plans for an \u201cairport city\u201d and aerotropolis would violate a two-decade-old intergovernmental agreement over how the land Denver annexed should develop.\nThat, too, is an important development for Hancock\u2019s vision.\nFor years, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock\u2019s appealing vision of an aerotropolis growing up around Denver International Airport appeared based upon pie-in-the-sky dreams for what he hoped would be the cornerstone of his legacy.\nSuddenly, those dreams appear on the way to reality, although Denver and the cities around the airport must come to an agreement before development will truly take off."}
