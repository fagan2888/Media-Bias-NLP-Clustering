But there\u2019s a catch: The 54.5 mpg number \u2013 often repeated in news stories \u2013 is a fiction. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that real-world mileage for the average 2025 model will be 40 mpg. And some environmental advocates believe it will be as low as 37 mpg.\n\nThe big gap in the numbers exists because federal authorities essentially keep two sets of books. The set that produced the unrealistically high target is used to track compliance with U.S. auto emissions and fuel economy rules. But these figures exaggerate true mileage because they rely on outdated performance tests and give automakers credit for extra mpg for cutting greenhouse gas pollution from their vehicles.\n\nThe other set of government numbers is designed to help consumers shop for more fuel-efficient cars. This set consists of the EPA estimates posted on the window stickers of new cars, figures that come much closer to drivers\u2019 real-world experience. For 2015, the real-world, or window sticker, average is expected to be about 26 mpg, versus nearly 34 mpg for the other government figure.\n\nDaniel Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, a Washington-based environmental advocacy group, said keeping varying sets of numbers is \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cbad policy.\u201d He said it confuses policymakers and consumers alike, and eases pressure on the industry to boost fuel economy because people think the companies are doing better than they are.\n\nDon Anair, deputy director of the Union of Concerned Scientists\u2019 clean vehicles program, agreed. He said the situation \u201callows there to be confusion and potentially pushback from automakers who are not happy with the standards, who want to see them lowered.\u201d Recent reports (Wall Street Journal story and Bloomberg story) say the auto industry already is preparing a lobbying push to relax the 2025 target.\n\nFederal officials say they don\u2019t consider the differing sets of numbers a major issue. Jeff Alson, a senior engineer in the EPA office of transportation and air quality in Ann Arbor, Mich., said agency engineers \u201cdo need to keep in mind\u201d which type of numbers they are working with. But, he added, \u201cThe good news is, it\u2019s all pretty invisible to most consumers.\u201d\n\nWade Newton, a spokesman for the trade group Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said in an email, \u201cAutomakers work very hard to make sure consumers understand the fuel economy range a vehicle will get \u2013 you\u2019ll often see it all over advertising and it\u2019s clearly on the vehicle label \u2013 which, legally, must be visible to the consumer.\u201d\n\nEven though the window sticker numbers are the most accurate government figures, they also can be deceptive because some automakers have stretched the truth.\n\nThat sort of number-fudging was highlighted in November when South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia reached a record settlement with the federal government. The sister companies agreed to pay more than $300 million in penalties to resolve civil charges that they inflated fuel economy figures. The EPA, which in recent years has conducted mileage audits on about 15 percent of new cars, says it is stepping up oversight.\n\nYet the gaps between the government\u2019s two sets of books generally are far bigger than the scale of known cheating on window-sticker figures, which often has amounted to exaggerating mileage by as little as 1 mpg or 2 mpg. The biggest manipulation discovered to date involved the 2012 and 2013 Kia Soul. The cars were found to have highway mileage figures that were exaggerated by 6 miles per gallon, or more than 20 percent; Kia agreed to cut the figure from 34 mpg to 28 mpg. Kia and Hyundai said they cut the mileage ratings, by an average of 3 percent, for more than one-third of their 2011-2013 model year cars.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration promises 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.
