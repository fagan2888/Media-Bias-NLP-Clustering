At this week\u2019s debate for the Republican presidential candidates, Carly Fiorina, who\u2019s dabbled at times with demonstrably false talking points, proudly declared, \u201cObamacare isn\u2019t helping anyone.\u201d Even for her, it was unsettling to hear Fiorina deny the existence of tens of millions of Americans who\u2019ve benefited from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut aside from the garden-variety nonsense, the debate\u2019s audience also heard a more specific claim from Marco Rubio: \u201c[W]e have a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people.\u201d To which the reality-based community responded, \u201cWe do?\u201d\n\nThe oddity of the criticism is how easy it is to recognize how wrong it is. We know, for example, that in 2014 \u2013 the first full year of ACA implementation \u2013 the job market in the United States had its best year since the late 1990s . Indeed, hiring in 2014 was so strong, it surpassed literally any single year in either Bush presidency, and even many of the years in the Clinton era.\n\nHow do \u201cObamacare\u201d critics explain this? As best as I can tell, so far, they don\u2019t even try.\n\nBut we can go a step further with this. Riffing off a great observation Dan Diamond made in Forbes, I made the above chart, noting private-sector employment in the United States over the last eight years. The red line shows the final two years of the Bush/Cheney era, as the private sector shed jobs; the light blue line shows the first year of the Obama era, when the Great Recession started to end; and the hard blue line shows March 2010 through the present.\n\nAnd why is March 2010 of particular significance? Because private-sector employment bottomed out in February 2010, and then started to recover in March 2010. It hasn\u2019t looked back since.\n\nMarch 2010 is the month President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. In other words, America\u2019s private sector started hiring again, not around the same time as \u201cObamacare,\u201d but quite literally the exact month the president put pen to paper and made the ACA the law of the land.\n\nThe question then becomes, if we have \u201ca crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people,\u201d why does the evidence point in the opposite direction?\n\nPostscript: I\u2019d be remiss if I neglected to note that new jobs are being created in the health-care industry at an extraordinary pace. The industry added more jobs in the first 10 months of this year than in all of 2013 and 2014 combined , and hospitals in particular have been on a hiring binge unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in many years.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "If we have \"a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people,\" why does the evidence point in the opposite direction?", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/private-sector-jobs-soar-under-obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "If we have \"a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people,\" why does the evidence point in the opposite direction?", "title": "Private sector jobs soar under 'Obamacare'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/private-sector-jobs-soar-under-obamacare", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/11.12.15.jpg?itok=UDVDrqUl", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/private-sector-jobs-soar-under-obamacare", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/11.12.15.jpg?itok=3SSvcP2V", "height": 553}, "title": "Private sector jobs soar under 'Obamacare'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "If we have \"a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people,\" why does the evidence point in the opposite direction?"}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-11-12T10:00:31-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Private sector jobs soar under 'Obamacare'", "tags": "affordable-care-act,carly-fiorina,economy,election-2016,elections,health,health-care-reform,jobs,marco-rubio,obamacare,republicans,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "11/12/2015 10:00:31 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/private-sector-jobs-soar-under-obamacare"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "If we have \"a crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people,\" why does the evidence point in the opposite direction?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Jobs, Economy, Election 2016, Elections, Health Care Reform, Health, Republicans, Affordable Care Act, Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "In other words, America\u2019s private sector started hiring again, not around the same time as \u201cObamacare,\u201d but quite literally the exact month the president put pen to paper and made the ACA the law of the land.\nThe red line shows the final two years of the Bush/Cheney era, as the private sector shed jobs; the light blue line shows the first year of the Obama era, when the Great Recession started to end; and the hard blue line shows March 2010 through the present.\nPostscript: I\u2019d be remiss if I neglected to note that new jobs are being created in the health-care industry at an extraordinary pace.\nThe question then becomes, if we have \u201ca crazy health care law that discourages companies from hiring people,\u201d why does the evidence point in the opposite direction?\nBecause private-sector employment bottomed out in February 2010, and then started to recover in March 2010."}
