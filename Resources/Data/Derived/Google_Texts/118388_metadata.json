Up to half of California\u2019s uninsured population is made up of immigrants not in the country legally and therefore excluded from health insurance exchanges, tax credits and most Medi-Cal coverage.\n\nOthers can\u2019t afford coverage (even if it\u2019s subsidized), choose not to buy insurance or are unaware that they qualify for free or subsidized insurance.\n\nNo matter who they are or what their circumstance, they get sick, too.\n\nQ: I\u2019m uninsured but need medical care. What are my options?\n\nA: It\u2019s hard to pin down exactly how many Californians remain uninsured, but Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, believes there are roughly 3 million of you.\n\nThe good news is that more than a third are actually eligible for coverage, either Medi-Cal or subsidized insurance through Covered California, said Laurel Lucia, an ACA expert at UC Berkeley\u2019s Center for Labor Research and Education.\n\nSo my first piece of advice is perhaps the most important: Find out if you\u2019re eligible.\n\nCovered California\u2019s open enrollment time has ended for this year, but Medi-Cal enrollment stays open year-round \u2014 and it is free for most who qualify.\n\nIf you have a specific disease, you may be able to get coverage from state programs such as California Children\u2019s Services or the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, said Daniel Zingale, senior vice president of the California Endowment. Also, Los Angeles and several other counties offer county-based benefits such as My Health LA for uninsured residents, Wright said.\n\nCheck to see what your county offers. If you don\u2019t qualify for anything, your health care options will depend largely on three things: your location, your income and your immigration status. \u201cIt really is a patchwork,\u201d Wright said. \u201cDepending on your county, you may have very different levels of access to care.\u201d\n\nCounty health systems\n\nCalifornia counties run a mishmash of programs. Some operate public hospitals, others contract with private providers, and still others run clinics. Your eligibility also varies widely by county, whether we\u2019re talking income or immigration status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re undocumented in L.A. County, the county clinics are where you\u2019d go,\u201d Zingale said, adding that is not the case in 48 of the state\u2019s 58 counties. Check with your county to explore your options.\n\nCommunity clinics\n\nSeparate from county clinics, California\u2019s roughly 1,100 community health clinics serve about 5.6 million each year, said Carmela Castellano-Garcia, president and CEO of the California Primary Care Association. Of those, about 2 million are uninsured.\n\nThere are different types of clinics, but they all generally provide primary and preventive care regardless of immigration status, and their prices are set on a sliding scale based on income. Free clinics charge nothing at all. \u201cHow much you pay depends on the kind of clinic you go to,\u201d she said.\n\nWant to find a clinic near you? Castellano-Garcia suggests visiting www.CaliforniaHealthPlus.com and using its online clinic locator tool.\n\nEmergency room/hospital care\n\nFederal law requires ERs to stabilize patients without asking about their immigration status or ability to pay. But if you\u2019re uninsured, you\u2019ll be responsible for the bills, which can easily climb into the tens of thousands and wreck your credit.\n\nWant proof? A December report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that medical collections comprise more than half of collection accounts on credit reports.\n\nBut there are some options. Though unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for full Medi-Cal benefits, they may be eligible for emergency care and pregnancy-related services, based on income.\n\nAlso, most hospitals offer financial assistance and \u201ccharity care\u201d to patients, also based on income, Wright said.\n\nThe ACA provides new protections for consumers who use nonprofit hospitals, such as limiting how much people at certain incomes can be billed.\n\nBut California has stronger protections, Wright said. A pre-existing state law requires all hospitals to inform consumers about their rights and financial options, give them 150 days before their bills get sent to collection and limit the amount uninsured consumers at certain incomes must pay.\n\nHealth Access and other groups host a website \u2014 www.HospitalBillHelp.org \u2014 that will help you find discounted or charity care in your area. You can also visit a state-run website to search for similar information: syfphr.oshpd.ca.gov/.\n\nConsumer groups support legislation that would address health coverage for the uninsured. For instance, one proposed law (SB 4) would make unauthorized immigrants eligible for Medi-Cal, assuming they meet the program\u2019s criteria, and allow them to buy unsubsidized plans from Covered California with their own money. A similar measure stalled last year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "About 5 million Californians have new health coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), both through the Covered California health insurance exchange and the expansion of Medi-Cal, California\u2019", "title": "Ask Emily: How to find medical care if you\u2019re uninsured", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20150405/ask-emily-how-to-find-medical-care-if-youre-uninsured", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Ask Emily: How to find medical care if you\u2019re uninsured"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "About 5 million Californians have new health coverage as a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), both through the Covered California health insurance exchange and the expansion of Medi-Cal, California\u2019", "title": "Ask Emily: How to find medical care if you\u2019re uninsured", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20150405/ask-emily-how-to-find-medical-care-if-youre-uninsured", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews.png?052016"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,health,insurance,Obamacare, Affordable Care Act", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act,health,insurance,Obamacare, Affordable Care Act"}, "article_summary": "Q: I\u2019m uninsured but need medical care.\nAdvertisement\u201cIf you\u2019re undocumented in L.A.
