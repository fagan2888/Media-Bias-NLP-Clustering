Saturday night, Crestview Police officials responded to a domestic violence situation and possible shots fired at a home on Lloyd Street.

When officers arrived on scene they learned from the victim that 37-year-old Marquette Antonio McQueen, had fired at least two rounds inside the home. It was also determined there were two small children still inside the house.

McQueen refused to exit the home and at that time the Crestview Police Departmentâ€™s SWAT Team and Hostage Negotiation Team were activated.

McQueen eventually came out of the home. Both children were taken into protective custody of the Department of Children and Families.

McQueen was charged with Aggravated Assault with a Firearm with Domestic Violence, Possession of a Firearm by a Convicted Felon, and two counts of Child Abuse.

During the incident, 35-year-old Jessie Coleman refused to follow several orders by officers to move behind a safety perimeter that had been put into place. Coleman was arrested and charged with Obstructing a Law Enforcement Officer.
