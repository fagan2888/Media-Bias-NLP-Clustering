(AP Photo)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In his handwritten will, al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden claimed he had about $29 million in personal wealth \u2014 the bulk of which he wanted to be used \u201con jihad, for the sake of Allah.\u201d\n\nThe will was released Tuesday in a batch of more than 100 documents seized in a May 2011 raid that killed bin Laden at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The al-Qaeda leader planned to divide his fortune among his relatives, but wanted most of it spent to conduct the work of the Islamic extremist terror network behind the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nThe threat of sudden death was on his mind years before the fatal raid in Pakistan.\n\n\u201cIf I am to be killed,\u201d a bin Laden son wrote to his father in a 2008 letter, \u201cpray for me a lot and give continuous charities in my name, as I will be in great need for support to reach the permanent home.\u201d\n\nThe letters were included in a batch of documents released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. They address a range of topics, including fractures between al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda in Iraq, which eventually splintered off into what is now known as the Islamic State; and bin Laden\u2019s concerns about his organization\u2019s public image and his desire to depict it as a united network.\n\nIn a letter to one of his wives who had been living in Iran, bin Laden expressed worry that her visit to a dentist could have presented the Iranians an opportunity to implant a small chip under her skin, apparently as a tracking device.\n\n\u201cMy dear wife,\u201d he began. \u201cI was told that you went to a dentist in Iran, and you were concerned about a filling she put in for you. Please let me know in detail \u2026 any suspicions that any of the brothers may have about chips planted in any way.\u201d\n\nThe Iranian dentist might have used a slightly enlarged syringe to make such an implant, bin Laden wrote in the letter. The U.S. translation is undated.\n\n\u201cThe size of the chip is about the length of a grain of wheat and the width of a fine piece of vermicelli,\u201d bin Laden said. He asked her to recall the exact date of her dental work, \u201calso about any surgery you had, even if it was only a quick pinch.\u201d\n\nIn another letter, addressed to \u201cThe Islamic Community in General,\u201d bin Laden offered an upbeat assessment of progress in his holy war since 9/11 and of U.S. failings in Afghanistan. The letter is undated but appears to have been written in 2010.\n\n\u201cHere we are in the tenth year of the war, and America and its allies are still chasing a mirage, lost at sea without a beach,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThey thought that the war would be easy and that they would accomplish their objectives in a few days or a few weeks, and they did not prepare for it financially, and there is no popular support that would enable it to carry on a war for a decade or more. The sons of Islam have opposed them and stood between them and their plans and objectives.\u201d\n\nBin Laden sought to portray the U.S. as hopelessly mired in an unwinnable war in Afghanistan. In an undated letter that appears to have been written in the 2009-2010 period, he compared the American combat position to that of the Soviet Union in the final years of its occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cAmerica appears to be hanging on by a thin thread. Due to the financial difficulties,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWe need to be patient a bit longer. With patience, there is victory!\u201d\n\nBeginning last summer, the CIA spearheaded an interagency review of the classified documents under the auspices of the White House\u2019s National Security Council staff. Representatives from seven agencies combed through the documents.\n\n\u201cThis was no easy feat as members of the task force dedicated themselves over a long period of time working in an intelligence community facility to review and declassify as many documents as possible,\u201d said Brian Hale, a spokesman for the national intelligence director.\u201d\n\nThe review is ongoing, with the next release expected later this year.\n\nShortly before his death, bin Laden hailed the overthrow and death of Libya\u2019s strongman leader Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nIn a Feb. 25, 2011 letter addressed \u201cto our people in Libya,\u201d bin Laden said al-Qaida had triumphed over Gadhafi.\n\n\u201cPraise God, who made al-Qa\u2019ida a great vexation upon him, squatting on his chest, enraging and embittering him, and who made al-Qa\u2019ida a torment and exemplary punishment upon him, this truly vile hallucinating individual who troubles us in front of the world!\u201d he wrote.\n\nWritten by Deb Riechmann and Robert Burns\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/03/01/osama-bin-laden-dedicated-much-of-his-fortune-to-jihad/", "article_author_name": "Associated Press", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bin-Laden-Documents-_Bunk-e1457454096677.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "Afghanistan, Al Qaeda, Iraq, jihad, Middle East, Osama Bin Laden, Pakistan, personal wealth, Syria, terrorism, war"}, "description": "In his handwritten will, al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden claimed he had about $29 million in personal wealth \u2014 the bulk of which he wanted to be used \"on jihad,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Bin-Laden-Documents-_Bunk-e1457454096677.jpg"}, "keywords": "osama bin laden,al-qaeda,jihad,personal wealth,afghanistan,al qaeda,iraq,middle east,pakistan,syria,terrorism,war", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Osama bin Laden dedicated much of his fortune to jihadPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/03/01/osama-bin-laden-dedicated-much-of-his-fortune-to-jihad/Osama bin Laden is seen in Afghanistan in this undated photo.\nShortly before his death, bin Laden hailed the overthrow and death of Libya\u2019s strongman leader Moammar Gadhafi.\nIn a Feb. 25, 2011 letter addressed \u201cto our people in Libya,\u201d bin Laden said al-Qaida had triumphed over Gadhafi.\n\u201cThe size of the chip is about the length of a grain of wheat and the width of a fine piece of vermicelli,\u201d bin Laden said.\n(AP Photo)WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 In his handwritten will, al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden claimed he had about $29 million in personal wealth \u2014 the bulk of which he wanted to be used \u201con jihad, for the sake of Allah.\u201dThe will was released Tuesday in a batch of more than 100 documents seized in a May 2011 raid that killed bin Laden at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan."}
