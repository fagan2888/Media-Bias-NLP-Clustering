The Affordable Care Act has benefited hundreds of thousands of Nebraskans, including more than 767,000 people with preexisting conditions who are no longer at risk for coverage denials, reduced benefits, or higher premiums -- and if the state expands Medicaid, an additional 42,000 uninsured people would gain coverage. Additionally, the president\u2019s historic investment in college affordability has resulted in a 95 percent increase in Pell Grant funding in Nebraska and the number of grant recipients increased by 11,000,\" the statement reads.\n\nThis will be Obama's second visit to Nebraska since he was elected and the statement reads that he is looking forward to discussing his priorities and opportunities for progress in the next year.\n\nFurther details regarding Obama's travel to Nebraska have not been made available.\n\nWe'll update you as we learn more.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Fri, 08 Jan 2016 17:01:02 CST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "DaVont\u00e9 McKenith", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "White House officials confirm President Obama plans to travel to Omaha following his seventh and final State of the Union Address.", "title": "President Obama schedules visit to Omaha", "url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/president-obama-schedules-visit-to-omaha/37329238", "image": "http://www.ketv.com/image/view/-/37329376/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/nqxq62z/-/obama-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/president-obama-schedules-visit-to-omaha/37329238", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "ketv://content/article/37329238", "iphone": "ketv://content/article/37329238", "googleplay": "ketv://content/article/37329238"}, "name": {"ipad": "ketv", "iphone": "ketv", "googleplay": "ketv"}, "id": {"ipad": 505254249, "iphone": 505254249, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}}, "site": "@ketv", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "ketv://content/article/37329238", "app_name": "ketv", "package": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}, "ios": {"url": "ketv://content/article/37329238", "app_store_id": 505254249, "app_name": "ketv"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130967633662636}, "google-site-verification": "a0PMTzs25l6fcC16_88mc37ga4Phf53uYiDWwMp4Ois", "keywords": "president obama", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/davontemckenith"}, "news_keywords": "president obama", "description": "White House officials confirm President Obama plans to travel to Omaha following his seventh and final State of the Union Address."}, "article_summary": "White House officials confirm President Obama plans to travel to Omaha following his seventh and final State of the Union Address.\nAlong with a stop in Omaha on Wednesday, Jan. 13th, the president will also travel to Baton Rouge, Louisiana on Thursday, Jan. 14.\nWith each day of his presidency, the president plans to keep his foot on the gas pedal and engage Americans in discussions about how we can continue to move the country forward.\"\nThis means more than 70,000 jobs, including more than 40,000 in the Omaha area, have been created since 2010.\nFurther details regarding Obama's travel to Nebraska have not been made available."}
