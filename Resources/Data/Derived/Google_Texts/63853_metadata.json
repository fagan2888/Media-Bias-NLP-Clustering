President Barack Obama has unilaterally altered the law to delay the insurance mandate for businesses and make changes for lawmakers so they aren\u2019t subject to the same health care regulations as the rest of the American people.\n\nOn Thursday, Obama announced that he would be making yet another change to the law by allowing Americans to keep their current health insurance plans, though there are several conditions included in his new pledge.\n\nBut that brings us to the question: Does the president of the United States have the legal or constitutional authority to unilaterally change laws passed by Congress?\n\n\u201cThe short answer is no,\u201d David Corbin, a professor of politics at King\u2019s College in New York, told TheBlaze.\n\n\u201cHowever, the way he\u2019s been operating on this bill is that he can make alterations as he goes along,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cAnd so far, he\u2019s been allowed to get away with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States\u2026\u201d Share:\n\nHistorically, the executive branch has not been allowed to alter laws passed by Congress, he said, adding that there is a constitutional argument to be made.\n\nCorbin cited section one, article one of the U.S. Constitution: \u201c\u2018All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president certainly has some regulatory and prosecutorial discretion in how he executes the law, but he has no legislative power,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cIf his actions in this case (waiver, extensions, etc.) amount to him becoming a lawmaker rather than a law executor, they are unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nThough the Constitution is clear that \u201call legislative powers\u201d belong to Congress, Corbin said it sometimes comes down to how those in power choose to \u201cinterpret\u201d the law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure he will be able to get away with it in this case because I think people are going to understand that if you are going to remove the law of any legal standing by having the enforcement mechanisms or the penalties stripped out, then what is the law?\u201d the professor added.\n\nAppearing on MSNBC on Thursday, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean reportedly questioned if Obama really has the \u201clegal authority to do this\u201d when discussing the proposed change to the law, Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier tweeted.\n\nDuring a briefing before the presidential press conference, officials reportedly told members of the press that the White House does have the authority to delay enforcement for a year.\n\n\u201cHHS will be using its enforcement discretion to allow for this transition,\u201d the official said, according to the Washington Times. \u201cEnforcement discretion can be used generally in transitions, as well as a bridge towards legislation. This is something that has been used, for example, with the deferred action for childhood arrivals policy, pending immigration reform.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act, as passed by Congress, looks quite different today.
