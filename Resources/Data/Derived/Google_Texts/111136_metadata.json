Komen three-day, 60-mile walk for breast cancer in Tampa two Octobers ago, it was never my intention to do it again.\n\nEven then my motivation for taking on the challenge had nothing to do with an altruistic commitment to helping eradicate a disease I\u2019d been visited by twice. I did not walk \u201cBecause I can,\u201d \u201cFor those who cannot,\u201d \u201cTo bring us closer to a cure\u201d or any of the other noble reasons I\u2019d heard other survivors pledge.\n\nNo, with a writer\u2019s disregard for boundaries and enthusiasm for mining her own life for material, I walked because the Herald-Tribune agreed to let me write about the experience and I thought it would make for \u201ca good story.\u201d A story that could enhance my reputation! A story that might lift my name recognition, perhaps even my salary! A story that could win a prize!\n\n(Postscript: Not so.) Even after I\u2019d committed to training with a local team for six months to document their journey, I was a recalcitrant participant. In fact, it\u2019s a wonder my teammates didn\u2019t give me the boot. I resisted their cheerful efforts to get me to \u201csurrender to the pink.\u201d I declined fuchsia tutus and feather boas and refused to lace my shoes or my sports drink with something pink. While I begrudgingly groveled on Facebook for the $2,300 in donations every walker must raise in order to participate, when people generously responded, I felt compelled to let them know immediately that I did NOT agree with Komen\u2019s decision to stop giving grants to Planned Parenthood for breast cancer screenings, a story then making headlines.\n\nHowever, to no one\u2019s astonishment more than my own, by the time of the walk, I\u2019d succumbed. I was carrying around a floppy stuffed bunny named \u201cBooby,\u201d sporting \u201cDo You Tutu?\u201d and \u201cCancer Sucks!\u201d buttons on my pink backpack and displaying a smug insider\u2019s \u201d 3\u204460\u201d sticker on my car. Still, I cringe when I look back at those photos of me in obscenely tight fluorescent bike shorts lunging into the arms of some unsuspecting Tampa fireman, or crossing the finish line with pink plastic wristbands stacked halfway up my triumphantly raised arms.\n\nSo when Komen announced the walk would not be returning to Tampa, I figured I had the perfect out. Even after a group of dedicated teammates formed the \u201cTampa Bay Refugees\u201d and signed up to walk last year in Atlanta, I discovered ... oh dear, what a pity ... that I had a scheduling conflict that just could not be reconciled.\n\nSo why, next month, will I be walking another 60 miles over three days, this time in San Diego?\n\nIt still doesn\u2019t have anything to do with thinking that by begging for another $2,300 or wearing out a couple more pairs of shoes I am really doing anything that will bring us closer to a cure. Nor that, because I am fortunate to be in remission, it is my personal duty to do this \u201cBecause I can!\u201d\n\nIt has to do with the most important thing I learned from two tumors, two years of being attached to IVs, two bouts of hairlessness and too many sessions of \u201cdriving the great white porcelain bus\u201d (as an alcoholic friend once put it.) I stopped believing I would always have more time. More time not only to do the things that brought me pleasure \u2014 being with loved ones was at the top of that list \u2014 but also more time to do the things that, because they were difficult or unpleasant, I tended to kick down the road.\n\nI\u2019m embarrassed to admit that when I was diagnosed for the first time, in 2007, I had a forgotten, decades-old will that left my health care decisions and everything I owned to a husband I\u2019d been divorced from for almost 30 years. I had an adult son with mental health challenges who will never be fully self-supportive \u2014for whom I\u2019d made no future financial or managerial arrangements. I had a house full of stuff that was likely to become, at best, a burden, at worst grounds for conflict, to those who might inherit it.\n\nI had the tendency of a busy person who has been blissfully healthy all her life to put off bothering to assemble in one place all the documents that don\u2019t seem that important until no one can find them \u2014 house insurance policy/ automobile title/birth certificate/ Facebook password. I\u2019d avoided for years destroying a stale stash of love letters that could cause misunderstanding and hurt if posthumously revealed.\n\nI had a life that looked tidy and organized on the outside, but hid a pile of procrastinations under the surface. And frankly, I didn\u2019t like the idea of dying before I\u2019d cleaned up both my literal and figurative messes.\n\nBy the time I was diagnosed a second time in 2012, I\u2019d taken care of most of those clerical and emotional postponements. Interestingly, it resulted in my feeling less anxious about my eventual demise. Not that I was in any hurry, but I had the comfort of knowing my son would be provided for, my sister would get the archival family photos and my wishes would be clearly (and legally) spelled out if I couldn\u2019t make my own decisions at the end. That brought a sense of peace, serenity and acceptance of my mortality I\u2019d never experienced.\n\nSo I\u2019m walking this year for two reasons. One is that my longtime friend from Montana, Annie, who lost her husband to pancreatic cancer several years ago; and my very funny, very fun sister, Sarah, who tortured me as a child and brightens my every day as an adult, have both agreed to walk with me. Three days to spend with two of the people I love most in the world \u2014 free of children, spouses and any agenda other than enjoying the moment \u2014 is not something that should be postponed.\n\nAnd reason number two is this: I have the tranquility of knowing my house is in order. Should I be run over by a large pink bus en route, everything you\u2019ll need can be found in the upper left hand drawer of my file cabinet.\n\n\u2014Carrie Seidman is a dance, features and special projects writer for the Herald-Tribune.
