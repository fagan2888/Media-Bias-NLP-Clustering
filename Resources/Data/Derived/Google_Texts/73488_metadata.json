Amid a dramatic fall in the ruble\u2019s value, the country\u2019s central bank frantically moved this week to correct course, sharply raising interest rates and sparking renewed discussion of Russia\u2019s economic woes. In his year-end news conference yesterday, President Vladimir Putin sought to steel Russians for a medium-term slump, warning that the economic turmoil could last two years.\n\nIn his New York Times column today, economist Paul Krugman sets out to explain how Russia arrived at this point. A variety of factors contributed to the ruble\u2019s plunge, including Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine, but the immediate cause of the collapse is the dramatic fall in global oil prices, largely owing to factors like increased shale production and reduced demand from countries like China. But, Krugman points out, the ruble\u2019s value has plummeted far more dramatically than oil prices have decreased. What gives?\n\n\u201cThe kind of crisis Russia now faces is what you get when bad things happen to an economy made vulnerable by large-scale borrowing from abroad \u2014 specifically, large-scale borrowing by the private sector, with the debts denominated in foreign currency, not the currency of the debtor country,\u201d Krugman explains.\n\nUnlike most countries that experience currency crises, however, Russia has been running trade surpluses, not trade deficits. So what\u2019s with the \u201clarge-scale borrowing\u201d? Here\u2019s Krugman:\n\nWell, you can answer the second question by walking around Mayfair in London, or (to a lesser extent) Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, especially in the evening, and observing the long rows of luxury residences with no lights on \u2014 residences owned, as the line goes, by Chinese princelings, Middle Eastern sheikhs, and Russian oligarchs. Basically, Russia\u2019s elite has been accumulating assets outside the country \u2014 luxury real estate is only the most visible example \u2014 and the flip side of that accumulation has been rising debt at home.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Russia's economic crisis shatters the myth of Putin as a strong, all-knowing leader", "author": "Luke Brinker", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Russia's economic crisis shatters the myth of Putin as a strong, all-knowing leader", "title": "\u201cMacho posturing, it turns out, makes for bad economies\u201d: Paul Krugman slams Vladimir Putin", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/19/macho_posturing_it_turns_out_makes_for_bad_economies_paul_krugman_slams_vladimir_putin/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/paul-krugman-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Russia's economic crisis shatters the myth of Putin as a strong, all-knowing leader", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/paul-krugman-1280x960.jpg", "title": "\u201cMacho posturing, it turns out, makes for bad economies\u201d: Paul Krugman slams Vladimir Putin", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cMacho posturing, it turns out, makes for bad economies\u201d: Paul Krugman slams Vladimir Putin", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Currency, Global economy, Kremlin, oligarchs, Pat Buchanan, Paul Krugman, ruble, Rudy Giuliani, Russia, Russian Oligarchs, The New York Times, Vladimir Putin", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3ce\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Currency, Global economy, Kremlin, oligarchs, Pat Buchanan, Paul Krugman, ruble, Rudy Giuliani, Russia, Russian Oligarchs, The New York Times, Vladimir Putin, Politics NewsWhat\u2019s happening in Russia?\nSo what\u2019s with the \u201clarge-scale borrowing\u201d?\nIn his New York Times column today, economist Paul Krugman sets out to explain how Russia arrived at this point.\nBut, Krugman points out, the ruble\u2019s value has plummeted far more dramatically than oil prices have decreased.\nIn his year-end news conference yesterday, President Vladimir Putin sought to steel Russians for a medium-term slump, warning that the economic turmoil could last two years."}
