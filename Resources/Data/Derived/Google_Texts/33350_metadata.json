There\u2019s an app for that. Want your door to click open as soon as you approach? A special key fob and lock can take care of that for you. Want your thermostat to note when you\u2019re a few miles away from the house so it can start warming the place up for you? Easy \u2014 for a price.\n\nYup, as the Internet of Things emerges, expanding the ranks of interconnected devices, an automated home is quickly becoming a reality. Home automation is due to become a $44 billion industry by 2017, according to an industry report cited by CNN, rising rapidly from this year\u2019s estimated $10 billion.\n\nSlideshow: 6 Cheap and Easy Ways to Make Your Home Smarter\n\nWhen thinking about a smart home, you\u2019d be forgiven for dreaming of a house like Tony Stark\u2019s mansion, ruled over by a centralized computer like his J.A.R.V.I.S, crooning commands to the thermostat, speakers and front door in Paul Bettany\u2019s soothing brogue.\n\nThe reality is a bit different.\n\nAs Tony Faddell, CEO of the smart Thermostat maker Nest said at Business Insider\u2019s Ignition Conference, the idea of a fully automated home remains somewhat unrealistic.\n\nFaddell claimed that the idea of a centralized automated home system that controls everything is mostly the vision of \u201csingle geeky guys,\u201d adding that families with children are unlikely to fill their homes with components that may break easily or require a change in lifestyle.\n\nIn addition, it's also worth mentioning that the more connected your home is, the more vulnerable you may be to hacking attacks or potentially even identity theft.\n\nRelated: The Hidden Threats from Your \u201cSmart\u201d Home\n\nIn other words, for most of us, an Einstein-level smart home is still well off in the future. Home automation is still a nascent field. As Fadell noted, there are a multitude of different products from different providers, many with their own proprietary connection protocols and software, all with their own pros and cons. Getting everything set up is not for the faint-hearted, and God or the Geek Squad help you should anything go wrong.\n\nBut the question then becomes this: What would it cost to have a home that doesn\u2019t necessarily run itself but actually makes life more comfortable? A place where you can come home late at night to lights that slowly turn on, your favorite music automatically billowing from sightless speakers and a thermostat that sees you coming and pumps out fresh air that\u2019s not too warm, not too cold?\n\nClick here to see six items that can bring your home closer to that vision, and what they will cost you. A truly smart home may still be years away for most of us, but these devices can sharply boost your current home\u2019s IQ.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A truly smart home is still years away for most of us, but these devices can at least boost your current home\u2019s IQ.", "title": "Forget the Jetsons.
