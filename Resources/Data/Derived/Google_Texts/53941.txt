John Q. Doyle has been named president of New York-based global insurance broker Marsh, a subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Cos.

Doyle was most recently CEO of American International Group’s (AIG) commercial insurance business worldwide, but was ousted in December as part of a management shake up.

Doyle will oversee Marsh’s global brokerage businesses and will the firm’s Executive Committee as well as the Executive Committee of Marsh & McLennan. His duties are to begin April 15.

He will report to Peter Zaffino, CEO of Marsh, and chairman of Risk and Insurance Services, and will be based in Marsh’s New York office.

Doyle was responsible for AIG’s property, casualty, financial lines, specialty lines, institutional markets and mortgage guaranty products and services. Previously, Doyle served as president and CEO of Chartis U.S.

“I look forward to working closely with John to deliver superior value to our clients and to further distinguish Marsh as the industry leader,” said Peter Zaffino, CEO of Marsh, and Chairman of Risk and Insurance Services. “In today’s evolving and dynamic marketplace, John’s appointment is evidence of our continued commitment to having the most talented people and broadest capabilities to position Marsh’s business for the future.”

AIG CEO Peter Hancock announced a management team realignment last December that resulted in departures of several high-ranking executives. In addition to Doyle, those leaving included David Herzog, chief financial officer; Jose Hernandez, CEO Asia Pacific; and Eric Martinez, executive vice president Global Claims and Operations.

Doyle joined AIG in 1986 and has run units including National Union Fire Insurance Co. and American Home Assurance Co. He was named to AIG’s executive team in June, 2013 by then-CEO Robert Benmosche. He was given additional responsibilities by Hancock in September, 2014 after he took over from Benmosche as CEO.
