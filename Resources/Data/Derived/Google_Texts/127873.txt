If only Congressional Democrats had called their monumental healthcare legislation the Adorable Care Act back in 2009, it might not have been quite so controversial.

The Obama Administration corrected that misnaming Friday, when it unveiled a site devoted to kittens, puppies, baby pandas, polar bears and other cute animals telling you to get health coverage.

All of the Valentine's Day cards the Adorable Care Act site offers invite you to share them on Facebook — whereupon the Obama Political Action Committee Organizing for Action gains access to your friends list. (Cute, and smart politics too.)

Cute animals: the Obama PAC's trojan horse into millions of Facebook accounts.

The Adorable Care Act Twitter account has been tweeting pictures like these for years, but the White House always denied it was behind the account. A new Twitter bio on the account says that its mystery founder has handed over the keys of the account to Organizing for America.

The account had lain dormant since October, but then sprang into life Thursday night with this preparatory tweet:

You could dismiss it as a bit of Valentine's Day fun, but it brings up an important point: "Obamacare" has always stumbled when it came to branding itself. (There's that name, for one thing, appropriated by Obama but still the favorite moniker of conservative critics.)

But it would be hard for any politician to state they're against adorable care.

Perhaps the next act for the administration, then, is to counter the GOP's attempted defunding of the ACA by hiring kitten navigators.

Because the GOP would be hard pressed to block, defund or otherwise impede kittens.
