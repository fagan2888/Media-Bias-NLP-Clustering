It\u2019s called the Clean Power Plan.\n\nThe new proposal appeared as document 2014-13726 in the Federal Register today. That automatically triggers the start of a 120-day written comment period where stakeholders can provide public input before the proposal takes effect. EPA plans to implement the new regulation early next year.\n\nREAD ALSO: American energy policy: Government must do what\u2019s right for the health of its citizens\n\n\n\nEPA Administrator Gina McCarthy announced the President\u2019s Clean Power Plan on June 2nd before a supportive audience at EPA headquarters in Washington DC. It\u2019s the most far reaching environmental regulation in history. Despite what McCarthy said, it will increase your electric bill.\n\nIf you are dissatisfied with Obamacare, you\u2019ll hate the Clean Power Plan.\n\nThere are only four public hearings scheduled to make your feelings known:\n\nPublic Hearings: Clean Power Plan Date Time Location 7/29/2014 9AM-8PM Atlanta, GA 7/29/2914 9AM-8PM Denver, CO 7/30/2014 9AM-8PM Washington DC 7/31/2014 9AM-8PM Pittsburg, PA\n\nEPA has limited oral testimony to 5-minute segments spread over 36 hours, crammed into a three day whirlwind through four cities.\n\nWhy the urgency for citizen comments? Just for starters:\n\nIt affects every single American in big ways\n\nThe plan description, widely repeated in the press, is faulty\n\nThe Proposed Regulation\n\nIn her prepared remarks, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said the proposed regulation is a 30 percent reduction in CO 2 emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. \u201c30 in 2030\u201d might make a catchy slogan for plan supporters in the upcoming 2014 elections.\n\nHowever, that description does not agree with what one of McCarthy\u2019s chief assistants, Janet McCabe, said in the official EPA blog on June 4th. She said percentage reductions aren\u2019t set against a baseline year.\n\n\u201cI hope this explanation makes clear that EPA is not setting goals based on percentage reductions against a baseline year.\u201d\n\n-Janet McCabe, EPA Acting Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, \u201cUnderstanding State Goals under the Clean Power Plan\u201c, 6/4/2014\n\nAs it turns out, both are incorrect. Individualized reductions are set against a baseline year, but the year is 2012, not 2005.\n\nWhat is the big deal about 2012 instead of 2005?\n\nIf 2005 were the real baseline year, as Gina McCarthy said, we\u2019d already be 12 percent of the way to meeting the goal. A logical person would look at the above graph and say, \u201cHeck, we are almost half way there now. Should be easy to get the rest of the way\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, it isn\u2019t true. Just like Obamacare, the devil is in the details of the Clean Power Plan. For perspective, think, \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep it!\u201d.\n\nThe real proposed regulation\n\nHidden deep in the bowels of the plan is a innocent looking one-page spreadsheet showing each state\u2019s target goal. It is just a list of four raw numbers for each state, but it is the heart and soul of the whole plan.\n\nThe last number lists the 2030 target amount of CO 2 emissions expressed in pounds/megawatt-hour for each state. EPA goes into great, convoluted detail in the plan about how each state\u2019s target reduction level was determined.\n\nREAD ALSO: Climate Change: Tornado myth update\n\n\n\nThe second to last number shows the state\u2019s average emissions in the year 2012, also expressed in pounds/megawatt-hour. A check of EIA records shows the numbers and the year, 2012, are correct as listed. It\u2019s not just a typo.\n\nAdd up the numbers and calculate the percent reductions for each state, which EPA does not do, and you find that the real proposal calls for a 31.4 percent reduction in CO 2 emissions below 2012 levels (not 2005) by 2030.\n\nThe 31.4 percent is not the problem. The year 2012 is.\n\nWhat it means is the 12 percent in reductions that have already happened since 2005 don\u2019t count. That is the big deal about 2012!\n\nConclusions\n\nThis concludes a brief introduction to the Clean Power Plan. The worst is yet to come.\n\nIt\u2019s the first installment in an investigative series on the EPA\u2019s new Clean Power Plan. It barely scratches the surface of a draconian new regulation with an astronomical price tag that will only reduce U.S. overall CO 2 emissions by about 11 percent.\n\nThe real plan buried in the proposed regulation includes 12 percent more CO 2 reductions than the advertised plan. Compared to the advertised plan, the real plan calls for 43 percent reductions in CO 2 emissions below 2005 levels.\n\nAmong other things, this series will realistically estimate the plan\u2019s total costs and how it will affect ordinary Americans in the next few years, if implemented in its current form.\n\nFor example, calculations show the equivalent of somewhere between 227 to 454 of the existing 557 coal-fired electric power plants in 2012 will have to be retired and replaced to reduce CO 2 by 614 million metric tons, as called for in the plan.\n\nIs the plan worth it, as is, or are there better, cheaper ways to achieve the reduction goals? Nobody really knows.\n\nThat is why it is vitally important that as many people as possible study the 645-page monster regulation and make their discoveries known to the EPA and to their elected officials ASAP.\n\nThe clock is ticking. There are only 120 days to say something before it is too late to do anything about it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "First in an investigative series on the EPA's new regulation, called the Clean Power Plan, limiting CO2 emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Steve Davidson", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "AUSTIN, June 18, 2014 \u2014You have until October 16th, 2014 \u2013 exactly 120 days from today \u2013 to make your opinion known on a newly proposed EPA regulation that may increase electric rates $\u2026", "title": "Clean Power Plan: The clock is ticking", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/environment/clean-power-plan-the-clock-is-ticking-19824/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/EPA-Clean_Power_GHGs.png", "height": 427}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "First in an investigative series on the EPA's new regulation, called the Clean Power Plan, limiting CO2 emissions by 30 percent by the year 2030.", "title": "Clean Power Plan: The clock is ticking", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/EPA-Clean_Power_GHGs-435x375.png", "creator": "@commdiginews", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "environment,science,electricity,electric power,green energy,politics,energy policy,economic politics,climate change,emission standards", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-19T13:59:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-19T13:59:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Climate Change, Emission standards, Environment"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb6c1\"", "article_summary": "If you are dissatisfied with Obamacare, you\u2019ll hate the Clean Power Plan.\nIt\u2019s the first installment in an investigative series on the EPA\u2019s new Clean Power Plan.\nIt\u2019s called the Clean Power Plan.\nJust like Obamacare, the devil is in the details of the Clean Power Plan.\nConclusionsThis concludes a brief introduction to the Clean Power Plan."}
