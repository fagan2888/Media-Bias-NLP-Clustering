Meanwhile, 401 national parks across the country are closed to tourists and vacationers, provoking \u201cpretty livid\u201d responses.\n\nBut the fact that the government and parks are closed hasn\u2019t stopped Congress from holding hearings, including one Thursday in the House Natural Resources Committee on a bill that would force a fire sale of 3.3 million acres of public lands.\n\nThe Disposal of Excess Federal Lands Act of 2013 (H.R. 2657) from Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) would mandate that public lands Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming to be sold off to the highest bidder as a way of reducing the deficit. The areas to be sold are based on an outdated report from 1997, although the bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to \u201cupdate\u201d that report.\n\nHowever, evidence shows not only that voters oppose selling off public lands, but that they are incredibly important economically. This is especially true for the state of Utah, which is losing $4.4 million every day because its five national parks are shutdown. Tourists and visitors to these parks are being turned away, and reports of the potentially devastating economic impacts are already coming in.\n\nThe manager of an lodge outside of Bryce Canyon National Park said \u201cThis such an important time for us \u2026 It\u2019s going to kill us if this drags on\u201d\n\nMoab retailer Canyon Voyages Adventure Company has gotten \u201ctons and tons of calls from visitors who have scheduled trips with us or aren\u2019t sure if they can go\u201d because Canyonlands and Arches National Parks are closed.\n\nAnd The Deseret News reports that \u201cZion [National Park] expects to turn away 10,000 visitors a day during the government-imposed closure, costing $50,000 in daily revenue.\u201d\n\nSome of these disgruntled tourists have gone so far as to go on record blaming Republicans for the shutdown. For example, Mark Boeckman, a visitor to Zion National Park said earlier this week:\n\nI\u2019m a Republican and I am not happy with what they are doing. I\u2019m of the opinion that the far right of the Republican Party has taken this too far. The Obamacare thing is something they voted for\u2026 it is what is. Live by it.\n\nWith Americans\u2019 frustration growing at the shutdown, House Republicans are trying to distract from their closure of national parks by proposing piecemeal legislation to keep just national parks (but not monuments, refuges, or Forest Service campgrounds) open. They also took the opportunity on Wednesday to vilify the National Park Service for providing safe access for Honor Flight participants to the World War II Memorial, despite the fact that the agency \u201c\u2018bent over backwards\u2019 to make sure veterans were not inconvenienced or disappointed\u201d according to the co-founder of the Honor Flight Network.\n\nAnd of course, while national parks are closed to the public, they remain open to oil and gas drilling.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The fact that the government and parks are shut down hasn't stopped Congress from holding hearings to sell off public lands.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The fact that the government and parks are shut down hasn't stopped Congress from holding hearings to sell off public lands.", "title": "National Parks Remain Closed, Yet House Republicans Move To Sell Off 3.3 Million Acres Of Public Lands", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/10/03/2724281/shutdown-parks-republicans-public-lands/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP873811461782.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ThinkProgress", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP873811461782-321x214.jpg", "description": "The fact that the government and parks are shut down hasn't stopped Congress from holding hearings to sell off public lands.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "National Parks Remain Closed, Yet House Republicans Move To Sell Off 3.3 Million Acres Of Public Lands"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-climate", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP873811461782.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP873811461782.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-03T09:08:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Climate National Parks Remain Closed, Yet House Republicans Move To Sell Off 3.3 Million Acres Of Public Lands CREDIT:The U.S. government remains shut down, thanks to House Republicans\u2019 refusal to fund the government without defunding the Affordable Care Act.\nAnd of course, while national parks are closed to the public, they remain open to oil and gas drilling.\nThis is especially true for the state of Utah, which is losing $4.4 million every day because its five national parks are shutdown.\nHowever, evidence shows not only that voters oppose selling off public lands, but that they are incredibly important economically.\nWith Americans\u2019 frustration growing at the shutdown, House Republicans are trying to distract from their closure of national parks by proposing piecemeal legislation to keep just national parks (but not monuments, refuges, or Forest Service campgrounds) open."}
