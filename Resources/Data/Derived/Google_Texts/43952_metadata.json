But I think there might be some underlying things happening to her, some things off the court, that are affecting her. I\u2019m sure she will work them out.\u201d\n\nOn a sunny but blustery middle Sunday \u2014 traditionally an off-day at Wimbledon \u2014 most of the players remaining in the singles draw held sessions at the nearby Aorangi Park practice courts.\n\nFederer and Murray were there at the same time, although due to rain delays on Friday, Federer, like Nadal, won\u2019t play his fourth-round match until Tuesday.\n\nFederer says he\u2019s amazed as anyone about the Big 4\u2019s ability to maintain such a stellar record in Grand Slam tournaments.\n\n\u201cI came through the ranks where it was normal for top guys to have a bad Slam, have maybe two bad Slams from time to time, but it barely happens anymore,\u201d Federer said. \u201cIt\u2019s like such a shock when it does.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve been surprised how consistent I\u2019ve been personally, but even more so by everybody else who is just like normal to get to quarters, get to semis. Because I know how small the margins are.\u201d\n\nDjokovic\u2019s chances of advancing might rest with his sore arm. He had an afternoon training session Sunday to test his left arm and shoulder he injured in a nasty fall on Friday in his Centre Court win over France\u2019s Gilles Simon.\n\nDjokovic lunged for a shot behind the baseline, tumbled on the grass and rolled over twice, his racket flying from his hand. He thought he had dislocated his shoulder, but from what Djokovic says, it looked a lot worse than it was.\n\n\u201cLuckily there is nothing damaged,\u201d he said. \u201cI just came from the doctor\u2019s office, ultrasound. I\u2019m quite confident that it will not affect my physical state or regimen or daily routine. I think it\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\n\nDjokovic will play the third match on Centre Court on Monday against 14th-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.\n\nAlize Cornet, who scored the biggest upset of the tournament when she beat Serena Williams on Saturday, opens Monday\u2019s play on Centre against Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, who is the only woman to advance to the semifinals of both Grand Slam tournaments this year.\n\nDefending champion Murray plays Kevin Anderson in the match following.\n\nIn third-round matches carried over due to Saturday\u2019s rain suspensions, Wawrinka is up against Denis Istomin to start play on Court 2 while Feliciano Lopez plays American John Isner on Court 3.\n\nThe only other third-round men\u2019s match to be completed is nearly there \u2014 Kei Nishikori of Japan and Italy\u2019s Simone Bolelli are 3-3 in the fifth set, with the winner to play Canadian Milos Raonic on Tuesday.\n\nBritish tabloids will no doubt have fun with the back-to-back \u201clove\u201d matches on Court 1 on Monday.\n\nGrigor Dimitrov plays Leonardo Mayer, followed by Dimitrov\u2019s girlfriend Maria Sharapova, the 2004 Wimbledon champion, up against Angelique Kerber.\n\nNot to miss an opportunity, a gambling agency, calling Dimitrov and Sharapova \u201cthe most glamorous couple in tennis (since Connors and Evert in 1974)\u201d are offering odds of 50 to 1 that the pair will win their respective singles titles this year.\n\nAnd, oh, 250 to 1 that they\u2019ll announce their engagement before the end of the Wimbledon Champions Ball.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The same can't be said on the women's side, where top-seeded and five-time champion Serena Williams won't see any action at the All England Club in Week 2 except in doubles with her sister Venus, another five-time Wimbledon winner who is also out of singles.", "Author": "Dennis Passa", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The same can\u2019t be said on the women\u2019s side, where top-seeded and five-time champion Serena Williams won\u2019t see any action at the All England Club in Week 2 except in doubles with her sister Venus, another five-time Wimbledon winner who is also out of singles.", "title": "Wimbledon 2014: Roger Federer, usual suspects ready for Week 2 on men\u2019s side", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/29/wimbledon-2014-roger-federer-usual-suspects-ready-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/29/britain-wimbledon-ten_lanc9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/29/britain-wimbledon-ten_lanc9.jpg", "title": "Wimbledon 2014: Roger Federer, usual suspects ready for Week 2 on men&", "description": "The same can't be said on the women's side, where top-seeded and five-time champion Serena Williams won't see any action at the All England Club in Week 2 except in doubles with her sister Venus, anot", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Grand Slam, Billie Jean King"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81c4\"", "article_summary": "Grigor Dimitrov plays Leonardo Mayer, followed by Dimitrov\u2019s girlfriend Maria Sharapova, the 2004 Wimbledon champion, up against Angelique Kerber.\nFederer says he\u2019s amazed as anyone about the Big 4\u2019s ability to maintain such a stellar record in Grand Slam tournaments.\nWTA founder Billie Jean King, winner of eight Grand Slam singles titles in the Open era, says she recalls going through a similar streak in her career.\nWilliams, who has 17 Grand Slam singles titles, hadn\u2019t been knocked out of Wimbledon so soon since 2005, but has departed before the quarterfinals at four of the past five majors.\n\u201cMost definitely,\u201d King said Sunday near Wimbledon when announcing Singapore as the new site of the WTA season-ending championships in October."}
