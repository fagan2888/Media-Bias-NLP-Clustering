But Bart Scott, the former Jets linebacker and current The NFL Today studio analyst, has no such obligations. Which is why he spoke frankly on the Jets' locker room dynamic and the quarterback's role within it.\n\n\u201cI can understand how that situation can escalate, especially because there's an ATM in the players' lounge,\u201d Scott said Tuesday, via the New York Post's Brian Costello. \u201cCome on, bro, you're walking by an ATM every day. It's just bam, bam, get the money.\u201d\n\nLike most current and former players, Scott was surprised that Smith found himself in a predicament that ended with him getting punched in the face.\n\n\"I've never heard anyone get into it with the quarterback,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIn my opinion, if you put [former Jets quarterback] Mark Sanchez into that same situation and he couldn't make it to the charity event or whatever happened, what a quarterback is supposed to do is to give you your $600 and donate $1,000 to your charity. That's what a leader does. Maybe Geno is too young in the process to understand that and he has to mature more. ...\n\n\u201cSanchez, even though he was goofy and he didn't play well at times, he was a likable guy. The only person I could have seen getting in an altercation with Sanchez was maybe Santonio [Holmes].\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Smith returned to practice this week, though he'll miss the start of the regular season. That means veteran journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick will be the Jets' starting quarterback with rookie Bryce Petty and just-signed Matt Flynn behind him on the depth chart.", "article_metadata": {"description": "'The NFL Today' studio analyst and former NFL LB Bart Scott spoke frankly on the Jets' locker room dynamic and the quarterback's role within it.", "og": {"site_name": "CBSSports.com", "description": "'The NFL Today' studio analyst and former NFL LB Bart Scott spoke frankly on the Jets' locker room dynamic and the quarterback's role within it.", "title": "Bart Scott: Geno Smith should have used ATM in Jets players' lounge", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25280980/bart-scott-geno-smith-should-have-used-atm-in-jets-team-lounge", "image": "http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/blogs/Geno-Smith-fans-words-Lions.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'The NFL Today' studio analyst and former NFL LB Bart Scott spoke frankly on the Jets' locker room dynamic and the quarterback's role within it.", "title": "Bart Scott: Geno Smith should have used ATM in Jets players' lounge", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25280980/bart-scott-geno-smith-should-have-used-atm-in-jets-team-lounge", "image": "http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/blogs/Geno-Smith-fans-words-Lions.jpg", "creator": "@EyeOnNFL", "site": "@cbssports", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 297742330311988, "pages": 25902406772}, "vr": {"content_id": 25280980, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "sports news scores information, NFL football MLB baseball NBA basketball live scores news standings teams players, NCAA college basketball football scores news polls rankings, fantasy football news player rankings advice, fantasy baseball basketball news, CBS fantasy sports, golf tennis soccer autos auto racing tour de france, summer winter Olympics, CBSSports.com Sports Line, CBS SportsLine.com", "googlebot": "NOODP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d75\"", "article_summary": "\"I've never heard anyone get into it with the quarterback,\u201d Scott said.\nBut Bart Scott, the former Jets linebacker and current The NFL Today studio analyst, has no such obligations.\n\u201cI can understand how that situation can escalate, especially because there's an ATM in the players' lounge,\u201d Scott said Tuesday, via the New York Post's Brian Costello.\nIt's just bam, bam, get the money.\u201dLike most current and former players, Scott was surprised that Smith found himself in a predicament that ended with him getting punched in the face.\nThat means veteran journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick will be the Jets' starting quarterback with rookie Bryce Petty and just-signed Matt Flynn behind him on the depth chart."}
