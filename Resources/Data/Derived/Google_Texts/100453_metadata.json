Fairgrounds in Raleigh opens to the public this week.\n\nThis long-running sale, which spreads across two buildings at the fairgrounds, attracts thousands of shoppers who nab great deals on children's clothes, toys and other gear. It's the first of three dozen sales that will pop up over the next few months. They'll all primarily feature spring and summer clothes and gear. We have a full list in our consignment sale database.\n\nThe Kids Exchange is open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Friday; 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday; and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday, when some items are half off.\n\nIf you're going, it's best to go prepared. Know your children's sizes. Have a list of their needs. And bring something to lug around your haul - a stroller or wagon (without a child in it) or even a large cardboard box that you pull around with a rope. In my many years of consignment sale shopping, I've seen it all.\n\nYou'll also want to bring your own large shopping bag or kitchen trash bag to use. Otherwise, you'll need to pay 25 cents for a shopping bag from the sale.\n\nAdmission is free to the sale. Children are welcome (though I always find it's easier to shop without little ones if you can swing it). From 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., Saturday, Elsa, Elmo and Spider-Man will make an appearance.\n\nHappy shopping!", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-19 20:45:00", "description": "This long-running sale, which spreads across two buildings at the fairgrounds, attracts thousands of shoppers who nab great deals on children's clothes, toys and other gear.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-19 20:45:00", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14364931|asset_type=blogpost"}, "twitter": {"description": "This long-running sale, which spreads across two buildings at the fairgrounds, attracts thousands of shoppers who nab great deals on children's clothes, toys and other gear.", "title": "Kids Exchange consignment sale opens to public this week :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/kids-exchange-consignment-sale-opens-to-public-this-week/14364931/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/goaskmom/2015/01/17/14364961/14364961-1451931529-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-19T20:45:00-05:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "This long-running sale, which spreads across two buildings at the fairgrounds, attracts thousands of shoppers who nab great deals on children's clothes, toys and other gear.", "title": "Kids Exchange consignment sale opens to public this week :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/kids-exchange-consignment-sale-opens-to-public-this-week/14364931/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/goaskmom/2015/01/17/14364961/kidsexchangefb-960x326.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "pinterest": "nohover", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1783\"", "article_summary": "You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other charactersThe massive Kids Exchange consignment sale at the N.C.
