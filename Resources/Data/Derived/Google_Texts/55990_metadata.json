A recent study released Monday has found that only 18 percent of all claims made in cosmetic advertisements are actually true, while the rest are covering up for something.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Global Fashion Marketing, found that only one in five advertisements could be proven for accuracy, while most dashed the truth with vague, scientific-sounding terms like \u201cclinically proven\u201d and \u201cdermatologically tested.\u201d\n\nFor the study, researchers looked at 289 full-page advertisements in fashion magazines, like Vogue, Glamour, and Marie Claire, that featured makeup, body care products, facial skincare products, fragrances, hair products and nail polishes. A panel of three judges then examined so-called \u201cscientific claims,\u201d and categorized them into one of four groups: outright lie, omission, vague, and acceptable.\n\nAfter going through just seven magazines, researchers discovered that 621 out of 757 claims made by these companies did not add up. Only 18 percent were filed into the \u201cacceptable\u201d category, while just 14 percent were concluded to be trustworthy.\n\n\u201cDeception not only undermines the credibility of advertising as a whole by making consumers defensive, but also produces damaging effects for the advertisers who are directly responsible for making the claims,\u201d Professor Jie Fowler, from Valdosta State University in Georgia, told the Telegraph. \u201cThe study makes it clear that marketers have a powerful self-interest in upholding the truth in cosmetics advertising. The article presented the genesis and current status of cosmetic claims and suggested that more regulations need to be developed.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, researchers also noted that if on-sale cosmetics were actually able to do half of the things they claimed, they would have such an effect on metabolism that they'd have to be considered medicine.\n\nClaims of \u201cwellbeing and happiness,\u201d the age-old advertising tactic, were also found to be unsubstantiated by researchers. Overall, they found that \u201cthose who back the claims with scientific evidence and consumer testing often use questionable methodologies for their substantiation.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first instance in which cosmetic companies danced around the truth. The potential for the chemicals used within cosmetics to cause harm is also relatively unknown to consumers, and mostly unregulated. A proposed amendment to the current federal Food, Drug, and C0osmetic Act cited that women typically put 168 chemicals on their bodies each day, the health repercussions of which are mostly unknown.\n\nScott Faber, Environmental Working Group\u2019s vice president of government affairs, told ABC, \u201cCosmetics are sort of the last unregulated area of consumer product laws. I can\u2019t overstate how little law is now on the books. The FDA virtually has no power to regulate the products we use every day.\u201d\n\nAnd with little consumer knowledge or government regulation going into these products, cosmetic companies are free to make these advertising claims that we see so often. Your best bet when dealing with cosmetics: proceed with caution, and take everything with a grain of salt. Most products are not the miracle they claim to be, and looking up chemicals that are used within your favorite creams and shampoos is the best way to avoid potential health repercussions.\n\nSource: Fowler J, Reisenwitz T, Carlson L, et al.
