The company says the floor has only been around for a few years, and more schools are using it to help teach children with special needs.\n\nThe \"Wize Floor\" can also be used to help children who struggle with traditional forms of learning.\n\n\"Some kids just learn better by moving, some kids learn really well by sitting still engaging with a book, but some kids have trouble just sitting and not doing anything. They learn better when they use their body and they remember things much better when they use their body as a way of doing it,\" said Kaspar Rosengreen Nielsen, WizeFloor.\n\nThe company says it hopes to expand the \"Wize Floor\" into other countries in the near future.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "It's safe to say learning is not the same as it was when we were in school.", "author": "Justin Dougherty", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31047619/tech-transforming-the-classroom-new-interactive-device-helps-students-learn", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9723297_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It's safe to say learning is not the same as it was when we were in school.", "title": "Transforming The Classroom: 'Wize Floor' Helps Students Learn"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9723297_G.jpg", "description": "It's safe to say learning is not the same as it was when we were in school.", "card": "summary", "title": "Transforming The Classroom: 'Wize Floor' Helps Students Learn"}, "wnreadableurl": "tech-transforming-the-classroom-new-interactive-device-helps-students-learn", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/01/25", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive, School", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS20", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive, School"}, "article_summary": "The company says it hopes to expand the \"Wize Floor\" into other countries in the near future.\n\"Some kids just learn better by moving, some kids learn really well by sitting still engaging with a book, but some kids have trouble just sitting and not doing anything.\nThey learn better when they use their body and they remember things much better when they use their body as a way of doing it,\" said Kaspar Rosengreen Nielsen, WizeFloor.\nThe \"Wize Floor\" can also be used to help children who struggle with traditional forms of learning.\nA company in Denmark has developed what it calls the \"Wize Floor.\""}
