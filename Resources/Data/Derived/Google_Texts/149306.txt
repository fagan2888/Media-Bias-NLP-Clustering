Brandon, SD

Brandon homeowners living east of Split Rock Boulevard are asked to limit the amount of water used Saturday night. The restriction is expected to be in place through Sunday.

Brandon Director of Public Works Rollie Hoeke says a sewer lift station is down and any extra flow could cause backup to flow into more than 100 homes.

As of 8:30 p.m., at least one home has sewer in the basement, according to Hoeke.

The restriction will be in place until the lift station is repaired.
