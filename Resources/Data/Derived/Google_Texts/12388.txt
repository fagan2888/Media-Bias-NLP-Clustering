Many people were at the Frank Cochran Center for a back-to-school gospel fest Sunday evening.

The fest had several gospel performers including the Echoaires, Joseph Johnson and two performers from the Mississippi Mass Choir. Organizers say the event is to give back to the community before school starts.

"Gospel Fest 2015. This is where the choirs meet the quartets. This is a back to school program we are doing. We want to give back to the kids." 105.7 The Beat’s Keith Brown says.

A car was also given away at Sunday night’s event.
