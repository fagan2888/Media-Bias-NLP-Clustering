The vote came nearly a decade after the bishops chose their first female leader.\n\nLeading up to Saturday\u2019s selection, Curry who has served as bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina since 2000, said he envisioned a church committed to being part of the \u201cJesus movement.\u201d He said he would focus on evangelism and acts of service, along with a \u201cchurchwide spiritual revival.\u201d\n\nWhile he must lead and tend to day-to-day functions as the faith\u2019s chief executive officer, Curry said his job is more than that.\n\n\u201cIn this mission moment of the church\u2019s life,\u201d he said, \u201cthe primary role of the presiding bishop must be CEO in another sense: Chief Evangelism Officer, to encourage, inspire and support us all to claim the calling of the Jesus movement.\u201d\n\nCurry, 62, spent 12 years as rector of St. James Church in Baltimore before his election as bishop of the N.C. Diocese. He and his wife, Sharon, have two grown daughters, Rachel and Elizabeth.\n\nHe will succeed Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori, the faith\u2019s first female presiding bishop, who completes her nine-year term Nov. 1.\n\nThe U.S. Episcopal Church is a branch of the 80 million-member Anglican Communion, with churches across the globe and its origins in the Church of England.\n\nAbout 9,000 people have come to Salt Lake City for the Episcopal General Convention, held every three years, where leaders and lay followers vote on proposals about the direction for the church.\n\nOn Friday, the convention reportedly erupted into applause when the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling was announced legalizing same-sex marriage across the U.S. The Episcopal Church has advocated for equal rights for gays and lesbians since 1976.\n\nCurry has been a supporter of LGBT rights and was among the first group of bishops to allow same-sex marriages to be performed among the NC diocese\u2019s 112 congregations.\n\nOutspoken on social issues, including race and gender issues, he has spoken out at Moral Monday demonstrations in Raleigh, the state capital, challenging local and state governments to lift up the poor and marginalized.\n\nBut he may be best known for his energetic African-American preaching style that mixes a down-home flavor with a distinct emphasis on what he calls \u201cradical hospitality\u201d and the Christian message of God\u2019s grace and love.\n\n\u201cHe talks about being called to be relationship with God that\u2019s not just about your own personal piety, but about changing people\u2019s lives and changing the world for the good,\u201d said the Rev. Jim Melnyk, president of the N.C. diocese\u2019s standing committee and rector at St. Paul\u2019s Episcopal Church in Smithfield, N.C.\n\nA Chicago native, Curry graduated from Hobart College in Geneva, N.Y., and received a masters of divinity from Yale Divinity School.\n\nMelnyk said Curry will be known as a bridge-builder who recognizes that people may not always agree.\n\n\u201cRather than being divided by people who differ, he believes we\u2019re called to love one another and work together to transform the world,\u201d Melnyk said.\n\n(Yonat Shimron contributed to this report.)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Institutions, Christian, Episcopal Church USA, Michael Curry, presiding bishop, Protestant", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "SALT LAKE CITY\u2013 Curry said he envisioned a church committed to being part of the", "title": "Episcopal Church elects Michael Curry first black presiding bishop", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/27/episcopal-church-elects-michael-curry-first-black-presiding-bishop/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/michaelcurry1-copy.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/27/episcopal-church-elects-michael-curry-first-black-presiding-bishop/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/27/episcopal-church-elects-michael-curry-first-black-presiding-bishop/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "SALT LAKE CITY\u2013 Curry said he envisioned a church committed to being part of the"}, "article_summary": "He will succeed Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori, the faith\u2019s first female presiding bishop, who completes her nine-year term Nov. 1.\nThe U.S. Episcopal Church is a branch of the 80 million-member Anglican Communion, with churches across the globe and its origins in the Church of England.\nThe Episcopal Church has advocated for equal rights for gays and lesbians since 1976.\nOn Saturday (June 27), during a private meeting at St. Mark\u2019s Cathedral in downtown Salt Lake City, they elected Bishop Michael Curry as the first African-American presiding bishop of the 2.5 million-member faith.\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2013 Episcopal bishops have made history again."}
