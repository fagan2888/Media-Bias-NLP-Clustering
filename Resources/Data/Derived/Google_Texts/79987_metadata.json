This year\u2019s event, which stretches on until March 1, is focused on reaching the families and communities that may fail to realize how disordered eating is impacting the people they know and love. \u201cEverybody knows somebody with an eating disorder,\u201d the promotional materials for the awareness campaign point out. Here are five facts to keep in mind about the devastating impact of this issue:\n\n1. Thirty million Americans will suffer from an eating disorder at some point in their lifetime.\n\nAccording to the National Eating Disorder Association, an estimated 20 million U.S. women and an additional 10 million U.S. men will struggle with a \u201cclinically significant\u201d eating disorder at some point in their life. Eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, or what\u2019s defined as an \u201cother specified feeding or eating disorder\u201d (OSFED). Although many Americans incorrectly assume that it\u2019s easy to spot an eating disorder, the people who struggle with this condition can actually come in all types of shapes and sizes, and are typically adept at hiding their symptoms.\n\n2. Anorexia is the most fatal mental health issue.\n\nOne out of every five people with anorexia eventually dies from causes related to the disease. The rates of suicide among people who suffer from eating disorders are higher than the rates among other psychiatric disorders, largely because anorexia is often accompanied by depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. A 2003 study found that people with anorexia are 56 times more likely to take their own lives than people who don\u2019t suffer from an eating disorder.\n\n3. Disordered eating is on the rise among children.\n\nDisordered eating is an issue that tends to manifests itself in children and young adults. A full 95 percent of the Americans who have eating disorders are between the ages of 12 and 25, and the majority of those people report that their unhealthy relationship with food began before they turned 20. Perhaps partly because of the unrealistic body images that are persistently marketed toward kids, this issue is getting worse. According to a recent study, hospitalizations for eating disorders in children under 12 years old increased by a staggering 119 percent between 1999 and 2006. Eighty percent of U.S. girls say they\u2019ve been on a diet.\n\n4. Eating disorder patients often lack sufficient health coverage.\n\nDespite the fact that disordered eating impacts millions of Americans\u2019 lives, and early intervention has been proven to be an effective method of treating the condition, people who struggle with anorexia or bulimia often can\u2019t get the medical care they need. Just one in ten eating disorder patients typically receives treatment. That\u2019s often because eating disorders are difficult to diagnose and insurers don\u2019t always cover the wide range of mental health treatments that can be necessary to address them. Some states have taken their own steps to expand coverage for eating disorders, which isn\u2019t considered to be an \u201cessential benefit\u201d under Obamacare\u2019s new exchanges. Fortunately, though, the health reform law does prevent insurers from denying coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions, which includes eating disorders.\n\n5. The government doesn\u2019t designate much funding toward eating disorder research.\n\n\u201cEating disorders are complicated and vexing problems and we don\u2019t exactly understand the pathophysiology of them. Certainly there is both a genetic component and an environmental component,\u201d Dr. Aaron Krasner, a practicing psychiatrist, explained to Forbes this week. Some eating disorder prevention advocates argue that\u2019s because there isn\u2019t enough funding designated for research in this area. The National Institute of Health (NIH) allocates just 93 cents in research funding per affected eating disorder patient, compared to $88 per affected autism patient and $81 per affected schizophrenia patient. Figuring out how to address eating disorders would be in the government\u2019s best interest, though \u2014 one study estimated that hospital costs associated with anorexia and bulimia can top $271 million annually.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Advocates are currently raising awareness about the deadly disease, which is the most fatal mental health issue in the country.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Advocates are currently raising awareness about the deadly disease, which is the most fatal mental health issue in the country.", "title": "5 Facts To Remember During National Eating Disorders Awareness Week", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/24/3322321/facts-eating-disorder-awareness/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/thinspo_large.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Advocates are currently raising awareness about the deadly disease, which is the most fatal mental health issue in the country.", "title": "5 Facts To Remember During National Eating Disorders Awareness Week", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/thinspo_large-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/thinspo_large.jpeg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/thinspo_large.jpeg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-24T11:53:25+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde58f\"", "article_summary": "Health 5 Facts To Remember During National Eating Disorders Awareness Week CREDIT: (Credit: Vice's Motherboard Blog)Supporters illustrate their personal connections to eating disorders for this week\u2019s campaign CREDIT: National Eating Disorders Awareness WeekAdvocates are currently marking the 14th annual National Eating Disorders Awareness Week to highlight the psychological and physical toll stemming from the disease.\nEating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, or what\u2019s defined as an \u201cother specified feeding or eating disorder\u201d (OSFED).\nAccording to the National Eating Disorder Association, an estimated 20 million U.S. women and an additional 10 million U.S. men will struggle with a \u201cclinically significant\u201d eating disorder at some point in their life.\n\u201cEating disorders are complicated and vexing problems and we don\u2019t exactly understand the pathophysiology of them.\nSome eating disorder prevention advocates argue that\u2019s because there isn\u2019t enough funding designated for research in this area."}
