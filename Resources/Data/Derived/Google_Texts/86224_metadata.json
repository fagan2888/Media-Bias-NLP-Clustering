It wouldn't have been that much of a shocker, considering past female Oscar winners who have worn white. But it would've been a bit of a disappointment, as a little of one thing can go a long way \u0097 and a lot of one color on any red carpet can make for a boring fashion discussion.\n\nLogin required We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us.

Much, much bigger improvement than the odd, white gown she wore at the Globes.\n\nAlso improved since then was fellow nominee Julia Roberts in a lacy black floor-length gown.\n\nAs I've already gone over to the dark side, others looking bombshell in black included past Oscar-winner Charlize Theron, Anne Hathaway in mirror-like pailettes sewn into the bodice and, perhaps most interestingly, Anna Kendrick. The \"When I'm Gone\" singer and \"Perfect Pitch\" actress wore a really cool J. Mendel gown with pleated, asymmetrical hem and red beadwork on a sheer midriff panel - and, best of all, an amazing clutch that looked like an emerald-cut ruby.\n\nBejeweled\n\nSpeaking of jewelry terms, quite a few starlets took a gilt trip on the red carpet in gold tones. Among my favorites were Broken Arrow's own Kristin Chenoweth in gold-beaded Roberto Cavalli.\n\nAlso channeling Oscar gold was past winner Cate Blanchett in a glorious Giorgio Armani that \u0097 OK, this is weird, I admit \u0097 reminded me of golden, crystalized ginger. Just yummy. Sarah Paulson from \"American Horror Story\" and \"12 Years a Slave\" was lovely in golden Elie Saab.\n\nWasn't feeling Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins' gold gown with heavy beadwork, though. I wanted to like it, as it seemed vintage; but the long sleeves, length of the gown and, again, heavy beadwork almost seemed dowdy on her.\n\nOn a brighter note, albeit darker in tone (literally), Tony-winning actress Idina Menzel was fetching in dark green strapless Vera Wang, Sandra Bullock was fabulous in an aubergine-esque navy Alexander McQueen, and June Squib was matronly marvelous in green beaded Tadashi Shoji. Oh, and don't forget Amy Adams in navy Gucci and Tiffany jewels.\n\nWhite winners\n\nThose who lived up to the show's white expectations were host Ellen DeGeneres' wife, Portia de Rossi, in a beautiful, sheer halter gown with cut outs. Kristin Cavallari wore white Alexander McQueen with gold cap sleeves, and the divine Bette Midler in a red-accented Reem Acra made just for her.\n\nBut my favorite in white might be Naomi Watts in Francisco Costa for Calvin Klein \u0097 and a gorgeous spiderwebby collar-like necklace.\n\nSuit up\n\nAmong the best-dressed guys were nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor in a classic tux, as well as musician John Legend. My favorite suits, though, were the blue ones \u0097 specifically, Kevin Spacey and Jason Sudeikis. Also liked Joseph Gordon-Levitt's tux, which seemed to have metallic thread woven into the fabric.\n\nAlthough I'm not fond of white tux jackets, I liked the ivory ones over bright white shirts on Ryan Seacrest, Matthew McConaughey and, popping his with a red bow tie, winner Jared Leto.\n\nBut what was up with presenter Jim Carrey in a too-blue tux? Also wasn't fond of fellow funny man Bill Murray, who looked a bit disheveled. And I wanted to like Kellan Lutz's tux because it was made partly from recycled plastic bottles. But the sleeves looked badly wrinkled, and it was distracting. Nothing should ever be distracting on Kellan Lutz.\n\nThe worst dressed was Pharrell Williams, who looked awesome from the knees up \u0097 until you realized the knees were as far as his pants went. Grammys? Go for it. Oscars? Not a good look.\n\nLove them, not the dresses\n\nJulie Delpy looked dowdy, and Meryl Streep \u0097 who's my favorite actress on the face of the planet \u0097 was ho-hum in her gown. Love her more than ice cream, but Ellen DeGeneres' opening outfit \u0097 the weird Col. Sanders-ish white tie/cravat or whatever it was \u0097 stood out in a bad way. But loved her in white. I oohed along with the audience when she came out in her second outfit.\n\nAlso wasn't a fan of E!'s Kelly Osbourne's dress during pre-show commentary. Didn't like most of the commentators' choice in wardrobe, actually. But I'm sitting here writing this in sweatpants and a Bass Pro Shop hoodie, so who the heck am I to judge. (They were white, though - once upon a time, anyway).\n\nBest dressed Women\n\n\u00bb Lupita Nyong'o\n\n\u00bb Jennifer Lawrence\n\n\u00bb Portia de Rossi\n\n\u00bb Charlize Theron\n\n\u00bb Cate Blanchett\n\n\u00bb Kristin Chenoweth\n\n\u00bb Anna Kendrick\n\n\u00bb Amy Adams\n\n\u00bb Idina Menzel\n\n\u00bb Kristin Cavallari\n\nBest dressed men\n\n\u00bb Matthew McConaughey\n\n\u00bb Jason Sudekis\n\n\u00bb Kevin Spacey\n\n\u00bb Chiwetel Ejiofor\n\n\u00bb Joseph Gordon-Levitt\n\nWorst dressed\n\n\u00bb Pharrell Williams\n\n\u00bb Julie Delpy\n\n\u00bb Jim Carrey\n\n\u00bb Kelly Osbourne", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "I was expecting white-out conditions in Hollywood this weekend.", "title": "Jason Ashley Wright: Stars stun in colors, jewel-toned gowns at Oscars", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/movienews/jason-ashley-wright-stars-stun-in-colors-jewel-toned-gowns/article_de92f30d-6491-5b59-bc40-20cbd9037d31.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/d5/1d5ee084-a2c4-11e3-9c0b-001a4bcf6878/531462bb3909b.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C456", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "I was expecting white-out conditions in Hollywood this weekend.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "gown,beadwork,red,gold,oscar,tux,actress,bit,seemed,carpet,movienews,scene,scenehomepage2", "news_keywords": "gown,beadwork,red,gold,oscar,tux,actress,bit,seemed,carpet,movienews,scene,scenehomepage2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b52\"", "article_summary": "Much, much bigger improvement than the odd, white gown she wore at the Globes.\nAlso channeling Oscar gold was past winner Cate Blanchett in a glorious Giorgio Armani that \u0097 OK, this is weird, I admit \u0097 reminded me of golden, crystalized ginger.\nWasn't feeling Oscar nominee Sally Hawkins' gold gown with heavy beadwork, though.\nSince the Golden Globes, fashion experts have predicted quite a bit of white on the red carpet during Sunday night's Oscar telecast.\nIt wouldn't have been that much of a shocker, considering past female Oscar winners who have worn white."}
