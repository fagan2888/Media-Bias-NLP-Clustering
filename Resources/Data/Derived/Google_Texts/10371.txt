Two men were arrested early Sunday morning following a home invasion in east Wichita.

It happened just after 1 a.m. in the 5100 block of East Bayley, near Lincoln and Oliver. Sgt. Roger Runft said a man and woman were at the home when the suspects forced their way in. The woman living there alerted her roommate who then confronted the two men.

Sgt. Runft said the suspects assaulted the man with brass knuckles and a wooden chair. He suffered before he was able to grab a kitchen knife and stab one of the suspects in the arm.

Both ran from the home.

Officers found and arrested the two suspects, one of whom was treated for his stab wound. They were booked for aggravated burglary and aggravated battery.
