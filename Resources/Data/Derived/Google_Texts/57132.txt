(Photo : Facebook/Haven) "Haven" is a show on SyFy about a town full of people with supernatural secrets.

Season 5 of "Haven" is in the books. Well, the filming is, at least. We still have 13 episodes left to watch this season, thankfully. The cast took to social media on Dec. 18 and got super sentimental about their last day of filming.

William Shatner was on set this past week, also. He's starring in an upcoming four-episode arc. His character will apparently have the power to affect the town of Haven in a big way.

This week @Christian4Peeps & I got to work with @WilliamShatner kinda crazy for two nerdy kids from Orangeville. Bill's a class act #Haven5 — Adam (Edge) Copeland (@EdgeRatedR) December 18, 2014

Missing my #Haven5 family already. — William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) December 17, 2014



In the midseason finale, we said goodbye to Mara and hello to a whole new world of Troubles. Duke, who was given some very strange Troubles by Mara, exploded upon her exit. Black tears poured out of him and rained down on the townspeople, one by one.

This happened just as a dark, heavy and ominous cloud came rolling in. Whatever's about to happen to Haven doesn't look good.

The promo shows tons of explosions, likely a side effect of these new Troubles from Duke.



"Haven" will return sometime in 2015.
