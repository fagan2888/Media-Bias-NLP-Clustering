Trey Radel is back on Capitol Hill. What should he do now?\n\nEach week, Politico Magazine picks a political scandal to highlight, and our colleague Mike Allen asks Playbook readers to weigh in with their crisis-management expertise, both professional and otherwise.\n\nThis week\u2019s challenge: The return of freshman Rep. Trey Radel (R-Fla.), who pleaded guilty in November to a cocaine possession charge and is back on Capitol Hill after a month-long stint in a Florida rehabilitation center. Radel, who is on probation, refuses to resign, and faces what likely be a stiff primary challenge in August. And his troubles don\u2019t stop there: The House Ethics Committee is looking into his drug use, POLITICO reports. Radel says he\u2019s spending more time in church and has enrolled in an outpatient treatment program, but otherwise it\u2019s business as usual. \u201cI look forward to getting back to work next week representing my neighbors in Southwest Florida as they face the burdens of Obamacare, a jobless recovery, and a federal government that continues to spend more than it takes in,\u201d he said in a statement Thursday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf you were advising Radel, what would you tell him to do now? We asked Playbook readers to give it a shot, and here\u2019s what they came up with. We\u2019ll announce a winner in Tuesday\u2019s Playbook.\n\nAmelia Chass\u00e9, vice president, Hynes Communications\n\nZero-three months: Give interviews to targeted Florida outlets (print, digital, radio) that will agree up front to keep the questions reasonable. Have short, non-detailed answer for rehab Qs that includes apology, gratitude to constituents, acknowledgment of personal progress and then pivots to getting back to work for Floridians. Be able to detail specific legislative goals.\n\nThree-six months: Exclusive interview with glossy pub detailing personal progress post-rehab, ideally with spouse/family participation. Follow up with Beltway/national media blitz.\n\nSix-nine months: Look for legislative outlet to demonstrate progress i.e. drug education/prevention legislation. Meet with teen/parent/community groups and deploy anecdotes on campaign trail.\n\nKey for Radel here is that he\u2019s not Rob Ford or Marion Barry. He did something that tons of normal citizens have done and moved beyond, so provided he is able to give the appearance of frankness on the issue while also demonstrating value as a legislator, the average voter should be open to forgiving and forgetting fairly quickly given the relatively minor nature of the offense.\n\nJames Ryan Hoyne, Playbook reader\n\nIf I were Rep. Trey Radel\u2019s P.R. adviser, I would have told him to tenure his letter of resignation effective New Year\u2019s Eve, in order to focus on both his recovery as well as to avoid putting his family through the media blitz as a result of his poor judgment.\n\nAdam Dubitsky, Washington-based publicist and GOP political consultant\n\nCongressman, good to speak with you.\n\nI read your interview with Gannett, your first since being released from an in-patient treatment center if I\u2019m correct. You seemed genuinely contrite and that you understand that your best thinking got you busted for coke halfway through your first term in Congress.\n\nA lot of Hollywood types, surrounded by fawning yes men and assistants, somehow conclude that their 28 days of supervised recovery entitles them to share their vast experience with sobriety in a book or morning-show interview, only to get arrested weeks later. I\u2019m glad that\u2019s something else you don\u2019t have in common with them. Right?\n\nYou and I both know that it isn\u2019t easy for a first-termer to get national press attention. Well, you\u2019ve got it now, and I\u2019m glad you respect the gaggle of reporters camped outside your office enough to not pretend they\u2019re here to get your opinion on Obamacare or Syria.\n\nReally? Seriously? You think Anthony Weiner was mobbed by reporters because of left-wing media bias? No, you shouldn\u2019t avoid them; in fact you should go out and take their questions\u2014all of them. They\u2019ll lose interest in you before long if you respect the fact that they are doing their job. Besides, someone else in our party will do or say something dumb in the near future and they\u2019ll go bug him.\n\nYou owe it to your constituents to go on the air for ONE in-depth taped TV interview. Sure, NBC 6 is fine. No, you shouldn\u2019t get into details about your recovery; twelve-step groups are anonymous for a reason. No, I wouldn\u2019t say it was an isolated incident. Nobody will believe it. I\u2019d say that you now recognize that your problem with drugs started when you first experimented with pot or whatever it was back in high school. You don\u2019t have to talk about the legal case against you. Just be honest and work hard. Your political career is hardly in your hands anymore.\n\nOh, yeah\u2014one more thing. You\u2019re going to \u201cmeetings,\u201d right? Got a sponsor? Great.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Spin This: Rep.
