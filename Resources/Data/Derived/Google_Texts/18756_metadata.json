Look Good Feel Better (LGFB) is celebrating its 25-year anniversary providing women with the public service of beauty workshops to improve self-esteem and quality life for women at this difficult time in their life.\n\n\u201cMany women, even those who have never used make up, attend these workshops,\u201d LGFB\u2019s Beauty Expert Linda Whitehurst, who has been with the organization since the beginning, told Medical Daily. \u201cWhen you lose your lashes and brows, the eyeliner is key to giving them the appearance of lashes. Eyebrows are one of the biggest parts and areas of concern. It\u2019s not just one thing. It\u2019s losing the hair, the face changing, gaining or losing weight.\u201d\n\nBut the importance of reflecting outer beauty when test tubes and tiring treatments make a patient feel not so glamorous can improve their overall wellbeing and attitude. The appearance-related side effects of cancer can drain, demoralize, and lose a person\u2019s sense of identity during their struggle to navigate through treatments. Whitehurst, who teaches the workshops twice a month said she has seen the informal level of bonding and support from woman at the workshops create a healthy peer environment.\n\nIf you can\u2019t attend a group, Whitehurst said the new virtual makeover component provided on their website and on mobile apps is popular among teenagers undergoing chemotherapy, radiation, or other forms of treatment. The patient uploads a headshot and adjusts their makeup, hair, face, and styling along with tips designed for patients.\n\nLook Good Feel Better Look Good Feel Better\n\nSome side effects of chemotherapy damage bone marrow, hair follicles, cells in the mouth, digestive tract, and productive system. Some drugs can damage the heart, kidney, bladder, lungs, and nervous system, according to the American Cancer Society. But that\u2019s all beneath the skin. On the surface, the skin can become discolored, highly sensitive and dry, while the face may thin and hollow. Locks of hair, including eyebrows and lashes, will fall out, and weight fluctuations occur. It makes it more difficult to get out of bed and remain motivated and uplifted when you not only feel sick and tired, but also don\u2019t look like yourself anymore.\n\nIt was Ed Kavanough, the former president of the Personal Care Products Council, who recognized the need for providing women with an uplifting makeover during this difficult period in their life. In 1987, he became \u201cinstrumental in seeing the necessity and demand and pulling it all together,\u201d LGFB Executive Director Louanne Roark, who started with the organization in 1990, told Medical Daily. He was emotionally struck by one patient who became a recluse during her diagnosis when her appearance began to diminish and was rejuvenated when she received a makeover.\n\nLook Good Feel Better Look Good Feel Better\n\n\u201cSince we began, we\u2019ve developed a level of sophistication that\u2019s gone beyond what we could have imagined,\u201d Roark said. \u201cMoving forward, we want to expand our online presence and facilities to reach all women who want to participate in workshops. Accessibility is key in helping as many women as possible.\u201d\n\nThe program currently has more than 15,800 group workshops nationwide in 2,400 locations in addition to local community branches in 25 different countries in order to provide for women suffering abroad. With the program\u2019s goal to improving self-confidence, there is no border they can\u2019t cross. They\u2019ve also developed three key partnerships that are integral to the success of the program.\n\nThe Professional Beauty Association is where they recruit licensed aestheticians and cosmetologists to volunteer, while Personal Care Products Foundation supplies them with donated cosmetic products from various organizations that provide the women with quality makeup and accessories for workshops and patients\u2019 take home packages. The American Cancer Society is also a partner with LGFB, connecting the organization with individual patients, hospitals, and facilities who could benefit from their beauty care services.\n\nAll of the makeovers are free, and over the last 25 years 1.5 million cancer patients have benefited from the program. The trained volunteers are the foundation of the organization, and every year more than 6,000 volunteers dedicate their time to working with cancer patients with an informed and skilled fashion.\n\n\u201cWith the workshop format, there\u2019s a huge benefit for women in group settings,\u201d Roark said. \u201cThe outcome is always remarkable. They never know exactly what they\u2019re walking into and they come into the workshops quiet and then you see them bloom.\u201d\n\nLook Good Feel Better Look Good Feel Better\n\nThe workshop facilitators are trained to redirect conversations that become too medically depressing and remind women of their ailments. The workshops are not meant to be support groups where women discuss the struggles of new treatments, prescriptions, and life adjustments. While cancer patients have a lot to cope with, LGFB designs its workshops, website, and at-home kit packages to ease the stress. Makeup tutorials, scarf-wrapping, and wig training are often overlooked in the healing process, but workshops aimed at improving physical appearance may create a positive emotional environment for an otherwise bleak hurdle in their life.\n\n\u201cIt gives them a sense of control because when you\u2019re diagnosed with cancer you have to make many important medical decisions in a short period of time,\u201d Roark said. \u201cTaking control of your appearance is very empowering.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "look, good, feel, better, celebrates, 25, years, helping, women, appearance, related, side", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Makeovers for cancer survivors provide more than just eyeliner and foundation tips, but help patients regain their self-confidence.", "title": "25 Years Of Helping Cancer Patients Look Good And Feel Better", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/look-good-feel-better-celebrates-25-years-helping-women-appearance-related-side-effects-307287", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/16/look-good-feel-better-helps-beautify-cancer-patients.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Makeovers for cancer survivors provide more than just eyeliner and foundation tips, but help patients regain their self-confidence.", "title": "25 Years Of Helping Cancer Patients Look Good And Feel Better", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/look-good-feel-better-celebrates-25-years-helping-women-appearance-related-side-effects-307287", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/16/look-good-feel-better-helps-beautify-cancer-patients.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/16/look-good-feel-better-helps-beautify-cancer-patients.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-16T17:21:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-16T17:21:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Makeovers for cancer survivors provide more than just eyeliner and foundation tips, but help patients regain their self-confidence."}, "article_summary": "Look Good Feel Better Look Good Feel BetterSome side effects of chemotherapy damage bone marrow, hair follicles, cells in the mouth, digestive tract, and productive system.\nLook Good Feel Better Look Good Feel Better\u201cSince we began, we\u2019ve developed a level of sophistication that\u2019s gone beyond what we could have imagined,\u201d Roark said.\nLook Good Feel Better (LGFB) is celebrating its 25-year anniversary providing women with the public service of beauty workshops to improve self-esteem and quality life for women at this difficult time in their life.\nAll of the makeovers are free, and over the last 25 years 1.5 million cancer patients have benefited from the program.\nThey never know exactly what they\u2019re walking into and they come into the workshops quiet and then you see them bloom.\u201dLook Good Feel Better Look Good Feel BetterThe workshop facilitators are trained to redirect conversations that become too medically depressing and remind women of their ailments."}
