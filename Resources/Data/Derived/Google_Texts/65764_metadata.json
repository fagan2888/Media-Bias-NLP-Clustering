His blue-collar work set up several chances for Jarome Iginla and Alex Tanguay.\n\nThat included one shining opportunity early in the game, just minutes after Iginla\u2019s unassisted opener 30 seconds in. O\u2019Reilly won the puck in the Blue Jackets\u2019 zone, then back-handed a pass from the corner to Iginla, whose shot went just wide.\n\nThe Avs\u2019 top line \u2014 with O\u2019Reilly centering two of their oldest players \u2014 produced seven shots in a 4-3 loss to Columbus. And together they have been the Avs\u2019 brightest offensive light lately.\n\nIt is perhaps no coincidence, then, that O\u2019Reilly\u2019s name continues to surface as a potential piece in trade speculation. I asked him about it last week after an off-day practice.\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2026\u201d O\u2019Reilly said, before stopping and sighing and changing course.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t care less. Knowing where we are, and how we\u2019re playing, all that matters is tomorrow\u2019s game and winning that game. And I\u2019m not worried about anything else.\u201d\n\nAs Terry Frei noticed after Sunday\u2019s game, several agents were hanging out in the deep hallways near the Avs and Jax locker rooms. Not that that necessarily means anything. (I don\u2019t know if O\u2019Reilly\u2019s agent, Pat Morris, was among them. But I wasn\u2019t looking.)\n\nO\u2019Reilly stands out as a potential trade piece because of, among other reasons, a sour history of contract negotiations with the Avs. And because he\u2019s a player with enough talent and ability to attract any number of teams\u2019 attention.\n\nAt the last minute before proper arbitration was set to begin in the summer, O\u2019Reilly and the Avs agreed to a two-year, $12-million deal in July. It was more than the $5.525 millioni the Avs initially offered. And the O\u2019Reilly camp likely still wants a $6.75 million-per-year deal when he becomes an unrestricted free agent in 2016.\n\nBut it\u2019s settled for now. Sorta. Avalanche general manager Joe Sakic said in July that O\u2019Reilly\u2019s contract was not part of a sign-and-trade deal.\n\nBut that was then, before the season. And now, the Avs remain in last place in the Central Division with time dwindling away from playoff contention.\n\n\u201cYou never know what they\u2019re planning,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said last week. \u201cFor me personally, I can\u2019t control any of that. It\u2019s just my play.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s play, as a solid and effective top-6 type center, makes him a valuable piece. The Avs, it seems, would want defensive help in any trade this season (every team needs more or better defense).\n\nPotential partners could include teams with expendable pieces looking to separate themselves (Montreal) or teams on the bubble looking for a spark (Toronto, Winnipeg). But all\u2019s quiet in early January.\n\nFor now, O\u2019Reilly said he\u2019s focused on getting the Avs over and through their own bubble.\n\n\u201cI think we can turn this around and get into the playoffs,\u201d he said last week. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m worried about.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Alex Tanguay,arbitration,Blue Jackets,Colorado Avalanche,Edmonton Oilers,Jarome Iginla,Joe Sakic,Ryan O'Reilly,Toronto Maple Leafs,Winnipeg Jets", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Ryan O'Reilly is playing well for the Colorado Avalanche.
