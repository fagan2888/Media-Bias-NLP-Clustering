Quanterus Smith, the backup defensive end to DeMarcus Ware, is finished for the season after he re-injured his left knee.

The Broncos placed Smith on season-ending injured reserve and replaced him on the roster by promoting former Colorado State linebacker Shaquil Barrett from the practice squad.

Smith had 12.5 sacks in his senior season at Western Kentucky when he suffered a torn ACL in his left knee. A fifth-round selection by the Broncos in the 2013 draft, Smith played the preseason but was placed on IR before the season began.

He played in 15 games for the Broncos this season but is still looking for his first career sack.

Barrett, an undrafted rookie, was on the practice squad for 15 of 16 games this season. The one time he was on the 53-man roster, he was not activated for the game against San Francisco.
