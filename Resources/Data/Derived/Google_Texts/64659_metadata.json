Edward Conard, a former partner of Romney's at Bain Capital, put $1 million into W Spann LLC, which then directed the cash into Romney's super-PAC.\n\nCampaign finance law stipulates that donors cannot make political contributions in another person's name. This law has tended to be breached by employers who privately instruct their employees to donate to political campaigns, with the assurance that they will later be reimbursed.\n\nBut in the era following the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which paved the way for corporations and unions to make unlimited political expenditures, the practices of disclosure have become even cloudier, and mysterious LLC groups have proliferated.\n\nThe non-profit advocacy group Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint to the FEC in 2011 about the shell groups funding the Romney super-PAC.\n\nBut it took nearly five years \u2014 until Friday last week \u2014 for the FEC, which is deadlocked between three Democrats and three Republicans, to inform the Campaign Legal Center through a mailed letter that it would not be opening an investigation.\n\nTweeting a picture of the letter on Monday, the Campaign Legal Center's deputy executive director Paul S.
