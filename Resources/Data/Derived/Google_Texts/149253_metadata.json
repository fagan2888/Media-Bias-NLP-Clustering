A Santa Clara Superior Court judge has until the end of the year to decide if paint companies should pay to get rid of lead paint still in thousands of older homes around the state.\n\nWhile California\u2019s lead poisoning cases have declined, especially over the last two decades, children\u2019s advocates say the most vulnerable children are still at risk because they don\u2019t have enough money to reach the finish line.\n\nTwo counties are trying to fix the problem with the resources they have.\n\nAlameda County is one of the ten counties and cities involved in the lawsuit.\n\nTwo years ago Nathaniel Stone was living in an East Oakland apartment with one-year-old Antonio. Stone is Antonio\u2019s legal guardian and is in the process of adopting him. The home they lived in had a lot of peeling paint.\n\nOne day when Stone was cooking in the kitchen from across the room he saw that Antonio seemed to be eating something. Stone checked it out and found Antonio with paint chips in his mouth.\n\nStone had no idea the peeling paint was lead-based \u2014 or that it\u2019s not so surprising that small children like to eat it. Lead paint tastes sweet. Soon, Stone noticed a change in Antonio\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cFrom there he was kind of a little sick and restless, sleeping bad at night and kind of crying and a mood that normally wasn\u2019t him,\u201d Stone says.\n\nSo Stone took Antonio to the doctor and discovered that Antonio had a high level of lead in his blood.\n\n\u201cFrom that he ended up with loss of hearing in his ear,\u201d Stone says.\n\nImmediately Alameda County stepped in to help Stone find a new place to live. Today they live in an apartment that is free of lead paint. But because of that early exposure to lead, Antonio, now three-years-old, has major hearing loss. He goes to a center for children with disabilities.\n\nStone says Antonio has a speech therapist, because his words are \u201cslow and twisted.\u201d\n\nIt takes a variety of county experts to handle a case like Antonio\u2019s. This is easier for Alameda County because as part of its lead poisoning prevention program, the public health, environmental health and housing departments are integrated. The county program also has more resources than most.\n\nProperty owners of houses built before 1978 pay the county a $10 annual fee to respond to lead hazards. It\u2019s one of the only assessments of its kind in California. With stable funding, the County tries to be more proactive.\n\nPeter Belanger is a state certified lead project designer with the Alameda County Healthy Homes Department.\n\nTo get a better understanding of the issues he drove me around West Oakland \u2013 an area with industrial factories, art studios and he says, \u201ca lot of older homes.\u201d\n\nIn Oakland, 90 percent of houses have lead paint. Belanger says it\u2019s not cheap to remove with an average cost of $5,000 per unit.\n\nIf the lead can\u2019t be removed he\u2019ll help move the family out, as happened in Antonio\u2019s case. But whatever the approach, Belanger says the key is getting the children away from the toxic lead.\n\nBut for many families in California that level of support isn\u2019t available.\n\nLos Angeles County is also a plaintiff in the lead paint trial. But unlike in Alameda, in LA County, it can take six months to resolve a case like Antonio\u2019s.\n\nDr. Jonathan Fielding, director of the Los Angeles County Public Health Department, points to three main reasons for this lag.\n\nThe first: the sheer size of the county and the problem.\n\n\u201cWe have roughly one and a half million residences that have lead paint,\u201d he says.\n\nSecond, unlike Alameda County, LA\u2019s Public Health and Housing Departments are not integrated. Fielding says that lack of integration can delay action.\n\nAnd, the third reason: money. LA County doesn\u2019t have a dedicated property tax like Alameda County. It relies mainly on state funding and that amount has varied over the years. In addition, the county took a hit last year when Congress cut almost all of its funding for the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s lead program. That money goes out to county health departments for outreach and education.\n\nFielding says this resulted in LA County\u2019s lead program losing about $600,000 a year.\n\nAt the same time the CDC reported that even lower levels of lead can cause permanent brain damage than had previously been known. Yet Fielding says there\u2019s less and less funding to protect children from lead exposure.\n\n\u201cIt is really catastrophic to see literally tens of thousands of kids having a level of poisoning that\u2019s going to affect their ability to succeed in high school or to succeed in college,\u201d he says.\n\nLearn More:\n\nLead poisoning in California\u2019s kids: Antonio\u2019s story from CAhealthReport on Vimeo.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three year old Antonio suffered hearing loss after eating lead-based paint chips as a toddler.
