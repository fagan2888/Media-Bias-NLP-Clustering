Rick Scott, have touted across the state that their public schools were among the nation\u2019s best. But one set of rankings \u2014 which just two years ago put Florida in the top 10 \u2014 has come out with a revamped formula that saw Florida tumble to the 28th best school system in the nation. Education Week on Thursday released its \u201cQuality Counts\u201d rankings for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The last time the rankings were released Florida was sixth. Since then, Education Week has changed the formula to focus more on \u201coutcomes\u201d instead of policies and procedures. Some of the criteria that aided Florida in the past \u2014 such as its system for grading and evaluating schools \u2014 had helped its overall grade.

According to the annual ATR list and report, issued with little fanfare just before Christmas, the only judicial hellholes ranked worse than the Florida Supreme Court were 1) New York City\u2019s Asbestos Court, 2) California, and 3) the West Virginia Supreme Court.

Attorney John Morgan\u2019s United for Care group has submitted a new constitutional amendment to the Florida Division of Elections that could go to voters as early as the 2016 general election. United for Care\u2019s first proposed medical marijuana system gained 58 percent of the vote last November \u2014 2 points shy of the 60 percent required to amend Florida\u2019s Constitution. That\u2019s close enough to make another effort worthwhile, said campaign director Ben Pollara. \u201cThe voters of Florida clearly want a medical marijuana law and we intend to pass one, whether in the Legislature this session or on the ballot in 2016,\u201d Pollara said.

Their latest effort: a statewide \u201cDay of Action\u201d to close the coverage gap. For the past two years, Florida House Republicans have refused federal dollars to extend publicly funded healthcare coverage to nearly a million residents. But there are signs 2015 may be different. A new plan offering an alternative to expansion as envisioned under the Affordable Care Act has found support in the Capitol. And a federal judge ruled last week that the state\u2019s artificially low Medicaid budget has caused needy children to be deprived access to healthcare.

The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in federal court in Orlando. It requests a jury trial on claims the board had an unreasonable response to her accusations and created a hostile educational environment for her. Also Wednesday, Winston declared his intention to enter the NFL draft. At a student code of conduct hearing last month, Winston was cleared of charges that he violated any or all of four sections of the code of conduct \u2014 two for sexual misconduct and two for endangerment. A criminal investigation concluded last year without charges being filed.
