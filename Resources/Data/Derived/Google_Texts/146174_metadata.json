(I\u2019m still waiting for examples of things I\u2019ve said that are as crazy as Prescott\u2019s insistence that there is no evidence that monetary policy matters.)\n\nBut let\u2019s leave that stuff aside; there\u2019s a point I think needs making about how a Keynesian (or if you like, a Hicksian \u2014 let\u2019s not get into the question of What Keynes Really Meant) thinks he knows.\n\nAs I see it, we have a general proposition \u2014 most recessions are the result of inadequate demand. And we have a pretty good model of aggregate demand, and of how monetary and fiscal policy affect that demand. That model is IS-LM, with endogenous money as appropriate. You can, for some purposes, usefully think of the IS curve as derived from intertemporal optimization, but that\u2019s a metaphor rather than a principle.\n\nWe do not have an equally good model of aggregate supply. What we have, instead, is an observation: prices and wages clearly are sticky in the short run, and maybe for longer than that. There\u2019s overwhelming evidence for that proposition, but in trying to justify it we engage in various kinds of hand-waving about menu costs and bounded rationality.\n\nThe thing is, for many purposes this slightly vague notion of aggregate supply is enough; we can, for example, be fairly sure that expansionary policies in a depressed economy won\u2019t be inflationary, and we can use the pretty good demand side model to tell us that monetary expansion won\u2019t work but fiscal policy will when we\u2019re at the zero lower bound.\n\nStill, we try. New Keynesians do stuff like one-period-ahead price setting or Calvo pricing, in which prices are revised randomly. Practicing Keynesians have tended to rely on \u201caccelerationist\u201d Phillips curves in which unemployment determined the rate of change rather than the level of inflation.\n\nSo what has happened since 2008 is that both of these approaches have been found wanting: inflation has dropped, but stayed positive despite high unemployment. What the data actually look like is an old-fashioned non-expectations Phillips curve. And there are a couple of popular stories about why: downward wage rigidity even in the long run, anchored expectations.\n\nThe point, however, is that the price-setting side of the models has never been an integral part of Keynesian doctrine, and the surprising resilience of inflation hasn\u2019t undermined the core insights.\n\nAnd it remains true that Keynesians have been hugely right on the effects of monetary and fiscal policy, while equilibrium macro types have been wrong about everything.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140714104405, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 14, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Aggregate Demand, Aggregate Supply, and What We Know (Wonkish) ( 20140714 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Implications of missing deflation.", "title": "Aggregate Demand, Aggregate Supply, and What We Know (Wonkish)", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/aggregate-demand-aggregate-supply-and-what-we-know-wonkish/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Implications of missing deflation.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "July 14, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1405349045, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-07-14T14:44:05-04:00"}, "utime": 20140714144405, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140714, "pdate": 20140714, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Implications of missing deflation.", "title": "Aggregate Demand, Aggregate Supply, and What We Know (Wonkish)", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/aggregate-demand-aggregate-supply-and-what-we-know-wonkish/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/aggregate-demand-aggregate-supply-and-what-we-know-wonkish/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Aggregate Demand, Aggregate Supply, and What We Know (Wonkish)", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "And we have a pretty good model of aggregate demand, and of how monetary and fiscal policy affect that demand.\nWe do not have an equally good model of aggregate supply.\n(I\u2019m still waiting for examples of things I\u2019ve said that are as crazy as Prescott\u2019s insistence that there is no evidence that monetary policy matters.)\nAs I see it, we have a general proposition \u2014 most recessions are the result of inadequate demand.\nAnd it remains true that Keynesians have been hugely right on the effects of monetary and fiscal policy, while equilibrium macro types have been wrong about everything."}
