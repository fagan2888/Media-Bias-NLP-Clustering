Recently, Apple has veiled the launching of its newest iPad that is about to come out possibly on Oct 16th. Moreover, the users are not just puffed up about the iPad that is about to be launched but, the tech giant might be planning to launch its latest OS (Operating System) known as OS X Yosemite and perhaps a new iMac computer too. The upheaval comes out weeks after the launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and the first iWatch showing that Apple is hell curved on achieving immense deeds in 2014.

According to the reports revealed, in the first week of launch, Apple sold 10 million iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models. Though, on the other hand, the sale of the present iPad (which was launched back in 2013) starts declining and fanatics wait for the California-based company to endeavor and offset this trend.

The official reports revealed that the latest iPad is coming with the Touch ID fingerprint scanning systems, which is similar that the Apple has been using on its iPhoneâ€™s since they launched their earlier model, the iPhone 5S). Well, this seems to be a brilliant add up, particularly since the Apple has been attempting to get users to espouse the Apple Pay mobile payment platform.

In the meanwhile, tech giant states that, there is no better way of compelling users to the payment platform than by integrating touch ID into as many devices as possible.

Certainly, some people are expecting that, tech giant would not be updating its iPad mini and with the launch of iPad Pro, Apple will succeed in pushing back as of the iPad Air launch.
