But it\u2019s part of a larger pattern at MSNBC, where any and all scandals of Democrats are so frequently marginalized in favor of those daring to probe them.\n\nThis might come as a shock, but MSNBC has concern-trolled plenty of other times when Republicans criticized or investigated Democrats over various malfeasances. On the IRS scandal, the VA scandal, Obamacare\u2019s myriad problems, the Benghazi investigation and President Obama\u2019s executive amnesty, MSNBCers have posed some variance of the question, \u201cAre Republicans in danger of overreaching\u201d or \u201cAre Republicans in danger of overplaying their hand?\u201d\n\nOr in the case of more partisan hosts like Rachel Maddow, Al Sharpton and Melissa Harris-Perry, simply calling it \u201cRepublican overreach.\u201d\n\nThis has been done for the past six years in service of President Obama, but now there\u2019s another presidential campaign brewing and another Democrat to steer into the White House. As the Clinton email saga continues developing, look for more network gasping about the GOP going over the top through dastardly actions like asking questions and filing subpoenas.\n\nIt\u2019s not exactly clever, but it\u2019s an easy way to shift negative stories about Democrats to narratives about Republicans and their darned scandal-mongering. The press often goes for it.\n\nOther favorite MSNBC talking points including claiming Republicans \u201chate\u201d Obama and accusing the GOP of \u201cdelegitimizing this president\u201d and \u201cunprecedented obstruction.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "It didn't take long for MSNBC to unveil one of its favorite talking points in response to Hillary Clinton's email scandal at the State Department.
