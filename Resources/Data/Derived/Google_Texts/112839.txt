Speaking before a few hundred supporters Tuesday afternoon in La Crosse, Hillary Clinton covered a wide range of issues facing voters in Wisconsin ahead of next week's primary elections.

Clinton spoke at Western Technical College's Integrated Technologies Center on topics ranging from education, expanding the Affordable Care Act, women's rights and gun control.

On education, she promoted her debt-free tuition plan which she said would work by increasing taxes on the wealthy to pay for the education for middle and low income students. She said the idea is different than the one her democratic opponent Bernie Sanders proposes. Clinton said that plan would require the support of state governors. "Having followed from afar, the wrecking ball that Scott Walker has used against higher education, I don't think its all that realistic to say, 'Well, you'll get free college if Scott Walker chips in about $300 million dollars.'"

Mentions of the Wisconsin governor or republicans in general brought boos from the audience on several occasions. She also spent time bashing republican candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz saying they aren't for the middle class.

Prior to her speech, she toured some of Western's classrooms looking at their facilities for training students.
