Her father was a dentist, as his father was, and her mother was a homemaker.\n\nShe recalled gluing sugar cubes together, helping her mother prepare a display at the local library that illustrated how much sugar was in common foods, like ketchup. Both parents were community leaders, Mack said, and sometimes acted like parents to other children.\n\n\u201cNot everything that they did had a title; they just did it,\u201d said Mack.\n\nThe practice Mack will oversee was purchased by CapitalCare Medical Group in 2011. She will introduce pre-natal care and obstetrics services at the practice, so a mother won\u2019t have to switch doctors or go off of the Hill, except to deliver at Bellevue Woman\u2019s Center in Schenectady. Without the change, Mack said, a mother might use an obstetrician-gynecologist, which could lead to breaking the continuity of a single family doctor for a family.\n\n\u201cI prefer a whole community approach when it comes to family medicine,\u201d said Mack.\n\nAs a doctor of osteopathy, as opposed to a medical doctor, Mack is trained in relying on her hands for diagnoses and treatments. But D.O.s aren\u2019t limited from using medications or surgery.\n\n\u201cOur training is very similar,\u201d Mack said of M.D.s. \u201cWe really base it on the idea that the body heals itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you come in with a headache,\u201d she explained, \u201cI am going to be relieving some of that muscle tension while discussing with you what to do in the future.\u201d\n\nAs schools of osteopathic medicine proliferate, more doctors graduate and they are welcomed as a solution to help with a shortage of physicians who can work in underserved areas.\n\nMack studied at Vanderbilt University, where she was led into research science, earning her master\u2019s degree in biology at the University of Cincinnati. The focus on the details of biology led Mack to recognize that she wanted to work in the broader world of helping patients, and she says she has a responsibility to see through the changes happening in health-care, with the Affordable Care Act, and protect her relationships with her patients in the meantime.\n\nAs a student, Mack attended \u201cD.O. Day\u201d on Capitol Hill, when osteopathic medical students lobbied federal lawmakers. She then became the national liaison officer of the student osteopathic medical association.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be in a room with a patient, but I think that\u2019s what keeps me in a room with a patient,\u201d Mack said.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; minimum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc99f8\"", "article_summary": "She then became the national liaison officer of the student osteopathic medical association.\nDr. Kristin Mack will this week begin a year of training under Dr. Gary Kolanchik before he retires and she becomes the next primary-care physician in Berne.\nAs a student, Mack attended \u201cD.O.\nKristin Mack grew up in Spring Hill, West Virginia.\nDay\u201d on Capitol Hill, when osteopathic medical students lobbied federal lawmakers."}
