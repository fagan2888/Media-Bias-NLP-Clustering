(TRUNEWS) – Continuing the current administration’s plans for ever-expanding government dependence and citizen surveillance, President Barack Hussein Obama today announced the launch of a new internet delivery plan, ConnectAll, or as some are calling it, ObamaNet.

Despite President Obama’s seven years in office, there have been unprecedented gains in wiring the nation for the future, including a tripling of the average home Internet speed, covering 98 percent of Americans with fast 4G/LTE mobile broadband, and doubling the number of schools connected to high-speed Internet. As a result, the US has seen a technology sector that spans coast to coast, the creation of millions of high-paying jobs, and a revolution in the way students learn in the classroom.

So, in the current administration’s spirit of “If it ain’t broke, then break it”, the proposal to further expand internet connectivity with the help of government, the plan is to connect 20 million more Americans to the internet by the year 2020.

In statement released by the White House on March 9th:

Even with the significant progress we’ve made, more work remains to help all Americans access the economic benefits of broadband, especially low-income households. Families earning under $25,000 a year are about half as likely to have the Internet at home as families that are the most well-off. A new Issue Brief released today by the Council of Economic Advisers outlines how being offline is more than inconvenient; it creates specific economic costs, especially for job-seekers unable to access online job search tools. Today, because of a digital divide, low-income Americans have a harder time accessing these tools, and unemployed workers without home Internet access take a longer time to find employment. Given these costs, we cannot be satisfied if broadband is out of reach for anyone in America, and today, President Obama is acting to make that a part of the past. So today, the President is launching ConnectALL (ObamaNet) to ensure more Americans have the broadband they need to get a job, engage their community, and deliver opportunity to their children by:
