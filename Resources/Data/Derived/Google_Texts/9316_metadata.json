DHHS over breastfeeding denial\n\nFormer child support officer was behind failed \u2018Devon\u2019s Law\u2019 in last legislative session\n\nBy Bob Sanders\n\nThe New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services \u2013 which on its website advocates that employers accommodate women who breastfeed their babies \u2013 has been sued by a former employee who claims the agency would not let her leave the premises or even use a lactation room to do just that.\n\nKatherine \u201cKate\u201d Frederick, a former child support officer in the department\u2019s Conway office, filed suit Sunday night in a U.S. District Court in Concord, claiming DHHS fired her in September 2012 in retaliation for requesting a reasonable accommodation to directly breastfeed her then 2 1/2-month-old son Devon, because he could not yet take a bottle.\n\n\u201cThe state effectively forced her to choose between her baby and her job,\u201d said Benjamin T. King, an attorney with the office of Douglas, Leonard and Garvey in Concord. \u201cWhen Kate chose her baby, the state fired her.\u201d\n\nDHHS referred the suit to the state Attorney General\u2019s office, which declined comment, saying that it didn\u2019t have time to review it.\n\nBut in an email included with the lawsuit as an exhibit, an official stated the department\u2019s position at the time.\n\n\u201cFederal law and Department policy permit reasonable times and facilities for the expressing of breast milk, as have been explained and offered to you. You are also permitted to breast feed your child on breaks in any public area on the grounds, which has also been explained and offered to you. You are not permitted to leave the premises during your paid breaks, which seems to be the only option that you find acceptable.\u201d\n\nWhile Frederick declined an interview through her attorney, she did testify in February about her battle with the department while testifying at a New Hampshire House hearing on House Bill 1571, known as Devon\u2019s Law, named after her son.\n\nThe law would have required that all employers provide a safe space for their workers to either express milk or breastfeed their child or face a $100-a-day penalty. Opposed by Business and Industry Association of New Hampshire, the House passed a watered-down version, and the Senate eventually tabled that bill.\n\nFrederick first asked for the accommodation in March 2012 while still on pregnancy leave, providing notes from her medical providers suggesting a modified work schedule because she was suffering from anemia during her pregnancy, but her supervisor allegedly pressured her to work \u201charder and faster.\"\n\nDevon was born in May 2012 and refused to take nutrition from the bottle, says the suit.\n\n\u201cBreastfeeding was the only means through which to feed Devon,\u201d says the complaint.\n\nIn July 2012, Frederick\u2019s medical provider released her to work up to four hours a day, but with an extra half-hour break so she could directly breastfeed her child.\n\nFrederick proposed that she simply go to the daycare center three-tenths of a mile away, arguing that other workers leave the premises during breaks, but her supervisor refused, saying she could express her milk instead, according to the complaint.\n\nFrederick countered that Devon could be brought to her so she could directly breastfeed him in the lactation room. This too was denied.\n\n\u201cThe rigid conditions that the state was setting \u2026 were utterly insensitive to the particularly needs of Ms. Frederick\u2019s baby,\u201d says the complaint.\n\nAfter Frederick didn\u2019t return to work by Aug. 17, 2012, when her family leave expired, the department granted her a disciplinary hearing a week later. When she again asked to breastfeed in the lactation room, her supervisor allegedly said, \u201cNope, not gonna happen. It\u2019s just for pumping.\u201d\n\nThe state maintained that bringing babies to the workplace would be \u201ctoo disruptive,\u201d the complaint says.\n\nDHHS strongly encourages breastfeeding on its website, saying it is \u201ccrucially important to the health of mothers and children. It notes that the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) rewards breastfeeding recipients with an extra allocation of fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe website also points out that the federal Affordable Care Act says that employers \u201care required to provide reasonable break time for an employee to express breast milk for her nursing child for 1 year after the child\u2019s birth each time such employee has need to express milk. Employers are also required to provide a place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the public, which may be used by an employee to express breast milk.\u201d\n\nThe site also recommends that \u201cmanagement can encourage supervisors to work with breastfeeding employees in making reasonable accommodations to help them reach their breastfeeding goals and encourage other employees to exhibit a positive and accepting attitude.\u201d\n\nAnd the state DHHS site links to the federal DHHS\u2019 \u201cBusiness Case for Breastfeeding\u201d website, \u201cwhich provides a toolkit for employers and employees to create a breastfeeding friendly worksite, is available for download online or can be ordered free of charge.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 357619467597909}, "description": "Ex-employee sues N.H.
