It could take eight months to see a neurologist, more than three to see a cardiologist.\n\nTo speed things up, doctors at county and community clinics urged their patients to go straight to the emergency room, the unofficial back door for specialist appointments. That way, patients could bypass the long waits and get the recommended colonoscopy or CT scan. But that route was expensive and burdensome to ERs.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem across the nation: Specialists are hard to find for many patients, and even harder to afford. Sick people may grow sicker as they wait for appointments, causing them unnecessary discomfort and making treatment more costly in the long run. Diabetics may suffer with untreated foot ulcers, raising the risk of amputation; patients with abnormal chest X-rays may turn out to have cancer.\n\nWith a million patients a year depending on Los Angeles County for health care, local officials decided they had to act. Hiring scores of costly specialists wasn\u2019t an option. So in 2012 they created a program called eConsult, modeled after a system at San Francisco General Hospital, to streamline the referral process.\n\nThe L.A. County program allows for a Web-based conversation between primary care doctors and specialists that can include the exchange of medical records and photographs. The specialist typically responds to inquiries within three days and a decision on a referral soon follows.\n\nMuch as a triage nurse clears the way for accident victims in a crowded ER, clinics would use guidelines for each specialty \u2014 created by specialists and primary care doctors working together \u2014 to determine who needs an appointment and how quickly. The primary care physicians can continue to care for the remaining patients, consulting with specialists electronically.\n\nThree years later, it\u2019s clear the program hasn\u2019t been a panacea. Most patients in Los Angeles County still need face-to-face appointments with specialists, and there still aren\u2019t enough of them to go around. But both primary care doctors and specialists say things have gotten better.\n\nThe county quickly realized its hypothesis was right \u2014 about 30 percent of patients referred by providers at county and community clinics didn\u2019t actually need to see a specialist in person. Primary care doctors said they now have a clear way to communicate with specialists about their patients. And when patients do get to the specialist\u2019s office, more have the necessary lab work or tests so the appointments are more efficient.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall, doctors agree that the electronic referral system has improved both communication and collaboration among doctors on both sides. And primary care doctors say the new system is far better than the old days, when they would have to \u201cbeg, borrow and plead\u201d to get appointments for their patients.\n\nWait times for specialists in general also have dropped, although a small number of patients with nonurgent health issues still may have to wait up to six months for appointments, according to the county\u2019s specialty care director, Dr. Paul Giboney.\n\nCosts could go up\n\nIn L.A. County, about 10,000 eConsult requests come in each month across more than 40 specialties. The program has the potential to become a national model: Giboney said health leaders in Illinois, Alaska, Connecticut and elsewhere have contacted him to ask about how the county\u2019s program works.\n\nBut some primary care doctors have argued that they don\u2019t have the skills, time or resources to manage patients who need more advanced care. In addition, the system isn\u2019t set up to pay community physicians for the added work, tests or procedures that specialists request before seeing patients.\n\n\u201cWithout any extra reimbursement, those costs are hitting the primary care providers,\u201d said Dr. Richard Seidman, chief medical officer at Northeast Valley Health Corp., which runs several community clinics.\n\nEConsult works better for some specialties than others. For example, an endocrinologist may be able to advise a doctor on how to manage the complications of diabetes or a cardiologist can suggest ways to manage a heart murmur but an ophthalmologist can\u2019t treat cataracts through an electronic conversation. Nearly 90 percent of patients referred to ophthalmology end up with an in-person appointment.\n\nNevertheless, Dr. Lauren Daskivich, an ophthalmologist with L.A. County, said she no longer has to try to interpret one-line referrals and can more easily figure out what type of eye doctor a patient needs to see and how soon. \u201cFor the first time, we have actually been able to triage how urgently they need to get in,\u201d she said.\n\nNationwide, the problem of access to specialists has eased somewhat due to the Affordable Care Act, which enabled more than 16 million people to get insurance. But the health law didn\u2019t cover everyone, most notably people living here illegally, and specialists may not take the insurance that patients have.\n\nElectronic consultation by itself can\u2019t resolve the access problem for poor patients, said Dr. Nwando Olayiwola, associate director of UC San Francisco\u2019s Center for Excellence in Primary Care, who studies these efforts nationally. \u201cIt solves a huge part of the problem but it doesn\u2019t solve all of it,\u201d she said.\n\nFor now, the Los Angeles County health care system is still overburdened. One doctor put it simply: Technology doesn\u2019t solve the problems that were there before technology.\n\nAt the UMMA Community Clinic in South Los Angeles, more than 40 percent of patients remain uninsured and some have been in the queue for a specialist appointment for months. The clinic\u2019s Dr. Cesar Barba says he\u2019s grateful there is a way to talk to specialists and identify those who need to be seen more quickly.\n\nThe eConsult system helps, but it \u201cis not the ideal,\u201d Barba said. \u201cThe best solution is if we had more specialists. That would be ideal.\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Doctors called it the black hole.
