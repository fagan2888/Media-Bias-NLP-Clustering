She also said that questions about same-sex relationships from LGBT students were immediately shut down.\n\nEmily\u2019s mother, Kathy Dawson, tried to pull her out of the course so she wouldn\u2019t have to attend the second day. But school officials told her that attendance was mandatory in order for Emily to pass her Career and Life Management class. High school students in Alberta can\u2019t graduate without passing that class.\n\nSo Dawson decided to sit in on the abstinence lecture to experience it for herself \u2014 and, as a single mother, she was personally offended by the messages about families like hers. Dawson told CBC News that the speakers were essentially \u201cbashing\u201d single parents, saying that their kids are \u201cprone to depression, suicide, juvenile delinquency.\u201d\n\nThe two-day course was provided by the Pregnancy Care Centre, an anti-abortion group that\u2019s affiliated with a network of right-wing \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u201d in the United States called Care-Net. Both groups advocate against sex before marriage and consider themselves to be part of the pro-life movement. Dawson, who identifies as an agnostic, signed a permission slip for her daughter to receive sex ed \u2014 but she had no idea that these groups were going to be providing it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s values-based sex ed and all the values are evangelical values,\u201d Dawson told the Edmonton Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s not even mainstream Christianity. I\u2019m not against abstinence. But I think the message is diminished when it\u2019s surrounded by misinformation and fear.\u201d She alleges that Emily\u2019s abstinence-only course told kids that most boys have HPV under their fingernails, gonorrhea can kill you in just three days, and girls need to dress modestly to avoid tempting boys.\n\nEmily\u2019s public school district maintains that the abstinence assembly meets school guidelines. So the mother and daughter brought their complaint to the human rights commission, citing a section of Alberta\u2019s Human Right Act \u2014 legislation that was enacted in their province in 2009 \u2014 that gives parents the right to exempt their children from courses that cover sex, sexual orientation, or religion. This week, the commission agreed to review that complaint.\n\nHere in the United States, similar faith-based groups are involved in developing abstinence education curricula implemented in school districts across the country. These courses typically tell students that sex will make them dirty, and drive that point home with exercises that compare sexually active individuals with chewed up gum, dirty chocolate, and spit. It\u2019s not uncommon for public schools to host mandatory assemblies focusing on these topics. Last year, a West Virginia high schooler made national headlines after she protested being forced to attend a similar \u201cslut-shaming\u201d course.\n\nProponents of abstinence-only programs typically claim that teaching kids medically accurate information about their bodies will convince them to start having more sex. But there\u2019s actually a large body of research that\u2019s confirmed the kids who receive accurate information about sexuality, contraception, and STDs are more likely to delay having sex until they\u2019re older. Nonetheless, there aren\u2019t currently any national standards for implementing comprehensive sex education classes in public schools.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "She and her mother say being forced to attend a mandatory abstinence assembly run by a faith-based organization violated their agnostic beliefs.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "She and her mother say being forced to attend a mandatory abstinence assembly run by a faith-based organization violated their agnostic beliefs.", "title": "High Schooler Files Human Rights Complaint Over \u2018Slut-Shaming\u2019 Abstinence Education Class", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/07/11/3459088/high-schooler-canada-abstinence-education/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/shutterstock_60437059.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "She and her mother say being forced to attend a mandatory abstinence assembly run by a faith-based organization violated their agnostic beliefs.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/shutterstock_60437059-321x214.jpg", "title": "High Schooler Files Human Rights Complaint Over \u2018Slut-Shaming\u2019 Abstinence Education Class", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/shutterstock_60437059.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/shutterstock_60437059.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-11T09:12:39+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdadcf\"", "article_summary": "Health High Schooler Files Human Rights Complaint Over \u2018Slut-Shaming\u2019 Abstinence Education Class CREDIT: ShutterstockA Canadian high school student and her mother are taking their objections to abstinence-only education all the way to the Alberta Human Rights Commission, saying that making the teen sit through a Christian-based course about sexual purity violated her rights as a nonbeliever.\nHere in the United States, similar faith-based groups are involved in developing abstinence education curricula implemented in school districts across the country.\nNonetheless, there aren\u2019t currently any national standards for implementing comprehensive sex education classes in public schools.\nLast year, when Emily Dawson\u2019s public school required her to attend a two-day abstinence education class delivered by a conservative religious group, she was shocked by what she heard from the speaker.\nEmily\u2019s public school district maintains that the abstinence assembly meets school guidelines."}
