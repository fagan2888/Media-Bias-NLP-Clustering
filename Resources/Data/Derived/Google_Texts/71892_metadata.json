But no one mistook it for foreshadowing. Criticism came at them like a rushing linebacker, despite a perfect mark going into a bye week.\n\nIt came less than a year after a shocking playoff loss in Denver? Oy. Only two victories over teams with winning records? Pshaw.\n\nSound familiar?\n\nThe \u201997 Broncos were an imperfect bunch. But they scrapped their way to an upset Super Bowl victory over the Green Bay Packers \u2014 their first as a franchise \u2014 by overcoming deficiencies.\n\nA gaggle of Broncos from the \u201997 championship team reunited in the south end zone Sunday at Sports Authority Field to help celebrate owner Pat Bowlen\u2019s induction into the team\u2019s Ring of Fame \u2014 and to, perhaps, troll the Packers 18 years after their title-game loss.\n\n\u201cEach game we went into, we felt like we\u2019d win,\u201d said Steve Atwater, the Broncos\u2019 starting free safety in \u201997 who wore his blue No. 27 jersey Sunday.\n\n\u201cBut after each loss, we had to go back and say, \u2018Man, what did we do wrong? What did we mess up?\u2019 Each guy had to look at themselves and point the finger at themselves and say, \u2018What can I do better?'\u201d\n\nThis 2015 Broncos team has issues, sure. Peyton Manning leads the NFL in interceptions. And their 102 points scored entering Sunday night were the fewest by a division-leader.\n\nBut the \u201997 team faced its share of problems too. It finished 12-4, with each of its losses on the road. And it couldn\u2019t keep pace with AFC West rival Kansas City, which won the division.\n\nThat forced the Broncos into a wild card playoff spot \u2014 and two of three playoff games on the road.\n\n\u201cWe went back to the drawing board to do it,\u201d Atwater said. \u201cWe definitely felt like we had the talent to beat anyone. But unless you put it together on the field, it really means nothing.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos in \u201997 led the league across the board in offense \u2014 first in points scored (29.5 per game) and yards gained (367).\n\nBut their defense led them through the playoffs.\n\nAfter splitting with the Chiefs during the regular season, including a two-point loss at Kansas City in mid-November, the Broncos ground out a defense-dominant 14-10 victory in the divisional round. In the AFC championship game at Pittsburgh, Denver\u2019s defense held the Steelers to seven points in the second half to win, 24-21.\n\nThis year\u2019s Broncos defense, though, has Atwater\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re extremely explosive up front,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d put the two corners against anybody in the league. All around, they have the No. 1 defense \u2014 the best I\u2019ve seen in awhile.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: @nickgroke or ngroke@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "1997 Broncos had issues too, Steve Atwater says, but figured it out", "title": "1997 Broncos had issues too, Steve Atwater says, but figured it out", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/01/1997-broncos-had-issues-too-steve-atwater-says-but-figured-it-out/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101_080214_steve-atwater.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151101_080214_steve-atwater.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-01T19:58:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:16:12+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It came less than a year after a shocking playoff loss in Denver?\n'\u201dThis 2015 Broncos team has issues, sure.\nThe \u201997 Broncos were an imperfect bunch.\nThis year\u2019s Broncos defense, though, has Atwater\u2019s attention.\n\u201cEach game we went into, we felt like we\u2019d win,\u201d said Steve Atwater, the Broncos\u2019 starting free safety in \u201997 who wore his blue No."}
