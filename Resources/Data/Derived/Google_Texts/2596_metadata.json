The 6.6 percent increase still leaves funding below where it was in adjusted dollars 12 years ago, after the last big dollar surge, but it's an undeniable victory for research. Not to be left out is FDA, which got a 5 percent increase, the bulk of which is earmarked for neglected food safety programs. The drug, device and biologics centers saw modest gains as well.\n\nDEVICE TAX SUSPENSION BRINGS LOBBYING TO FRUITION \u2014 The two-year suspension of Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax is partial fulfillment of a years-long industry lobbying campaign for full repeal. Many believe it will be scrapped permanently because of the political difficulty of reinstating a tax that\u2019s been temporarily blocked. At a minimum, it means $3.9 billion to the industry over the next two years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation\u2019s estimate of the package.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAND THE R&D TAX BREAK IS PERMANENT \u2014 Another big win for pharma and medical device makers: the research and development tax credit, included in the $680 billion package of tax extenders, is here to stay. That year-end deal was in large part a bonanza for health care interests.\n\nHappy Monday and welcome back to Prescription PULSE, holiday recess edition. Programming note: your favorite pharma newsletter will take a break next week and return on Tuesday, Jan. 5. Now our nugget from medical history: This week in 1898, Pierre and Marie Curie isolated radium (element 88 on your periodic table). It was one of a number of discoveries that led to Marie Curie becoming the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in 1903. More from Wired: http://bit.ly/1NXr4tu\n\nOMNIBUS MANDATES REPORT ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG SPENDING \u2014 The budget deal includes a directive to HHS to undertake a major report detailing spending on prescription drug prices (after rebates) for the top 10 most frequently used and the top 10 highest cost medicines under Medicare Part B and Part D, Medicaid and the Department of Veterans Affairs. An important limitation on the instruction: HHS can only use data that's available under current law and not proprietary. The report due in six months must also include an account of what HHS has done to lower drugs costs since 2001. It\u2019s included in the Labor-HHS section of the conference report (pages 55-57): http://1.usa.gov/1I93mds\n\nRIDERS-ROUNDUP: OTHER KEY PHARMA PROVISIONS \u2014 The massive $1.1 trillion spending bill contains some other important wins and losses for the drug industry. Here are some key ones:\n\n\u2014 The popular FDA pediatric disease priority review voucher program was extended until Sept. 30, just as the incentive for companies to develop drugs for rare diseases in children was about to sunset. When FDA does approve one of these pediatric drugs, the program rewards the company with a voucher for an expedited review of another drug. Companies have been able to sell these vouchers for hundreds of millions of dollars. Some public health advocates worry the program hasn\u2019t incentivized truly new innovation.\n\n\u2014 Gene editing block \u2014 FDA won\u2019t be able to use any funds to review or approve clinical research that modifies a human embryo to change a heritable genetic trait, known as germline gene editing.\n\n\u2014 The bill directs the Veterans Administration to adopt opioid prescribing guidelines CDC is in the process of finalizing. Public health groups are probably cheering that, but opioid makers likely are not.\n\n\u2014The bill restricts FDA from developing a rule that would require pharmaceutical prescribing information to be distributed to health care professionals electronically instead of on paper.\n\n\u2014 Another provision that says U.S. Customs and Border Protection can\u2019t block an individual from importing a 90-day supply of a prescription drug for personal use from Canada. However, the provision says the drug must comply with the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, so some legal experts believe this could make the law meaningless as drugs sold in other countries aren\u2019t likely to meet FDA Act standards.\n\nONE HOLD LIFTED ON CALIFF, ONE REMAINS \u2014 Nebraska freshman Sen. Ben Sasse released his hold on the nomination of Robert Califf for FDA Commissioner, saying that HHS had produced the documents he wanted about the failure of Obamacare co-ops. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski still has a hold over concerns about FDA\u2019s approval of genetically modified salmon, but a GOP HELP aide said that the committee plans a vote to advance Califf\u2019s nomination in early January. He appears to have support in the full chamber as well.\n\nSENATE \u2018CURES\u2019 LIMPS INTO 2016, BUT HOPE LINGERS \u2014 The big boost for NIH complicates any attempt for additional, mandatory funding for the agency, which was the carrot that got Democrats behind the big bipartisan push in the House. As expected, 2015 slips into the history books without a HELP Committee draft of its companion Innovations for Healthier Americans initiative, much less a marked up bill, which was the goal Chairman Lamar Alexander had set. But sources tell Prescription PULSE that Alexander and ranking member Patty Murray still want to put out a draft in January. Of course, they\u2019ve wanted to do that for several months now, and some of the key outstanding issues that have kept that from happening before remain \u2014NIH funding and Democratic pressure for action on prescription drug pricing, among other things. We\u2019ll see.\n\n\u2026 House Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton praised the NIH funding in the year-end deal, noting that it was close to the level included in the House-passed Cures. \u201c[B]ut more work remains as we seek to build upon this momentum to deliver cures now,\u201d his statement said. \u201cAs the Senate continues to do its work, we will continue to seek out every legislative opportunity to improve the future for patients and cures.\u201d\n\nSHKRELI OUT, TILLES IN AT TURING \u2014Martin Shkreli resigned as CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals Friday afternoon after being charged with fraud and Ron Tilles was named interim CEO. The case against Shkreli is unrelated to pharmaceutical pricing but Turing still has the notoriety Shkreli brought it by hiking the price of a drug often used to treat HIV patients by 5,000 percent earlier this year. The company didn't indicate whether the new leadership planned to reduce the price of Daraprim. Tilles has been chairman of Turing's board of directors since the company launched last year. Shkreli says he\u2019s confident he will be cleared of all charges. Read the POLITICO NY story on the indictment: http://politi.co/1RroRZR\n\n... Shkreli's downfall doesn't mean Congress is stopping its investigation into drug price hike rises. Sens. Susan Collins and Claire McCaskill said they'll continue their work, adding the practice wasn't limited to one company: http://1.usa.gov/1OBjtgG.\n\nDEMOCRATS WANT CMS DRUG COST PLANS \u2014 Five Democratic senators led by Mark Warner want to know how acting CMS Administrator Andy Slavitt is maximizing CMS\u2019s authorities to improve transparency on drug pricing and bring prices down. Specifically they ask how CMS might use CMMI to examine new payment mechanisms \u2014 like an alternative to Part B payments to doctors based on a drug\u2019s average sales price plus 6 percent (which many say incentivizes prescribing high cost drugs). They also want to know how CMS can use comparative effectiveness analyses from groups like PCORI and ICER to improve patient outcomes and lower program spending. And in the private insurance market, where many consumers have high-deductible plans, they want to know how CMS plans to use its authority to ensure people can access drugs. The letter: http://1.usa.gov/1NBVHBn\n\nFDA\u2019S 2016 PHARMA PRIORITIES \u2014 Reevaluating FDA regulation of drug advertising and promotion in light of recent pharmaceutical court cases surrounding the First Amendment is a front burner item for the agency\u2019s drug center, Janet Woodcock said last week. Other key priorities include continuing to implement the 2013 compounding law and the track and trace legislation, which aims to improve the safety of the drug supply chain. FDA will also be focusing on reaching new user fee agreements for brand, generic and biosimilar drugs. And it will continue to address the opioid epidemic through guidance on how companies can get generic versions of abuse-deterrent opioids approved. It also plans to reevaluate opioid labels as well as the safety systems known as risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS).\n\n\u2026 Ramping up the drug center\u2019s staffing is key. CDER currently has 600 vacancies, Woodcock said. FDA\u2019s also working on a strategic plan for drug imports and updating personalized medicine policies. FDA commissioner nominee Robert Califf aims to modernize clinical evidence development by using electronic health data, she added.

Amarin and FDA asked for another extension to work out a settlement in their free speech case related to off-label marketing. They have until Feb. 17, 2016 to update the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\n\u2026 ICYMI: FDA and Pacira Pharmaceuticals were able to wrap up their free speech dispute last week. Pacira called the settlement a \u201cfavorable resolution\u201d and legal experts say it is likely a win for drug companies that seek to promote truthful off-label information about their products. The settlement confirmed Pacira\u2019s understanding of the drug\u2019s approved indication, and resulted in FDA updating the drug\u2019s labeling and pulling a warning letter regarding advertising. The settlement: http://bit.ly/1J9zSqP. FDA\u2019s letter rescinding the warning letter: http://1.usa.gov/1m4lFGd\n\nBIOSIMILAR USER FEE REATHORIZATION KICKS OFF \u2014 FDA commenced work on reauthorizing the biosimilar use fee program Friday with a public meeting. While there\u2019s only been one biosimilar approved in the U.S., the agency said that as of November, 59 were in its development program. That\u2019s pretty significant since when the use fee program was first put in place the agency was only expecting 11 products in the program at any one time. However, GPhA VP David Gaugh noted at the meeting that fewer biosimilars have been approved by FDA than the agency anticipated by this point. Gaugh also said that most of FDA\u2019s time and resources has been spent on developing broader biosimilars policies not on reviewing drugs (only 7 percent of agency BSUFA resources went to application reviews). He also asked that FDA, industry and payers to collaborate on biosimilar education.\n\n... FDA\u2019s taking steps to make sure biosimilar uptake is successful in the U.S., Woodcock said. It\u2019s working to educate doctors in hope of avoiding the pushback that came with the introduction of generic medicines. A hurdle for the agency on biosimilars is recruiting and retaining staff that can review biosimilars. \u201cThis is very complicated science. I think it's very fun but the people who have to do it every day are highly sought after outside,\u201d and offered much higher salaries than the government can pay, Woodcock said.\n\nDRUG OVERDOSES CONTINUE TO CLIMB \u2014 The CDC reported that 47,055 people died of drug overdoses in 2014 \u2014 a 6.5 percent increase from the year before and a startling 137 percent jump since 2000. Overdoses on prescription opioids in particular climbed by 9 percent, while overdoses involving heroin and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl grew by even more \u2014 26 percent and 80 percent, respectively \u2014 according to the data published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Overdose deaths were highest in five states: West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire, Kentucky and Ohio. The report drew calls for Medicare reforms. \u201cUnless Congress lets Medicare use drug management tools like patient review and restriction programs to curb abuse, overdose deaths will continue to rise,\u201d said Cynthia Reilly, director of the Prescription Drug Abuse Project at The Pew Charitable Trusts. More from Brett here.\n\nVERMONT PUTS MANDATORY OPIOID GUIDELINES, PDMP CHECKS IN PLACE \u2014 Gov. Peter Shumlin announced last week that rules were in force to require prescribers of controlled substances to check the state\u2019s prescription drug monitoring database. It also puts in place requirements for prescribing opioids, including a risk assessment and consideration of alternative treatments, as well as follow-up evaluations. The prescribing rule: http://1.usa.gov/1NC1g2y\n\n\u2026 Meanwhile, CDC\u2019s draft opioid prescribing guidelines remain open for public comment through mid-January. The agency noted in its release of the overdose numbers that the greatest risk factor for heroin use was the misuse of prescription opioids. ICYMI, Brett\u2019s story on the guidelines CDC released last week.\n\nICER RELEASES NEW REPORTS ON DIABETES, ASTHMA MEDS \u2013 The Institute for Clinical and Economic review put out two new analyses of the cost-effectiveness and value of new medicines this morning. GSK\u2019s asthma biologic Nucala (mepolizumab) didn\u2019t fare so well. While the drug appears to offer additional benefits and improved quality of life, to achieve a cost-effectiveness ratio of $150,000 per each quality of life year gained by the drug, the price per vial would need to drop 63 percent from the $2,500 wholesale acquisition cost, the report concludes. If the drug was priced in the range of $7,787 to $12,116 per year it would not exceed 5-year potential budget impact thresholds, the report adds.\n\n\u2026 Novo Nordisk\u2019s Tresiba (insulin degludec) does OK by ICER\u2019s standards. The drug would need to be discounted by less than 10 percent to be better aligned with its value to patients and the health system, ICER said. This is well within the range of most negotiated discounts, the report notes. Based on the list price, the cost of the insulin is approximately $7,800 per year.\n\nK STREET NEWS: WEINSTEIN JOINS PODESTA GROUP, NEW 340B WEBSITE LAUNCHES \u2014 Anna Weinstein, a former Senate Democratic adviser and strategist at BIO, is joining the Podesta Group\u2019s health care practice. She\u2019ll focus on Medicare policy, clinical trials, and drug discovery and development.\n\n\u2026 In other staffing moves, Express Scripts hired Chris Davis from GPhA and Emily Katz, who was health policy director to Sen. Barbara Boxer, as directors of government affairs.\n\n\u2026 340B Health, a group of safety net providers who support the drug discount program, launched a new website, www.340BCoalition.org.\n\nNEW RARE DISEASE CAUCUS ON THE SCENE \u2014 The first bicameral rare disease congressional caucus was announced last week, led by Sens. Orrin Hatch and Amy Klobuchar, and Reps. Leonard Lance and Joseph Crowley. The announcement from the Rare Disease Legislative Advocates: http://bit.ly/1Pea3MF\n\nCATCHING OUR ATTENTION: IS PHARMA INFLUENCING ACADEMIC TRIAL REPORTING \u2014 Academic scientists who ignore legal requirements to publicly report clinical trials results have often received large payments from drug companies involved in those studies, STAT reports. STAT reviewed federal data, which reveals it\u2019s pretty common for both drug companies and academics to fail to report clinical trials results within legally mandated timelines, or at all. And it\u2019s hard to draw firm conclusions about whether the drug industry influence is a large factor in the widespread failure of trial reporting, the article adds. For more on the missing clinical trial data go to: http://bit.ly/1Id8dKE.\n\n** A message from The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association: PBMs are projected to save employers, unions, government programs, and consumers $654 billion - up to 30 percent - on drug benefit costs over the next decade. PBMs reduce drug costs by: \u00b7 Offering Amazon-style home delivery of medications and creating select networks of more affordable pharmacies; \u00b7 Encouraging the use of generics and more affordable brand medications; \u00b7 Negotiating rebates from drug manufacturers and discounts from drugstores; \u00b7 Managing high-cost specialty medications; and \u00b7 Reducing waste and improving adherence.
