You want to say something about it, let\u2019s see you do this.' \u201d\n\nThen they\u2019ll whip off a Brass Monkey, a Dragon Tail, a Yogini or a Rainbow Marchenko \u2014 tricks requiring strength, flexibility and technique while hanging off a pole \u2014 and leave him with his mouth hanging open ... for a different reason.\n\nYou can hardly blame the poor guy. Mention \u201cpole dancing\u201d to almost anyone and what comes to mind is not a fitness studio with eight students of all shapes and sizes doing upper body crunches while holding their bodies off the ground horizontally with the power of their inner thighs.\n\nBut that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see during \u201cPole Boot-y Camp,\u201d a once-a-month 90-minute class at Apple Jelly taught by Gina Duncan who, at 36 and after three kids, has the body of . . . well, of a different type of pole dancer.\n\nMore photos from Apple Jelly Studios' \"Pole Boot-y Camp\"\n\n\u201cThe thing people don\u2019t realize is that pole is not just one thing,\u201d says Bright, 27, who lives in Tampa but bought the business in Sarasota two years ago after falling in love with the sport. \u201cIt\u2019s for fitness or it\u2019s dance-oriented or it\u2019s even for people who want to spice up their life at home. We do embrace the sexy side of it, but that\u2019s not the same as stripping in a club.\u201d\n\nIn fact, there is an entire industry built around the \u201cpole sport,\u201d the athletic variant of pole dancing, with international and national organizations, a full calendar of competitions and celebrities as idolized in their own field as ice skaters are in the rink. Pole work is touted as a way to build strength, flexibility and balance and you don\u2019t have to be young, female, an exhibitionist or wearing stilettos to give it a try. (Though 99 percent of Apple Jelly\u2019s clients are women.)\n\nIn fact, at least initially, working on a pole is not only un-sexy, it can be downright ugly.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, it\u2019s not pretty,\u201d says Bright. \u201cYou get lots of bruises and calluses and stinging rashes on your legs. And it\u2019s hard. When I first started three years ago, I couldn\u2019t have climbed to the top of the pole to save my house if it was on fire.\u201d\n\nStill, the biggest hurdle to getting people to walk in the door, Duncan says, is the \u201cstigma.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I tell people I do pole, they immediately start whispering,\u201d she sighs, mimicking a conspiratory stance. \u201d 'You do pole? You mean you\u2019re a stripper?' \u201d\n\n\u201cI am a pole dancer, I\u2019m not a stripper. I don\u2019t take off my clothes. But you have to spell out the difference for them. It\u2019s a completely different thing doing a three-minute song in a club or a 45-minute workout class.\u201d\n\nPotential clients are quickly reassured that no nudity or heels are required. (Though just in case, there are some 7-inch, plexiglass platforms for sale in the studio\u2019s anteroom.) Skimpy workout wear is simply helpful in maintaining non-slip leg contact with the pole, something you find out quickly if you\u2019re wearing baggy sweats. Heels with leather straps can serve the same tractional function.\n\nAnd whether you are 49-year-old Roxy Rusu, a hardbody with \u201cSexy\u201d printed across the derriere of her bikini shorts, or Melissa Prueitt, a 37-year-old in shorts and a T-shirt who visits sporadically when she\u2019s not traveling for work, you are part of what Bright calls her \u201cApple Army,\u201d enfolded into a \u201csisterhood\u201d that is rewarded with endless buoyant encouragement and smoothies and healthy snacks after class.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in for an hour and a half of sheer bliss!\u201d yells Duncan over the rap music (\u201cFat butt, fat butt, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle\") during a recent session, sprinkling her instruction with plenty of \u201cgirlfriends\u201d and \u201cdarlin\u2019s.\u201d \u201cNo a-pole-ogies!\u201d\n\nApple Jelly\u2019s students range in age from 18 (the minimum age allowed) to a grandmother of almost 60 (\u201cWe call her \u201cGlamma,\u201d says Duncan). They come from, as Bright puts it, \u201call walks of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoctors, teachers, moms, accountants,\u201d she says counting off on her fingers.\n\nStrippers?\n\n\u201cIf they are, they don\u2019t tell me,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cBut if they were it would be fine.\u201d\n\nRusu, tall and graceful, is a runner who took up pole a year and a half ago to achieve a full body toning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a better workout, it involves at the same time all the muscles,\u201d says the Romanian native. \u201cAnd I always like to try new things, especially things people are scared about.\u201d\n\nTwenty-year-old Sydney Kling first saw someone pole dance while watching the movie \u201cRock of Ages.\u201d She pulled out her smartphone in the theater, Googled on the spot and signed up for a class the following week.\n\nPrueitt, whose work involves implementing tax software, came to Apple Jelly the first time when a friend rented out the studio for a party that involved Champagne, cookies and an introduction to the pole. She doesn\u2019t talk about her hobby at work, but her boyfriend knows and \u201che thinks it\u2019s funny.\u201d\n\nFor those who move to the advanced levels, there is a Grindhouse class (sexy moves), a Spin class (the pole has a turn setting) and one where you can create a dance routine. Just because you keep your clothes on doesn\u2019t mean pole work can\u2019t be sensual, says Duncan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating a space for women of all ages and sizes to feel strong and confident and not have to answer to anyone about what they\u2019re doing,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019d think that, in 2014, that would be something everyone could applaud.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/07/SPOLE19h_5072253_624031.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ffa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTo us, we immediately see the pole and we\u2019re off,\u201d says Bright, owner of Apple Jelly Studios, a Sarasota business offering classes in pole dancing and fitness.\nJust because you keep your clothes on doesn\u2019t mean pole work can\u2019t be sensual, says Duncan.\nBut that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see during \u201cPole Boot-y Camp,\u201d a once-a-month 90-minute class at Apple Jelly taught by Gina Duncan who, at 36 and after three kids, has the body of .\nPole work is touted as a way to build strength, flexibility and balance and you don\u2019t have to be young, female, an exhibitionist or wearing stilettos to give it a try.\nIn fact, at least initially, working on a pole is not only un-sexy, it can be downright ugly."}
