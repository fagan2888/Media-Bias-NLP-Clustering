It was one of three risk-sharing initiatives that help companies adjust to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nYet companies mostly did poorly in state marketplaces, leaving the amount insurers expect to pay into the program at less than 10 percent of what others expect to get out, S&P found. And a bill passed last year doesn\u2019t let the government use its own funds to make up the difference.\n\n\u201cThe only money they can use to pay the insurers who are on the downside is money coming in from insurers who are profitable,\u201d S&P analyst Deep Banerjee said. Most insurers \u201cended up being on the loss side of the corridor. That\u2019s why we are here.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services hasn\u2019t yet put out final figures on the risk corridor program, S&P said.\n\nThe shortfall could mean higher premiums for customers and may threaten the viability of some smaller insurers, Banerjee said. Kentucky Health Cooperative Inc. and Minnesota\u2019s PreferredOne Insurance Co. are counting on receiving a sum of money that exceeds their total regulatory capital, S&P found. Capital, or the excess of assets over liabilities, is a gauge of financial strength that\u2019s monitored by regulators.\n\nMore Than Half\n\nIn New York, Oscar Insurance Co. and Health Republic Insurance of New York Corp. had risk corridor receivables equal to more than half their capital, as of Dec. 31. Receivables at Moda Health Plan in Oregon and Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative in Wisconsin also topped 50 percent of capital.\n\nCoOportunity Health, an Iowa-based insurance startup formed under Obamacare, already has failed.\n\nSome big insurers also are expecting payments, though the sums are smaller relative to their total size, Banerjee said. Humana Inc. expected to get $110 million under the risk corridor program as of March 31, the company said in a regulatory filing. That\u2019s about 1 percent of the company\u2019s equity, as measured under generally accepted accounting principles. The amount Health Net Inc. was expecting in risk corridor payouts was about 5 percent of its capital as of Dec. 31, S&P said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Zachary Tracer", "description": "There may be just $1 in the piggy bank to cover every $10 in claims at an Obamacare program designed to spread risk among insurers, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said.", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-01/obamacare-risk-fund-may-pay-just-10-of-insurer-claims-s-p-says", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "There may be just $1 in the piggy bank to cover every $10 in claims at an Obamacare program designed to spread risk among insurers, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said.", "title": "Obamacare Risk Fund May Pay Just 10% of Insurer Claims, S&P Says"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-01/obamacare-risk-fund-may-pay-just-10-of-insurer-claims-s-p-says", "title": "Obamacare Risk Fund May Pay Just 10% of Insurer Claims, S&P Says", "description": "There may be just $1 in the piggy bank to cover every $10 in claims at an Obamacare program designed to spread risk among insurers, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "fb": {"status": "There may be just $1 in the piggy bank to cover every $10 in claims at an Obamacare program designed to spread risk among insurers, Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-title": "Obamacare Risk Fund May Pay Just 10% of Insurer Claims, S&P Says", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NNN2SA6K50Y601", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "parsely-author": "Zachary Tracer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "date": "2015-05-01T14:00:00.004Z", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-05-01T14:00:00.004Z", "parsely-tags": "Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-01/obamacare-risk-fund-may-pay-just-10-of-insurer-claims-s-p-says"}, "article_summary": "Humana Inc. expected to get $110 million under the risk corridor program as of March 31, the company said in a regulatory filing.\nThat\u2019s why we are here.\u201dThe U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services hasn\u2019t yet put out final figures on the risk corridor program, S&P said.\nThe \u201crisk corridor\u201d program was designed to bolster plans that suffered losses on health-care insurance exchanges, in part by taking funds from those that turned a profit.\nThe amount Health Net Inc. was expecting in risk corridor payouts was about 5 percent of its capital as of Dec. 31, S&P said.\nThere may be just $1 in the piggy bank to cover every $10 in claims at an Obamacare program designed to spread risk among insurers, Standard & Poor\u2019s said."}
