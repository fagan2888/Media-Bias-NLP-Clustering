In case you don’t know American history and/or how it’s currently repeating itself, this is the Gadsden flag:

It was designed in 1775 by an American general named Christopher Gadsden, and in the context of the American Revolution, its meaning is self-evident. “Don’t step on us, King George, or you’re going to regret it.” And he did.

Now we have King Barry, and many of his opponents have given him the same warning by displaying the Gadsden flag. Those crazy teabaggers actually want to live their own lives in accordance with the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. They think a bunch of old dead white guys actually knew anything about the world we live in today.

What a bunch of loons. Everybody knows that today, fundamental human nature is completely different than it was back then. After all, now we have iPhones. Duh!

So naturally, Obama for America (the fine folks who run Obama’s official Twitter account) are striking back in the very best way:

You know you want to display this free sticker everywhere: http://t.co/P3jiADJHDx pic.twitter.com/XcR8HAysgV — OFA TruthTeam (@OFATruthTeam) March 21, 2014

LOL!

The bumper sticker is free in the same sense Obamacare itself is free: You might not be paying for it, but somebody is. Whether they like it or not. As long as it’s not you, what do you care?

Once again, the President of the United States speaks power to truth. If you oppose his attempts to control every aspect of your life, including your very body itself, he’ll only redouble his rhetorical efforts to sell you something you don’t want and can’t afford. And he’ll mock you for daring to dissent.

What are you going to do about it? Vote this November? Nice try, wingnut. Just give up, or your moral, ethical, and intellectual betters will mock you with another bumper sticker. Another Twitter hashtag. Another TV ad.

Nothing you do matters.

Right?
