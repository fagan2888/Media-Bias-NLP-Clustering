What should his instructors do?\u201d wrote Suk, adding that \u201cStudents seem more anxious about classroom discussion, and about approaching the law of sexual violence in particular, than they have ever been in my eight years as a law professor.\u201d\n\nAccording to Suk, the consequence of omitting rape law from law school curriculum is the absence of instruction on laws concerning consent, the various classifications of sexual violence, and the extraction of information in cases of rape or sexual assault.\n\nSuk says the study of rape law is especially critical now since attempts to reform laws regarding sexual assault on college campuses have become a topic of national debate.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, it is critical that law students develop the ability to engage productively and analytically in conversations about sexual assault,\u201d wrote Suk. \u201cInstead, though, many students and teachers appear to be absorbing a cultural signal that real and challenging discussion of sexual misconduct is too risky to undertake\u2014and that the risk is of a traumatic injury analogous to sexual assault itself.\u201d\n\nStudent requests for \u201ctrigger\u201d warnings have begun to spread from undergraduate classrooms to law schools, according to Suk.\n\nShe says \u201cstudent organizations representing women\u2019s interests now routinely advise students that they should not feel pressured to attend or participate in class sessions that focus on the law of sexual violence. \u2026 [T]hese organizations also ask criminal-law teachers to warn their classes that the rape-law unit might \u2018trigger\u2019 traumatic memories.\u201d\n\n>>> Should Colleges Warn Students That Courses May Include Upsetting Material?\n\nIn response to Suk\u2019s column, Susan Kruth, a lawyer with the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, wrote that it \u201cdefies reason to exempt discussions of rape, perhaps the second-most serious crime, from what is intended to be a meaningful survey of the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs the point of law school to make future lawyers feel comfortable, or is it to enable them to be zealous advocates for their clients, who may include victims of rape and other crimes?\u201d asked Kruth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Criminal Law professor says increased emphasis on sexual assault and rape culture has made it difficult to effectively teach her students.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Criminal Law professor says increased emphasis on sexual assault and rape culture has made it difficult to effectively teach her students.", "title": "Talking About Rape Is Now Too Controversial at Harvard Law", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141018780.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-03T22:20:05+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/142yR5y"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Criminal Law professor says increased emphasis on sexual assault and rape culture has made it difficult to effectively teach her students.", "title": "Talking About Rape Is Now Too Controversial at Harvard Law", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141018780.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "higher ed", "published_time": "2015-01-04T03:01:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-03T22:20:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "criminal law, harvard law, Jeanne Suk, rape law, sexual violence, women\u2019s organizations, trigger warnings, the new yorker, law school, rape culture"}, "article_summary": "According to Jeannie Suk, a professor at Harvard Law School, the accentuation of rape culture has forced her and other law professors to tread carefully while discussing rape law with students.\nSexual violence in the context of criminal law is now considered too disturbing to study for students attending the nation\u2019s most prestigious law school.\n\u201cNow more than ever, it is critical that law students develop the ability to engage productively and analytically in conversations about sexual assault,\u201d wrote Suk.\nSuk says the study of rape law is especially critical now since attempts to reform laws regarding sexual assault on college campuses have become a topic of national debate.\n\u2026 [T]hese organizations also ask criminal-law teachers to warn their classes that the rape-law unit might \u2018trigger\u2019 traumatic memories.\u201d>>> Should Colleges Warn Students That Courses May Include Upsetting Material?"}
