Burwell, among other cases involving non-profits seeking to avoid the provision of ObamaCare that forces them to provide contraception as part of their employees\u2019 health insurance.\n\nThis week, Alabama and nineteen other states filed the brief in support of David Zubik, the Catholic Bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, whose organization is seeking an exemption from the contraceptive mandate.\n\n\u201cAmericans\u2019 ability to exercise their religious beliefs \u2013 a fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution \u2013 is unfortunately under assault from a federal government determined to sacrifice our rights to further its political goals,\u201d said Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange, whose office filed the brief on behalf of the State of Alabama.\n\n\u201cBy compelling religious nonprofit groups to provide contraceptive coverage, the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, forces them to institute practices that are at odds with their deeply-held religious beliefs. These groups, which perform vital public services, have a constitutional right to exercise their religious beliefs just as surely as any individual citizen.\u201d\n\nThe brief echoes Strange\u2019s sentiments, arguing that \u201cerecting impediments to (the non-profits\u2019) adherence to their religious beliefs can threaten\u201d their ability to \u201cserve their communities in a variety of ways, from caring for the youngest members of society, to serving the elderly with compassion, to providing educations that allow individuals to pursue their own contributions.\u201d\n\nThe State of Alabama has previously joined numerous other friend of the court briefs supporting religious non-profits seeking exemptions from ObamaCare\u2019s contraception coverage mandates, including Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell. The plaintiffs in that case, who have been embroiled in a four-year legal battle with the Obama administration, were guests of House Speaker Paul Ryan at Tuesday night\u2019s State of the Union Address.\n\nIn October 2013, the State also joined a lawsuit on behalf of the Alabama-based Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN). EWTN, the largest Catholic media company in the world, could face $10 million in fines for failure to comply with the contraceptive mandate. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals granted EWTN a stay from federal fines while its case is under review.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule on the issue this summer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alabama's \"friend of the court brief\" urges SCOTUS not to force religious non-profits to comply with parts of ObamaCare that violate their beliefs.", "og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2014 The State of Alabama has joined a \u201cfriend of the court brief\u201d to the United States Supreme Court, urging its justices not to force religious non-profit organizations[...]", "title": "State of Alabama urges SCOTUS not to force religious orgs. to provide contraceptives - Yellowhammer News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 840, "identifier": "http://yellowhammernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/rsz_supreme_court_us_2010.jpg", "height": 426}, "updated_time": "2016-01-13T18:10:49-05:00", "url": "http://yellowhammernews.com/faithandculture/state-of-alabama-urges-scotus-not-to-force-religious-orgs-to-provide-contraceptives/", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "1bb21e647809aaf739789565c0783008"}, "fb": {"pages": 303363616352436}, "article": {"section": "Faith & Culture", "tag": "united states supreme court", "published_time": "2016-01-12T18:28:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-13T18:10:49-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the issue this summer.\n\u201cBy compelling religious nonprofit groups to provide contraceptive coverage, the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act, also known as ObamaCare, forces them to institute practices that are at odds with their deeply-held religious beliefs.\nMONTGOMERY, Ala. \u2014 The State of Alabama has joined a \u201cfriend of the court brief\u201d to the United States Supreme Court, urging its justices not to force religious non-profit organizations to comply with parts of ObamaCare that violate their beliefs.\nIn October 2013, the State also joined a lawsuit on behalf of the Alabama-based Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN).\nThe 11th Circuit Court of Appeals granted EWTN a stay from federal fines while its case is under review."}
