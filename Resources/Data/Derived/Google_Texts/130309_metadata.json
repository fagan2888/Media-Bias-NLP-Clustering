The party's election campaign manager Gigi Ugulava, Tbilisi's mayor from 2010 until last December, was arrested and charged with misspending public funds.\n\n\"I cannot congratulate a candidate for whose victory it became necessary to arrest a former mayor of the capital city,\" Melia said.\n\nUgulava was arrested just days after the first round and court decided that he must stay in detention for up to nine months until his trial.\n\nDozens of ex-officials including a former prime minister have been arrested on charges such as abuse of power and corruption since Georgia's new government took office.\n\nWestern countries have aired concerns that the government has used selective justice against opponents in Georgia, which fought a brief war with Russia in 2008.\n\nThe authorities deny that the prosecution of former officials is political and promise fair trials.\n\n(Writing by Margarita Antidze; Editing by Rosalind Russell)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Margarita Antidze", "Author": "Margarita Antidze", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Georgia's ruling Georgian Dream coalition has won a string of local election runoffs, cementing its control of local councils which had been the last powerbase of former president Mikheil Saakashvili's party.", "title": "Georgia's ruling party sweeps to victory in local election runoffs", "image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140713&t=2&i=932018783&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEA6C0C3", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
