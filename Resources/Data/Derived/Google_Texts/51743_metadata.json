And soon, it may become illegal for employers\u2019s health plans not to offer it.\n\nMore than 415 companies out of the 780 surveyed in a March study by the advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign offer benefits that cater to transgender employees, covering procedures such as gender reassignment surgery and hormone therapy. That\u2019s up from 49 businesses in 2009. And the Human Rights Campaign expects that number to continue rising.\n\nTechnology companies including Facebook, Netflix, and Tesla are among the latest to offer these benefits, according to their responses to the HRC\u2019s survey. They join corporate behemoths such as Coca-Cola and Time Warner Cable, which have offered transgender-specific benefits for years. Facebook and Tesla did not respond to requests for confirmation on their benefit offerings.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is working to extend protections in the Affordable Care Act that bar health coverage discrimination based on sex. A proposed new rule would remove exclusions in insurance policies for all care related to gender transition. Federal employee health plans are already required to cover transition-related health care.\n\nSome advocates say this effort is long overdue. \u201cWe think these exclusions that have been in place forever are illegal,\u201d said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, adding that she\u2019s happy to see more businesses offer health care for employees transitioning into another gender. \u201cAnybody who\u2019s not doing it now is just procrastinating and hoping nobody sues them.\u201d\n\nAnd they argue that adding the benefit is a win-win for employers. Because the benefit is rarely used, companies aren\u2019t making a big financial leap by adding it to their offerings. And it helps attract top transgender employees.\n\n\u201cIn competing for the very best talent, a company wouldn\u2019t want to lose a star performer who happens to be transgender over what is a very low-cost benefit,\u201d explained Beck Bailey, of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s workplace equality program, in an email.\n\nAmong the companies that the HRC surveyed, law, finance, and tech appeared to be the sectors that have taken most enthusiastically to this logic.\n\nOffering these health benefits doesn\u2019t change what many advocates consider the biggest underlying injustice for LGBT employees in some parts of the country\u2014the lack of protection against workplace discrimination.\n\n\u201cIn the U.S., an LGBT employee can get married on Saturday in all 50 states, but fired on Monday in 28 states for being gay or lesbian and in 31 for being transgender,\u201d said Selisse Berry, founder and CEO of Out & Equal Workplace Advocates, in an email. \u201cWe applaud major companies like Netflix for illuminating the need for LGBT-inclusive workplace policies. We are eager to see all companies follow this inclusive example\u2026 so that LGBT-inclusive policies become workplace pillars rather than perks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More and more US businesses are offering to cover the cost of sex reassignment and hormone therapy for transgender employees\u2014a gesture that\u2019s relatively cheap for employers because few people use it, and goes a long way to show a\u00a0commitment to diversity.
