Electricity is nonexistent in most homes, as is indoor plumbing.\n\nSEE ALSO: Country Times: Modern bluegrass gets a warm welcome from legends of old\n\nTo earn money amid hardscrabble conditions, the Mouse Boys sold barbecued mice-on-sticks at a roadside stand. But they were so inspired to create music that they made their guitars, drums and other instruments from scraps of wood, metal and other random materials they salvaged as they waited for customers.\n\nAnd they instinctually played and composed songs of praise in their native language, Chichewa.\n\nIt was there on a nondescript road through their village near the town of Balaka that Grammy Award-winning producer Ian Brennan encountered the self-styled musicians about four years ago.\n\nPHOTOS: Celebrity deaths in 2014\n\nDiscovering this group \u201cis just what you hope for when you make this type of journey,\u201d said Mr. Brennan, who traveled to Malawi at the urging of his father-in-law, a longtime charity worker. \u201cWhen we were there, we couldn\u2019t find music. We couldn\u2019t find any instruments. There\u2019s such a scarcity there.\n\n\u201cAfter driving thousands of miles on two-lane roads, we almost gave up. Then we saw this fellow sitting by the side of a road with a guitar. When we asked him to play a song for us, he did and all these kids gathered around and joined in. It was incredible. It will stay with me forever,\u201d the record producer said.\n\nMr. Brennan took a portable studio to the Boys\u2019 homeland and recorded their original songs. The result was the group\u2019s 14-track 2012 debut album, \u201cHe Is #1,\u201d which went to No. 75 on the Amazon.uk chart \u2014 the only world music entry on the chart.\n\nThe album fired up a fiercely loyal fan base for the band, which just released its second album, \u201cDirt Is Good.\u201d The response has been so positive that Mr. Brennan brought the band to the U.S. earlier this month for a short tour that included sold-out shows in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York.\n\nAfter a long journey, the eight band members clustered by a window in their Los Angeles hotel, fascinated by the sight of hundreds of cars in a line on the highway. They had never before seen so many vehicles in one place.\n\nOne of the musicians, Joseph, broke away from the spectacle to speak by phone about the excitement he and his band mates felt.\n\n\u201cWe have wanted to play in the United States since we were 12, and we thank God and we thank [Mr. Brennan] for bringing us here. We can\u2019t believe we are here, and even our parents can\u2019t believe we are here,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cOur music is not a joke and it is not just something for us to do. We have always played music. Sometimes we thank God for giving us this music that comes from within us.\u201d\n\n\u201cCalifornia is a big area and many people who are going to see us are rich. They are going to hear our music and know that we found it as a gift from God,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, the Malawi Mouse Boys\u2019 music \u2014 generally characterized as world music \u2014 is up-tempo, punctuated with whistling and rudimentary percussion. Recorded with either Chichewa or English lyrics, most songs sound upbeat, but their titles \u2014 \u201cYour Deeds,\u201d \u201cBlood of Jesus,\u201d \u201cThough You Are Laughing, I Am Telling the Truth\u201d \u2014 suggest the music is deeply thoughtful.\n\n\u201cPeople talk about good music and bad music. For me, even though all music is meaningful to someone, the \u2018dividing line\u2019 is truth music that is truly genuine and can generate emotion,\u201d Mr. Brennan said. \u201cThe Malawi Mouse Boys grew up as almost brothers. Their bond is similar to that of the Jackson 5 or the Carter Family. That is what makes their music so genuine, so truthful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Few musicians have struggled more for their art than the Malawi Mouse Boys.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Few musicians have struggled more for their art than the Malawi Mouse Boys.", "title": "Malawi Mouse Boys blaze new world music path", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/27/malawi-mouse-boys-blaze-new-world-music-path/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/27/10272014_img-24828201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/27/10272014_img-24828201.jpg", "description": "Few musicians have struggled more for their art than the Malawi Mouse Boys.", "card": "summary", "title": "Malawi Mouse Boys blaze new world music path"}, "Author": "Nancy Dunham  -  Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Ian Brennan"}, "article_summary": "Indeed, the Malawi Mouse Boys\u2019 music \u2014 generally characterized as world music \u2014 is up-tempo, punctuated with whistling and rudimentary percussion.\n\u201cThe Malawi Mouse Boys grew up as almost brothers.\nANALYSIS/OPINION:Few musicians have struggled more for their art than the Malawi Mouse Boys.\nAn octet of childhood friends, the Malawi Mouse Boys grew up together in the landlocked southern African nation of Malawi, one of the world\u2019s poorest \u2014 ranking 170 of 187 countries on the Human Development Index.\nSEE ALSO: Country Times: Modern bluegrass gets a warm welcome from legends of oldTo earn money amid hardscrabble conditions, the Mouse Boys sold barbecued mice-on-sticks at a roadside stand."}
