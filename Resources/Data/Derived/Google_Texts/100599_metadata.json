McCrory and Duke energy officials that came to light this week. Here are some excerpts from a press release that the group distributed yesterday:\n\n\u201cThe Alliance of Carolinians Together (ACT) Against Coal Ash formed in July as a way for residents from across the state to connect in solidarity in their demands for an end to the coal ash crisis. Members were appalled and confused last week when DEQ downgraded coal ash sites that as recently as December the agency\u2019s staff had ranked as high priority. The proposed low or low-intermediate status means the sites could potentially be capped in place and left indefinitely to leak toxins into neighboring groundwater supplies. \u2018It\u2019s an established fact that all sites are leaking, so of course they should be listed as high priority,\u2019 says Deborah Graham, who lives near the Buck plant in Salisbury. \u2018We know more than we ever wanted to know about the damage this toxic waste causes to our environment and health each and every day it continues to sit there.\u2019 \u2018DEQ changing our priority from high to low-intermediate is just wrong,\u2019 says Debra Baker, who lives within 100 feet of the G.G. Allen plant in Belmont. \u2018DEQ says they did not have enough information from Duke Energy, but they have had several months. Now, we are still living on bottled water, waiting for this mess to be cleaned up.\u2019 To urgently address the realities of coal ash pollution, ACT Against Coal Ash released its Unifying Principles so that state decision makers, Duke Energy, and the public can better understand the needs and demands of residents most harmed \u2014 now or in the future \u2014 by Duke\u2019s coal ash pollution. The alliance also launched a website and a video.\n\nAnd here are some statements made by ACT Against Coal Ash members in response to yesterday\u2019s WRAL.com story that Gov. McCrory met with Duke Energy officials in a private, closed door meeting last June:\n\nFrom Debra Baker, whose husband died from environmentally related lung disease several years after moving into their home next to G.G. Allen, which has been illegally polluting the air for decades:\u201dI\u2019ve tried calling and emailing Governor McCrory. I\u2019ve sent him photographs of my house full of bottled water. And all I\u2019ve gotten is his automatic email response. He\u2019s never called, sent a letter, nothing. I\u2019m mad that he\u2019s having backroom meetings with Duke Energy but won\u2019t talk to us. It seems like he thinks my husband\u2019s life doesn\u2019t matter. My husband was only 43 years old when he passed. Now, I\u2019m a widow with a 19 year old son. They think this problem is just going to go away, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s our lives. They need to talk to us.\u201d From Caroline Armijo, grew up near the Belews Creek power plant and has been actively engaging in coal ash work for a decade: \u201cWe can all name multiple individuals who have suffered from devastating illnesses, which have baffled doctors and too often proved fatal. Our communities are now rising up together to demand a better way. Duke Energy and DEQ have to take the initiative to actually pursue a long-term solution and work with and for our communities, instead of making backroom decisions that are blatantly fraudulent and corrupt.\u201d From Debbie Hall, who lives near the proposed coal ash dump in Lee County and is a member of EnvironmentaLEE: \u201cThe decision by DEQ to allow Duke Energy to dump millions of tons of coal ash on Lee and Chatham Counties coming mere days after that meeting is telling. Its appalling, and shows exactly where Governor McCrory\u2019s priorities are. Neither DEQ Secretary van der Vaart nor the Governor have made the communities impacted by Duke Energy\u2019s coal ash a priority.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: The state\u2019s coal ash problem remains a huge and growing issue for the McCrory administration \u2014 from a policy, political (and maybe even legal) perspective. And from the looks of things, it\u2019s going to become an even higher profile issue before it does away. The Governor would do well to tackle the problem honestly and aggressively lest he find himself buried by it in the months and years ahead.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "And here are some statements made by ACT Against Coal Ash members in response to yesterday\u2019s WRAL.com story that Gov.\nA statewide citizens group formed last year to demand stronger state environmental protection efforts to combat coal ash pollution is decrying the new state rankings attached to the state\u2019s coal ash ponds and the closed door meeting between Gov.\nMembers were appalled and confused last week when DEQ downgraded coal ash sites that as recently as December the agency\u2019s staff had ranked as high priority.\nAllen, which has been illegally polluting the air for decades:\u201dI\u2019ve tried calling and emailing Governor McCrory.\nHere are some excerpts from a press release that the group distributed yesterday:\u201cThe Alliance of Carolinians Together (ACT) Against Coal Ash formed in July as a way for residents from across the state to connect in solidarity in their demands for an end to the coal ash crisis."}
