The researchers studied 52 pairs of single, straight college students. They asked the pairs to sit in a room and had them talk for 10 to 12 minutes about what they thought the study was about. When the study was over, the students were asked to fill out a questionnaire in separate rooms, and they had to write down if they flirted and if they thought their pair had flirted, too.\n\nThe participants were 80 percent accurate at detecting when their counterpart was not flirting with them. However, they were oblivious when it came to knowing when someone was flirting with them. Men were 36 percent correct and women 18 percent.\n\n\u201cBehavior that is flirtatious is hard to see, and there are several reason for that,\u201d Hall said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to do it in obvious ways because they don\u2019t want to be embarrassed, flirting looks a lot like being friendly, and we are not accustomed to having our flirting validated so we can get better at seeing it.\u201d\n\nHall also conducted another study where he had more than 250 people watch six one-minute video clips of the first study. Only one person was shown this video at a time. They researchers found out that third-party observers were not more accurate at detecting flirting. They were 66 percent accurate when flirting didn\u2019t occur and 38 percent when it did occur.\n\nFemales were least accurate when it came to detecting males flirting, as they were only correct 22 percent of the time. Women and men alike had an easier time detecting when females were flirting.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear to be the case that men have some intuition about women and women have some intuition about men. But it does seem that women are just a little more clear if they are interested or not,\u201d Hall said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "flirting", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "When it comes to flirting, most people are not aware when someone is hitting on them.", "title": "Think You\u2019re A Natural Flirt?
