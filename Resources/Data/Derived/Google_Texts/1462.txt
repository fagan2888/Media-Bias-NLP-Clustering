ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK —

Mountain biking in Rocky Mountain National Park is close to reality.

The National Park Service has finalized a report that allows mountain biking on a 2-mile stretch of trail on the park’s west side near Grand Lake.

The Fort Collins Coloradoan reported the trail will be the first in Rocky Mountain National Park to allow mountain biking.

Under the Wilderness Act of 1964, bicycles are prohibited on the trails in the wilderness area of Rocky Mountain National Park, though cycling on the paved roads in the park is allowed.

In 2012 the National Park Service expanded bike access in its parks under a new rule giving park superintendents the authority to allow bicycles on roads or trails.
