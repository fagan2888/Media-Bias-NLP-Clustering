However, Native Americans who did not have health insurance during 2014 can avoid the cost by filing an exemption.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no need to worry about the \u201cshared responsibility\u201d cost if you had private insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid in 2014 and if you do not file taxes, according to the IRS guidelines. If you fall in any of these categories, sit back and relax, you don\u2019t need it and you don\u2019t qualify.\n\n\n\nBut if you are among the many Native Americans who rely on Indian Health Services for the majority of your urgent care needs and well child check-ups there is a form you will need to include in your filing to avoid paying up to $95 per person or the national average premium for minimal coverage according to the U.S. Department of Health and Services.\n\nThere are three ways to apply for the exemption.\n\n\u00b7 There is the Indian Health Services Affordable Care Act Exemption Form and this form must be completed and submitted to IHS facility along with a copy of your CDIB and takes about a week to receive the IHS exemption eligibility letter\n\n\u00b7 There is the Health Insurance Marketplace Application for Exemption for American Indians and Alaska Natives and other Individuals who are Eligible to Receive Services from an Indian Health Care Provider. You will need a CDIB or tribal membership, Social Security numbers and household information.\n\n\n\n\u00b7 But the easiest route is the most recent of eligibility requirements, the IRS Form 8965. All you need is your CDIB or tribal membership, complete Section three and use Code \u2018C\u2019. Most big companies like H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt are already versed in using the form and will only need a copy of your CDIB.\n\n\n\nThe Osage Nation Constituent Services Office and your local IHS can provide an application for exemption. Information about the exemption process is also provided on the Constituent Services web page.\n\n\u201c[The exemption application] is provided on our website for constituents to conveniently access it,\u201d said Jacque Jones, Coordinator for Constituent Services.\n\nAccording to HealthCare.gov the shared responsibility cost will continue to increase, \u201cthe penalty increases every year. In 2016, it\u2019s 2.5 percent of income or $695 per person after that it is adjusted for inflation.\u201d\n\nForms and links:\n\nOsage Nation Constituent Services osagenation-nsn.gov/what-we-do/constituent-services\n\nTo receive the tax exemption file Form 8965, a link is provided on the Constituent Services site\n\n\n\nor call 918/287-5662, or email This email address is being protected from spambots.
