× Iraq civil war upping gas prices in NJ: report

TRENTON, N.J. (AP) – Widespread violence in Iraq is causing pain at the gas pump for consumers in New Jersey.

AAA Mid-Atlantic says in its weekly report that average gas prices rose in the state by five cents over the last week, to $3.54 per gallon. That’s 13 cents per gallon over the average one year ago.

Nationally, the average rose three cents in the last week to $3.68 per gallon. That’s four cents higher than a month ago and eight cents higher than a year ago.

Gas prices have increased for nine straight days. Before that, they had fallen for nine straight days.

Turmoil in Iraq is seen as a factor in crude oil prices notching their biggest weekly gain this year.

Prices are expected to continue rising if instability in Iraq continues.
