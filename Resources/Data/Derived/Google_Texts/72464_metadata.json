The Hospital Engagement Networks, formed by the federal Partnership for Patients initiative and made possible by the Affordable Care Act, is making significant strides towards better patient care at an affordable cost.\n\nAs one of 26 hospital organizations and associations that comprise the national Hospital Engagement Network, Dignity Health focused on providing better quality care across 10 patient safety areas that were identified through the partnership. Dignity Health is committed to every initiative across all its hospitals, including seven new measures just launched in January this year. The efforts implemented across Dignity Health hospitals reveal that the organization has reached its goal of improving patient care in six out of the 10 patient safety areas before the three year target date.\n\n\u201cThe goals of the Partnership for Patients align with Dignity Health\u2019s mission and longstanding commitment to making hospital care safer, more reliable, and less costly,\u201d says Barbara Pelletreau, senior vice president of patient safety for Dignity Health. \u201cThrough enhanced collaboration and coordination among our staff, we\u2019re seeing great results, and even more importantly, we\u2019ve improved how care is delivered at Dignity Health hospitals.\u201d\n\nDignity Health is narrowing in on its overall goal of reducing the rate of hospital-acquired infections by 40 percent and readmissions by 20 percent before 2015. To achieve this goal, the hospital system introduced specific evidence-based practices and bedside intervention activities, called MeasureVention, to evaluate full adoption of safe preventive practices and assure coordination of care at the bedside with clinicians, including physicians.\n\nBest practices deployed system wide ensured procedures were conducted as routinely and as safely as possible. For example, nurses and doctors only inserted catheters if absolutely necessary, changing the previously presumed notion that catheters were innocuous, which led to a large decrease in urinary tract infections. Insulin treatments were given to patients at specific times in relation to their meals lowering the overall hypoglycemic rate.\n\nDignity Health also enlisted the help of MeasureVentionists, nurses that have been through specialized training programs to examine current patients\u2019 conditions, and measure their risk for infection and readmission. Through their work, MeasureVentionists were able to assess and document whether protocols were being followed ultimately, raising the bar of patient care across the system.\n\nBelow are the results for all 10 patient safety areas from Jan. 2012 through Dec. 2013:\n\n\u2022 Hypoglycemic Rate: 65 percent reduction achieved by standardizing insulin protocols and enhancing coordination.\n\n\u2022 Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infections: 45 percent reduction implemented through a strict justification policy and significant education efforts.\n\n\u2022 Central Line Associated Blood Stream Infections: 34 percent reduction accomplished by using alcohol-impregnated disinfection caps, new insertion practices and MeasureVentionists.\n\n\u2022 Falls: 35 percent reduction by generating fall assessment scores, providing enhanced bedside protection and instituting monthly \u201cfall calls.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Early Elective Deliveries: 96 percent reduction through \u201chard stop\u201d policies, and patient, staff, and physician education.\n\n\u2022 Hospital-Acquired Pressure Ulcers: 50 percent reduction through enhanced wound assessments, risk assessments, and improved equipment and documentation.\n\n\u2022 Surgical Site Infections: 35 percent reduction through SCIP practices, skin prep, antibiotic dosing, environmental controls, wound dressing, and education.\n\n\u2022 Venous Thromboembolism & Pulmonary Embolism: 6 percent reduction achieved by standardized risk assessments, staff education, daily huddles, and documentation by MeasureVentionists.\n\n\u2022 Ventilator Associated Pneumonia: 60 percent reduction through bed elevation, advanced sedation practices, and the launch of \u201cimprovement teams.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Readmissions within 30 Days: 9 percent reduction with an estimated positive impact to more than 2,000 patients.\n\nAs of January 2014, Dignity Health also started measuring results on an additional seven measures: Perinatal Hemorrhage; Peripartum Hysterectomy; PreEclampsia; ADE OPIOD; ADE Anticoagulant INR, ADE VTE5; and HYPOglycemia Insulin Mealtime, Insulin IV, Basal Bolus Order, Basal Bolus Approved Protocol.\n\nSource: Dignity Health", "article_metadata": {"site_name": "Infection Control Today", "description": "Dignity Health, one of the five largest hospital systems in the nation, announces that in two years it has reduced hospital-acquired infections and", "og": {"url": "http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/news/2014/04/dignity-health-saves-30-million-on-reductions-in-hais-and-readmissions.aspx", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Dignity Health, one of the five largest hospital systems in the nation, announces that in two years it has reduced hospital-acquired infections and", "title": "Dignity Health Saves 30 Million on Reductions in HAIs and Readmissions"}, "vpi-date": "2014-04-10", "twitter": {"title": "Dignity Health Saves 30 Million on Reductions in HAIs and Readmissions", "description": "Dignity Health, one of the five largest hospital systems in the nation, announces that in two years it has reduced hospital-acquired infections and readmissions, positively affecting more than 10,000", "card": "summary", "site": "@ICT_magazine"}, "DC.date": "2014-04-10", "keywords": "Dignity Health, hospital-acquired infections and readmissions,", "google-site-verification": "fhACDHu0y1VRuJn2Kl-av9ETvTB9CzlLpR66C8YSLQY", "verify-v1": "Cttvcxv1MIeEwmvkSyjObGtyI++pWRbmbaPFysXm+1s=", "y_key": "ead0b0ebf297bedc"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf279\"", "article_summary": "Dignity Health is committed to every initiative across all its hospitals, including seven new measures just launched in January this year.\nSource: Dignity Health\nThe efforts implemented across Dignity Health hospitals reveal that the organization has reached its goal of improving patient care in six out of the 10 patient safety areas before the three year target date.\nThrough their work, MeasureVentionists were able to assess and document whether protocols were being followed ultimately, raising the bar of patient care across the system.\nDignity Health also enlisted the help of MeasureVentionists, nurses that have been through specialized training programs to examine current patients\u2019 conditions, and measure their risk for infection and readmission."}
