They have to go underneath or go behind, and that gets our guys open.\u201d\n\nCall it a rub route, call it a rubout or call it a pick play, but call it highly effective. It\u2019s a central component of Denver\u2019s high-octane offense, something the Seattle Seahawks say they\u2019ll be braced for Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we are certainly aware of,\u201d Seattle safety Kam Chancellor said. \u201cYou have to get around them, be athletic and get around.\u201d\n\nRub routes have multiplied in recent years because of the incredible accuracy of quarterbacks such as the Broncos\u2019 Peyton Manning, New England\u2019s Tom Brady, New Orleans\u2019 Drew Brees and Green Bay\u2019s Aaron Rodgers. Because those type of quarterbacks are so accurate and can dissect a zone defense with ease, defenses were forced to go to tight, physical, man-to-man coverage at the line of scrimmage.\n\nIn the face of that pressure, offenses countered with a variety of pick plays and sophisticated routes. The Broncos, for instance, align receivers in \u201cbunch\u201d or \u201cstack\u201d formations in order to free up space for them to operate. In essence, the Broncos designate one receiver to come off the line and get tangled up with a defender, thus freeing up another receiver. The goal is keep the defense from getting its hands on all the receivers, which disrupts the timing of the routes. Picks and rubs are most often used in crucial situations \u2014 on third downs and often in the red zone, where space is squeezed \u2014 when teams look to beat tight coverage.\n\nCritics call it cheating, claiming that receivers are essentially committing offensive pass interference. But Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase said rub routes are just one more tool for an offense to exploit.\n\n\u201cEverybody runs different forms of the play, not just the Broncos,\u201d Gase said. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting a (defender) to change directions.\u201d\n\nNo team uses picks or rub routes more than the Broncos, except perhaps the Patriots. For example, in their Week 12 meeting, which New England won 34-31 at home in overtime, the teams combined to run 12 pick plays in the second quarter alone, six by each team.\n\nThat\u2019s ironic, especially given that Patriots coach Bill Belichick unleashed a tirade the day after Denver beat New England in the AFC championship game. In that game, Broncos receiver Wes Welker collided with New England cornerback Aqib Talib, knocking Talib out of the game on a pass play to the Broncos\u2019 Thomas, who was the \u201cunderneath\u201d receiver on the rub route. Belichick called the incident \u201cone of the worst plays I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nDean Blandino, the NFL\u2019s vice president of officiating, said \u201cunder current rules, this is a legal play.\u201d\n\nMike Pereira, a former vice president of NFL officiating and now an analyst for Fox Sports, defended Denver\u2019s use of pick plays.\n\n\u201cEverybody assumes that when they hear the word \u2018pick,\u2019 it\u2019s illegal,\u201d Pereira said. \u201cBut not all picks are illegal, and Denver has run them for years.\u201d\n\nPereira pointed out that receivers are allowed to make contact with defenders within 1 yard of the line of scrimmage, which is why a lot of teams set up so-called bubble screens for their receivers. One of Manning\u2019s favorite plays is throwing a bubble screen to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, which allows him to use his strength and speed to break free as he cuts to an open gap.\n\nPereira also said it\u2019s legal for a receiver to get in a defender\u2019s way downfield, so long as the receiver doesn\u2019t intentionally initiate contact while the ball is in the air. If he does, it should be called pass interference.\n\nPereira, however, also acknowledged that officials face tough judgment calls when it comes to pick plays.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Welker play, technically it was offensive pass interference because his pick occurred when the ball was inches away from Demaryius Thomas\u2019 hands,\u201d Pereira said. \u201cIt was one frame on the tape, so fast I can hardly stop it on the frame. It was like 1/26th of a second. So it was a bang-bang play, and it was impossible for the official to discern it.\u201d\n\nThe Seahawks will try to combat pick plays by jamming Denver\u2019s receivers at the line. Seahawks opponents often complain that Seattle\u2019s defensive backs frequently get too physical with receivers without getting penalized. Expect plenty of hand-to-hand fighting at the line of scrimmage.\n\nThe Seahawks are confident they can disrupt the Broncos\u2019 pick plays.\n\n\u201cYou have to know when it\u2019s coming,\u201d safety Earl Thomas said. \u201cThey have little tells and keys. Everything is attack mode. When you know, you just go. You don\u2019t second-guess yourself. Play with the absence of fear.\u201d\n\nWhile the Broncos will be looking to rub out defenders, the Seahawks vow to get physical.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, watching film, I don\u2019t think anyone ever hits them. They just take the pick play,\u201d linebacker Bobby Wagner said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking, we\u2019re very aware of the pick plays and when they show up, we\u2019re going to hit them.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 pick plays to meet Seahawks\u2019 aggressive, physical DBs", "title": "Broncos\u2019 pick plays to meet Seahawks\u2019 aggressive, physical DBs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/31/broncos-pick-plays-to-meet-seahawks-aggressive-physical-dbs/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131030__BroncosWRs103013p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131030__BroncosWRs103013p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-31T23:12:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T02:58:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce583\"", "article_summary": "The Seahawks are confident they can disrupt the Broncos\u2019 pick plays.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking, we\u2019re very aware of the pick plays and when they show up, we\u2019re going to hit them.\u201dPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\nPereira, however, also acknowledged that officials face tough judgment calls when it comes to pick plays.\nIn the face of that pressure, offenses countered with a variety of pick plays and sophisticated routes.\nBut Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase said rub routes are just one more tool for an offense to exploit."}
