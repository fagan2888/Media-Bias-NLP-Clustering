His artwork, described as very disturbing, often focuses on abortion.\n\nRecently Ron English uploaded a video depicting a baby Jesus doll hanging from a coat hanger with a sign saying: Hobby Lobby Aborted Baby Jesus.\n\nIt is unclear who orchestrated this vandalism or who produced the video. But Ron English just happened to go to the exact Hobby Lobby where these dolls were placed:\n\nEnglish writes on his blog, \u201cWhile at Hobby Lobby in Poughkeepsie NY, Ron came across a rack which held four crucified aborted Baby Jesus\u2019. Wonder if they are still there?\u201d\n\nThe video shows the back of a person walking through a Hobby Lobby store on what appears to be around Easter.\n\nThe person then strategically places the coat hanger \u201caborted Jesus\u201d through out the store.\n\nThe video entitled \u201cChristian Consumerism\u201d is almost certainly intended to make some sort of political statement, most likely in reference to Hobby Lobby\u2019s pending lawsuit against the Obama Administration in opposition to Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate.\n\nIt ends with this cryptic message: \u201cConsume like a real Christian at Hobby Lobby!\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nRon English also mocked the pro-life billboard which features an African American child with the text: The MOST DANGEROUS place for an African American IS IN THE WOMB.\u201d\n\nThe Ron English version read: \u201cThe MOST DANGEROUS place for an African American IS ON A BILLBOARD.\u201d\n\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nIn another piece of \u201cart\u201d produced by Ron English an archived and very disturbing video uploaded to the Ron English YouTube page, attempts to play into the fears that making abortion illegal will cause women to turn to coat hanger abortions and die.\n\nThe video: WARNING VERY GRAPHIC \u2013 depicts a naked woman standing in front of a Coat Hanger billboard giving herself a supposed \u201ccoat-hanger\u201d abortion.\n\nAs she strips down in the video she simulates inserting a coat hanger into her vagina and at that point red paint simulating blood splatters on the billboard directly behind her.\n\nI Haven\u2019t seen the artwork showing the women killed by legal abortion yet- but- I am certain it is on the Ron English \u201cto do \u201d list- NOT!\n\nLifeNews Note: Carole Novielli is the author of the blog Saynsumthn, where this article originally appeared.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pro-Abortion Vandal Hangs Aborted Baby Jesus Dolls Throughout Hobby Lobby Store", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Pro-choice propaganda artist Ron English is very controversial.
