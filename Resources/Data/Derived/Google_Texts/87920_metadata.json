Baden, special to CNN\n\n(CNN) - Moses: the main character of the Torah, the paradigmatic law-giver and the star of multiple motion pictures.\n\nAs Passover rolls around again and Jews the world over retell the story of Moses\u2019s big moment, it\u2019s worth remembering that there are aspects of Moses that haven\u2019t made it to the big screen or into public consciousness.\n\nFor example, here are five things you probably didn\u2019t know about the Hebrew prophet.\n\n1. Moses was probably Egyptian.\n\nThe most important piece of evidence for this is his name.\n\nIn the Bible, it is explained that his name is derived from the Hebrew word mashah, \u201cto draw,\u201d as in \u201cto draw him from the waters of the Nile,\u201d where he had been hidden as an infant.\n\nUnfortunately, it is awfully hard to get from that verb to the name Moses, which would probably mean something like \u201cthe one who draws,\" which isn\u2019t how the story goes.\n\nThe name Moses is in fact a good Egyptian name meaning \u201cson.\u201d It\u2019s a common element in the names of many pharaohs, such as Tuthmoses and, most famously, Ramesses (\u201cson of Ra\u201d).\n\nThat well-known narrative in which Moses\u2019 mother hides him in the Nile until he is found and raised by the pharaoh\u2019s daughter looks a lot like a heavy-handed attempt to explain that despite all the indications that Moses was Egyptian \u2014 especially his name \u2014 he was actually Israelite.\n\nThere\u2019s also the little passage in Exodus that suggests that Moses was uncircumcised, as was his son \u2014 unexpected, to say the least, for a native Israelite.\n\n2. Moses wasn\u2019t anti-slavery.\n\nHe has a reputation as the great liberator. And it\u2019s true, he did liberate the Israelites from Egypt.\n\nBut Moses didn\u2019t have anything against slavery as an institution, only against the enslavement of the Israelites by the Egyptians.\n\nThe Israelites themselves were expected to have slaves of their own: both their fellow Israelites, who were to be treated relatively well, and non-Israelites, who received no such kindness.\n\nMoses tells the Israelites that if they hit a slave so hard that the slave dies on the spot, that\u2019s bad. But if the slave survives for a day or two and then dies, no punishment is required, \u201csince he is the other\u2019s property.\u201d\n\n3. Moses had a black wife.\n\nTrue story. And not his first wife, either; that was Tziporah, the daughter of Jethro, a Midianite priest.\n\nThis is his second wife, a Cushite, Cush being the ancient name for Ethiopia.\n\nIf you\u2019re bothered by this, you\u2019re not alone. Aaron and Miriam, Moses\u2019 own brother and sister, think it\u2019s a bad thing, too.\n\nBut if you think that their objections justify your discomfort, there you\u2019re wrong.\n\nGod reprimands Aaron and gives Miriam a skin disease for speaking out against Moses.\n\nTo be fair, Aaron and Miriam are bothered by inter-ethnic marriage, not interracial marriage. Since, in all likelihood, Moses \u2014 being Egyptian and all \u2014 was probably pretty dark-skinned himself.\n\n4. Moses didn\u2019t come up with a single law.\n\nMoses is the paradigmatic law-giver, not the paradigmatic law-maker.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single law in the Torah that Moses claims to have come up with all by himself. Every law he gives the Israelites was dictated to him by God.\n\nThe New Testament refers to the law, usually in a negative sense, as something that Moses commanded. But this is deceptive (intentionally or unintentionally).\n\nIt may be that the laws of the Old Testament were all consigned to the dustbin when Jesus came along. But they weren\u2019t commanded by Moses; they were the word of God.\n\nDon\u2019t shoot the messenger.\n\n5. Moses didn\u2019t write the Torah.\n\nDespite the well-established Jewish and Christian tradition, the Torah never says, or even remotely suggests, that Moses wrote it.\n\nThe Bible does refer to the Torah as \u201cthe book of Moses.\u201d But this doesn\u2019t mean that Moses wrote the Torah, any more than \u201cthe book of Job\u201d was written by Job or \u201cthe book of Kings\u201d was written by Kings. \u201cThe book of Moses\u201d means the book in which Moses is the main character \u2014 as in Job, or Kings.\n\nThe Torah is written in the third person from start to finish. Even the great speech of Deuteronomy is a reported speech: It begins with \u201cThese are the words that Moses addressed to all Israel\u201d and ends with Moses\u2019 death.\n\nThe verse in Deuteronomy that states that \u201cMoses wrote down this Torah\u201d isn\u2019t proof that he actually wrote the Torah. Again: He\u2019s a character, and in any case he\u2019s taking dictation, not composing anything himself.\n\nA final note on this point. If Moses did write the Torah, then consider this verse in Numbers: \u201cNow Moses was a very humble man, more so than any other man on earth.\u201d\n\nIf Moses wrote that, he\u2019s at worst a liar and at best a serious humblebragger. It\u2019s probably fortunate, then, that he didn\u2019t write that verse, or any other, for that matter.\n\nJoel S.
