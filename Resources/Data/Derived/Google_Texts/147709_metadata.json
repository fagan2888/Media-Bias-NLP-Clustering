Maybe now Americans will think about what the same thing would mean if it were imposed on the entire U.S. economy.\n\nAs IBD\u2019s Jed Graham reported Monday, Wal-Mart\u2019s recent earnings warning is due largely to the company\u2019s decision to unilaterally raise its wages.\n\nFor the record, we have no problem with wage hikes. But when it\u2019s done for political rather than economic reasons, it\u2019s always a mistake.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to blame Wal-Mart. In recent years, the retailing behemoth has been subjected to nonstop hard-left criticism for its low wages. The criticism stung.\n\nSo earlier this year, the company announced it would raise its own base wage to $9 an hour in April and to $10 an hour as of February 2016. Very generous.\n\nBut last week, the Benton, Ark., discounter issued its second warning about profits in two months, saying that it expects a 6%-13% drop in earnings next year as a result of its higher costs.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s shares didn\u2019t take it lightly, plunging 10% in just a day \u2014 a $21 billion loss for shareholders.\n\nContrary to the propaganda of unions and their media toadies, Wal-Mart\u2019s profit margins are razor-thin \u2014 about 3.6% in 2013. Now, due to higher wage costs and ObamaCare, its margins will shrink below 3%.\n\nIt\u2019s strange that Wal-Mart\u2019s poor results surprised investors. After all, earlier this year, after its wage hikes were announced, Wal-Mart quietly revealed plans to lay off 1,000 workers at its headquarters.\n\nThen, in April, it announced it would close five stores for \u201cplumbing\u201d problems, idling 2,500 more workers. No doubt, as the company\u2019s margins are squeezed further, more layoffs will come.\n\nUnfortunately for its critics, Wal-Mart already pays its workers more than the comparable average for retail workers, as a 2014 National Bureau of Economics Research study showed. That never stops the criticism.\n\nMeanwhile, anti-Wal-Mart activists also ignore the discount chain\u2019s massive economic benefits to the U.S. economy. A 2005 study by Global Insight found WalMart saved American families \u2014 even those who don\u2019t shop there \u2014 $2,500 a year, or some $287 billion total.\n\nEven so, Wal-Mart is a test case for what unions and their \u201cprogressive\u201d allies are now trying to foist on all of us: A job-killing hike in the U.S. minimum wage to $15 an hour from $7.25. Don\u2019t expect a different outcome. It will kill millions of jobs and raise minority youth unemployment dramatically.\n\nWe\u2019ve already seen what such big wage hikes have done to cities such as Seattle, San Francisco and Oakland. Massive mandated hikes in the minimum wage have caused businesses to close, killed jobs and lost many others their long-cherished benefits as employers scramble to offset sharply higher wages.\n\nA doubling of the U.S. minimum to $15 an hour will mean the Wal-Mart-ization of America \u2014 job losses, benefit cuts, closed stores and a lower standard of living for all. But at least the far left will feel good.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Labor: Wal-Mart's politically driven decision to raise its workers' pay is a major reason for its financial woes.
