Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican, agreed with Mr. Bush on his views about a government shutdown. He said that passing a short-term budget that funds the government through December is the best way to go, considering that such a budget does not include Planned Parenthood funding. Planned Parenthood already has received all the money it can this year, he noted.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s none left to do this year, so the idea that we\u2019re fighting over money for Planned Parenthood is \u2026 just not true,\u201d Mr. Cole told Mr. Wallace.\n\nRepublicans have been fighting to cut Planned Parenthood funding, but despite their being the majority in the Senate, do not have enough votes to slash the budget for the women\u2019s health group.\n\nSome Republicans, most notably presidential candidate Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have been floating the idea of letting the budget lapse on Sept. 30, when the government would have to shut down until a new budget can be approved.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush said Sunday that shutting down the government over defunding Planned Parenthood is \"not how democracy works.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jeb Bush said Sunday that shutting down the government over defunding Planned Parenthood is \u201cnot how democracy works.\u201d", "title": "Jeb Bush, GOP presidential candidate: Government shutdown is \u2018not how democracy works\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/27/jeb-bush-gop-presidential-candidate-government-shu/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/22/58005548a5eeb12a820f6a706700280d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/22/58005548a5eeb12a820f6a706700280d.jpg", "description": "Jeb Bush said Sunday that shutting down the government over defunding Planned Parenthood is \"not how democracy works.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Jeb Bush, GOP presidential candidate: Government shutdown is \u2018no"}, "Author": "Anjali Shastry", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "Rep.
