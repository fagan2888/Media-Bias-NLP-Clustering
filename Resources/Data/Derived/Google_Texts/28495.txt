A decade ago, we could have mused about the U.S. government "spying on everything we do." In fact, in 2007, The Simpsons Movie made exactly that joke when the world-renown family was on the run from the law. The cartoon's creator Matt Groening was probably chuckling to himself as he mapped out the plot, to which a massive room of spies are listening to the conversations of everyone talk on the phone.

And yet, only a few years later, former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden evades his former employers by jumping on a flight to Russia where he claimed asylum, not long after pilfering thousands of top secret and classified documents relating to the U.S. government's ( and its allies ) surveillance efforts.

With PRISM and Upstream, Tempora, and dozens of other programs, the U.S. really has the ability — at very least — to monitor to our calls (despite claims by President Obama to the contrary ). It turns out The Simpsons' were indeed onto something all those years ago.
