Failure to comply could result in fines.\n\n\u201cThey want to have the consent decree filed in federal court by the end of September,\u201d Fort Smith City Administrator Ray Gosack said. \u201cThen we\u2019ll be mandated to do certain things like constructions projects, maintenance for the sewer system, record-keeping and reporting.\u201d\n\nGosack and other city officials met in Dallas with representatives of the EPA and Department of Justice last week.\n\n\u201cIt went well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have another round of discussions set with them in August here in Fort Smith. That will probably be the final round of discussions. So we\u2019re getting close.\u201d\n\nDuring budget talks in November, Utilities Director Steve Parke was asked by city directors if sewer rates will eventually rise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not if, but when,\u201d he said.\n\nGosack said the rates could rise next year if the consent decree is filed this fall.\n\n\u201cThey take the average income in the city and say that number times 2 percent is what a sewer bill should be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re quite a bit below that number. What we\u2019ve been doing is trying to structure this so we can phase in the sewer rates.\u201d\n\nAdditional funds would help pay for maintenance and rehabilitation of the sewer system. The city has been using voter-approved sales tax bonds for sewer construction work.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of construction work, but we\u2019re not doing nearly as much on the maintenance, record-keeping and reporting side as we\u2019ll have to do under the consent decree,\u201d Gosack said. \u201cWe\u2019re costing all that out now.\u201d\n\nHe added that over the past eight years, Fort Smith has eliminated more than 70 percent of the recurring sanitary sewer overflows.\n\n\u201cThey recognize we\u2019ve made significant progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also point out that no other city in the U.S. has been under an enforcement action longer than Fort Smith. That\u2019s not something to be proud of.\u201d\n\nThe consent decree\u2019s length is still in debate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking for a 15-year period,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to keep it down closer to 10. We\u2019re telling them if we have to do it all in 10, it\u2019s not going to be affordable for the community. We will exceed the EPA\u2019s own affordability guidelines.\u201d\n\nFort Smith has been plagued with sanitary sewer overflows for decades, Gosack said.\n\n\u201cThose are violations of the Clean Water Act,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had 21 locations in this city where back in the late 1970s the city intentionally put in overflow points in the sewer system to let the sewage escape into the creek \u2014 a blatant violation of the Clean Water Act. I think it was about a year-and-a-half ago we removed the last of those.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fort Smith\u2019s long-standing federal mandate to comply with the Clean Water Act will likely lead to firm sewer-system regulations this fall and possibly higher sewer rates as early as next year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Chad Hunter Times Record &#8226; chunter@swtimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "Times Record", "description": "Fort Smith\u2019s long-standing federal mandate to comply with the Clean Water Act will likely lead to firm sewer-system regulations this fall and possibly higher sewer rates as early as next year.", "title": "Fort Smith Braces For EPA Consent Decree For Sewer Overflows", "url": "http://swtimes.com/news/fort-smith-braces-epa-consent-decree-sewer-overflows", "image": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_News-mug-clr-RayGosack.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/news/fort-smith-braces-epa-consent-decree-sewer-overflows", "image": {"src": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_News-mug-clr-RayGosack.jpg"}, "title": "Fort Smith Braces For EPA Consent Decree For Sewer Overflows", "description": "Fort Smith\u2019s long-standing federal mandate to comply with the Clean Water Act will likely lead to firm sewer-system regulations this fall and possibly higher sewer rates as early as next year.", "creator": "@timesrecord"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1089492", "app_name": "swtimes", "package": "com.stephensmedia.timesrecord"}, "ios": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1089492", "app_store_id": 964468128, "app_name": "swtimes"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964468128", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.timesrecord", "keywords": "News,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-29T05:06:11-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37db\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey want to have the consent decree filed in federal court by the end of September,\u201d Fort Smith City Administrator Ray Gosack said.\n\u201cWe have another round of discussions set with them in August here in Fort Smith.\n\u201cWe\u2019re costing all that out now.\u201dHe added that over the past eight years, Fort Smith has eliminated more than 70 percent of the recurring sanitary sewer overflows.\n\u201cThey also point out that no other city in the U.S. has been under an enforcement action longer than Fort Smith.\nGosack said the rates could rise next year if the consent decree is filed this fall."}
