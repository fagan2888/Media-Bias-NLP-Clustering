Thinkstock\n\nWe all know it\u2019s tough to save for retirement today. Somehow, workers will have to save more for retirement than previous generations, all while dealing with the pressures of student loan debt, stagnating wages and rising fixed costs.\n\nSome workers are cracking under that pressure, new research by PwC shows. Nearly half of 1,600 workers surveyed said they\u2019ve saved less than $50,000 for retirement. Almost the same number of workers said they will probably have to tap their nest egg to cover unexpected expenses before they retire, driving them to prolong their working years.\n\nStats like these shouldn\u2019t just trouble individual workers. Here are two reasons employers should be worried, too:\n\nIt\u2019s killing their productivity.\n\nTwenty-eight percent of workers admitted money problems have distracted them during their working hours, up from 20% in 2015. Nearly half of workers said they devote three working hours or more each week handling financial issues, up from 37% last year. Younger workers are the most likely group to be distracted at work. More than one-third of millennial workers this year said they worry about meeting their monthly expenses, up from 23% in 2015. Considering millennials make up the majority of the workforce today, employers should pay attention.\n\nView gallery .

In PwC\u2019s survey, more than half of boomers said they plan to retire later than they originally planned, compared to 44% of Gen Xers and 32% of millennials. The primary reason? Not saving enough. And when older employees stick around, it becomes harder for employers to attract fresh talent. \u201cYou\u2019ve got older employees, less productive, less healthy employees hanging around longer and that isn\u2019t a good solution for the employer,\u201d says Kent Allison, head of PwC\u2019s employee financial wellness practice.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe bottom line is it\u2019s not enough to encourage workers to save for retirement while ignoring all the roadblocks that stand in their way. For years, we\u2019ve seen employers shift away from programs that help ease the financial burden of their workers, like 401(k) matching contributions and employer-provided health care plans (to counter some of these developments, the federal government has delivered programs like the Affordable Care Act and MyRA, where workers can save for retirement if their employers don\u2019t offer a dedicated plan). Only 3% of employers offer some kind of student loan repayment assistance program now. The U.S. is still one of the only developed countries that doesn\u2019t require paid maternity and paternity leave for workers.\n\nThese trends should be reversed. Already, a few major corporations are leading the way. The question is whether others will follow suit.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "From Yahoo Finance: Nearly half of 1,600 workers surveyed said they\u2019ve saved less than $50,000 for retirement.
