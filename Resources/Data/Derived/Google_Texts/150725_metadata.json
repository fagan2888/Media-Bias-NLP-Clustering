So, I\u2019m worried about buying her clothes because she\u2019ll, on Christmas Day, look at it and say, \u2018That\u2019s really sweet, honey,\u2019 and peck me on the cheek, and then I never see her wear whatever I bought.\u201d\n\nHowever, Obama called his daughter Malia a \u201cfun\u201d person to shop for because of her interest in movies.\n\nObama also detailed the tradition during which, on Small Business Saturday, he and his daughters purchase books to gift their relatives on the Christmas holiday.\n\n\u201cMalia, Sasha, and I have a tradition of going to an independent bookstore and buying some books for various members of the family,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s always a lot of fun and it\u2019s a great way to support small businesses.\u201d\n\nIn the spirit of Christmas, Seacrest baited Obama into signing a duet of Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cAll I Want For Christmas Is You.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want you for my own,\u201d sang an apparently tone-deaf Seacrest, \u201cmore than you could ever know, make my wish come true, baby, all I want for Christmas \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 is you to sign up for health care at HealthCare.gov,\u201d Obama replied in his usual speaking voice.\n\nAside from engaging in holiday chatter, the radio host also complimented Obama on his recent \u201cColbert Report\u201d stint during which the president, of course, attempted to re-sell Obamacare to American Millennials.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m preparing for my next career, laying the groundwork,\u201d Obama laughed. \u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty good about it.\u201d\n\nThe president also insisted that he didn\u2019t \u201crehearse much\u201d for his turn in Stephen Colbert\u2019s chair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to admit, I don\u2019t rehearse much on these things because I figure, if I\u2019m a little spontaneous, it\u2019ll probably end up being a little bit better, and if I practice it won\u2019t be as fun,\u201d explained Obama. \u201cYou know, leave a little room for mistakes.\u201d\n\nWhen he got around to touting the Affordable Care Act, Obama called his championed health care law a \u201creally good deal for a lot of people who don\u2019t have health care coverage.\u201d\n\nHe also alleged that HealthCare.gov \u2014 the Obamacare website that endured an atrocious rollout last time around \u2014 works \u201cflawlessly\u201d today.\n\nIndividuals signing up for health care coverage starting January 1 through Obamacare must sign up by December 15.\n\nIn addition to calling in to Ryan Seacrest\u2019s show, Obama also gave interviews to ESPN Radio\u2019s \u201cThe Herd with Collin Cowherd\u201d and \u201cAfternoon Traffic Jams with Brian Dawson\u201d on Raleigh NCW QOK-FM last week during which he discussed the Obamacare deadline.\n\nListen to the full interview below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "President Obama continued his desperate quest to sound the alarm about the December 15 Obamacare deadline by appearing \"On Air With Ryan Seacrest\" Monday.", "title": "Obama channels Mariah Carey, talks Christmas shopping with Ryan...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 522, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/12/Obama-Christmas-in-Wa_Chal-522x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/12/15/obama-channels-mariah-carey-talks-christmas-shopping-with-ryan-seacrest/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "published_time": "2014-12-15T12:20:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-15T12:20:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "President Obama continued his desperate quest to sound the alarm about the December 15 Obamacare deadline by appearing \u201cOn Air With Ryan Seacrest\u201d Monday.\nIndividuals signing up for health care coverage starting January 1 through Obamacare must sign up by December 15.\nIn addition to plugging the Affordable Care Act, Obama also spoke about his Christmas shopping during the interview, labeling the first lady \u201chard to shop for.\u201d\u201cYou know, Michelle is hard to shop for,\u201d the president explained.\nObama also detailed the tradition during which, on Small Business Saturday, he and his daughters purchase books to gift their relatives on the Christmas holiday.\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty good about it.\u201dThe president also insisted that he didn\u2019t \u201crehearse much\u201d for his turn in Stephen Colbert\u2019s chair."}
