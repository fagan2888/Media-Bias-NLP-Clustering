General Assembly feature various Republicans jockeying for a spot on the November ballot. The March 15 primary includes two Republican contenders for the state House\u2019s 115th District and three for the Senate\u2019s 48th District. The Democrats in these races are unopposed in the primary.\n\nN.C. House 115th District\n\nIn the Republican primary, Black Mountain resident Bob Chilmonik goes up against Fairview\u2019s Frank Moretz for the chance to unseat Democratic incumbent John Ager in November.\n\nChilmonik, who teaches business and computer tech full time at Asheville High School and part time at A-B Tech, has emphasized job growth and reducing corporate taxes to lure businesses to the region.\n\nBob Chilmonik. Republican candidate for N.C. House District 115. Resident of Black Mountain.\n\n\u201cBusinesses are attracted to states that have a low tax structure; modern roads; an experienced, well-trained workforce; and strong public schools,\u201d he says. \u201cThe state overregulates small businesses at the federal, state and local levels with reports, surveys and, in some cases, ridiculous mandates. My goal is to reduce these obstacles by cutting taxes and attracting high-paying jobs to Buncombe County.\u201d\n\nThe educator, who previously worked for Nabisco and Heinz, also wants to restructure public education, emphasizing improved technological resources, competitive compensation packages for teachers and tailoring curricula to individual student needs. Chilmonik also calls for more transparency concerning public records, including those of publicly funded charter schools.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe that open government reduces waste and unnecessary spending,\u201d he says. \u201cThe public is paying the bill and has the right to see how the money is spent and to whom.\u201d\n\nMoretz, a retired anesthesiologist and Air Force veteran who\u2019s a part owner of Highland Brewing Co., has zeroed in on the need for health care reform, job creation, economic growth and more support for public schools statewide.\n\nFrank Moretz. Republican Candidate for N.C. House District 115. Resident of Fairview.\n\n\u201cHealth care accounts for 23 percent of the state budget, and currently, there is only one physician in the General Assembly,\u201d he points out. \u201cLikewise, education accounts for 57 percent of the state budget. I graduated from a public high school and from UNC undergraduate and medical schools, so I know the value of public education.\u201d\n\nMoretz also takes a firm stand on health care, calling for dismantling the federal Affordable Care Act. Although he concedes that \u201cThere are limitations on what can be done on the state level to dismantle the affordable care system, I am letting voters know where I stand \u2026 so they can understand the principles I will use in any related opportunities.\u201d Health care reform, he maintains, must involve all levels, from patient to government, working together.\n\nSimilarly, he believes public education must fit the community each school serves. \u201cAre the educational needs of a student in a rural school the same as those of one in an urban school?\u201d Moretz asks. \u201cThe quality of education should be the same for all locations, but the curriculum should vary according to the students\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nHe also favors eliminating restrictions on businesses to stimulate job growth and wage increases for workers. If elected, Moretz says he would work to persuade \u201csmall, environmentally conscious businesses to locate here\u201d through improved tax and regulatory policies.\n\nN.C. Senate District 48\n\nIn this race, three Republican candidates are facing off for the chance to lock horns with Democratic contender Norman Bossert, who\u2019s running unopposed. All four contenders are setting their sights on the seat long held by Senate fixture Tom Apodaca, who\u2019s retiring after 12 years of service.\n\nRepublican Dennis Justice, a welder at Thermo Fisher Scientific who\u2019s a former president of the Henderson County Republican Men\u2019s Club, seeks to redefine some of his party\u2019s typical positions. \u201cI decided to run for state Senate to help restore the concept of \u2018Lincoln conservatism\u2019 to the Republican Party,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m aghast that the party leadership only seems to fight for more debt and corporate welfare.\u201d\n\nDennis Justice. Republican candidate for N.C. Senate District 48. Resident of Fletcher.\n\nJustice opposes the amendment to the state constitution banning same-sex marriage, supports legalizing medical marijuana and wants to abolish for-profit prisons. Lincoln, he maintains, \u201cwould be aghast at how the party has made homosexuals the \u2018boogeyman\u2019 for everything wrong in America. The issue is not whether I personally agree with a lifestyle: The issue is about rights.\u201d\n\nIf elected, Justice says he\u2019d focus on wiser spending in Raleigh, better teacher pay and mental health care, as well as funding for an arts center in downtown Asheville and a concrete dome arena at the WNC Agricultural Center.\n\n\u201cWhen the Carolina Panthers can get $87.5 million from Charlotte taxpayers and we can\u2019t get funding for a decent arts center in Asheville, we have a problem,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the danger of the \u2018overlord mentality\u2019 in Raleigh. There\u2019s too many people in power who placate the \u2018I\u2019ve got mine\u2019 crowd. The reality is, we have to find a way to work together or we\u2019ll lose representation in Western North Carolina after the next census.\u201d\n\nLisa Baldwin. Republican candidate for N.C. Senate District 48. Resident of Fletcher.\n\nRepublican Lisa Baldwin, a columnist for The Tribune Papers and a former Buncombe County school board member, says her familiarity with the state\u2019s educational system and government, and her devotion to \u201cpreserving our precious liberty and freedom for the next generation,\u201d make her the ideal candidate for the 48th District.\n\nBaldwin advocates free market educational reform, giving students more choice in what schools they attend, and rejecting the Common Core educational standards. \u201cCommunity colleges are seeing remediation rates in excess of 50 percent,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is imperative to replace Common Core with higher academic standards and encourage vocational \u2018schools within a school,\u2019 such as health care or STEM academies within local high schools.\u201d\n\nTo stimulate private sector job growth, Baldwin, a former economist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, also calls for lowering taxes and reducing regulation of businesses unless it would affect public safety. \u201cSpecifically, I would like to see the 4 percent corporate income tax rate eliminated and personal income tax rates continue to go down,\u201d she says, adding that E-Verify laws and the Protect North Carolina Workers Act must be enforced.\n\nEndorsed by the N.C. Police Benevolent Association and recipient of the John Locke Foundation\u2019s 2012 Leadership in Public Service Award, Baldwin supports Second Amendment gun rights and would also push to implement zero-based budgeting for government agencies, forcing them to focus on core services. Citing biblical principles, Baldwin is pro-life and favors traditional marriage.\n\nChuck Edwards. Republican candidate for N.C. Senate District 48. Resident of Flat Rock.\n\nThe third candidate in this race, Flat Rock resident Chuck Edwards, says he\u2019s chosen to run to fill a vacancy \u201cthat requires the need for strong leadership to effectively represent WNC in Raleigh.\u201d\n\nEdwards, who owns seven McDonald\u2019s franchises in the region and serves on the board of directors of Entegra Bank, says, \u201cI\u2019m the only candidate with real-world experience and involvement to grow the economy, create jobs, and develop and achieve large budgets.\u201d He advocates \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d in Raleigh, noting, \u201cMy business experience has taught me that efficiency measures, cost-benefit analysis and accountability must be in place in order to reduce spending. I intend to look for these things and work to install them where they are not present.\u201d\n\nIf elected, Edwards would also seek to \u201cget the politics out of\u201d the state educational system and \u201callow educators do their jobs\u201d by replacing the Common Core standards, improving students\u2019 workplace readiness, raising the pay for high-performing teachers and expanding school choice.\n\nA graduate of Blue Ridge Community College, Edwards says a key part of his platform is \u201cbeing sure our voice is loudly recognized in Raleigh. I have spent my life building the economy and creating jobs in my own company, those I\u2019ve been hired to help direct, and many organizations to which I belong. Any candidate will tell you they can do these things, but there is no replacement for actually having demonstrated the ability.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two hotly contested local races for seats in the N.C.
