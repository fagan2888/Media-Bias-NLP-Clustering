Iran accused the Obama administration of lying after it touted its terms as a step toward halting Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\n\nIt\u2019s all reminiscent of Pelosi\u2019s 2010 statement regarding the Affordable Care Act:\n\n\u201cBut we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it, away from the fog of controversy,\u201d she said of the legislation.\n\nOthers thought so also. Here are a few examples:\n\n@thehill @NancyPelosi the old bag should retire. Why not pass it to see what's in it? And no, we haven't forgotten!! pic.twitter.com/fJ8ouXqMVy \u2014 Aaron cornett (@123aaroncornett) April 9, 2015\n\n@thehill She should vote for and pass the bill so she can find out what is in it. \u2014 Sergeant Hulka (@Hulka_Sgt) April 9, 2015\n\n@thehill We know witch, gotta pass it to know whats in it, you stupid freaking moron. You, & the rest of your kind need to get the hell out \u2014 Joanie CPC (@sunybandrick) April 9, 2015\n\n@politico But of course. We must pass it to find out what's in it. Like her head. We must break it open to find out what's in it. \u2014 Jeff Gully (@jeffgully49) April 9, 2015\n\n@thehill @RickCo01 Pelosi is an idiot. She needs to be removed from the house and retired before she can do anymore damage to the country \u2014 Matt Diaz (@matt831) April 9, 2015\n\n@politico the wicked witch of the west doing what she normally does \u2014 Steve (@dididoitright) April 9, 2015\n\nPelosi\u2019s statement continued:\n\n\u201cIn the weeks ahead, we must give this diplomatic framework room to succeed so that we can judge a June 30th agreement on its merits,\u201d she said.\n\nOne thing we do know that wasn\u2019t a part of the deal was Iran\u2019s ballistic missiles. Discussion of a nuclear delivery system was off the table, according to CNS News.\n\nAnd assuming a final deal is hammered out when June 30 arrives, what then? Continuing with the Obamacare analogy, will we hear the president tell Iran, \u201cIf you like your nukes, you can keep your nukes? And will he mean it this time?\n\nBe sure to also check out:\n\nVideo: President Obama uses Easter breakfast to take a jab at Christians\n\nJudge Napolitano slams out-of-control Dem governor: \u2018Who does this thug think he is?\u2019", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi sided with the administration on the Iranian nuclear arms deal Wednesday, by announcing her opposition to congressional approval of its terms.
