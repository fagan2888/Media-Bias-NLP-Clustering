Raise the Minimum Wage\n\nBy Tina Dupuy\n\nSay you\u2019re philosophically opposed to food stamps. Let\u2019s say you feel better about yourself by calling those who\u2019ve hit hard times freeloading parasites. Suppose the very idea someone somewhere may be cheating the system is enough for you to support snatching all subsidized sandwiches out of the hands of your fellow Americans. Imagine that right in the middle of the Great Recession you think feeding the hungry is actually hurting the poor and discouraging them from working. Let\u2019s pretend\u2014hypothetically\u2014the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is one of the government programs you\u2019d most like to see cut or dissolved altogether. Let\u2019s suppose you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019s disgusted by the whole thing. \u201cGet a job!\u201d you mutter at the TV when the food stamp issue is broadcast into your home.\n\nThen you should be for raising the minimum wage!\n\nThere are 46.2 million impoverished citizens in this country. That\u2019s more than the populations of Tunisia, Greece, Portugal, Switzerland and Ireland combined. Of these 46.2 million, about 10.4 million are the working poor. The others are largely elderly, disabled or children.\n\nThe most recent data tells us 10.4 million Americans work and yet can\u2019t feed themselves or their families. Why? Because working doesn\u2019t work. Working isn\u2019t the solution to hunger because work doesn\u2019t pay enough to buy food AND shelter. Raising the minimum wage to the proposed $10.10 an hour would mean a person with a full time job and one dependent child would no longer meet the requirements for food stamp eligibility. Working could effectively get people out of poverty: A novel concept.\n\nCurrently the ideologically pure right wing thinks food stamps are a disincentive to work and a minimum wage raise will kill jobs. Their hope is to keep wages so low you can\u2019t live on them while also cutting food stamps. It\u2019s where philosophy shatters on the frayed edge of facts on the ground. It\u2019s not realistic\u2014it\u2019s just Republican.\n\nThe right wing has shed its once storied pragmatism for a new outraged ostrich-with-its-head-in-the-ground approach to public policy. They\u2019re against abortion AND family planning; against the national debt AND for tax cuts; against Obamacare AND against socialized medicine (google it). So when you ask a Republican lawmaker what their ideas are to fix pressing issues Americans face every day they just squawk, \u201cBenghazi!\u201d \u201cLawless!\u201d and hide their head back in their proverbial burrow.\n\nAn easy way to reduce food stamp dependency is to raise the minimum wage. A Pew Research study noted, \u201cNearly 21.3 million U.S. workers (or 16.4 percent of the workforce) would be directly affected by raising the minimum wage to $10.10 by July 2015.\u201d\n\nAnd if 21.3 million workers and their families have new spending power\u2014it\u2019s good for business. Walmart, which depends on food stamps to largely feed their workforce, saw a negative impact on their profits from the cuts to the program last November. If they were forced by government decree to pay their workers enough to buy food at Walmart with their wages (instead of EBT cards), it would be a positive impact to Walmart\u2019s bottom line.\n\nIf food stamps are something you in your gut just don\u2019t like, then you would naturally support an initiative to reduce dependency on that program. Since poor shaming has had little impact on making the poor less poor perhaps we should try another tactic.\n\nTell Congress to raise the minimum wage.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2014 TinaDupuy.com, distributed exclusively by Cagle Cartoons newspaper syndicate.
