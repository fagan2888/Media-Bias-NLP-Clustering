Evans of Wilcox County, Ala., said that investigators had recovered the bodies of the children, all 1 to 8 years old, in a rural area near Camden, more than an hour southwest of Montgomery.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s department in Lexington County, S.C., where the children were reported missing by their mother on Sept. 3, identified the father as Timothy Ray Jones Jr. A department spokesman said Mr. Jones, 32, would be charged initially with unlawful neglect of a child by a legal custodian, though officials expected to file additional charges.\n\nSheriff Evans said investigators had begun an intense search in his county early Tuesday after Mississippi officials, who had found blood and bleach when they detained the father on Saturday at a motor vehicle checkpoint in Smith County, contacted them with information about the children.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe investigators called me last night and told me what the suspect had said: that he had dropped those kids off in a rural area in Wilcox County or Butler County,\u201d Sheriff Evans said in a telephone interview.\n\nBut investigators were at first unable to find the children, and the Mississippi authorities soon took the father, who had been arrested at the Smith County checkpoint on drunken driving and drug charges, to Alabama to help locate them.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cHe showed us pretty much where it was,\u201d said Sheriff Evans, who added that officials were still processing the scene, at least 200 yards off a highway, on Tuesday night and were awaiting forensics specialists. A South Carolina coroner was preparing to transport the bodies to Lexington County.\n\nSheriff Charlie Crumpton of Smith County, where Mr. Jones was being held on Tuesday night, said in a statement that the bodies had been decomposing in individual garbage bags when they were found.\n\nEarlier, Sheriff Crumpton told The Clarion Ledger, in Jackson, Miss., that he could not \u201cimagine what goes through a man\u2019s head when he does this; it was a horrible, horrible crime.\u201d\n\nThe Lexington County sheriff\u2019s department said in a statement that Mr. Jones had joint custody of the children after a divorce and that his former wife had sometimes \u201cbeen unable to contact her ex-husband.\u201d\n\nHe had told neighbors, the department said, that he planned to move with the children to a different state.\n\nThe disappearance of the children set off a search that included the F.B.I., and Sheriff Evans said officials had determined that Mr. Jones withdrew money from an Alabama bank on Saturday morning.\n\nSheriff Evans said the discovery of the bodies was deeply unsettling in his impoverished county of 11,300, where months often pass without homicides.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis is our first time ever having anything like this here in Wilcox County,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost unheard-of here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140909214214, "twitter": {"description": "A South Carolina man, identified as Timothy Ray Jones Jr., led the authorities on Tuesday to the
