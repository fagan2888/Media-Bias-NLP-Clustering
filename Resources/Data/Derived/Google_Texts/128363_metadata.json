Despite his leadership responsibilities, Feinberg has tried to see patients every day, telling the publication he makes regular rounds in Geisinger's clinics, labs and the emergency department to ask whether there's anything he can do personally to make the experience easier for patients and their families. That kind of in-person connection \"drives everything,\" Feinberg told Healthcare IT News.\n\nGeisinger also recently unveiled its ProvenExperience initiative, which provides refunds to patients who feel their care experience lacked \"kindness and compassion.\" This guarantee, Feinberg said in the article, started out as \"Proven Heart,\" a program that guaranteed a price for heart surgery and pledged not to charge any patients in the event of a readmission, infection or complication. The provider soon expanded this \"warranty\" to surgeries for acute hip and lung conditions and from there to chronic condition care.\n\nWhile these initiatives were in place when Feinberg took the helm, he told the publication that work still remained to improve patients' comfort and satisfaction, which he felt Geisinger lost sight of amid intense growth. This observation led to the idea of ProvenExperience, he said. Since rolling out the initiative, Geisinger has refunded about $80,000, with the response overwhelmingly positive so far, according to Feinberg. The criticisms the system has encountered have generally focused on care coordination and communication.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the interview\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nGeisinger will refund money to dissatisfied patients\n\nHow do hospital CEOs define population health?\n\nDo hospitals care too much about patient satisfaction scores?\n\nHow to improve patient satisfaction in the ER [Interview]\n\nFor patient satisfaction surveys, the details count\n\nWhy Geisinger's care coordination strategies are a model for the US", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital executives who want their organizations to deliver top patient experience must engage directly with patients, the CEO of Geisinger Health System tells Healthcare IT News.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospital executives who want their organizations to deliver top patient experience must engage directly with patients, the CEO of Geisinger Health System tells Healthcare IT News.", "title": "One year into tenure, Geisinger CEO praises patient engagement, satisfaction initiatives", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/one-year-tenure-geisinger-ceo-praises-patient-engagement-satisfaction-initi/2016-04-13", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,care quality,David Feinberg,Geisinger Health System,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Patient Experience,patient satisfaction,Population Health", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction"}, "article_summary": "How to improve patient satisfaction in the ER [Interview]For patient satisfaction surveys, the details countWhy Geisinger's care coordination strategies are a model for the US\nHospital executives who want their organizations to deliver top patient experience must engage directly with patients, the CEO of Geisinger Health System tells Healthcare IT News.\nDo hospitals care too much about patient satisfaction scores?\nGeisinger also recently unveiled its ProvenExperience initiative, which provides refunds to patients who feel their care experience lacked \"kindness and compassion.\"\nThat kind of in-person connection \"drives everything,\" Feinberg told Healthcare IT News."}
