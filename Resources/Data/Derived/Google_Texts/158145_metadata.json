( Trevor L. Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 Saturday was just the first of 18 Mountain West games for Colorado State and Boise State.\n\nBut with the Rams and Broncos both among the conference's top title contenders, the early January game felt much more like one in mid March. And sure enough, there was some madness at the end as Jamie Patrick's 3-pointer in the final minute lifted CSU to a 68-64 win at Moby Arena.\n\nPatrick's go-ahead 3, off a drive-and-dish by Elin Gustavsson with 17 seconds left to break a 64-all tie, gave the senior guard a season-best 27 points.\n\nBut it was her play on both ends of the floor that stood out as Patrick helped limit BSU leading scorer Brooke Pahukoa to just four points and without a field goal (0 for 3) for the first time all season.\n\nJamie Patrick's go-ahead 3 in the final minute pic.twitter.com/3TnDzAMRUs \u2014 Sean Star (@seanvstar) January 2, 2016\n\n\"We asked Jamie to guard their leading scorer tonight, and Jamie's one of our best offensive players. That's always a tough ask,\" said CSU coach Ryun Williams, whose team improved to 11-1 overall and 1-0 in the MW. \"The 27 is special, but that four, that's rockstar status right there. That's a big-time day at the office by Jamie Patrick. Can't be more proud of that young lady.\"\n\nWith the Broncos (7-5, 0-1) switching to a zone defense and the Rams' ability to penetrate and kick, Patrick had open looks on the perimeter all afternoon. She finished 10 for 23 from the field, including 5 for 14 from 3, so she wasn't necessarily that efficient.\n\nBut she sure was clutch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You can't say, 'Man, I missed that one.' It's gotta be, 'I'm making the next one.' As a shooter, you know you can make those shots, so you just keep shooting,\" she said. \"This year I've kinda been up and down, but (my teammates) always say, 'Jamie we believe in you. You've got this.'\"\n\nPatrick wasn't the only Ram with a short memory. A few possessions prior to the game-winner, Gustavsson knocked down a 3 from the top of the arc to tie it at 64. Before that shot, Gustavsson was just 1 for 11 from the field. She finished with 14 points thanks largely to a 9-for-10 performance at the free-throw line.\n\nCSU guard Keyora Wharry helped provide a much-needed boost in the second quarter Saturday. (Trevor L. Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nThe Rams were forced to come back in the closing minutes despite leading by 15 in the third quarter. Boise State guard Yaiza Rodriguez was the biggest reason why, scoring 13 of her team-high 19 in the second half.\n\nPlaying for the first time in nearly two weeks, it took a little while for the Rams to shake off some rust, shooting just 4 of 14 in the first quarter in falling behind 16-10.\n\nBut like they have all season, the Rams leaned on a dominant second quarter to turn things around. CSU began the frame on an 11-2 run to erase the deficit, a run capped by seven straight points by Keyora Wharry, who finished with 12 points and four rebounds.\n\n\"My first five minutes are a little rough, but once I settle down and get going, I can see a lot better. I noticed that they were like hugging, so I saw a wide-open gap every single time, so I just started driving it,\" Wharry said.\n\n\"It gives us a little boost. Plus, last year when we went there, we lost, so we're just returning the favor.\"\n\nCSU plays it first conference road game Wednesday at UNLV.\n\nSean Star: 970-669-5050, sstar@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/seanvstar\n\nRams 68, Broncos 64\n\nAt Moby Arena\n\nBOISE STATE (7-5, 0-1)\n\nShaw 5-14 4-4 15, Askew 5-10 0-0 10, Rodriguez 7-12 1-1 19, Hermida 2-5 0-0 5, Brooke.
