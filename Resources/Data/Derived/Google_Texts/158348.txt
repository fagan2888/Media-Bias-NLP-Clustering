Before the end of the first week of the new session of Congress, where Republicans control both the House and Senate, a Republican congressman has already filed legislation that would repeal Obamacare. The pro-life community opposed Obamacare because it includes abortion funding with tax dollars, the HHS mandate forcing employers to cover abortion-causing drugs, and concerns about rationing health care.

Congressman Steve Kin, an Iowa Republican, filed the bill to repeal the controversial law.

“In the wake of the 2014 mid-term elections it has become clear that the American people overwhelmingly reject the President’s failed healthcare law,” said King. “The botched implementation of ObamaCare has been nothing short of a complete failure when millions of people had their health insurance plans cancelled because their grandfathered plans were in violation of ObamaCare’s ‘essential health benefits.’ For several years now, conservatives in Congress have warned the American people of the damage this law has done to our personal health insurance. Unfortunately, our warnings have come true. ObamaCare was, is, and will always be dreadful public policy.

King continued: “Every Republican who was elected to Congress during the 2014 mid-term vowed to oppose ObamaCare during their respective campaigns. Now that Republicans have control of both the House and the Senate we must take swift action to keep pressure on the White House by repealing this unconstitutional and egregious law. My bill is the answer: full 100% repeal of ObamaCare ‘as if such Act had not been enacted’.”

When he signed the Obamacare bill into law, President Barack Obama promised the American people that Obamacare would not pay for abortions — going as far as signing an executive order to that effect. But a GAO report shows he misled Americans.

The GAO report also found that nearly all of the insurance issuers sampled are not itemizing the required separate abortion surcharge on its bills – confirming that the Obama Administration is ignoring the law’s abortion accounting gimmick.

“In an 11th hour ploy to garner a remnant of pro-life congressional Democrats absolutely needed for passage of ObamaCare, the President issued an executive order on March 24, 2010 that said: ‘the Act maintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to newly created health insurance exchanges’,” said Congressman Chris Smith, co-chairman of the Bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus. “It turns out that those ironclad promises made by the President himself are absolutely untrue.”
