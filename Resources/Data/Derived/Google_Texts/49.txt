The Arkansas City Police Department has shot and killed a coyote in the city limits that was showing obvious signs of rabies.

It happened Sunday near 6th Street and Maple, outside of the First Church of God in Christ in Arkansas City. Captain Mark McCaslin said they received the report of a coyote acting strangely and no apparent fear of humans. The animal appeared to be unable to keep his head up and continued to bob its head up and down.

Officers watched the animal for over an hour. The observed the coyote profusely salivating as well as circling the same spot before sitting down and eating snow.

McCaslin said the coyote also had a build up of discharge around its eyes and snout. The animal also remained in the same spot and didn't react to the officers nearby. A neighbor also reported that the coyote had jumped out at them the night before while they were out walking.

Officers contacted the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks and relayed their observations. Based of the information along with the close proximity of homes with children and the fact that the church was in service, the department advised police to put they coyote down.

There were no reports of anyone being injured or attacked by the animal.
