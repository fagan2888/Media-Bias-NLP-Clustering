Although it is traditionally held on Rodgers' death date, May 26. But this year, the foundation rescheduled the event so more of his family could take part. Jimmie Rodgers' great-granddaughter Dixie Haslett laid the wreath Saturday morning, and she says she feels very blessed to do so.\n\n\"When you get down here, all the musicians know a JR song. You feel the love, you see it everywhere you go,\" she says. \"There's a picture here and there. It's a great honor.\"\n\nMany of the guests traveled from as far as Texas or Georgia to attend the ceremony. The group honored Jimmie Rodgers with a few of his songs before leaving.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Fans and family of Jimmie Rodgers came together today to honor the musician with a wreath-laying at his gravesite.", "language": "english", "author": "Candace Barnette", "og": {"description": "Fans and family of Jimmie Rodgers came together today to honor the musician with a wreath-laying at his gravesite.", "title": "Wreath-Laying Ceremony Honors Jimmie Rodgers", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Wreath-Laying-Ceremony-Honors-Jimmie-Rodgers-259658181.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/AAD/8AD/AAD8AD0FEDC843E4A196FA412B3FF69B", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/AB9/665/AB9665EAFAFA4622BB7C41EBB06641CB.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Fans and family of Jimmie Rodgers came together today to honor the musician with a wreath-laying at his gravesite.", "creator": "@newscenter11", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Wreath-Laying-Ceremony-Honors-Jimmie-Rodgers-259658181.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/wreath+22.jpg", "title": "Wreath-Laying Ceremony Honors Jimmie Rodgers", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Wreath-Laying Ceremony Honors Jimmie Rodgers", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "WreathLaying Ceremony Honors Jimmie Rodgers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc19\"", "article_summary": "The wreath-laying tradition started in 1953 when the Jimmie Rodgers festival first began.\nFans and family of Jimmie Rodgers came together Saturday to honor the musician with a wreath-laying at his grave site.\nThe group honored Jimmie Rodgers with a few of his songs before leaving.\nJimmie Rodgers' great-granddaughter Dixie Haslett laid the wreath Saturday morning, and she says she feels very blessed to do so.\nMany of the guests traveled from as far as Texas or Georgia to attend the ceremony."}
