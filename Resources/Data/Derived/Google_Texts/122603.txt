JACKSON, La. (AP) - A Mississippi woman has been charged with helping to smuggle synthetic marijuana into a Louisiana prison.

East Feliciana Parish Sheriffâ€™s Office spokesman Detective Kevin Garig tells The Advocate (http://bit.ly/1YlfWcj) that 38-year-old Lashonda Lee of Woodville, Mississippi, obtained the synthetic marijuana and hid it in a container of red beans that a guard brought into Dixon Correctional Institute. Lee was arrested Thursday on charges that she introduced contraband into a prison and was distributing illegal drugs. She was jailed in East Feliciana Parish with bail set at $60,000.

The guard, 33-year-old April Lemon of McComb, Mississippi, was arrested Monday for introducing contraband and released on $10,000 bond.

Garig says investigators found Lee, a former Dixon employee, had been in contact with inmate Tyrone Stevens, who was supposed to receive the drugs.
