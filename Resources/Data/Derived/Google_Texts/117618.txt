Via the Daily Caller comes a new word from gun control liberals that should be added to their growing dictionary of terms that do not exist. Yesterday, California Democratic Rep. Loretta Sanchez warned about something called “multi-automatic weapons” flowing into the state:

Appearing on MSNBC Live with Tamron Hall on Thursday, Sanchez made up a term to describe a gun while blasting congressional inaction. “The reality is that Congress has been trying to get up some of these issues [relating to mental health] for the last five years, and we haven’t been able to,” she said We let the assault weapons ban, which was led by our senator Dianne Feinstein, we let that lapse. So you know, multiautomatic round weapons are easily available, even though not in California, but they can cross the state line, as you know,” Sanchez insisted.

Sanchez was a professional at naming everything on the gun control wish list–like waiting periods and closing the (phantom) gun show loophole­. Regardless, this isn’t the first time a liberal just made up words when talking about gun control. In January of 2014, California State Sen. Kevin de Leon infamously warned the public about ghost guns that “has the ability with a .30 caliber clip to disperse with 30 bullets within a half a second. Thirty magazine clip in half a second.” Yes, mockery ensued. Last August, CNN’s Don Lemon didn’t know the difference between semi-automatic and automatic.

If liberals want to brush up on their firearm lexicon, the National Rifle Association is just one phone call away.
