KDHE says most E. coli is harmless, however some can make people very sick, especially those young and old.\n\nHendrick hopes this is either an isolated incident or a bad sample.\n\n\"Until they complete their testing and find a cause I don't think there's a huge reason to panic just do what they ask to do and you'll be fine,\" he said.\n\nUntil this boil advisory is lifted, Pretty Prairie residents are asked to:\n\n1. Boil water for a minute before drinking or using for food preparation.\n\n2. Throw away ice cubes and don't use ice from a household automatic icemaker.\n\n3. Water used for bathing doesn't generally need to be boiled, but parents are asked to supervise their young children to make sure water is not ingested.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A boil water advisory issued for the town of Pretty Prairie last week has been lifted", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "A boil water advisory issued for the town of Pretty Prairie last week has been lifted", "title": "UPDATE: Boil water advisory lifted in Pretty Prairie", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Boil-advisory-issued-in-Pretty-Prairie-374393301.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/516/23E/51623EB236F84544B34B8431AEA4A1B0", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/83E/1F2/83E1F2928D6148E28BE6C55F338799B5.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A boil water advisory issued for the town of Pretty Prairie last week has been lifted", "title": "UPDATE: Boil water advisory lifted in Pretty Prairie", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Boil-advisory-issued-in-Pretty-Prairie-374393301.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Boil+Water9.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Boil water advisory lifted in Pretty Prairie", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Boil water advisory lifted"}, "article_summary": "A boil water advisory issued for the town of Pretty Prairie last week has been lifted.\nA boil water advisory has been issued for the town of Pretty Prairie after a water sample turned up positive for E. coli.\nUntil this boil advisory is lifted, Pretty Prairie residents are asked to:1.\nWhile this is just a precaution until further tests can confirm the results, residents are asked to boil water before consuming.\nBoil water for a minute before drinking or using for food preparation."}
