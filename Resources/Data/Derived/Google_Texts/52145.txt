The finale of True Detectives on HBO was supposed to be a fun event for subscribers of the network, instead, the company’s digital service, HBO GO, failed, leaving thousands of fans to vent their frustration on Twitter.

The HBO GO platform typically airs shows in real-time, allowing users to login and watch. Unfortunately, the popularity of the show caused the software to fail at the start of the 9 p.m. East Coast stream.

Immediately following out outage the official Twitter account for HBO GO sent out the following tweet:

Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon. — HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014

Fans reacted to the outage exactly how we would expect fans to react:

Next week on True Detective: Marty and Rust frantically scramble to log onto HBO Go to learn what happened this week on True Detective. — Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) March 10, 2014

On the plus side, the HBO go outage is helping family togetherness, as people all over call their parents to see if they changed a password — Michael Schaffer (@michaelschaffer) March 10, 2014

This is what we all get for borrowing other people's HBO Go accounts. — Will Frasure (@WillFrasure) March 10, 2014

And of course someone had to use the outage to attack ObamaCare:

HBO Go has turned into the ObamaCare website of online TV portals, apparently. THE YELLOW KING STRIKES AGAIN. #TrueDetective — Ryan McGee (@TVMcGee) March 10, 2014
