At 4-foot-9-inches and 96 lbs., does the former Jersey Shore party girl have something to worry about?\n\nAccording to Rush University Medical Center, Polizzi is at her ideal weight or even a couple of pounds over. A chart used to help people calculate their body mass index (BMI) shows that the ideal weight for a female at Polizzi's height is between 77 and 94 lbs.\n\nPolizzi, who was recently picked as a contestant for season 17 of Dancing With the Stars, was not too pleased with the scrutiny that she received from critics. \"People are jerks,\u201d she told In Touch. \u201cI don't look emaciated \u2014 I look healthy!\"\n\nWeighing 146 lbs. during the taping of MTV\u2019s Jersey Shore, Polizzi credits reaching her weight loss goal to strength and cardio training with her own personal trainer. Her new life as a mother has also made a difference. \u201cI hate drinking now. I\u2019d rather be with my son!\u201d she said.\n\nPolizzi initially fired back at critics when an Instagram picture of herself, toned and flexing, was accompanied by the caption \u201cToo skinny my a** *FIT.\u201d\n\n\"My arms still jiggle when I wave! I'm 4-foot-9, which is the size of a third grader, so weighing 96 pounds is normal for me,\u201d she told In Touch. \"People ask me why I'm still working out \u2014 I'll gain the weight back if I don't.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nicole snooki polizzi, 96 pounds, 50 pounds, weight loss", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "\"Jersey Shore\" star Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi said that there's nothing wrong with her 50-lb. weight loss and that she looks \"healthy.\"", "title": "Snooki Defends Dramatic 50-Pound Weight Loss: 'I Don't Look Emaciated, I Look Healthy!'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/snooki-defends-50-pound-weight-loss-saying-i-dont-look-emaciated-i-look-healthy-96-pound-body-255825", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/nicole-snooki-polizzi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Jersey Shore\" star Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi said that there's nothing wrong with her 50-lb. weight loss and that she looks \"healthy.\"", "title": "Snooki Defends Dramatic 50-Pound Weight Loss: 'I Don't Look Emaciated, I Look Healthy!'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/snooki-defends-50-pound-weight-loss-saying-i-dont-look-emaciated-i-look-healthy-96-pound-body-255825", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/nicole-snooki-polizzi.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/06/nicole-snooki-polizzi.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-06T12:24:18-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-06T12:24:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"Jersey Shore\" star Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi said that there's nothing wrong with her 50-lb. weight loss and that she looks \"healthy.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde4e7\"", "article_summary": "\"Jersey Shore\" star Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi said that there's nothing wrong with her 50-lb.\nweight loss and that she looks \"healthy.\"\nduring the taping of MTV\u2019s Jersey Shore, Polizzi credits reaching her weight loss goal to strength and cardio training with her own personal trainer.\nibtimes.comReality TV star Nicole \u201cSnooki\u201d Polizzi recently unveiled her dramatic 50-lb.\nAt 4-foot-9-inches and 96 lbs., does the former Jersey Shore party girl have something to worry about?"}
