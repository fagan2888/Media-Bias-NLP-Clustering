Built to boost visitation at Rocky Mountain National Park, Trail Ridge Road needs re-paving. Rocky Mountain National Park officials on Sunday announced that drivers should expect 15-minute delays starting Wednesday as road crews go to work.

Tundra weather conditions permitting, re-surfacing work will continue through Sept. 1 along a 14-mile segment between Lava Cliffs and the Colorado River Trailhead, park officials said. Traffic will be squeezed onto one lane.

Road crews are not expected to work during weekends, park spokeswoman Kyle Patterson said.

The road workers planned to perform “fog sealing” at the end of August to increase durability of the road. The Timber Creek Campground will close Aug. 17- 20, park officials said. And a parking lot in the tundra at Lava Cliffs will be closed temporarily for storage of construction materials.

Trail Ridge Road cuts through the heart of the park, reaching an elevation of 12,183 feet — the highest continuous road in the United States. It is closed during winter.
