Tom Corbett sought to keep the state's Children's Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, intact under the federal government's health care law. Federal regulators did not grant that exception, meaning more than 50,000 children could be placed under Medicaid, said Roseanne Placey, spokeswoman for the state Insurance Department. More than 180,000 children are enrolled in CHIP.\n\nMedicaid is the federal insurance program for low-income people. Pennsylvania, under the late Democratic Gov. Robert Casey, was the first state to establish a program for uninsured children.\n\nCorbett's top insurance regulator, Michael Consedine, said the federal response is disappointing. He said the administration will explore options suggested by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, such as a phased-in transition.\n\nThe requirement takes effect on Jan. 1.\n\nKids enrolled in CHIP who need extensive medical care will move into Medicaid, Placey said. Medicaid provides broader benefits than the state program, she said, but changing programs means many no longer will be able to see the same provider. Some doctors do not want to participate in Medicaid, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate there could be disruptions in relationships with providers,\u201d Placey said.\n\nA survey in January found CHIP parents rated satisfaction with their child's personal doctor at 8 or higher on a scale of 0 to 10. Specialist care was rated the same, Placey said.\n\n\u201cI know that a lot of our families have children on CHIP now. We'll have to wait and see how it plays out,\u201d said Carolyn Pschirer, director of services for North Hills Community Outreach. \u201cPersonally, I think that every child should be insured. Will every child now under CHIP continue to be insured? I don't know. That's my concern.\u201d\n\nMany states prepared for the transition by ensuring Medicaid coverage for older children whose families earn up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, Sebelius said.\n\nSebelius said the move will simplify coverage for low-income families. Advocates for the poor say children are better off under Medicaid.\n\nThe decision comes as Corbett attempts to negotiate with Health and Human Services on overall provisions of the health care act.\n\n\u201cWe are continuing conversations with the federal government, specifically around the governor's interest in instituting common-sense reforms into the Medicaid program,\u201d said Corbett spokeswoman Christine Cronkright.\n\nCorbett has refused to expand the Medicaid program, an option for states under a 2012 Supreme Court decision on the federal law. The expansion would add about 800,000 people to Medicaid. Corbett and some Republican lawmakers insist Pennsylvania taxpayers can't afford the expansion.\n\nThe governor is expected to announce his idea soon for a revised Medicaid program in Pennsylvania.\n\nHe would like reforms \u201csuch as a work-search requirement\u201d to help \u201ctransition those on public assistance into the workforce,\u201d Cronkright said.\n\nCorbett wants \u201ca reasonable premium or co-pays, where appropriate, for able-bodied Pennsylvanians on Medicaid,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we can achieve reforms to our current program, we believe we can increase access to health care options for more Pennsylvanians.\u201d\n\nStaff writer Michael Hasch and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
