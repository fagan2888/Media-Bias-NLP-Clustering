Senate chaplain Barry Black is sick of the partisan bickering that has produced a stalemate in Washington, D.C. So much so that on this week’s episode of Saturday Night Live he prayed for God to “send a flood to Washington and just drown everybody.”

Appearing on the set of “Weekend Update” in one of his infamous bow ties, Black — played by Kenan Thompson — immediately launched into a prayer that Congress would “stop being a bunch of blabbering knuckleheads that go on to the television and spout all kinds of nonsense until you want to slap them across the face with a bag full of quarters.”

Since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, the real Senate chaplain Black has received news coverage for his scathing prayers critiquing Congress.

And his frustration over the lack of a compromise in Washington boiled over in increasingly aggressive prayers on SNL.

Host Seth Meyers asked Black whether he thought his daily prayers have helped improve the static situation within government. Black said he was optimistic about it since Republicans in Congress have been meeting with White House officials. Meyers reminded him that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) promised on Saturday that he would fight even harder to keep the government shutdown until the proper resolution was determined.

The chaplain immediately began to pray.

“Bless and forgive these braying jack***es…,” he prayed. “May they find themselves in a restroom stall devoid of toilet paper, with nothing to use but a receipt from CVS in their wallet — a receipt for a small purchase that they must then tear into small pieces.”

And after learning that a piece of legislation deemed a compromise has very little support, Black resorted to praying for a flood to get rid of everyone in Washington.
