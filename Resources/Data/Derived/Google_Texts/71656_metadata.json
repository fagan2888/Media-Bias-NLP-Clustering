Democrats nationally see Johnson as among the more vulnerable incumbents in their drive to take back the Senate in 2016.\n\nThe FEC documents obtained by Wisconsin Watchdog show Progressives United spending lavishly on airline tickets, rooms at posh hotels and some of the nation\u2019s finest restaurants for its small staff.\n\nFeingold founded the PAC in February 2011 to \u201ccombat the corrupting influence of corporate money in our elections and government,\u201d according to Progressives United\u2019s website. He took a leave of absence from the PAC in July 2013 when he joined the U.S. State Department as President Obama\u2019s envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa.\n\nBefore he did, Progressives United racked up $40,388 on travel-related expenses, FEC documents show. Feingold spent much of 2012 traveling and promoting his book, \u201cWhile America Sleeps.\u201d\n\nThe PAC spent $16,421 on hotels alone while Feingold served as an adviser over the two-year-plus period.\n\nAmong the choice accommodations:\n\nLe Parker Meridien, a luxurious hotel in midtown Manhattan. Progressives United appears to have paid $1,744 for four rooms on April 10, 2012.\n\nOmni Mandalay Hotel, an \u201celegant Asian-themed convention hotel,\u201d with a lakeside pool and spa in Irving, Texas, on Oct. 10, 2012. Progressives United spent $1,435 on lodging there.\n\nHollywood Roosevelt Hotel, a West Hollywood, California, \u201cboutique hotel located along the Walk of Fame, across from the Dolby Theatre. The PAC paid $897 on April 10, 2012, to stay at this \u201chip, upscale hotel.\u201d\n\nIntercontinental Hotel Boston, a \u201clandmark of luxury overlooking Boston\u2019s historic waterfront.\u201d The hotel has been named one of the \u2018Best Hotels in the World\u2019 by Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler magazine. Progressives United dropped over $1,100 at this establishment during four stays in 2012.\n\nThere were nights at some Red Roof Inns and Best Westerns, too, but plenty of stays at four-star hotels along the way.\n\nProgressives United staff enjoyed some good meals, too.\n\nThe PAC paid $585 for eats at 112 Eatery in Minneapolis on Aug. 9, 2011, just as the organization was expanding its footprint as an advocacy nonprofit.\n\nA meal at West Hollywood\u2019s Chateau Marmont, featuring an \u201cidyllic garden terrace,\u201d cost the PAC $261 on April 10, 2012. That same day, Progressives United picked up the tab for dinner at Nobu, a famed Japanese restaurant in West Hollywood.\n\nBut the expensive restaurants and luxury hotels seemed to dry up after Feingold took his leave of absence from Progressives United.\n\nThe PAC spent just $3,097 on travel-related costs from July 2013 to December 2014, according to the FEC documents. Feingold was working for the State Department during that time.\n\n\u201cFor a politician who built a career on championing campaign finance reform, Senator Feingold has a long and hypocritical record of manipulating his own PAC for personal gain,\u201d said Joe Fadness, executive director of the Republican Party of Wisconsin. \u201cThese lavish expenditures are further proof that Progressives United was nothing more than a slush fund that Feingold used to exploit unsuspecting donors to fund his celebrity lifestyle.\u201d\n\nThe state GOP earlier this week blasted Feingold after the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported nearly half of the $7.1 million the PAC has spent since 2011 has funded fundraising campaigns for Progressives United, with a significant share marked for salaries or consulting fees for Feingold, his top aide and eight former staffers.\n\nFeingold\u2019s camp told the newspaper the PAC raised much more money for the Democrat candidates it endorsed through a fundraising portal, but that still means Feingold\u2019s PAC spent more than $3.50 for every $1 it gave, directly or indirectly, to each candidate it supported.\n\nThe campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nProgressives United in May announced it would suspend activities to avoid any possible appearance of conflict, according to WisPolitics.com.\n\nWisconsin Watchdog contacted the number listed for Progressives for Wisconsin. Someone there answered, \u201cRuss for Wisconsin.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Russ Feingold's Progressive United PAC spent more than $40,000 on travel expenditures over two years.", "title": "Feingold's PAC spent lavishly on travel, FEC docs show - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/06/Feingold.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-17T10:08:17+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/224570/russ-feingold-pac-progressives-united/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Democrats,FEC,Federal Election Commission,finance reform,Hollywood,Joe Fadness,Liberal,Manhattan,President Obama's,Progressive United,Republican Party of Wisconsin,Ron Johnson,Russ Feingold,travel", "published_time": "2015-06-17T10:02:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-17T10:08:17+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Russ Feingold's Progressive United PAC spent more than $40,000 on travel expenditures over two years.", "title": "Feingold's PAC spent lavishly on travel, FEC docs show - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/06/Feingold.jpg"}, "creator": "@wiswatchdog", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Russ Feingold's Progressive United PAC spent more than $40,000 on travel expenditures over two years."}, "article_summary": "Feingold spent much of 2012 traveling and promoting his book, \u201cWhile America Sleeps.\u201dThe PAC spent $16,421 on hotels alone while Feingold served as an adviser over the two-year-plus period.\nThe PAC spent just $3,097 on travel-related costs from July 2013 to December 2014, according to the FEC documents.\nProgressives United spent $1,435 on lodging there.\nThat same day, Progressives United picked up the tab for dinner at Nobu, a famed Japanese restaurant in West Hollywood.\nThe documents show Progressives United spent more than $40,000 on travel costs between February 2011 and June 2013, while Feingold served as an adviser to the liberal organization."}
