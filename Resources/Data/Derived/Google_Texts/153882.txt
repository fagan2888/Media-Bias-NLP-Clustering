Tests are underway to determine what caused a giant hole in Meridian's IHOP parking lot.

Mayor Percy Bland says right now, they are still uncertain what caused the sinkhole, but the 30 foot deep chasm does stretch across an area of culvert for the city. The hole has caused a lack of water for many local businesses, which crews are working to fix.

Police officers on scene are asking people to stay away from the area. Public safety director Buck Roberts says he's not sure whether or not to call the hole is a sinkhole, but they hope to start removing the cars trapped inside sometime Monday. Right now, they count at least 12 vehicles in the hole.

Mayor Bland says he is proud of how quickly emergency responders made it to the scene to prevent further damage.
