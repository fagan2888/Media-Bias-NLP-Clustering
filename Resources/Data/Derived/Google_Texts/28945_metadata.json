It is a challenge in today\u2019s health care landscape for primary care doctors, Wilson and others say.\n\nThey are traditionally the first in line to treat a patient and their numbers are declining.\n\n\u201cWhen we look out at our patients, we wonder who\u2019s going to care for them,\u201d said Wilson, president of the 200 member group Private Practice Doctors, which helps to support those who run their own business.\n\n\u201cYoung people don\u2019t want to go into primary care,\u201d he said. \u201cOur system rewards those for doing procedures, not thought process.\u201d\n\nThe nation needs at least 40,000 new primary care doctors in the next seven years to fill in what some say is an anticipated shortage of physicians ready to care for the newly insured under the Affordable Care Act. Primary physicians are those who specialize in family medicine, are internists, or pediatric care.\n\nIn California, 42 of the state\u2019s 58 counties have less than 60 to 80 primary care physicians per 100,000 population, according to a report released last year by the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\nOf all active physicians in the state, 67 percent reported being non-primary care physicians.\n\nAbout 25 percent of medical school graduates go into primary care, and most of those end up working for large health systems, Wilson and others say.\n\nWilson\u2019s practice is by no means in an underserved area, but there are swaths of neighborhoods across Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties, from Avalon to Wilmington, Big Bear to Victorville, where there is only one full time primary care physician for thousands of people. In addition, these same people may be part of the swelling number of retiring Baby Boomers who will likely need more medical attention as they age.\n\nIn the western part of Long Beach, for example, there are 22 full time primary care doctors for 121,507 people, according to figures provided by the Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development. At least 15 more doctors are needed to meet federal standards.\n\nIn the western side of South Central Los Angeles, the situation is even more dire: there are only two full time primary doctors for 93,991 people. At least 28 primary care physicians are needed.\n\nThe 51,330 residents who live within the 310 square miles of the Adelanto/Phelan/Pinon Hills and Victorville Northwest area, are served by five primary care doctors. They need a dozen more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeeking solutions\n\nSolutions proposed to help bolster primary care come from differing viewpoints.\n\nThe California Medical Association wants to build more medical schools and expand opportunities for young doctors.\n\n\u201cObviously, this is a longer term solution, but creating additional medical schools, like the one that opened at U.C. Riverside in August, will help to increase the number of physicians coming into the pipeline,\u201d said Molly Weedn, spokeswoman for the California Medical Association.\n\nThe group also wants to expand the Steve Thompson Loan Repayment Program. Physicians receive up to $105,000 in medical education repayment funds in exchange for a commitment to practice in an underserved area.\n\n\u201cMany students are deterred from entering medical school because of the costs incurred while in school. This program not only encourages students to become physicians, but also helps place them in underserved communities,\u201d Weedn said.\n\nDr. Jo Marie Reilly, an associate professor of clinical family medicine at USC\u2019s Keck School of Medicine, said that while schools and more funding will help, those who train physicians need to step up and encourage students to consider and stay in primary care.\n\nAt USC, 31 percent of this year\u2019s Keck School graduates planned to go into primary care. That is 10 fewer students than last year.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons it\u2019s a challenge in USC is exposure,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cStudents don\u2019t have role models. Not all specialists speak favorably of primary care. They aren\u2019t as well paid.\u201d\n\nTo alleviate that, Reilly used money from a federal grant to start a primary care speciality program at USC, which includes matching students with physician mentors at community clinics.\n\n\u201cI think that medical education really needs to allocate more resources to the training of primary care,\u201d said Reilly, who also cares for patients at California Hospital in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of our challenges at USC.\u201d\n\nSen. Ed Hernandez, D-West Covina, chairman of the state Senate Health Committee and an optometrist, authored three bills, one of which would have expanded the ability of nurse practitioners to help treat patients and ease primary care shortage. The bill died earlier this month,\n\nHernandez has said he will reintroduce the bill.\n\n\u201cThe system we have now is pretty much strained, with the individuals who are uninsured or underinsured using the emergency room,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cNow we\u2019re going to have this influx of patients and the capacity issue hasn\u2019t been addressed.\u201d\n\nThe Inland Empire, San Bernardino and Bakersfield areas all need more primary care, he added.\n\nHernandez said his bills have been met with contention from physicians and the CMA. Those groups have said it would create a fragmented or two-tiered health care system.\n\nPhysicians such as Wilson agree.\n\n\u201cPhysicians are aghast,\u201d he said of the bills. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with nurse practitioners and for handling a cold, they\u2019re great. I have nothing against nurse practitioners under a physician\u2019s supervision.\u201d\n\nBut he said a primary care physician is trained to diagnose almost everything. In one morning, he said, he examined patients for heart disease, urinary obstruction, chest pain, rectal bleeding, high blood pressure, and a leaky heart valve.\n\nHe said physicians will return to primary care if they are rewarded beyond the satisfaction of helping people. That means higher reimbursement rates from Medi-Cal, assistance in maintaining private practices and other incentives. The average debt a medical student will have is $170,000.\n\nIn 2000, at least 60 percent of physicians owned their own practice. By next year it will be 30 percent, Wilson said.\n\n\u201cI love taking care of patients. I\u2019m in an area where I can take time with my patients. But how do you get the best and brightest if you don\u2019t reward them?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Reed Wilson operates his private practice in a city famous for its extravagance and nip/tuck reputation.But despite his Beverly Hills, 90210 address and his proximity to specialists who use scalpels and Botox to break the spell of aging, Wi", "title": "Affordable Care Act: Access to physicians may be limited", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20130921/affordable-care-act-access-to-physicians-may-be-limited", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20130921/NEWS/130929895/AR/0/AR-130929895.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "999px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Affordable Care Act: Access to physicians may be limited"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Dr. Reed Wilson operates his private practice in a city famous for its extravagance and nip/tuck reputation.But despite his Beverly Hills, 90210 address and his proximity to specialists who use scalpels and Botox to break the spell of aging, Wi", "title": "Affordable Care Act: Access to physicians may be limited", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20130921/affordable-care-act-access-to-physicians-may-be-limited", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20130921/NEWS/130929895/AR/0/AR-130929895.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act news, Los Angeles Affordable Care Act news, CA Affordable Care Act news, US Affordable Care Act news, world Affordable Care Act news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f2e\"", "article_summary": "Of all active physicians in the state, 67 percent reported being non-primary care physicians.\nAt least 28 primary care physicians are needed.\nIt is a challenge in today\u2019s health care landscape for primary care doctors, Wilson and others say.\nPrimary physicians are those who specialize in family medicine, are internists, or pediatric care.\nHe said physicians will return to primary care if they are rewarded beyond the satisfaction of helping people."}
