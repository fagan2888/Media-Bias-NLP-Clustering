“As the healthcare marketplace consolidates and health systems are engaged in a retail style battle for patient loyalty and collections, innovative revenue cycle strategies focused on the patient financial experience offer a unique competitive advantage,” said Corey Meyer, director of patient access at Lancaster General Health.

A recent survey, he said, found that 93 percent of patients who liked the billing process were happy with their clinical care, whereas only 63 percent of those who didn’t like the billing process reported being satisfied with care.

The following presentation explores innovations reshaping patient revenue cycle performance. To increase patient satisfaction results, Lancaster Health deployed a new integrated engagement and payments platform that connects the patient’s financial experience, from their first hospital interaction through to their last.

Those engagement tools include the creation of a user-friendly experience, from estimates to payment; coordinating paper and digital billing; creating a cohesive hospital and physician services experience; and measuring success with consumers in terms of payment and satisfaction.

“In addition to highlighting the changing emphasis on patient financial experience through real world results and best practices, this session will help attendees learn how to assess their own patient financial experience, and ways to clearly improve and measure innovative new tools,” said Meyer.
