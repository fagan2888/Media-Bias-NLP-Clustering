In Chuck Todd's debut as host of NBC's 'Meet the Press' this weekend, Oklahoma City was held up as a city putting politics aside to rebuild and revitalize their infrastructure and economy.

Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett also participated in a roundtable discussion on how some mayors—including those of Tacoma, Washington and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania— are moving forward without help from Washington.
