In each of the last three years, he\u2019s penned his special wishes on a card he sends to Gessler, a former private practice lawyer who usually represented Republican interests. Gessler ran for governor this year instead of re-election, and in January he will back in the private sector.\n\nSo Franklin signed his Christmas card citing Gessler\u2019s nickname: \u201cBuh-Bye, Honey Badger!\u201d Then he extended the courtesy to Gessler\u2019s deputy secretary of state, Suzanne Staiert, as well.\n\nLast year Gessler was planning to run for governor, but in June he finished third in the GOP primary. Franklin wrote, \u201cSending next year\u2019s card to the Governor\u2019s Mansion.\u201d Ah, that\u2019s nice. But wait for it. \u201cHopefully they\u2019ll forward it to you.\u201d Zing.\n\nAnd in 2012, when Gessler was under investigation by the state ethics commission and the Denver District Attorney\u2019s Office for using office funds, $1,278, to pay for a trip to a Republican lawyers seminar, Franklin suggested jail might be a ghost of Gessler\u2019s Christmases Yet to Come.\n\n\u201cI think orange will be a good color for you,\u201d he wished\n\nGessler instead paid a $1,400 fine levied by ethics commission, even though he had already paid back the disputed money, and the DA\u2019s office never found a crime.\n\nThe tradition of annual jabs appear to be a source of amusement and annoyance among Gessler\u2019s staff. Gessler himself just let\u2019s it slide.\n\n\u201cIt really shows their true colors for this group to use a holiday card to deliver such spiteful and petty attacks,\u201d Staiert said.\n\nFranklin responded: lighten up. \u201cI send funny Christmas cards to most of the our friends on the right in Colorado every year,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAll of my Christmas cards are meant in the most jovial Christmas spirit. Doesn\u2019t Gessler revel in being called Honey Badger? It\u2019s flattering that he has kept all of my cards.\u201d\n\nThen Franklin brought up some past beefs with the secretary for context.\n\n\u201cHe kept much better track of them then the hundreds of voter registrations his defective mobile voter registration site lost in 2012, or the \u2018thousands\u2019 of illegal voters he was certain existed in 2011 but never managed to track down.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, when Franklin made the \u201corange\u201d prediction, the Netflix show \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d had not yet debuted. The show came about in July 2013.\n\n\u201cSo I do expect points for originality,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Alan Franklin,ProgressNow Colorado,Scott Gessler", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Liberal ProgressNow Colorado wishes Republican officeholders snarky tidings each holiday season.", "title": "ProgressNow Colorado offers Scott Gessler holiday wishes", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/12/24/progressnow-spokesman-offers-scott-gessler-seasonal-greetings-twist/115881/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/12/ProgressNow-Christmas-Card2-495x345.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Liberal ProgressNow Colorado wishes Republican officeholders snarky tidings each holiday season.", "title": "ProgressNow political chief offers Scott Gessler seasonal greetings with a twist", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/12/24/progressnow-spokesman-offers-scott-gessler-seasonal-greetings-twist/115881/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/12/ProgressNow-Christmas-Card2-495x345.jpg", "creator": "@joeybunch", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Liberal ProgressNow Colorado wishes Republican officeholders snarky tidings each holiday season."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd762\"", "article_summary": "Each year Alan Franklin, the personable political director of the leading liberal group ProgressNow Colorado, keeps Republican Secretary of State Scott Gessler in his thoughts during the holidays.\nGessler ran for governor this year instead of re-election, and in January he will back in the private sector.\nSo Franklin signed his Christmas card citing Gessler\u2019s nickname: \u201cBuh-Bye, Honey Badger!\u201d Then he extended the courtesy to Gessler\u2019s deputy secretary of state, Suzanne Staiert, as well.\nLast year Gessler was planning to run for governor, but in June he finished third in the GOP primary.\nIn each of the last three years, he\u2019s penned his special wishes on a card he sends to Gessler, a former private practice lawyer who usually represented Republican interests."}
