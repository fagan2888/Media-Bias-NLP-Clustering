Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Republican and chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, said the committee\u2019s inquiry into the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attack would be done \u201cmuch sooner\u201d than 2016 if government departments were more responsive to its document requests.\n\nHe said President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry could expedite the process.\n\n\u201cIf they sen[d] a message to the folks that are reviewing our document request, give these folks what they need to complete their report or give them a legal reason why you\u2019re not going to, but quit playing this game about asking for priorities and \u2018what do you need first?\u2019 and \u2018are you sure you really need it?\u2019 \u201d he said Wednesday on Fox News\u2019 \u201cOn the Record with Greta Van Susteren.\u201d \u201cGive \u2018em what they ask for \u2014 this would be done much sooner than 2016 if they\u2019d do it.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the committee said Wednesday that the panel\u2019s inquiry could stretch into 2016, which Democrats and the presidential campaign of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton cited as evidence of the select committee\u2019s political motives.\n\nBut Mr. Gowdy said he wants it done sooner and has denied such charges.\n\n\u201cI want it done before 2016 and to that end, we\u2019re doing four witness interviews a week whereas we were doing two,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s ambitious for a staff our size \u2014 four. We\u2019re trying to accelerate it, but I\u2019ve got to have the documents.\u201d\n\nMr. Gowdy said he doesn\u2019t make the assumption that the report would even be critical of Mrs. Clinton because they\u2019re still in the process of gathering facts.\n\n\u201cIf the report is not critical of her, then she would probably want it to come out closer to the election, but it\u2019s not going to come out in the middle of 2016,\u201d he said. I hope it doesn\u2019t come out in 2016, period. I hope we\u2019re done before the end of this year. And I say hope because there are certain variables that I cannot control.\u201d\n\nMr. Gowdy said the timing of the inquiry depends on how fast the Departments of State, Justice and Defense respond to their requests for documents \u2014 some of which date as far back as two years.\n\nMr. Gowdy did say Mrs. Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the attack, is cooperative \u201cfrom the standpoint that she\u2019s never once evidenced a lack of willingness to come in [and] talk to us.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, her lawyer did reject a request from Mr. Gowdy that she sit with the committee for a transcribed interview before testifying publicly.\n\nMr. Gowdy said she would have come in November 2014, but \u201cthat was before we had her emails.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have 300 now \u2014 we had eight in November of 2014,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if I had done what they asked me to do and expedited this, I would have had a conversation with her in the dark. I would not have had her emails.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton explained last month that she used her own email system as secretary of state out of convenience and that she turned over about 30,000 emails she deemed work related to the State Department in December 2014, nearly two years after leaving office.\n\nShe said she followed the proper rules and regulations in place at the time and her office said she did not send or receive classified material over the private address.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
