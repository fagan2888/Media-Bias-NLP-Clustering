Support of candidates seeking statewide and national offices this fall have been selected based on their support of Farm Bureau policy, voting record and support for Iowa\u2019s rural communities.\n\n\u201cActions matter,\u201d said Decatur County farmer and IFBF PAC Chair, Lance Bell. \u201cOur PAC takes great care evaluating the candidates\u2019 track records and survey responses to determine who will support issues that directly impact our family farms, businesses and rural communities. We are proud that our process emphasizes Farm Bureau policies, not partisan politics. The fact that 99 counties participated in this process shows our members stand together and believe in supporting the men and women who understand the significance of agriculture in this state.\u201d\n\nGovernor Terry Branstad earned the 2014 \u2018Friend of Agriculture\u2019 designation for supporting agriculture and rural Iowa. Governor Branstad is running for his sixth term as Governor of Iowa. Bill Northey, running for his third term as Iowa\u2019s Secretary of Agriculture, also earned the designation from the IFBF PAC. In the first open-seat U.S. Senate race in Iowa in 40 years, the \u2018Friend of Agriculture\u2019 designation goes to State Senator Joni Ernst (R-Red Oak). In Iowa\u2019s congressional district Republican candidates Rod Blum in Iowa\u2019s 1st Congressional District race, David Young in Iowa\u2019s 3rd Congressional District race, and Congressman Steve King in Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District race also earned the designation from the IFB PAC\n\n\u201cWe are proud to endorse these candidates because of their solid stances and votes in support of key priorities for agriculture,\u201d said Bell. \u201cAll of these candidates have shown strong support for expanded trade, risk management programs, favorable tax policies, and renewable fuels measures that are critical to Iowa \u2013 like the RFS, advanced biofuels tax credits, and biofuels infrastructure credits.\u201d\n\nThe grassroots effort to designate Friends of Agriculture is guided by members and begins in July when county committees start evaluating candidates. The nine-member, bipartisan PAC committee reviews evaluations and questionnaires, while also considering candidates\u2019 positions on issues of importance to members, leadership on Farm Bureau priorities and past voting records.\n\n\u201cI am proud to receive the endorsement from the Iowa Farm Bureau in this election,\u201d said Governor Terry Branstad. \u201cI am passionate about agriculture and for protecting Iowa\u2019s farmers in all 99 counties. Growing up on a farm in Winnebago County and visiting farmers in every county, every year have given me the opportunity to listen and fight for Iowa farmers in our state, in Washington, D.C. and around the world. Lt. Gov. Reynolds and I are committed to keeping Iowa agriculture competitive in this global economy, and our Connect Every Acre policy that we have proposed to give broadband access to not only every Iowan but to every acre of farmland will be a key part of our agenda for Building Iowa\u2019s Future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is an honor to receive the endorsement from a group that truly represents Iowa values,\u201d said Lt. Gov. Kim Reynolds. \u201cGov. Branstad and I will continue to put forward policies that grow the economy and grow the strength of our agricultural sector which has an impressive influence on the world stage. The farmers across Iowa should know that we will be champions for them and will continue to be a steadfast voice for agriculture in Iowa.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to receive this acknowledgement, because I will be a congressman who stands up and fights for agriculture and the thousands of jobs it creates in every corner of Iowa\u2019s Third Congressional District,\u201d said David Young. \u201cWe continue to visit every county in this district, and we are encouraged by the growing support our campaign is receiving every single day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am honored to receive the support of the Iowa Farm Bureau. The Farm Bureau has long been a leading bipartisan advocate for the agricultural industry that is critical to our economy here in the 1st District. I\u2019m proud to stand alongside Iowa\u2019s farmers and look forward to being a common sense voice on their behalf in Congress,\u201d said Rod Blum.\n\n\u201cAs the rural candidate in this race, the members of Iowa\u2019s agriculture community are my friends, neighbors, constituents, and family.\u201d Joni Ernst said in response to the endorsement, \u201cSupporting renewable fuels and guarding against overreaching, burdensome federal regulations are important issues for Farm Bureau members, and I will continue to be a strong voice for Iowa agriculture in the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nThe Iowa Farm Bureau founded in 1918, it now represents more than 153,000 individual families who are members at the local level.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2014/08/iowa-farm-bureau-endorses-branstad-blum-ernst-king-northey-and-young/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Iowa_harvest_2009.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2014-08-21T08:13:53+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "bill northey, david young, friend of agriculture designation, iowa 1st congressional district race, iowa 3rd congressional district race, iowa 4th congressional district race, iowa farm bureau, iowa gubernatnorial race, iowa secretary of agriculture race, iowa u.s. senate race, joni ernst, lance bell, rod blum, steve king, terry branstad, iowa news & politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "IFBF PAC designated Gov.
