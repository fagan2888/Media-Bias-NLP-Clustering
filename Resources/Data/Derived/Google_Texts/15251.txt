Lehman Brothers used to be one of the largest, most successful investment banks in the country. At the beginning of the financial crises Lehman collapsed as the strain of subprime loans tanked in value. Lehman filed for bankruptcy in 2008 and remains in the courts today.

Chicago based American Homeowner Preservation started in 2008 as a 501(c)3 nonprofit before transitioning to for profit, evolving into a socially responsible hedge fund which delivered returns to investors of greater than 14% in 2012 and 2013. However, the 80/20 fee structure typical of hedge funds was not sufficient to fund AHP’s management-intensive workout approach. Thus, AHP recently added the crowdfunding component with predetermined – and attractive – yields to investors.
