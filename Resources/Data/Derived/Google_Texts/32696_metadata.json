Far less coverage, however, has been devoted to the ironic fact that Tavenner\u2019s agency administers the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. The \u201cSunshine Act,\u201d as it is generally known, is a provision of Obamacare meant to ensure that physicians conduct business transactions with complete transparency. In other words, the very bureaucrat whose emails have conveniently gone missing oversees the agency tasked with keeping your doctor and his business associates honest.\n\nThe Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs and other medical products to report anything worth more than $10.00 that they have given a physician. This includes food. If a software vendor takes your doctor out to lunch and buys him a steak, it must be reported on the CMS \u201cOpen Payments\u201d website. Failure to do so can result in penalties of up to $1 million. And Tavenner has by no means played a passive role in the implementation of this Byzantine statute. Late last year, ignoring the law\u2019s explicit exemption of medical textbooks and peer-reviewed journals, she issued an imperial decree to the effect that all such materials \u201cmust be reported either as \u2018education\u2019 or a \u2018gift.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhere transparency is concerned, however, Tavenner\u2019s philosophy is evidently \u201csunshine for thee but not for me.\u201d Like Lois Lerner and other high level Obama administration bureaucrats, she deep-sixed emails that had been subpoenaed by Congress. And a statement released by Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, suggests that he is not amused: \u201cToday\u2019s news that a senior HHS executive destroyed emails relevant to a congressional investigation means that the Obama Administration has lost or destroyed emails for more than 20 witnesses, and in each case, the loss wasn\u2019t disclosed to the National Archives or Congress for months or years, in violation of federal law.\u201d\n\nMoreover, it appears that Tavenner and her underlings have deliberately withheld information from Congress about her missing emails. Referring specifically to the Tavenner revelation, Issa\u2019s statement said, \u201cJust this week, my staff followed up with HHS, who has failed to comply with a subpoena from ten months ago. Even at that point, the administration did not inform us that there was a problem with Ms. Tavenner\u2019s email history.\u201d And Issa clearly isn\u2019t buying the CMS claim that these emails were inadvertently deleted: \u201cIt defies logic that so many senior Administration officials were found to have ignored federal record keeping requirements only after Congress asked to see their emails.\u201d\n\nBut Tavenner\u2019s cavalier disregard for federal rules concerning the retention of emails and other records shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Her history suggests an indifferent attitude about such regulations as they relate to her and her fellow apparatchiks. Before she took over as the administrator of CMS, Tavenner was the agency\u2019s deputy principal administrator. In that capacity she oversaw the activities of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO). This, you may recall, is the bureaucracy that issued the infamous Obamacare waivers. Not coincidentally, the CCIIO ignored repeated congressional requests for the criteria used to determine eligibility for those waivers.\n\nAll of which suggests that Tavenner is the last person who should be overseeing the implementation of the Sunshine Act. But it gets worse, and not merely because of her double standard concerning transparency. Rep. Issa\u2019s committee wants Tavenner\u2019s emails so they can be compared to the testimony she provided to Congress about the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov. The need to do so was underscored last week when her agency was forced to take down the website at which physicians must register to comply with the Sunshine Act: \u201cAnother glitch-filled government health site goes down.\u201d To quote the immortal Yogi Berra, it\u2019s d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again.\n\nOpen Payments is, like Healthcare.gov, a train wreck. As Sanjay Gupta reports, physicians attempting to register on the site face an absurdly cumbersome process that takes hours to navigate and fails to provide a confirmation when the ordeal is complete. That is not, however, the reason the site was taken down. It turns out that Open Payments has been publicizing inaccurate information. As a CMS spokesman delicately phrased it, \u201cAfter an assessment of the data resulting from a complaint\u2026 we have taken the system offline temporarily and will work with the industry to eliminate incorrect payment records.\u201d This is doubtless a great comfort to physicians nationwide.\n\nWhen Marilyn Tavenner replaced CMS administrator Donald Berwick, the latter\u2019s departure engendered so much relief that she received very little serious scrutiny. One publication that did raise questions was the Boston Globe: \u201cWhile Tavenner worked for HCA, the company was busily enhancing its profit margin by defrauding Medicare\u2026 it hardly seems wise to put her in charge of the government system her company helped defraud.\u201d Tavenner wasn\u2019t implicated in the HCA fraud, but her high-handed behavior regarding the Sunshine Act combined with the deletion of her emails suggests that she applies a different standard of honesty to herself than she imposes on the hoi polloi.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbe9\"", "article_summary": "Before she took over as the administrator of CMS, Tavenner was the agency\u2019s deputy principal administrator.\nAll of which suggests that Tavenner is the last person who should be overseeing the implementation of the Sunshine Act.\nThe \u201cSunshine Act,\u201d as it is generally known, is a provision of Obamacare meant to ensure that physicians conduct business transactions with complete transparency.\nThe Sunshine Act requires manufacturers of drugs and other medical products to report anything worth more than $10.00 that they have given a physician.\nWhen Marilyn Tavenner replaced CMS administrator Donald Berwick, the latter\u2019s departure engendered so much relief that she received very little serious scrutiny."}
