Here are a few of the most common mistakes we\u2019ve seen seniors make:\n\nBecoming a victim to fraud \u2013 Seniors are often targeted by scammers. The FBI lists a few tips on how to protect yourself at Seniors are often targeted by scammers.

But in fact there may be. For instance Medicare does not cover nursing homes and assisted living for long-term care.\n\nBecoming too conservative \u2013 An asset allocation that is overweight in bonds and cash might not generate enough long-term income from the portfolio. Your investment portfolio should be aligned with your financial savings goals, needs, and risk appetite. We also see some retirees make the critical mistake of not factoring the effects of inflation into their financial plan.\n\nCost expectations \u2013 In addition to not adjusting expenses to match retirement income, we find that some seniors also underestimate the cost of a serious illness. Another common mistake we see is that some seniors think a large house and/or a house in an expensive area will be affordable for them forever. It could be affordable now, but compounding the cost over 30-40 years may not be sustainable.\n\nNot planning for potential incapacity \u2013 While most people do have estate planning documents outlining how they want their property to be handled after death, we find that many seniors do not address how they want health care and property decisions handled in the case of incapacity. Incapacity can result from a serious injury, a stroke, or dementia for instance; a will does not address this situation.\n\nToo much money in tax deferred accounts \u2013 When planning for retirement, we find that people take advantage of utilizing tax deferred accounts to save for retirement. When retirees are forced to take required minimum distributions from these accounts, it is often anticipated they will be taxed at a lower tax bracket than when they were working. However, this is not always the case, and those withdrawals may be subject to high ordinary income tax rates. .\n\nDrawing from retirement accounts too soon \u2013 Again, we recommend examining your financial situation and tax bracket. Withdrawing money from your retirement accounts too soon or too late can both significantly impact your savings. Familiarizing yourself with the retirement account rules can help you extract the most value from your assets.\n\nCanceling life insurance too early or carrying it too long \u2013 It would be prudent to assess your life insurance needs and current premiums to determine what is appropriate for you.\n\nBecoming the bank for your kids or grandkids \u2013 Many seniors want to help their children or grandkids in some fashion, but we\u2019ve also seen some extreme examples of gifting that proved to be detrimental to the seniors\u2019 financial plan.\n\nRelying on annuities \u2013 Whether or not an annuity is right for you depends on your specific financial situation. We find that for some, annuities can be appropriate while for others, they can be unsuitable. We recommend an in-depth assessment of the product and your overall financial plan.\n\nLack of due diligence \u2013 We advise that people research financial providers before investing and/or depositing money. We have seen some seniors fall victim to purchasing products from \u201cnice people at the bank.\u201d\n\nIgnoring Roth IRA conversion opportunities \u2013 It may be worth exploring a post-retirement Roth conversion as many retirees have a longer life expectancy than they originally expect. We recommend checking your tax bracket and assessing also the size of the potential conversion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While there is nothing that can guarantee that you will have sufficient money to cover all potential costs in retirement, there are certainly some common mistakes that you want to steer clear from to help protect your assets.", "og": {"site_name": "MD Magazine", "description": "While there is nothing that can guarantee that you will have sufficient money to cover all potential costs in retirement, there are certainly some common mistakes that you want to steer clear from to help protect your assets.", "title": "Top Mistakes Seniors Make", "url": "http://www.hcplive.com/physicians-money-digest/columns/physicians-wealth-manager/04-2015/top-mistakes-seniors-make", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v1_media/_upload_image/_thumbnails/elderlywomanphonecomputer.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v2_media/_core/favi/ms-icon-144x144.png", "keywords": "Columns, Retirement, Mistakes, Financial Planning, Annuities", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b0d\"", "article_summary": "Here are a few of the most common mistakes we\u2019ve seen seniors make:Becoming a victim to fraud \u2013 Seniors are often targeted by scammers.\nBecoming the bank for your kids or grandkids \u2013 Many seniors want to help their children or grandkids in some fashion, but we\u2019ve also seen some extreme examples of gifting that proved to be detrimental to the seniors\u2019 financial plan.\nThe FBI lists a few tips on how to protect yourself at Seniors are often targeted by scammers.\nCost expectations \u2013 In addition to not adjusting expenses to match retirement income, we find that some seniors also underestimate the cost of a serious illness.\nWithdrawing money from your retirement accounts too soon or too late can both significantly impact your savings."}
