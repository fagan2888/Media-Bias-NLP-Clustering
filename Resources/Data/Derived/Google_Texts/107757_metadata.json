We have legions of electronic devices, and each one of those devices has a battery inside of it. Ever experience the frustration of fully charging your smartphone just to have it die a few hours later? Or need your electric car to drive more miles before the battery is completely drained? Then read on.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with how a basic capacitor works. A capacitor stores energy electrostatically in an electric field, i.e. a battery or electrical circuit. Capacitors store energy between plates, or the electrical conductors, which can be thin films of metal or even aluminum foil.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nA supercapacitor is basically a capacitor on steroids. Something typically used as a supercapacitor is graphene, and graphene is known to conduct heat and electricity with superb efficiency. \u201cGraphene,\u201d explains Liming Dai, Director of the Center of Advanced Science and Engineering for Carbon at Case Western Reserve University, \u201cis a single atomic layer of carbon sheets. You peel one layer away from graphite, you get graphene. Graphene has a huge surface area for capacity to store the charges and it gives you more charge to store on the surface.\u201d\n\nThe American Chemical Society explains, \u201csupercapacitors are energy storage devices that have huge potential to transform the way future electronics are powered. Unlike today\u2019s rechargeable batteries, which sip up energy over several hours, supercapacitors can charge and discharge within seconds. But they normally can\u2019t store nearly as much energy as batteries, an important property known as energy density. One approach researchers are taking to boost supercapacitors\u2019 energy density is to design better electrodes.\u201d And hemp, some think, could be that better electrode.\n\nGetting graphite, the parent of graphene, is a pretty dirty business. Graphite has to be mined then chemically processed to make graphene. Dai says, \u201cThe peeled away layers of graphite use a very strong acid, like a sulfuric acid or nitric acid to oxidize the graphite to make the graphene sheet.\u201d This acid application damages the structure, thereby losing electrical conductivity, not to mention utilizing a very harmful and environmentally unappealing chemical agent. \u201cHemp is a good replacement for this strong acidic process because you can produce graphene with more connective structure and a cheaper process.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the unsavory chemical treatment, there is also the issue of graphite mining, currently a very big problem in energy-hungry and pollution-laden China where a lot of our electronics are produced. Ironically, graphite is in the batteries that power Tesla Model S cars, Toyota\u2019s plug-in Prius, and other electric cars that promise zero emissions yet pollute China\u2019s air and water, damage crops, and create unbearable smog. Also, graphite does not store energy nearly as well as graphene does, and graphene, says Dai, \u201cis difficult to peel off. If you peel layer by layer of graphene out of graphite it is very tedious. And you cannot get high-yield production.\u201d And this peeling-away process makes graphene very expensive to make.\n\nRead more at Reset.me", "article_metadata": {"description": "One approach researchers are taking to boost supercapacitors\u2019 energy density is to design better electrodes.\u201d And hemp, some think, could be that better electrode.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Mint Press News Desk", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "One approach researchers are taking to boost supercapacitors\u2019 energy density is to design better electrodes.\u201d And hemp, some think, could be that better electrode.", "title": "Turning Hemp Fibers Into Batteries: Another Way Hemp Could Save Our Planet", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/turning-hemp-fibers-into-batteries-another-way-hemp-could-save-our-planet/202644/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AP494004047453-001.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-28T00:51:37-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One approach researchers are taking to boost supercapacitors\u2019 energy density is to design better electrodes.\u201d And hemp, some think, could be that better electrode.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AP494004047453-001.jpg", "title": "Turning Hemp Fibers Into Batteries: Another Way Hemp Could Save Our Planet", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "sustainable energy", "published_time": "2015-02-28T05:00:56-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T00:51:37-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd246c\"", "article_summary": "Turning Hemp Fibers Into Batteries: Another Way Hemp Could Save Our PlanetOne approach researchers are taking to boost supercapacitors\u2019 energy density is to design better electrodes.\nCapacitors store energy between plates, or the electrical conductors, which can be thin films of metal or even aluminum foil.\nOne approach researchers are taking to boost supercapacitors\u2019 energy density is to design better electrodes.\u201d And hemp, some think, could be that better electrode.\nAlso, graphite does not store energy nearly as well as graphene does, and graphene, says Dai, \u201cis difficult to peel off.\nSomething typically used as a supercapacitor is graphene, and graphene is known to conduct heat and electricity with superb efficiency."}
