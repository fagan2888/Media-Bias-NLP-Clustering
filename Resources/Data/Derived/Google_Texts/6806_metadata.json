And many spend far more.\n\nComplicating things is the reluctance of caregivers to talk about finances: Seven out of 10 have not spoken with loved ones about how to pay for their care.\n\nAs primary caregiver for both of my parents for more than five years, I\u2019ve spent considerably more than the survey\u2019s average on transportation, living accommodations, food, medication, services and treatments, including caring for my dad\u2019s service dog. Finances are a constant struggle wrought with tough decisions.\n\n>> 12 Foods That Can Help You Sleep\n\nMy situation is not because my parents didn\u2019t talk about how to pay for their care. They planned ahead and we did talk about their savings and long-term care insurance. But the savings were spent and long-term care insurance just doesn\u2019t cover the higher cost of care.\n\nPlus, Dad\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s means caregiving is more expensive. Even with his veteran\u2019s benefits, there\u2019s not enough to cover his 24-hour care along with all other basic needs. Because I have wanted both of my parents to receive every possible advantage, I often pay for extra services and activities.\n\nLike nearly three-quarters of all caregivers in the U.S., I am also a working caregiver. The Caring.com survey found that 60 percent of working caregivers said their care duties have had a negative effect on their job. Half said they made changes in their work schedules, 30 percent said they arrived late or left early, and 17 percent reported missing significant work. Clearly, work and finances are tied to overall long-term financial stability.\n\nChoosing to become an independent consultant in order to have the flexibility to care for my parents certainly has affected my finances, including my retirement savings. I\u2019ve been able to maintain a solid income, but there are many opportunities that I\u2019ve missed as a result of caregiving.\n\nI certainly don\u2019t regret a penny spent on caring for my parents, but I still have a lot of stress around managing current finances and my future financial security. At the times of my greatest financial anxiety, I mentally thank my parents for the planning they did do. Things would be even worse if they didn\u2019t have insurance and Dad\u2019s pensions.\n\n>> Get discounts on health services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nSo let this serve as a wake-up call for you current and future caregivers. Start talking now about how you and your loved ones plan to pay for care and how you\u2019ll juggle life, work and caregiving at the same time.\n\nTake advantage of the planning tools AARP and other organizations have to help with difficult conversations. Remember, it\u2019s easier to talk about it long before the services are needed than to wait and figure it out on the fly in the middle of a crisis.\n\nAmy Goyer is AARP\u2019s family, caregiving and multigenerational issues expert.
