Both had been shot.\n\nJames Ivey was reportedly arguing with his wife when the fight escalated.\n\nAccording to Mrs. Ivey, Kyle attempted several times to calm his father, before James went to get a firearm, saying he was going to kill his wife.\n\nKyle apparently got his own firearm, and the two shot each other.\n\n\"We have been able to determine from the medical examiners office through the bullet wound and again from the evidence that we believe that Kyle Ivey was acting in self defense protecting himself and his mother. And so at this point, no charges will be filed,\" Bay County Sheriff Frank McKeithen stated.\n\nKyle remains in the hospital.
