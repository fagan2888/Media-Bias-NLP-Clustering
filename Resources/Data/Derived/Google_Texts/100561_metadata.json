Late Monday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced she will appear before its members Oct. 30.\n\nThe delay angered Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, who called it a \u201crefusal\u201d by Mrs. Sebelius to testify Thursday. He said the public deserves answers now about the burgeoning problems with the HealthCare.gov website.\n\n\u201cThe refusal of Secretary Sebelius to appear at this week\u2019s hearing shows that this administration is still not prepared to be straight with the American people,\u201d Mr. Boehner said. \u201cEvery day new questions about the president\u2019s health care law arise, but candid explanations are nowhere to be found.\u201d\n\nThe speaker said Mrs. Sebelius\u2018 decision \u201ccontinues a troubling pattern of this administration seeking to avoid accountability and stonewall the public.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is more important to Secretary Sebelius than providing answers to the American people? I hope President Obama has a greater appreciation for the role of oversight and orders his secretary to fully cooperate with all congressional inquiries,\u201d Mr. Boehner said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jay Carney said it\u2019s up to Cabinet secretaries to decide when and how to cooperate with a congressional inquiry.\n\nMrs. Sebelius will be at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston on Wednesday night to speak about the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy signing the Community Mental Health Act. On Thursday, she\u2019s scheduled to attend an event in Phoenix.\n\n\u201cWe have always indicated to the committee that she intended to testify but that she had a scheduling conflict,\u201d said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters.\n\nRepublicans have criticized Mrs. Sebelius for being more willing to appear on the \u201cDaily Show\u201d with Jon Stewart on Comedy Central to talk about Obamacare than she is to testify before Congress about the rollout\u2019s failures.\n\nThe committee\u2019s Republicans said that three health care contractors will testify Thursday, including representatives of website designer CGI.\n\n\u201cWe are now entering week four of the botched health care rollout, and with hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars spent for a system that still does not work, Congress and the American people deserve answers,\u201d said Rep. Fred Upton, Michigan Republican, the committee chairman. \u201cWe were told repeatedly that implementation was \u2018on track,\u2019 and it is now time for all those responsible to explain what happened.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday put off Republican lawmakers who want to question her about the disastrous rollout of Obamacare this week, instead agreeing to testify about the program's computer problems next week.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday put off Republican lawmakers who want to question her about the disastrous rollout of Obamacare this week, instead agreeing to testify about the program\u2019s computer problems next week.", "title": "Sebelius to appear before House on Obamacare on Oct. 30", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/21/sebelius-ill-answer-obamacare-glitches-when-i-can/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/21/aptopix-obama-health-carejpeg-06e37.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/21/aptopix-obama-health-carejpeg-06e37.jpg", "description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday put off Republican lawmakers who want to question her about the disastrous rollout of Obamacare this week, instead agreeing to testify a", "card": "summary", "title": "Sebelius to appear before House on Obamacare on Oct. 30"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Kathleen Sebelius, John A Boehner"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0191\"", "article_summary": "A spokeswoman for Mrs. Sebelius said she cannot attend a House hearing Thursday due to a scheduling conflict.\nLate Monday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced she will appear before its members Oct. 30.\nThe delay angered Speaker John A.
