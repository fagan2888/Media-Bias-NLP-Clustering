One reason for that is that budget bills can be easier to pass. Legislators who join majority caucuses typically pledge to vote for the caucus budget, whatever it contains, as a condition of membership. So even if they find a provision in the budget that is personally distasteful, they are required to vote for it anyway. Such a lock-step rule doesn't apply to stand-alone bills, when legislators are generally free to vote their conscience.
