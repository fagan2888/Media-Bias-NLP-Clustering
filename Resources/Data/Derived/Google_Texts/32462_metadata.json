Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s legacy of nonviolence with his proposed military actions against Syria.\n\n\u201cAt the risk of being the odd man out, let me just add some broader context,\u201d Mr. Smiley said. \u201cJust days ago, we were celebrating 50 years since the March on Washington. President Obama stood where Dr. King stood 50 years ago, and we honored Martin with our words in Washington. Now here we are days away from dishonoring him with our deeds in Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWar, Dr. King would say were he here, is not the answer,\u201d Mr. Smiley clarified. \u201cWe cannot worship at the altar of retaliation, Dr. King would say were he here. It\u2019s either nonviolent coexistence or violent co-annihilation, Dr. King would say were he here. Just like this is connected to Iraq, it\u2019s connected to all of our history.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Charles Krauthammer slams Obama\u2019s decision to delay Syria strike: \u2018Amateur hour\u2019\n\nOn Saturday, Mr. Obama sent a letter to congressional leaders and draft legislation on the Authorization for the Use of U.S. Armed Forces (AUMF) in connection to the Syrian conflict. The draft resolution authorizes the president to use the U.S. military \u201cas he determines to be necessary and appropriate in connection with the use of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in the conflict in Syria[.]\u201d\n\nHouse Republican leaders said they\u2019ll wait until the end of their summer vacation, which ends a week from today, before returning to Washington to vote on authorizing a strike on Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s regime.\n\nThe GOP leadership said the coming days will give Mr. Obama some time to make a more convincing case than he has laid out so far.\n\nSEE ALSO: In reversal, Obama to seek congressional OK for Syria strike\n\nNot long after Mr. Obama\u2019s statements did Mr. Smiley take to Twitter to express his disapproval of any strike on Syria.\n\n\u201cWhen you draw a red line and dare someone to cross it, that\u2019s not diplomacy. In my neighborhood, we call that \u2018playing chicken,\u2019\u201d the TV host tweeted to his nearly 237,000 followers Saturday night.\n\n\u201cBlurred (red) lines. Now what? Peaceful coexistence or coannihilation? Only took us 48 hours to abandon King\u2019s dream for more drones,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PBS host Tavis Smiley appeared on \"This Week With George Stephanopoulos\" Sunday morning, arguing that President Obama is \"dishonoring\" Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy of nonviolence with his proposed military actions against Syria.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "PBS host Tavis Smiley appeared on \u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos\u201d Sunday morning, arguing that President Obama is \u201cdishonoring\u201d Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s legacy of nonviolence with his proposed military actions against Syria.", "title": "PBS host Tavis Smiley: Obama \u2018dishonoring\u2019 MLK\u2019s legacy with Syria plans", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/1/pbs-host-tavis-smiley-obama-dishonoring-dr-king-pr/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2008/07/22/tsmiley.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2008/07/22/tsmiley.jpg", "description": "PBS host Tavis Smiley appeared on \"This Week With George Stephanopoulos\" Sunday morning, arguing that President Obama is \"dishonoring\" Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy of nonviolence with his proposed", "card": "summary", "title": "PBS host Tavis Smiley: Obama \u2018dishonoring\u2019 MLK\u2019s leg"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, Martin Luther King Jr, Tavis Smiley, Syria"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda469\"", "article_summary": "PBS host Tavis Smiley, appearing on \u201cThis Week With George Stephanopoulos\u201d Sunday morning, argued that President Obama is \u201cdishonoring\u201d the Rev.\n\u201cAt the risk of being the odd man out, let me just add some broader context,\u201d Mr. Smiley said.\nPresident Obama stood where Dr. King stood 50 years ago, and we honored Martin with our words in Washington.\n\u201cWe cannot worship at the altar of retaliation, Dr. King would say were he here.\nNow here we are days away from dishonoring him with our deeds in Syria.\u201d\u201cWar, Dr. King would say were he here, is not the answer,\u201d Mr. Smiley clarified."}
