A Butler County sheriff's deputy and two others are seriously hurt following a crash Saturday evening near Towanda.

The crash happened just before 6 p.m. at K-254 and Southwest Ohio Street, which is a mile east of Towanda.

Master Trooper Brian Grunder said the deputy was in the median waiting to turn around on K-254 when an eastbound Ford pickup veered into the median and hit his vehicle.

The deputy and two people in the pickup were taken to the hospital with serious injuries. All three are expected to be okay.

Grunder said the driver for the pickup is being checked for possible intoxication and medical issues.

No names were released.
