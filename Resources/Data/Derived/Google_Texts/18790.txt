PA-9: Shuster Highlights ‘Fight to End Obamacare’ in New Ad (VIDEO)

Written by Jason Addy, Contributing Writer

After his first ad of the year sought to show his conservative values, Congressman Bill Shuster is focusing in on his work against Obamacare in his newest spot.

“What’s the best evidence Washington is broken?” the commercial begins. “Obamacare. Premiums are skyrocketing. Millions of jobs lost. Billions cut from Medicare.”

The spot – titled “Shuster Leading the Conservative Fight to End Obamacare” – goes on to tout his work to introduce a bill to defund the Affordable Care Act and stop the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing the president’s program.

“Thankfully, we have a conservative like Bill Shuster working for us,” the narrator says. “Bill Shuster stood up to the Washington special interests voted against Obamacare and has voted more than 60 times to repeal it.”

Shuster is seeking a 9th term in Congress, but (again) faces a primary challenge from Art Halvorson.

The 9th Congressional District consists of all or parts of Bedford, Blair, Cambria, Fayette, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Huntingdon, Indiana, Somerset, Washington and Westmoreland Counties.

The primary election will be held on April 26th.
