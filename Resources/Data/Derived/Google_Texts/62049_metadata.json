The reimbursement from Obamacare plans comes in somewhere in between but closer to the lower bound, meaning he could take up to a 20% cut in pay for each routine visit.\n\n\u201cI cannot accept a plan [in which] potentially commercial-type reimbursement rates were now going to be reimbursed at Medicare rates,\u201d the Connecticut internist explained to NPR. \u201cYou have to maintain a certain mix in private practice between the low reimbursers and the high reimbursers to be able to keep the lights on.\u201d\n\nAccording to Gerard, he has rejected two out of the three plans offered by insurers in the state on the exchange, accepting only the one offering the highest reimbursement rate to doctors. Connecticut is one of the states that runs its own health care exchange.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think most physicians know what they\u2019re being reimbursed,\u201d said Gerard. \u201cOnly when they start seeing some of those rates come through will they realize how low the rates are they agreed to.\u201d\n\nGerard is not the only one worried about the lower reimbursement rates. Kevin Counihan, chief executive officer of the Connecticut health marketplace, worries that more doctors will follow Gerard\u2019s lead and reject particular insurance plans.\n\n\u201cI think it could lead potentially to this kind of distinction that there are these different tiers of quality of care,\u201d explained Counihan.\n\nAnother Connecticut doctor, radiologist Bob Russo, labeled the fact that Obamacare appears to be losing doctors money \u201ca problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get what you pay for,\u201d explained Russo, who is also Connecticut State Medical Society president-elect. \u201cIf you can\u2019t convince [doctors] that they\u2019re not losing money doing their job, then it\u2019s a problem. And they haven\u2019t been able to convince people of that.\u201d\n\nAlas, not only is Obamacare \u201cnot an affordable product\u201d for individuals shopping for insurance, as the chairman and CEO of Aetna pointed out last week, but the health care law is actually costing doctors. And, as a result, it may well cost patients quality care if those doctors decide to reject Obamacare insurance plans that don\u2019t pay them enough.\n\nH/T The Daily Caller.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Obamacare isn't only hurting Millennials by causing college tuition to rise and offering expensive plans for young individuals, but the health care law is also hurting doctors.", "title": "Doctors rejecting insurance plans under Obamacare because of low...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/12/obamacare-marketplace-600x323.jpg", "height": 323}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/08/05/doctors-rejecting-insurance-plans-obamacare-low-physician-reimbursement-rates/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "obamacare-millennials", "published_time": "2014-08-05T17:33:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-05T17:33:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "And, as a result, it may well cost patients quality care if those doctors decide to reject Obamacare insurance plans that don\u2019t pay them enough.\n\u201cOnly when they start seeing some of those rates come through will they realize how low the rates are they agreed to.\u201dGerard is not the only one worried about the lower reimbursement rates.\nKevin Counihan, chief executive officer of the Connecticut health marketplace, worries that more doctors will follow Gerard\u2019s lead and reject particular insurance plans.\n\u201cI cannot accept a plan [in which] potentially commercial-type reimbursement rates were now going to be reimbursed at Medicare rates,\u201d the Connecticut internist explained to NPR.\nThe reimbursement from Obamacare plans comes in somewhere in between but closer to the lower bound, meaning he could take up to a 20% cut in pay for each routine visit."}
