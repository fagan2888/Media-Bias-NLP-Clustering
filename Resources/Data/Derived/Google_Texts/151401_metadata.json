The rate of exemptions mirrors what TurboTax saw during the full 2014 tax season, when filers dealt with Obamacare for the first time.\n\nAlso Tuesday, a lengthy report by the Health and Human Services Department\u2019s inspector general said the administration received 18 \u201cdocumented warnings\u201d about HealthCare.gov\u2019s shortcomings in the run-up to its disastrous October 2013 launch.\n\n\u201cMost critical was the absence of clear leadership, which caused delays in decision-making, lack of clarity in project tasks, and the inability of CMS to recognize the magnitude of problems as the project deteriorated,\u201d the IG report said.\n\nHealthCare.gov is functioning fine now, though consumers are still wading through the law\u2019s mandates and phased-in tax penalties, which are starting to take a real bite.\n\nThe tax for failing to hold insurance jumped from $95 or 1 percent of qualified income \u2014 whichever is greater \u2014 in 2014 to $325 or 2 percent of income in 2015.\n\nFilers who must pony up the 2015 penalty this season will see their pain more than double, to $695 or 2.5 percent of income, at tax time next year, unless they find a way to get insured this year.\n\nYet certain people are exempt from the mandate, either because they do not earn enough money or because they fit certain categories \u2014 for example, they are in prison, in the country illegally or take care of their own health costs through a religious health-care ministry.\n\nOthers, including victims of domestic violence, can qualify for a series of \u201chardship\u201d exemptions.\n\n\u201cThe IRS reported that about 300,000 people who paid the penalty likely qualified for an exemption last year. With the penalty nearly doubling this year, TurboTax urges those without health coverage to see if they qualify for an exemption from a tax penalty,\u201d said Debra Hammer, the company\u2019s spokeswoman for Obamacare issues.\n\nThe tax-prep company also says tax filers haven\u2019t been tripped up by the IRS\u2019 decision to delay the issuance of brand-new tax forms.\n\nInsurers and employers issued the forms, known as 1095-Bs and 1095-Cs, so that filers have a record of their coverage and compliance with the mandate, although they aren\u2019t attached to returns.\n\nThe IRS receives its own versions of the forms, however, and analysts said the delay could make it difficult for auditors to crack down on people who flout the mandate and claim full refunds, even though they owe a penalty.\n\nTurboTax noted that filers who received taxpayer-subsidized coverage on an Obamacare exchange will need to include a form, 1095-A, that helps them reconcile their amount of subsidy with their actual income in 2015.\n\nRoughly 800,000 HealthCare.gov customers received 1095-A forms with errors last year \u2014 a mix-up that evoked the law\u2019s flawed web rollout.\n\nThe administration doesn\u2019t expect to make the same mistake this year, though Republican critics say the law will continue to cause problems.\n\n\u201cThe website is part of the bigger problem behind Obamacare,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, said Tuesday. \u201cA massive undertaking was rushed through on a partisan basis. The law was badly written and poorly implemented.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Turbotax says seven out of every 10 uninsured filers who've used their tax-filing website this season have been able to claim an exemption from the \"individual mandate\" requiring Americans to hold insurance or pay a tax under Obamacare.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Turbotax says seven out of every 10 uninsured filers who\u2019ve used their tax-filing website this season have been able to claim an exemption from the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d requiring Americans to hold insurance or pay a tax under Obamacare.", "title": "TurboTax: 7 out of 10 uninsured customers claim exemption from Obamacare mandate", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/23/turbotax-7-out-10-uninsured-customers-claim-exempt/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/02/Health_Overhaul_.JPEG-07d2e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/02/Health_Overhaul_.JPEG-07d2e.jpg", "title": "TurboTax: 7 out of 10 uninsured customers claim exemption from Obamaca", "description": "Turbotax says seven out of every 10 uninsured filers who've used their tax-filing website this season have been able to claim an exemption from the \"individual mandate\" requiring Americans to hold ins", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Obamacare, Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "The tax-prep company also says tax filers haven\u2019t been tripped up by the IRS\u2019 decision to delay the issuance of brand-new tax forms.\nThe rate of exemptions mirrors what TurboTax saw during the full 2014 tax season, when filers dealt with Obamacare for the first time.\nWith the penalty nearly doubling this year, TurboTax urges those without health coverage to see if they qualify for an exemption from a tax penalty,\u201d said Debra Hammer, the company\u2019s spokeswoman for Obamacare issues.\nMost Americans are ducking Obamacare\u2019s tax penalty, claiming an exemption from the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d tax-filing company TurboTax said Tuesday, signaling how far the Obama administration still has to go in meeting its goal of universal health coverage.\nRoughly 800,000 HealthCare.gov customers received 1095-A forms with errors last year \u2014 a mix-up that evoked the law\u2019s flawed web rollout."}
