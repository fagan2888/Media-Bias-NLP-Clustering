From 2010 to 2013, SEIU poured $1.6 million into Health Care for America Now, an activist group promoting increased federal control of health care.\n\nDuring President Obama\u2019s first year in office, HCAN orchestrated rallies across the country to help ram Obamacare through Congress.\n\nA founding leader of HCAN, SEIU is not the group\u2019s only union backer. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, American Federation of Teachers and National Education Association are also HCAN founders.\n\nRELATED: Taxpayer money fuels big labor\u2019s political machine\n\nAFSCME, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest union, gave HCAN $2.9 million from 2009 to 2013. Like SEIU, AFSCME slammed \u201cextremist\u201d Obamacare critics in a statement applauding the King vs. Burwell ruling.\n\nThe ruling, AFSCME president Lee Saunders said, \u201cpreserved the health and peace of mind of the more than 8 million Americans\u201d who receive Obamacare subsidies through HealthCare.gov.\n\nNEA, the largest labor union in America, gave HCAN $1.8 million from 2008 to 2013. AFT, the nation\u2019s third-largest union, gave HCAN $325,000.\n\nOn Thursday, NEA president Lily Eskelsen Garcia praised the Supreme Court for keeping health insurance \u201csecure\u201d and \u201caffordable\u201d through Obamacare. AFT president Randi Weingarten cheered the Court for preventing \u201ca major step backward.\u201d\n\nEven in the specific professions the unions claim to speak for, workers\u2019 support for Obamacare is mixed.\n\n\u201cAs a teacher, I\u2019ve already felt the implications of Obamacare in a negative way,\u201d Rhonda Lochiatto, who teaches at a Florida charter school, told Watchdog.org. \u201cMy costs have gone up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t help me at all,\u201d she added, \u201cSo why would the unions fight for that when it\u2019s actually hurting their members instead of helping?\u201d\n\nLochiatto was a public school teacher for 15 years, and saw firsthand how NEA and AFT affiliates push members to support policies like Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe union jumps on board with all these issues that have nothing to do with education,\u201d she said. Lochiatto is currently a member of Association of American Educators, a non-union professional organization.\n\nFlorida is a right-to-work state, but individuals in states without right-to-work laws can be forced to pay union fees \u2014 and indirectly support union activism \u2014 as a condition of employment.\n\nIn 2014, SEIU took forced \u201cfair share\u201d fees from 176,969 nonmembers. AFSME took mandatory fees from 125,255 nonmembers, and NEA took mandatory fees from 90,255 nonmembers.\n\nSEIU, AFSCME, AFT and NEA all failed to respond to questions from Watchdog.org about how they gauge support for Obamacare among the workers who pay their bills.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Labor unions used the Supreme Court's King vs. Burwell ruling as a chance to accuse Obamacare critics of putting lives in jeopardy.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Labor unions used the Supreme Court's King vs. Burwell ruling as a chance to accuse Obamacare critics of putting lives in jeopardy.", "title": "Unions cheer Supreme Court ruling, smear Obamacare critics - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/06/seiu-twitter-kingburwell-2015-06-25.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-30T13:38:33+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/226318/unions-obamacare-critics/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Labor unions used the Supreme Court's King vs. Burwell ruling as a chance to accuse Obamacare critics of putting lives in jeopardy.", "title": "Unions cheer Supreme Court ruling, smear Obamacare critics - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/06/seiu-twitter-kingburwell-2015-06-25.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-07-01T04:00:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-30T13:38:33+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "obamacare, seiu, king vs burwell, king v burwell, service employees international union, american federation of teachers, health care for america now, national education association, afscme"}, "article_summary": "On Thursday, NEA president Lily Eskelsen Garcia praised the Supreme Court for keeping health insurance \u201csecure\u201d and \u201caffordable\u201d through Obamacare.\nBy Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgLabor unions used the Supreme Court\u2019s King vs. Burwell ruling as a chance to accuse Obamacare critics of putting lives in jeopardy.\nWhy is SEIU concerned about protecting Obamacare subsidies but indifferent to the fines, mandates, higher premiums and plan cancellations resulting from the law?\nTell your GOP Senator #ACAHereToStay \u2192 855-728-5215 pic.twitter.com/zF5ZBeKtR8 \u2014 SEIU (@SEIU) June 25, 2015If opposition to Obamacare makes one an extremist, a slim majority of Americans are extremists based on the latest RealClearPolitics polling average.\nLike SEIU, AFSCME slammed \u201cextremist\u201d Obamacare critics in a statement applauding the King vs. Burwell ruling."}
