Telehealth bill promotes more talk with providers about what's covered

Michigan has been in the forefront nationally in paying for telehealth services under its Medicaid program since 2006.



But telehealth legislation approved in 2012 — and promoted by its supporters as expanding commercial insurance coverage of telehealth — has stimulated more of a discussion between private health insurers and providers about what telehealth services should be covered rather than an explosion of covered services, several insurance experts told Crain's.



Bills approved in 2012, House Bills 5408 and 5421, and signed into law by Gov. Rick Snyder require health insurers to pay for health services claims delivered by telehealth by banning insurers from requiring face-to-face contact between providers and patients for treatment coverage.



The language of the legislation, however, had one loophole. It allowed insurers to continue to decide if they wanted to cover the service.



George Kipa, M.D., deputy chief medical officer for technology with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, said the number of telehealth claims paid by Blue Cross hasn't changed much over the past several years.



"We pay about 500 claims a year," said Kipa, noting that most of the claims come from rural areas of the state where there is a lack of availability of specialists.
