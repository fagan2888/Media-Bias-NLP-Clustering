Primary care practices are willing to implement behavioral and mental health assessments required by the Affordable Care Act, but lack the resources to do so effectively.

If practices implement the assessments, research shows that the high number of health risks identified will likely stretch many of them beyond treatment capacity. ThatÂ’s the conclusion of a study that produced two articles published in the Annals of Family Medicine. The authors suggest providers focus on fewer elements of the assessments, as prioritized by their patients, to avoid such overload.
