It wasn\u2019t until an autopsy performed on 78-year-old Rosa Calderoni revealed high levels of potassium did local police open a full investigation into Daniela Poggiali\u2019s seedy nursing practices.\n\nCalderoni was admitted to the Italian hospital with a routine illness, so family members were more than a little taken aback when she died. When the post-mortem examination revealed high levels of potassium in her blood that likely triggered cardiac arrest, police started to look into Poggiali\u2019s past. Throughout the course of the investigation, one of the nurse\u2019s colleagues described her as a \u201ccold person but always eager to work.\u201d\n\nPolice would later obtain Poggiali\u2019s cellphone where they discovered a photo of the disgraceful nurse posing over a patient\u2019s dead body while giving the camera a thumbs ups. \u201cI can assure you in that all my professional years of seeing shocking photos, there were few such as these,\u201d Alessandro Mancini, the prosecuting attorney in Poggiali\u2019s case, told local reporters.\n\nAnother one of Poggiali\u2019s colleagues reported that she was known for administered patients strong laxatives at the end of her shift to increase the workload for coworkers on the next shift. Upon questioning, Poggiali denied any part in the allegations brought against her and claimed she is the victim of an elaborate conspiracy concocted by her enemies. Prosecutor Rosell Materia described her as a sadist, \u201cwho draws pleasure in provoking the death of the patients in her care.\u201d\n\nPoggiali has currently been charged with murder over the death of Rosa Calderoni. However, prosecutors say they face \u201cinsurmountable difficulties\u201d due to the amount of time that has passed between all of the nurse\u2019s alleged victims. Police also said the case involving Calderoni\u2019s death would be difficult considering how fast potassium disbands in human blood.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nurse, kill, 38, patients, daniela, poggiali", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A nurse in Italy is being accused of killing 38 patients under her care because they or their families annoyed her.", "title": "Nurse Allegedly Killed 38 Patients Because They Annoyed Her", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/italian-nurse-accused-38-murders-after-elderly-woman-dies-suspicious-potassium-injection-306956", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/14/daniela-poggiali.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A nurse in Italy is being accused of killing 38 patients under her care because they or their families annoyed her.", "title": "Nurse Allegedly Killed 38 Patients Because They Annoyed Her", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/italian-nurse-accused-38-murders-after-elderly-woman-dies-suspicious-potassium-injection-306956", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/14/daniela-poggiali.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/14/daniela-poggiali.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-14T10:41:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-14T10:41:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A nurse in Italy is being accused of killing 38 patients under her care because they or their families annoyed her."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad23\"", "article_summary": "After the deaths of 37 patients under the care of a nurse in Lugo, Italy that were considered \u201cmysterious circumstances,\u201d including 10 that were \u201cvery suspicious,\u201d her colleagues started to ask questions.\nPolice also said the case involving Calderoni\u2019s death would be difficult considering how fast potassium disbands in human blood.\nWhen the post-mortem examination revealed high levels of potassium in her blood that likely triggered cardiac arrest, police started to look into Poggiali\u2019s past.\nIt wasn\u2019t until an autopsy performed on 78-year-old Rosa Calderoni revealed high levels of potassium did local police open a full investigation into Daniela Poggiali\u2019s seedy nursing practices.\nCalderoni was admitted to the Italian hospital with a routine illness, so family members were more than a little taken aback when she died."}
