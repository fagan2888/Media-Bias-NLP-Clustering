With TRIA the govern\u00adment is essentially acting as reinsurer. The government assumes some of the market terrorism risk and agrees to pay a portion of the losses over the $100 million threshold discussed earlier. The ability of the private market to shift some of the risks to the government in the event of a loss frees up capacity for the insurers, which is then made available to the consumer. Without the government acting in a reinsurance capacity, the private market would be forced to assume the entire risk, which would likely lead to little or no capacity at higher prices, particular in high risk areas.\n\nIt is important to note that the program only costs the government money in the event that the $100 million + 20% deductible threshold is reached. If losses remain below this level in any given year, then the private market is responsible for the entirety of those losses. Since TRIA\u2019s enactment in 2002 the government has not made any expenditures outside of minimal administrative costs associated with setting up the program.\n\nIf the $100 million + 20% deductible threshold is reached, and the gov\u00adernment begins to pay its share of losses, there is a mechanism in place for the government to recoup those expenditures. In the years follow\u00ading the federal sharing of losses, but prior to September 30, 2017, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to institute a surcharge on insur\u00aders to recoup 133% of the claims paid by the government. This man\u00addatory recoupment does not apply if the insurance industry\u2019s aggregate uncompensated losses exceed $27.5 billion; however, the Treasury Secre\u00adtary does retain the authority to apply a surcharge at his/her discretion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Much of the skepticism surrounding the need for the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) stems from nega\u00adtive perceptions of the government bailouts handed out to various finan\u00adcial institutions in 2008-2009 and the view that TRIA is a similar bailout for the insurance companies; TRIA, however, differs significantly in that the government\u2019s role in TRIA is to act as a reinsurer, and not as a major creditor as was the case with the financial institution bailouts.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Much of the skepticism surrounding the need for the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) stems from nega&amp;shy;tive perceptions of the government bailouts handed out to various finan&amp;shy;cial institution", "title": "TRIA (Terrorism Risk Insurance Act) Is Not a Government Bailout", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/tria-terrorism-risk-insurance-act-not-government-bailout", "image": "http://www.riskmanagementmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/grenade-1024x774.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Legal, Business, TRIA, Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, Government, Financial Institutions, bailout", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, TRIA, Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, Government, Financial Institutions, bailout"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaae3\"", "article_summary": "The government assumes some of the market terrorism risk and agrees to pay a portion of the losses over the $100 million threshold discussed earlier.\nIf losses remain below this level in any given year, then the private market is responsible for the entirety of those losses.\nWithout the government acting in a reinsurance capacity, the private market would be forced to assume the entire risk, which would likely lead to little or no capacity at higher prices, particular in high risk areas.\nSaturday, December 14, 2013Much of the skepticism surrounding the need for the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) stems from nega\u00adtive perceptions of the government bailouts handed out to various finan\u00adcial institutions in 2008-2009 and the view that TRIA is a similar bailout for the insurance companies; TRIA, however, differs significantly in that the government\u2019s role in TRIA is to act as a reinsurer, and not as a major creditor as was the case with the financial institution bailouts.\nWith TRIA the govern\u00adment is essentially acting as reinsurer."}
