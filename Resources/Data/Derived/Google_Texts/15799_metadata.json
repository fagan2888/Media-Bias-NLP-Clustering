Combine that with wingnut Noel Sheppard\u2019s freakout over san Francisco hookers signing up for the ACA, and it is now officially a Trend. of course, in this case, the women signing up are legally employed at a Nevada brothel, the Moonlight Bunny Ranch, so at least there\u2019s none of that \u201ccriminal\u201d stigma, right? Aha, well, not so much; The Blaze simply says \u201cIt\u2019s come to this\u201d and shakes its head sadly. So get ready for HookerCare to become a wingnut meme.\n\nOnce you get past the giggling over \u201cInsurance for Hoors\u201d (which you will not, because like us some part of you remains mentally 13 years old), it\u2019s not really that shocking a story \u2014 it\u2019s not like suddenly in 2014 sex workers will be seeing doctors for the very first time in history. They\u2019ll just have a more reliable way of paying for healthcare, which seems like as good an idea for hookers as it does for rightwing bloggers. And as one of the women in the USA Today report points out, insurance companies are probably getting a pretty good customer base, at least with Nevada\u2019s legal, regulated brothels like the Moonlight Bunny Ranch, where workers \u2014 who are \u201cindependent contractors,\u201d not employees \u2014 have far lower rates of STDs than streetwalkers.\n\nCue more freakouts over subsidized health care for sex workers; we\u2019d just point out that if the staff of Breitbart.com can get decent health coverage, then all other whores should be able to as well.\n\n[USA Today via Mediaite]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here's another story about sex workers who are happy to get insurance under the Affordable Care Act.
