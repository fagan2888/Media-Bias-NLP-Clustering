She is believed to be the ninth flu-related fatality in the state this flu season. Facebook\n\nIt's a heartbreaking tale that can't help but remind us of the real danger influenza brings to our doorstep every winter.\n\nAs reported by KIRO 7, Piper Lowery was a healthy, albeit asthmatic, 12-year-old girl living in Port Orchard, Washington. On January 12, however, the sixth grader came down with a high fever alongside her mother Pegy Lowery. Although both mother and child were given Tamiflu that same Tuesday and revisited the doctor twice more, Piper\u2019s symptoms only became worse. By Saturday morning, it left her vomiting up blood and she was rushed to Mary Bridge Children's Hospital in Tacoma, WH. Soon after, despite the valiant efforts of hospital staff, she would die from complications of the flu, specifically the H1N1 strain. Piper was unvaccinated.\n\n\"Her doctor said since the flu had attacked her kidneys...it was like a freight train coming that no one would have seen until it came,\" Pegy Lowery told KIRO 7.\n\nHer family remains devastated by the sudden turn of events.\"You never think they're going to die from something like this,\u201d said Pegy. \u201cShe was just our everything. She is still our everything.\"\n\nIt\u2019s believed Piper\u2019s death represents the second flu-related fatality previously announced in Washington\u2019s Kitsap County this winter, and the ninth in Washington State. It is the first pediatric flu death in the county since 2009. Local health officials hope that the case highlights the necessity of flu vaccination.\n\n\u201cThese tragedies remind us that influenza can be a very serious illness, especially in young children,\u201d Dr. Susan Turner, health officer for the Kitsap County Health District said last Wednesday, according to the Seattle Times. \u201cHaving your children and yourselves vaccinated is the best way you can protect your children from the flu.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the current pediatric death toll for the 2015-2016 flu season is at 7 (not including Piper\u2019s death), compared to 148 last season. However, health officials believe the worst of the season is yet to come and it\u2019s possible that it might continue into April.\n\nThough the vaccine isn\u2019t 100 percent guaranteed to prevent influenza, it is known that the vast majority of pediatric deaths happen among the unvaccinated. Vaccination might also offer some fringe benefits such as fewer sick days and even a slightly reduced risk of stroke.\n\nPiper\u2019s funeral was reportedly held this past Saturday at Bethany Lutheran Church in Port Orchard. \u201cI just want people to remember her smile, her smile and the freckles all over her face,\u201d Pegy tearfully told Q13 Fox.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kidney failure, flu vaccine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "12-year-old Piper Lowery of Port Orchard, Washington succumbed to complications of flu earlier this month.", "title": "Washington Girl Dies From The Flu", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/washington-girl-dies-flu-induced-kidney-failure-health-officials-remind-people-370766", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/24/piper-lowery.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "12-year-old Piper Lowery of Port Orchard, Washington succumbed to complications of flu earlier this month.", "title": "Washington Girl Dies From The Flu", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/washington-girl-dies-flu-induced-kidney-failure-health-officials-remind-people-370766", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/24/piper-lowery.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/24/piper-lowery.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-01-24T18:30:56-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-24T18:30:54-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "12-year-old Piper Lowery of Port Orchard, Washington succumbed to complications of flu earlier this month."}, "article_summary": "As reported by KIRO 7, Piper Lowery was a healthy, albeit asthmatic, 12-year-old girl living in Port Orchard, Washington.\n12-year-old Piper Lowery of Port Orchard, Washington, seen above, succumbed to complications of flu earlier this month.\nShe is believed to be the ninth flu-related fatality in the state this flu season.\nOn January 12, however, the sixth grader came down with a high fever alongside her mother Pegy Lowery.\nPiper\u2019s funeral was reportedly held this past Saturday at Bethany Lutheran Church in Port Orchard."}
