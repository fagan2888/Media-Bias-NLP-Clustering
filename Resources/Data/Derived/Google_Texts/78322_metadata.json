But what\u2019s even more shocking is how high supposedly mid-level silver-plan deductibles have gotten.\n\nThis year, Ambetter plans from Centene (CNC) broke new ground with a $6,500 silver-plan deductible as it sought to underprice the competition. The strategy seems to be paying off for the company, which is among the relatively few insurers making solid profits on the exchanges. Not only has Centene\u2019s exchange enrollment surged, but it has manged to attract a relatively healthy group of customers. That\u2019s not entirely surprising, since people expecting to have surgery, for example, would tend to choose a lower-deductible plan.\n\nNow, a regulatory filing for 2017 plans shows that Blue Cross of Idaho is set to push the envelope even further with a $6,850 silver-plan deductible and a maximum of $7,150 on out-of-pocket spending on medical services, excluding premiums.\n\nThe filing includes an example of what a plan member can expect in benefits if they have a baby with a regular delivery and no complications. The good news is that the plan will cover nearly 80% of qualifying expenses. The bad news is that the help won\u2019t kick in until after the $6,850 deductible is exhausted. The bottom line: The new mother pays $7,010 out of the $7,540 in costs.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u201caffordable care\u201d \u2014 especially after a couple earning $40,000 forks over about 8% of their income, or $3,200, for a silver plan. Still, the $6,850 deductible isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds because some benefits are provided before the deductible is met, including certain prescription drugs.\n\nIn another example, Blue Cross of Idaho details a case showing that routine maintenance of type 2 diabetes would result in $5,400 in medical expenses, with the policy holder on the hook for just $2,000.\n\nBy comparison, someone with the $6,500-deductible Centene silver plan this year would pay $3,080 for the same diabetes treatments. In other words, the fine print matters a lot.\n\nCentene\u2019s high deductibles may be one reason that the company, unlike UnitedHealth (UNH), has said it didn\u2019t experience any problems with people signing up for coverage mid-year and running up big bills.\n\nObamaCare was supposed to balance risk among all insurers by transferring funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick, but risk-adjustment hasn\u2019t worked as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer\u2019s risk. Now the Obama administration is focused on making risk-adjustment work better, with uncertain implications for insurers\u2019 profitability.\n\nBlue Cross of Idaho\u2019s highest silver-plan deductible this year is $4,000. But after hiking premiums about 22% last year and being underpriced by competitors, the company may be turning to a much higher deductible as a way to hold down premium price hikes for 2017.\n\nYet holding down premiums, while it may sound consumer friendly, can actually turn out to be the opposite when it comes to ObamaCare\u2019s subsidized customers. That\u2019s been evident in Centene markets like Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss., where the after-subsidy cost of a bronze plan is more than 20% more expensive than in the average HealthCare.gov market.\n\nThat\u2019s because offering silver plans with bronze-like deductibles, and scrunching down the cost of silver plans closer to those of bronze, shrinks the size of the available subsidies for all plans. Subsidies are based on the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan in each market.\n\nThis seems to be an issue particularly in Centene markets, because the company offers not just one, but two low-priced silver plans with bronze-like deductibles of $5,500 and $6,500. Early filings for 2017 suggest that Centene plans to stick with that strategy next year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More silver plans are carrying bronze-like deductibles, making ObamaCare look anything but affordable.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "More silver plans are carrying bronze-like deductibles, making ObamaCare look anything but affordable.", "title": "ObamaCare\u2019s Cut-The-Cord Plan: Mother Pays $7,010 For Delivery", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/policy-analysis/obamacare-silver-plan-deductibles-now-as-high-as-6850/", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Pol01-obamacare-051216-newscom.jpg", "height": 563}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Pol01-obamacare-051216-newscom.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "keywords": "obamacare deductibles,obamacare silver,obamacare bronze,obamacare", "date": "2016-05-12 09:39:07:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-12T16:39:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-12T16:39:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But what\u2019s even more shocking is how high supposedly mid-level silver-plan deductibles have gotten.\nThe bad news is that the help won\u2019t kick in until after the $6,850 deductible is exhausted.\nBy comparison, someone with the $6,500-deductible Centene silver plan this year would pay $3,080 for the same diabetes treatments.\nStill, the $6,850 deductible isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds because some benefits are provided before the deductible is met, including certain prescription drugs.\nThat\u2019s because offering silver plans with bronze-like deductibles, and scrunching down the cost of silver plans closer to those of bronze, shrinks the size of the available subsidies for all plans."}
