Auburn Journal: Uncovered California: Despite Insurance, Some Left Without Care

Charlene Sanborn loved being a mother to her three boys, and when they were grown she loved being a grandmother to their children. She would drop everything to babysit her grandchildren. In fact, she loved everybody’s children. When her boys were growing up in Placerville, the Sanborn house was the place to crash after school and on the weekends. Later, when she worked as a teacher’s aide, she went home and told her family stories of the cute things the kids had said and done that day. Growing up, the Sanborns had a lot of love, but they didn’t have much money, so their mom had gone without health insurance most of her life — until the Affordable Care Act went into effect in January, 2014, and along with so many other Californians she was able to enroll in Medi-Cal for the first time.
