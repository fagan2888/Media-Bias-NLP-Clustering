Burwell oral arguments that were heard Wednesday by the U.S. Supreme Court, Oregonians will have a difficult time forecasting its impact given Cover Oregon\u2019s convoluted track record.\n\nThe plaintiff\u2019s case in King is based on the claim that the Internal Revenue Service changed and negated the clearly stated provision in the Affordable Care Act that only people in states with state-established exchanges could get health insurance subsidies. Subsidies are now being given to people in states which have refused to establish their own exchanges.\n\nTranscripts of the oral arguments won\u2019t be available until Friday, but early reports indicate that the questioning was dominated by justices who seem to be attacking the plaintiffs in ways which would avoid engaging the IRS rewriting of the ACA provision that only people on state-established exchanges are entitled to the subsidies.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer raised issues about whether the plaintiffs have standing to sue. If the case is decided on standing, it will be a very narrowly focused decision with no impact on the ACA. On the other hand, Justice Anthony Kennedy seems to suggest it may be unconstitutional for the federal government to coerce the states into setting up the state exchanges. If the court decides that the original provision in the ACA is itself unconstitutional, all bets are off.\n\nWhat would the impact be on Oregon if the Supreme Court decided with the plaintiffs that only people on state-established exchanges would be subsidized? That question hangs on whether Oregon\u2019s exchange is \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d There is no clear answer to that question.\n\nOregon\u2019s recently resigned Gov. John Kitzhaber, a staunch supporter of the ACA, wasted somewhere between $248 and $350 million on an ambitious system, Cover Oregon. Everything about Cover Oregon failed, including the 1960s pseudo folk music video to support it. According to The Oregonian, \u201cCover Oregon closed one of the sorrier chapters in the history of Oregon state government\u201d in April 2014 when it opted to dump its troubled $248 million health insurance exchange in favor of the federal exchange.\n\nAccording to Lisa Lettenmaier of Health Resources NW, Oregon has a \u201chybrid\u201d exchange which has been called \u201cfederally assisted.\u201d\n\nMost of the published maps show Oregon as having a state-established exchange. It is commonly believed that the entire transition from the failed Cover Oregon to the failing Healthcare.gov seems to have been designed to allow Oregon\u2019s very pro Obama care\u2019s Democratic government to save face.\n\nIn any case, the government of Oregon and the Department of Health and Human Services are allowing this ambivalent status to continue. According to the Cato Institute\u2019s Michael Cannon who spoke in Portland last week at an event co-sponsored by Oregon\u2019s Cascade Policy Institute, strictly speaking, Oregon\u2019s plan no longer meets the ACA\u2019s criteria for an exchange \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d The state would have had to contract with entities subject to the laws of the state. It did not do so. But, as Cannon also claims, \u201cWhat the law says is not always what the administration does.\u201d\n\nIn keeping with the HHS agenda, Oregon had already greatly expanded its Medicaid program. As Cannon argued, Medicaid provides \u201clousy coverage.\u201d Last year, a federally-funded study in Oregon showed that when people newly enrolled in Medicaid were compared with people who had applied but were not enrolled, the people who did not receive Medicaid were healthier.\n\nThe studies also showed that emergency room use, hospital stays, and medical costs per patient increased under Medicaid. But, as Cannon also pointed out, Medicaid does not affect the middle class and so the King decision may not have a direct impact on Medicaid. The subsidized insurance on the exchanges does directly impact the middle class, however.\n\nIf, as the state government claims, Oregon has a state exchange, King v Burwell will not affect Oregon\u2019s ACA program. If Oregon\u2019s is not actually an exchange \u201cestablished by the state,\u201d than King v. Burwell could impact health care and taxes in very positive ways.\n\nAccording to a press release by Cannon and Cascade Policy Institute\u2019s Steve Buckstein, \u201cIf subsides are denied under a King ruling, Oregon will join the majority of states in reaping benefits.\u201d If the King ruling goes with the plaintiffs, \u201capproximately 157,000 individuals likely will be freed from the law\u2019s individual mandate requirement,\u201d and 890,000 working Oregonians \u201calso would be freed from the employer mandates that are putting downward pressure on our economy.\u201d\n\nWhether or not the plaintiffs are successful in King, which would gut the ACA, our health care system still needs to be fixed. States like Indiana are developing Medicaid systems which allow for a maximum amount of personal choice by patients. Other states are looking at other alternatives as are Republicans in Congress like U.S. Congressman Paul Ryan, who worked with Oregon\u2019s own Sen. Ron Wyden to develop a more bi-partisan plan.\n\nAs one of the speakers at the demonstrations outside the Supreme Court said, there are a lot of good ideas out there. There are ways forward that would allow people to make their own health care decisions.\u00ad\n\nThe Supreme Court is slated to deliver its decision on King v. Burwell in June.\n\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "If the Supreme Court decides with the plaintiffs of King v.
