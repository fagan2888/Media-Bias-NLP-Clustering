An easy glance at the data shows Americans are going to bed each night with full bellies and whetted appetites. Our obesity rate is climbing \u2014 among both adults and adolescents \u2014 which has to mean we\u2019re eating. Americans, it would seem, are doing many things, but going hungry is not one of them.\n\nUnfortunately, here may be a case where the numbers do lie, or at least conceal. Take the Food Security Index, a measure of global access to food, broken down by country. The United States ranks first. Our food is the most affordable and available, and it ranks fifth in quality and safety. Last year, the anti-poverty nonprofit Oxfam released research that showed the U.S. ranks 21st out of 125 countries in healthy eating. So how come, with all this food inside our borders, are so many families going hungry?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard for the last several years from our food banks that there\u2019s a growing need among military families for food assistance,\u201d said Maura Daly, a spokeswoman for Feeding America, a nationwide nonprofit food bank network, to NBC News.\n\nOn Monday, Feeding America released its 2014 survey of food insecurity among military veterans and their families. The survey found 25 percent of military personnel, or at least one person in 620,000 households, active duty and reserve status, is seeking aid from food pantries and other charitable programs across the country. Another 2.37 million households, including veterans, receive aid from Feeding America\u2019s network.\n\nWe may be food secure, but only in the aggregate. Just as the gulf between the richest and poorest Americans has widened over the preceding decades, food security has run in parallel. We have vast amounts of food, but access tilts heavily toward the side of the dollar signs. Food that nourishes isn\u2019t cheap and doesn\u2019t keep. The foods that stay fresh \u2014 or at least don\u2019t spoil \u2014 are the ones packed with preservatives like sugar and salt, and offer maximal calories with few nutrients.\n\n\"Food is very, very cheap in the U.S. compared to most countries,\" explained Max Lawson, Head of Global Policy and Campaigns at Oxfam, to NPR. \"But the fact is you end up with people malnourished in one of the richest countries because they don't have access to fresh vegetables at a cheap enough price to make a balanced diet.\"\n\nFinancial security lies at the root of this problem, as eking out a decent living in the military takes a lifetime of service. And even then, there are no guarantees. This year\u2019s figures for the Department of Defense\u2019s pay grade show a newly enlisted soldier will earn $18,000 for her service at the outset. Nearly two decades down the road, after the soldier has sunk a quarter of her life into defending the country\u2019s freedom, her salary will still hover around $65,000 a year.\n\nFor many families, tax-free allowances for housing, clothing, and food do little more than stop the bleeding. After the basics have been covered, there are still the matters of covering the costs of rent, utilities, medicine, and whatever additional food the family needs to survive. Too often, they are forced to sacrifice one for another.\n\n\u201cYou're robbing Peter to pay Paul most of the time,\u201d said Lindsey Yetter, a teaching assistant at a preschool, to NBC News. Yetter\u2019s husband, Adam, is a Petty Officer 1st Class in the U.S. Navy and has been serving for the last 17 years. Along with their three sons, the Yetters recently moved into a two-bedroom apartment and share it with another Navy family that includes two sons of its own. The Yetters have become incessant coupon clippers, regular recyclers, and Adam Yetter has made it a bi-weekly habit to donate plasma at the local blood bank.\n\nThe family\u2019s situation is a prime example of the limits of federal aid. After 17 years of service, Yetter makes $75,000 a year. According to a study released in March by the Center on Policy Initiatives, even if the Yetters were to drop in size from five family members to four, estimates still suggest they\u2019d need an extra $10,000 a year to stay afloat. Side- and odd-jobs are built-in to the lifestyle.\n\n\u201cIt's hard to find different ways and tricks. And everyone's always looking,\u201d Lindsey Yetter said. \u201cAt military handouts the lines are long. People are selling things or working from home. I'd say the majority of military families are always trying to find another source of income.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, while both heads of the Yetter household struggle to find more stable sources of income, Lindsey Yetter reassures her sons, ages 6, 8, and 10, that bouncing from apartment to apartment is just a \u201ctemporary adventure, hopefully.\u201d\n\nFor now, she at least has the benefit of age. Kids relish in what\u2019s new, but the \u201chopefully\u201d she adds to the adventure\u2019s transience seems to imply that newness could expire. For this one military family, like the rest of the military families who are forced to sacrifice precious moments enjoying life to keep from drowning, time could be running out.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hunger, america, military, families, feel, financial, strains, despite, countrys, food", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In the most well-stocked country on earth, food insecurity causes many military families to make extreme sacrifices.", "title": "Military Families Are Famished, Despite America's Food Surpluses", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hunger-america-military-families-feel-financial-strains-despite-countrys-food-security-298546", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/18/militaryfamilies.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the most well-stocked country on earth, food insecurity causes many military families to make extreme sacrifices.", "title": "Military Families Are Famished, Despite America's Food Surpluses", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hunger-america-military-families-feel-financial-strains-despite-countrys-food-security-298546", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/18/militaryfamilies.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/18/militaryfamilies.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-18T15:54:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-18T15:54:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In the most well-stocked country on earth, food insecurity causes many military families to make extreme sacrifices."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b42\"", "article_summary": "Take the Food Security Index, a measure of global access to food, broken down by country.\nFor this one military family, like the rest of the military families who are forced to sacrifice precious moments enjoying life to keep from drowning, time could be running out.\nJust as the gulf between the richest and poorest Americans has widened over the preceding decades, food security has run in parallel.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard for the last several years from our food banks that there\u2019s a growing need among military families for food assistance,\u201d said Maura Daly, a spokeswoman for Feeding America, a nationwide nonprofit food bank network, to NBC News.\nOn Monday, Feeding America released its 2014 survey of food insecurity among military veterans and their families."}
