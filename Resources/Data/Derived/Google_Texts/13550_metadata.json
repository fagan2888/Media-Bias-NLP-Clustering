That makes sense. The Spurs are a likable group, with an older core of players perhaps chasing a last title. And they\u2019re trying to dethrone a team that was built in large part on big-name free agents, including one who took his \u201ctalents to South Beach.\u201d\n\nBut even if more Americans will be rooting for the Spurs over the next week or two, there is little question that the Heat have more fans than the Spurs do. The map here is based on a large database provided to The Upshot by Facebook, which we used last month to create a national map of N.B.A. fandom.\n\nPhoto\n\nBased on estimates derived from which teams people \u201clike\u201d on Facebook, the map is simply a head-to-head comparison between the Heat and the Spurs. Any ZIP code where there are more Heat fans than Spurs fans is red (and the redder it is, the bigger the gap). Any gray or black-shaded ZIP code is Spurs country.\n\nThough San Antonio is one of the three most successful teams over the last 15 years, along with the Heat and the Lakers, the map shows that the Spurs have not built a national fan base. They remain a highly regional team, with fans concentrated in Texas (and among Texans scattered around the country). Even the Oklahoma City Thunder, a team that didn\u2019t exist until 2008, have more fans outside their home region than the Spurs.\n\nThe Heat and the Lakers, on the other hand, are the closest things that the N.B.A. has to the Yankees and the Red Sox \u2014 teams with a national following. All of which may well be one more reason for fans of neither team to root for San Antonio when the finals begin on Thursday night.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140605123712, "twitter": {"description": "Even if more Americans wind up rooting for the Spurs in the N.B.A. finals, the Heat will still have many more committed fans.", "title": "In Terms of Fans, the Heat Have Already Beaten the Spurs", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/upshot/in-terms-of-fans-the-heat-have-already-beaten-the-spurs.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002919826"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/05/upshot/05up-nba-finals/05up-nba-finals-thumbLarge-v2.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/upshot/in-terms-of-fans-the-heat-have-already-beaten-the-spurs.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002919826", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/upshot/in-terms-of-fans-the-heat-have-already-beaten-the-spurs.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "hdl_p": "If Fans Were Points, the Heat Would Beat the Spurs Easily", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 5, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/david_leonhardt/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2014-06-06", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Facebook Inc", "published": "2014-06-05", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "keywords": "NBA Championship,Miami Heat,San Antonio Spurs,Maps,Basketball,Facebook Inc", "description": "Even if more Americans wind up rooting for the Spurs in the N.B.A. finals, the Heat will still have many more committed fans.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Josh Katz and David Leonhardt", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/05/upshot/05up-nba-finals/05up-nba-finals-thumbLarge-v2.png", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "06up-nba-finals", "byl": "By JOSH KATZ and DAVID LEONHARDT", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Even if more Americans wind up rooting for the Spurs in the N.B.A. finals, the Heat will still have many more committed fans.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/05/upshot/05up-nba-finals/05up-nba-finals-thumbStandard-v2.png", "news_keywords": "Map,Basketball", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Facebook Inc", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140606135610, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/06/upshot/in-terms-of-fans-the-heat-have-already-beaten-the-spurs.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/05/upshot/05up-nba-finals/05up-nba-finals-videoSixteenByNine1050.png", "type": "article", "description": "Even if more Americans wind up rooting for the Spurs in the N.B.A. finals, the Heat will still have many more committed fans.", "title": "In Terms of Fans, the Heat Have Already Beaten the Spurs"}, "pdate": 20140605, "des": "Basketball", "articleid": 100000002919826, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "In Terms of Fans, the Heat Have Already Beaten the Spurs", "col": "Miami Wins the Map", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87b4\"", "article_summary": "Any ZIP code where there are more Heat fans than Spurs fans is red (and the redder it is, the bigger the gap).\nfinals assumes that most Americans are rooting for the Spurs to beat the Heat.\nEven the Oklahoma City Thunder, a team that didn\u2019t exist until 2008, have more fans outside their home region than the Spurs.\nPhotoBased on estimates derived from which teams people \u201clike\u201d on Facebook, the map is simply a head-to-head comparison between the Heat and the Spurs.\nThey remain a highly regional team, with fans concentrated in Texas (and among Texans scattered around the country)."}
