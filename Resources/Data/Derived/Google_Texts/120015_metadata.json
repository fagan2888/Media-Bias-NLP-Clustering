Do editors even care when basic \"facts\" are wrong?\u2014by A Siegel: \"Recently, The New Yorker's editors failed their readers by publishing Jonathan Franzen's Birds-Climate without\u2014it seems\u2014giving a serious look at assertions and basic failures. Newsweek's editors have done a similar\u2014if not more serious\u2014disservice to their readers with the publication of Randy Simmons' broadside attack on wind power. Simmons, in short, argues that government subsidy of wind power (such as the Production Tax Credit) is counter-productive and too costly. As with Franzen's piece, books could be dedicated to dissecting this one article and providing more accurate discussions to support public debate and discussion. This article gets things wrong on so many levels: from misstatements on basic facts, to misrepresentations, to playing with statistics, to not addressing fundamental issues to ... Follow after the fold for three examples.\"\n\nBad for planned Pacific NW Coal Mega-Ports: China's demand for imported coal fell 42%\u2014by Lefty Coaster: \"The business case for ever building two coal export mega-terminals in the Pacific Northwest is falling apart. From the Guardian: China\u2019s coal imports fell by nearly half in the first three months of the year as the slowing economy and tougher rules on pollution took their toll. Imports by the world\u2019s biggest coal consumer reached 49.07m tonnes in the first quarter, a fall of 42% on the same period a year ago according to data from the Chinese customs office. Trade figures for March showed that imports were down overall by 12.3% while exports badly missed expectations, falling 15% from a year earlier.\"\n\nglobal oil output continues to hit records, leaving big banks on the hook for fracking losses, et al\u2014by rjsigmund: \"among the highlights of this weeks news, legislators in Maryland have banned fracking in that state until at least October 2017, as their House passed a measure on Friday by a 102-34 margin to prohibit issuance of drilling permits for the process at least until that time... more than 100 business owners in the Western part of the state thought to have exploitable shale had signed a letter to the leadership of the General Assembly in support of the fracking moratorium...earlier in the weektheir Senate had passed a similar measure by a 45 to 2 margin, so although the governor has taken no position on the measure, the margin in both houses in obviously veto-proof... the week also saw the publication of a new study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health that found elevated levels of toxic radon gas in Pennsylvania homes near sites where fracking was taking place... researchers analyzed more than 860,000 indoor radon measurements from a Pennsylvania Department of Environment Protection database and found that overall ambient levels of the gas, the 2nd leading cause of lung cancer after smoking, have been on the increase since 2004, and that buildings in areas with fracked wells nearby had significantly higher readings of radon compared with buildings in low fracking-activity areas...\"\n\nFukushima Unit-1 Inspection: Another One Bites the Dust\u2014by Joieau: \"On Saturday, April 10 TEPCO inserted IRID's nifty new shape-changing robot into the first floor level of containment in Daiichi unit-1 to inspect damage and maybe find the missing core. This was the same unit that was muon scanned last month by two units from the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization [KEK] in Tsukuba, Japan. The scanners revealed that there is no fuel in the reactor vessel, so it was hoped the robot could get all the way around the interior containment catwalk to take photos, video and readings on radiation levels and temperature. Unfortunately, the robot only made it 2/3 of the way around, and then it died. Well, it didn't die completely, it just stopped taking commands from its operators and cannot move or change shape. For awhile there, it was still transmitting data. According to an IRID official, the operators tugged on the robot's cable and sent instructions for it to change shape, but it still would not move. The robot's camera, dosimeter and temperature gauge were not damaged, and the robot was still capable of transmitting data. Neither TEPCO nor IRID have released any of the inspection data so far, but there was apparently 'debris' in the area where the unit stopped moving.\"\n\nRenewables & Conservation\n\nHow to Make Solar \"Plug and Play\"\u2014by HannahMiller: \"The thousands of solar installers in Colorado \u2013 as in many other states \u2013 have a hard time developing energy regulation. As with most other green businesses, they are often small shops in a nascent industry. Since the rules about rooftop solar are local (decided by towns or counties), more than half the cost of installation are now the \u201csoft costs\u201d of permitting and inspection, said Rebecca Cantwell, executive director of the Colorado Solar Energy Industries Association (COSEIA). But COSEIA\u2019s Solar Communities program has made strides so far in streamlining the installation process, offering a $500 discount for customers of participating companies. The organization now hopes to expand its program to the rest of the country. Solar Communities is a program sponsored by a Department of Energy grant through the Sunshot Initiative and managed by COSEIA, which works directly with local governments to help them implement 12 best practices for rooftop solar. So far, Solar Communities has certified 16 communities in Colorado as 'solar-friendly' cities, ranging from Denver to Lyons. This covers over half the population of the state.\"\n\nFracking\n\nThe Mother Frackers think we are stupid\u2014by DWG: \"They are celebrating over in Frackerville. They scored a peer-reviewed paper in a decent journal. According to industry astroturf Energy in Depth, this new paper will 'discredit Duke methane papers.' Those 'flawed' studies found that the concentrations of methane, ethane, and other gases were substantially higher in wells close to active hydraulic fracturing operations. Heads exploded in Frackerville when they read this research article published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: Distance to gas wells was also the most significant factor for Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses (P < 0.01). For ethane concentrations, distance to gas wells was the only statistically significant factor (P < 0.005). Isotopic signatures (\u03b413C-CH4, \u03b413C-C2H6, and \u03b42H-CH4), hydrocarbon ratios (methane to ethane and propane), and the ratio of the noble gas 4He to CH4 in groundwater were characteristic of a thermally postmature Marcellus-like source in some cases. Overall, our data suggest that some homeowners living <1 km from gas wells have drinking water contaminated with stray gases. <.i> That conclusion probably gave more than a few investors heartburn. It invites meddlesome regulations and requires larger campaign contributions to keep politicians turning a blind eye. Really dangerous in the hands of the good lawyer.\"\n\nKeystone XL & Other Fossil Fuel Transportation\n\nObama Administration Issues Pipeline Safety Bulletin for Submerged Water Crossings\u2014by LakeSuperior: \"The Obama Administration Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issues a pipeline safety bulletin in today's Federal Register pertinent to operations throughout the United States: Pipeline Safety: Potential for Damage to Pipeline Facilities Caused by Flooding, River Scour, and River Channel Migration. Some of the recent spills on the Yellowstone River were mentioned.\"\n\nClimate Chaos\n\nHow Hot Can It Get? Here's How Hot.\u2014by Dartagnan: \"Most reputable climate scientists project a global environmental catastrophe (such as the irreversible loss of the Greenland ice sheet, for example, causing sea levels to rise on the order of 23 feet) if and when temperatures reach 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above the mean temperature that existed at the start of the Industrial Revolution. We have already warmed the Earth approximately 1.7 degrees F. since that time. Utilizing current technologies (and with a nod towards profitability), extraction of currently known recoverable fossil-based fuels will warm the planet an additional 2.8 degrees F., or 4.5 degrees F., well beyond the 'disaster' consensus. Michael Greenstone of the University of Chicago has now calculated how hot the world will get if we extract and use all of the available fossil fuels accessible (though not necessarily cost-efficiently), through current technology, including coal, shale and oil, rather than leave them in the ground. In an article written for The New York Times, Greenstone concludes:[T]he use of all reserves and resources would lead to a total increase of 16.2 degrees. Today\u2019s climate and planet would very likely be unrecognizable.\"\n\nGreenland permafrost thawing a lot faster than we thought causing danger of 'feedback loops'\u2014by VL Baker: \"We're living in a time of extreme weather and crisis. And now, it seems that the dominos are falling faster and faster as dreaded 'feedback loops' begin to kick in. A new study published this week in Nature Climate Change shows that Greenland's permafrost may be thawing faster than we thought. [T]he research shows that tiny microbes trapped in Greenland\u2019s permafrost are becoming active as the climate warms and the permafrost begins to thaw. As those microbes become active, they are feeding on previously-frozen organic matter, producing heat, and threatening to thaw the permafrost even further. [...] The big worry climate scientists have about thawing permafrost is that the frozen soil is chock-full of carbon. That carbon is supposed to be strongly trapped inside the soil, precisely because it\u2019s supposed to be permanently frozen \u2014 hence, 'permafrost.' However, as temperatures in the Arctic have risen due to human-caused climate change, permafrost is thawing, and therefore releasing some of that trapped carbon into the atmosphere.\"\n\nTrouble at Totten Glacier\u2014by greenman3610: \"The latest \u201cThis is Not Cool\u201d video is the third in a trilogy of very important, and sobering, pieces I\u2019ve posted over the last year. I didn\u2019t start with a trilogy in mind, but the developments of the last few months have been jarring and momentous. Chris Mooney wrote recently in The Washington Post, \u201cA hundred years from now, humans may remember 2014 as the year that we first learned that we may have irreversibly destabilized the great ice sheet of West Antarctica, and thus set in motion more than 10 feet of sea level rise.\u201d. He added, 'Meanwhile, 2015 could be the year of the double whammy\u2014when we learned the same about one gigantic glacier of East Antarctica, which could set in motion roughly the same amount all over again.'\"\n\nClimate is a world wide system\u2014by don mikulecky: \"Recent articles about the climate have been disturbing not only for their predictions but because they demonstrate the problem that dealing with pieces of the system can create. For example: West coast 'blob' may be to blame for drought and cold. This is but one of many 'explanations' for last winter's weather that may or may not be accurate and may or may not be tied to climate change as the author says very clearly. Then there is this one talking about the 'Tipping Point.' It lists a lot of things to be concerned about but makes the notion of tipping point a bit confusing because it is used in so many different ways. Then there is a bit of waffling here: Permafrost may not be the ticking 'carbon bomb' scientists once thought. There are plenty more but we need no more to ask some serious questions about the effect of all this on the public. Read on below and I will once again make my case for using systems science rather than a piecemeal approach.\"\n\nMerchants of Doubt: More than just a movie review\u2014a challenge to conservatives on climate change\u2014by David B Goldstein : \"I don\u2019t see a lot of movies, except on airplanes, and this is not the kind of movie that airlines like to show. The film is a documentary about how climate change deniers twist the truth and cast doubt on theories that are scientifically well established, reflecting a combination of interest-group money and personal ideological motivations. [...] First, they argue that climate science is not conclusive about the risks of climate pollution. The film showed how through having high-visibility spokesmen say things that were just plain incorrect they were able to create public doubt and to make climate denial a touchstone of faith for conservatives. But one thing the show talked about, but didn\u2019t note the significance of, was that the denial faction had managed to frame the issue incorrectly. The issue, as we have all heard it debated, is 'are we sure that human activity is already causing climate change?' But that is not the policy issue we have to deal with as a nation and as a civilization. If we have already affected climate, that may be a problem, but it is a fact. What is interesting is the question: 'Will future greenhouse pollution cause climate change?' Because when the question is framed properly the evidence is not just overwhelming, it is beyond doubt.\"\n\nDeniers Defend Denier-for-Hire\u2014by ClimateDenierRoundup: \"In a rather bizarre move, the co-authors of Willie Soon's most recent paper have issued a letter to Soon's employer, essentially throwing Smithsonian under the bus in a futile effort to salvage Soon's reputation. The letter argues that Soon was right to hide his fossil-fuel-funding in the conflict of interest disclosures for his studies, because he was required to do so by his contract, even though he himself did not sign it! Southern Company and the Smithsonian were the signatories, so of course they are to blame and not Soon, who actually took the money and wrote industry-friendly studies without disclosing the financial relationship, thereby breaking journal disclosure rules. It's surprising the co-authors would attack the Smithsonian, considering that Soon's affiliation with this highly regarded institution is about the only thing giving his name any credibility at all. In a post at WUWT, Monckton, Legates and Briggs call attention to the letter and request that, \"all supporters of Dr. Willie Soon\" sign on to the letter. They didn't specify whether Soon's fossil-fuel-funders were who they meant by 'supporters.'\"\n\nAs sea level rise accelerates, buying shorefront property becomes a game of musical chairs\u2014by Ivy Main: \"Although Hampton Roads gets most of the media attention, sea level rise threatens the entire Virginia coastline and the tidal portions of rivers, including the Potomac River all the way up to Alexandria and Washington, D.C. A whole lot of people should be consulting topographic maps before they make their next real estate decision. fThe Sierra Club report focuses in on specific timeframes that matter in real estate decisions: twenty-five years for short-term projects, fifty years for new homes, and a hundred years for infrastructure projects. With a one-foot margin of safety added in, the report recommends that anyone considering a new project or building today with a 50-year expected life should plan for as much as 3.7 feet of sea level rise over the 1992 baseline. That number becomes 5.5-7.2 feet when the planning horizon is extended out a hundred years, to 2115.\"\n\nClimate change = positive feedback loops galore.\u2014by don mikulecky: \"Once again the ability to predict and anticipate depends upon models created by the same species that is at the root of causing the problem. No one seems to seriously question the fallibility of our minds as long as we have our \"science\". Yet that very reductionist science turned nature into a machine to be manipulated by anyone capable of using the limited knowledge the scientists generated. Now we are confronted daily, it seems, with hard evidence of how little we really know. Once again as scientists look deeper into what is happening their eyes become opened a little more. I say this as a scientist who spent his life learning about how little we really know. Today I read this: Why This New Study On Arctic Permafrost Is So Scary. Scientists might have to change their projected timelines for when Greenland\u2019s permafrost will completely melt due to man-made climate change, now that new research from Denmark has shown it could be thawing faster than expected.\"\n\nRequiem for glaciers (and climate science) in Canada\u2014by DWG: \"Nature Geoscience just published a sobering look at likely deglaciation in Western Canada during the 21st century with continued carbon emissions. The research team led by Garry Clarke of the University of British Columbia developed models that incorporate ice dynamics physics with existing surface mass models. Using global climate models to project temperature and precipitation projections with \"business as usual\" carbon emissions, the models indicate that glacial ice mass in this region will decrease by 70% from its 2005 footprint by the end of the century. [...] Think of this as yet another chapter in the water crises that will be the hallmark of the 21st century. Climate change and unsustainable agricultural uses of water have conspired to put California into a drought with profound economic implications. Syria fell into civil war after a prolonged drought wiped out agricultural productivity in rural parts of the country. Blood shed in South Sudan and other sub-Saharan countries has become all too common during water shortages. Freshwater reserves in China are under pressure from climate change, industrial use, and pollution. Ditto in India. The list goes on. And on.\"\n\nWSJ Continues Climate Contrarianism\u2014by ClimateDenierRoundup: \"The Wall Street Journal has an opinion piece, \"Calling Obama's Bluff on Climate Change,\" by Steven Hayward, who is identified as a visiting professor at Pepperdine. What the WSJ fails to mention, however, are his numerous ties to fossil-fuel-funded groups\u2014Hayward was formerly the director and treasurer for Donors Capital Fund, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, and a board member of CFACT. The piece, while relatively short, is packed full of the WSJ's usual climate misinformation. Hayward's intention is to explain how 'the GOP Congress can get ahead of Mr. Obama' before the upcoming Paris climate change agreement. He suggests Congress can pass some bills to tie Obama's hands, but acknowledges this advice is of limited utility, because ' Mr. Obama would surely veto the bills.' Hayward is basing most of his objections on the false belief that the agreement shaping up for Paris is identical to the Kyoto Protocol. (Spoiler: the Paris agreement is designed to overcome the challenges of Kyoto, so it's as though Hayward wrote his article about Kyoto and just changed the name without bothering to read up on the new agreement.) For more detail, Neil Bhatiya explains all the pieces that Hayward gets completely wrong.\"\n\n25,000 March for Climate Action (in the Snow)\n\n\u2014by ClimateDenierRoundup: \"At WUWT, frequent contributor Bob Tisdale has posted an open letter to three of the Senate's leading climate change deniers: Ted Cruz, James Inhofe and Marco Rubio. In it, Tisdale poses four questions to the senators about climate models and taxpayer funding, and then provides long-winded explanations for each. The first question asks why taxpayers are funding models when models aren't simulating Earth's climate. Tisdale bases his question on a 2007 essay by Kevin Trenberth (borrowing his scientific credibility). Trenberth's essay is relatively complex, dealing with the difference between predictions and projections. Tisdale, of course, mines for quotes and misrepresents the essay to suggest that climate models \"are not simulating Earth's climate\" and model funding is wasted. In reality, Trenberth's essay says that it's imperative we have a \"climate information system that ... initializes models and makes predictions.' Models are the best way to see what the future has in store, which is the reason why they get funding. Next, Tisdale asks why we're funding new model research when each generation of models provides the same basic answer. Well, that's because the models don't just show 'climate change is happening,' but each generation of models provides a finer-grade resolution with important implications for regional impacts. Tisdale might as well ask why we kept inventing new microscopes when they give the same basic answer as Leeuwenhoek's original, way back in the 1600s.\"\n\nCritters & the Great Outdoors\n\nIn Defense of \"Clean\" coal -OR- Can't a Couple of Crawdads Take One For the Team?!?\u2014by docclay: \"I woke up this lazy Saturday morning and checked out the Twitter feed and what to my wondering eyes should appear but a Scientific American Tweet about Conservation Group Seeks Protection for Endangered Crayfish, Gets Newly Discovered Species as a Bonus. Now normally you'd think that this would be a generally good finding (or at least neutral depending on how you view your freshwater crustaceans). Ah, but there you would be wrong. It seems that some intrepid laissez-faire culture warrior, Trumandog22, opines in response to said article claiming that there are entirely too, too many species being offered up by an outfit called the Center for Biological Diversity, or CBD (a pinko name if ever I heard one). They proposed governmental protection of the Big Sandy crayfish and the Fish and Wildlife Service is actually going to do it! So upon much intense internal debate on my part, I decided to become a fellow Supply Side Warrior and take up my pen (or keyboard in this case) to join in battle against such eco terrorists and other forces of the \"left\" in this country who would gladly sacrifice our nations energy security and economic future, all to save a few mudbugs. Don't that beat all?\"\n\n\n\nDawn Chorus: It's A Cooper's Hawk (Or Is It?) \u2014by: \"Our title references two things. One is an experience I had long ago while doing field work in Phoenix. I stopped to take a look at a raptor flying by and some guy who was passing called out 'It's a Cooper's Hawk.' I told the friend I was with that, whatever else it was, it was not a Cooper's hawk (it was buteo of some sort). My memory of the details of the event are hazy and the only reason I remember it is that my friend (he was a biologist but definitely not a birder) was quite taken with the phrase and would often repeat it, saying 'It's a Cooper's hawk' imitating the rather yokelish accent of that long ago passer by whenever any kind of sizable bird might be seen. The second reference is to the notorious difficulty of distinguishing Cooper's and Sharp-shinned hawks. The most obvious difference between the two is size but there is overlap and size is not always easy to estimate from a distance.\"\n\nSterling Nature Center - April 15, 2015 - A Photo Diary\u2014by boriscleto:\n\nThe Daily Bucket - gleaming cormorants \u2014by: \". Pelagic Cormorants are never so gleaming as they are in spring. With the start of the breeding season their freshly donned plumage is bright and unworn, patterned and accented to attract the perfect mate. Considering that these are essentially black birds, and that males and females are alike, their appearance is spectacular. To me anyway - I've been watching these birds at the Anacortes ferry dock for the last few years, and this spring display is a special treat to catch, even for just a few minutes at a time when I am en route home from the mainland. Their iridescence is at maximum. How many colors do you see in those black feathers?\"\n\nThe Daily Bucket: Some Random Photos\u2014by Lenny Flank.\n\nA Giant Conflict of Interest: Big Oil Lobbyist's Oversight of Marine Protected Areas\u2014by Dan Bacher: \"In one of the biggest and most overlooked environmental scandals in recent California history, a prominent oil industry lobbyist served as a high ranking official overseeing the creation of marine protected areas in Southern California, as well as sitting on a federal marine protected areas advisory panel. Catherine Reheis-Boyd, President of the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA), the most powerful corporate lobbying group in Sacramento, chaired the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) Initiative Blue Ribbon Task Force to create so-called 'marine protected areas' in Southern California from 2009 to 2011. [...] During the period from 2004 to 2012, she also served on the task forces for the Central Coast, North Central Coast and North Coast. Under her leadership, she and other corporate interests made sure that oil industry operations, including fracking operations in Southern California waters, weren\u2019t impacted at all by the creation of so-called -marine protected areas.' In the violation of the provisions of the Marine Life Protection Act of 1999, these 'marine protected areas' fail to protect the ocean from fracking, oil drilling, pollution, military testing and all human impacts on the ocean other than fishing and gathering.\"\n\n\n\nThe Daily Bucket: The Great Blue Heron on Bellingham Bay \u2013 Heronries and Habitat Preservation \u2014by: \"My favorite picture of a GBH taken in the Padden Creek estuary within a quarter mile of the Heronry. This was taken a few years ago in early spring, about now. The Great Blue Heron (GBH; Ardea herodias) is found in all parts of North and Central America. Although many areas like to claim them as their own, residents of Puget Sound and the Salish Sea in particular, feel a strong affinity for these statuesque creatures. To most locals, they are right up there with eagles and gulls as being part of our \u201cnative\u201d landscape and part of our ecosystem. While not endangered at this time, they are considered a species of interest. As is probably of true a large number of heronries and their habitats around the country, our local ones have been encroached upon by development, polluted by industry, and degraded by loss of habitat. We have four such heronries in Whatcom County (the far northwestern corner of Washington State), and all have required preservation and reparation efforts to keep them viable. Recently significant restoration efforts have been taken locally and the Great Blue Heron (GBH) seems to be holding its own. This diary shows our local GBHs from one heronry that has survived in spite of habitat loss and industrial encroachment to within 30 yards of its closest nesting trees.\" Natural Wanderings: Angus Gholson Jr. Nature Park \u2014by: \"Well, another volunteer day out in my favorite piece of woods. I'll be honest, it may be a workday but mostly I'm out there deep in the woods to explore and see wonderful plants in bloom. So, let's jump right into the photos with one of the most beautiful, endangered plants: Fringed Campion. This plant (Silene catesbaei) is endemic to South Georgia/North Florida. Its endangered status is because of loss of habitat like so many others. It doesn't take kindly to clearcutting timber or burning or disturbance or any number of things we do to the land and call it progress. This plant's little bit of territory is on the slopes by the Apalachicola River. It may be endangered but we saw dozens of them; 'locally abundant' as my friend Leigh would say.\"\n\nSomeone released their goldfish and now there are thousands of goldfish taking over a Colorado lake\u2014by Walter Einenkel: \"As beautiful as it may seem to watch thousands of goldfish swim about in late afternoon light of a Boulder, Colorado day, for the Parks and Wildlife, it's a huge headache. The exotic species, which were first noted by Boulder Open Space Rangers March 13, are now present in the thousands and will likely need to be removed to maintain the integrity of the lake. 'Goldfish are not a native species and are very harmful to the local aquatic ecosystem,' said Kristin Cannon, district wildlife manager for Boulder. 'We strongly encourage the public not to dump their unwanted pet fish in our waters. It is bad for our environment as well as illegal.' This is a big problem, as any non-native species in an area can knock out the balance of a sensitive ecosystem.\"\n\nThe Daily Bucket - Lake Chabot Herons\u2014by enhydra lutris: \"Lake Chabot (Castro Valley), CA. I've been reporting on the Great Blue Heron rookery at Lake Chabot, California for some time. The final (I think) 2013 bucket is The Daily Bucket - Lake Chabot Heron Report wih a link to its predecessor, etc. Last year was kind of messed up, herons in general started nesting early in this area, but this particular rookery failed completely. There are buckets on that too. So far this year it has been a dud, but we got good news on April sixth. One of the Park staff told us that there were at least two if not three nests on the island they had relocted to after the eagles drove them out of their traditional site. While we did not see them ourselves, this person is a reputable source and we did see tow out foraging.\"\n\n\n\nTop Comments: Spring Flora and Fauna in Austin, TX \u2014by: \"It's springtime in Austin and that's pretty nice. It isn't hot yet and nights and mornings are still cool for the most part. We have had a ton of rain in the last 6 months, bringing much needed relief from this major drought. I see Austin is just outside the color lines and into normal territory and that means everything when the Edwards Aquifer and Lake Travis (52.5 feet below full), both sources of drinking water for the region, are still way, way low after years of parching, out-of-control impermeable development and wasteful usage. Fingers crossed, prayers, smudges, chants and meditations for a similar relief for our friends on the West Coast and everywhere rain is needed. These last months of rain have made for a gorgeous opening to the year. While underground and in the waterways there remains a serious problem, wet soil up top promotes a lovely show of flora and fauna alike at the edge of the Hill Country. Bluebonnets abound and so do oxeyes, phlox and many others. Ladybird Johnson's legacy of highway beautification is really picking up steam and now is the time when sunny weekends have folks pulled over alongside vast stretches of flowers, sometimes in their fanciest clothes, to take family portraits and pictures of their kids or themselves or their partners sitting amongst the booming colors of a Central Texas Spring.\"\n\nCalifornia's Twin Tunnels Plan Abandons Fish Protection, Public Participation\u2014by Dan Bacher: \"The Center for Biological Diversity also responded to the Brown administration\u2019s revelation that the twin tunnels project to divert water from the San Francisco Bay-Delta to Southern California and industrial agribusinesses \u201cno longer includes provisions to protect habitat for endangered salmon and smelt and more than 50 other imperiled species.' 'The new plan is a giant step backward,' said Chelsea Tu, a staff attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. If it goes through, this massive project\u2019s boosters will be able to build these tunnels without having to do anything to protect our wildlife and waters \u2014 and will neatly sidestep input from the public.' 'This backdoor process will waste more taxpayer money and kill more Delta species like endangered salmon and smelt,' she stated.\"\n\nEnvironmental Matters: Election 2016\n\nMarco Rubio is in. But he doesn't believe and this could derail his candidacy\u2014by VL Baker: \"Marco Rubio has declared his candidacy for the presidency. Two of the major republican 2016 candidates from Florida? How does this make sense for the GOP? But both Rubio and Bush have a major problem in confronting their Florida constituents; they both, to different degrees, don't believe in climate change. Climate Change happens to be the most important issue facing Floridians; it will affect their economy, health, homes and maybe even their survival. Well, Marco used to believe in climate change, but of course, now he's running for president.\"\n\nCarly Fiorina Prepares Herself for GOP Presidential Run, Blames Environmentalists for CA Drought\u2014by Doctor Jazz: \"In preparation for a Presidential bid, failed CEO and failed Senatorial Candidate, Carly Fiorina, has been busy establishing her conservative credentials accusing liberals and environmentalists of causing the California drought. Yes, you heard that right folks, libs and tree huggers are to blame. Without any hint that she recognizes the irony in her statement, science denier Fiorina calls the drought 'man made.' She made her case to Glenn Beck. 'It is a man-made disaster,' she told Glenn Beck during a Monday radio interview.'With different policies over the last 20 years, all of this could be avoided.' 'That\u2019s the tragedy of California, because of liberal environmentalists\u2019 insistence\u2014despite the fact that California has suffered from droughts for millennia, liberal environmentalists have prevented the building of a single new reservoir or a single new water conveyance system over decades during a period in which California\u2019s population has doubled,' Fiorina said. Now Fiorina is not a scientist, and neither am I, but her logic here is stunningly myopic. She is correct that environmentalists have opposed building new dams, for good reason. But of course Fiorina and other conservatives do not think that saving habitat for birds, frogs and fish are good reasons for allowing rainfall to run into the ocean.\"\n\nAbout that emerging right-wing divide on climate change\u2014by Cassiodorus: \"In a recent piece posted to the Grist website, David Roberts tells us that \"there's an emerging right-wing divide on climate change.' Now I suppose that by 'right wing' Roberts means Republicans, because of course all of the Important People want to give the Democrats some space to claim that they are not conservatives. Even so, I wanted more evidence from Roberts that this was in fact a 'divide.' I felt reinforced in my belief that Republicans have no solid opinions on climate change, but rather that they have a knee-jerk reaction to anything like climate change that would threaten their precious capitalist system (as Naomi Klein points out at the beginning of her book This Changes Everything). What appears to be most prominently the case is that prominent Republicans are backtracking on claims that climate climate change isn't happening, or that it isn't caused by human beings. They're starting to waffle on denial claims. This appears most prominently in the Dana Milbank piece which Roberts cites.\"\n\nDC, State & Local Eco-Politics\n\nWisconsin Climate Change Gag Order Part of Multi-Front, Industry-Tied Attacks\u2014by Steve Horn: \"On April 7, Wisconsin's Board of Commissioners of Public Lands voted 2-1 to ban those employed by the agency from doing any work pertaining to climate change or global warming while doing public lands related work. Although the story was covered by multiple media outlets, lost in the public discussion so far is how the vote fits into the broader multi-front industry attack in America's Dairyland-turned-Petro State and which industry interests may have played a role in the vote. The historical roots of the vote appear to trace back to an April 2009 congressional testimony given by Tia Nelson, executive secretary for the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands and daughter of former Wisconsin Democratic Governor Gaylord Nelson, in favor of passage of the American Clean Energy Security Act of 2009. That bill is better known as the controversial and eventually nixed Waxman-Markey climate bill, a bill opposed vigorously by the fossil fuel industry (and some environmentalists, too).\"\n\nWisconsin Bans Public Employees from Working on/Discussing Climate Change\u2014by Windtalker: \"The Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands has voted 2-1 to prohibit its nine employees from working on or discussing global warming and climate change 'on board time.' According to Republican State Treasurer Matt Adamczyk who is on the board, he was upset that the board's executive secretary worked on global warming issues on board time years ago. He also said that the the topic has nothing to do with the board's mission of 'generating investment dollars for public school libraries and providing loans for municipal and school projects.' The executive secretary? Tia Nelson, daughter of Earth Day founder Gaylord Nelson. The work she did on 'board time?' Serving as co-chair of a global warming task force formed by former Governor Jim Doyle until 2008. The lie? It IS part of the mission of the Public Lands board to protect the environment on school lands.\"\n\nWest Virginia Sticks to the Science. Mostly.\u2014by ClimateDenierRoundup: \"Closing the loop on the West Virginia science standard 'creditability' story from January, the state's Board of Education voted yesterday with a much better than expected end result. That said, enough damage was done to warrant Junk Science tweeting that the standards are a 'climate skeptic win over the forces of warmest brainwashing' and for CFACT to declare 'victory.' But don't get too worried; in classic JunkScience fashion, the reality is much different from what they're pitching. In fact, the changes made are much less egregious than the original changes that cast doubt on climate science. The recent changes include temperature 'rise' being replaced by temperature 'change,' as well as the addition of 'natural forces' as a possible climate change contributor that scientists are currently studying. While the addition of natural forces may seem like a major coup to deniers, understanding natural climate signals is an important part of climate science and serves as an entryway to understanding which signals are natural and which are human-caused. Junk Science thanked 'all who helped' get this 'win in West Virginia,' while CFACT sent an email to members praising them for taking action and making a difference. This is ironic given that out of 7,000 public comments submitted, 6,468 supported the standards teaching kids that climate change is real and man-made. But when you ignore 97% of climate scientists on the consensus, it's no surprise they consider 6% a victory.\"\n\nWhitehouse, Boxer, Warren, Franken, Sanders to Governors: Don't Listen to McConnell on the EPA\u2014by Liberty Equality Fraternity and Trees: \"Last month, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell sent a letter to the National Governors Association, telling the governors of the 50 states to disobey the EPA's new regulations for carbon pollution. Today, Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Al Franken (D-MN), and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) wrote to the NGA to tell governors to ignore Mitch and pay attention to the many expert voices across the Bluegrass State instead. The letter highlights how stakeholders in the business and academic community across Kentucky believe that action on climate change is needed. The letter concludes, '[F]ailing to act gives up your state\u2019s right to set its own course of action toward a clean energy future.

Think about that for a moment. Children born today will be in their 40s at a time that we need to have already doubled food production, yet during the last 20 years we have seen only a 20 percent increase in food supply. Assuming a steady rate of increase in production (which might be optimistic) we should expect to fall far short of demand over the next few decades. This is a problem. The problem is expected to most severely affect poorer people, people in less developed nations, and poor farmers, but if the entire world is double digit percentage points short of food, almost no one is going to get by unscathed. And, at some point, when nearly everyone is seeing some sort of food shortage or extraordinarily high prices, the totally unscathed are going to start looking pretty tasty to the rest of us. [...] And water. This will all require more water, when we are facing increasing shortages of water. How do we address this problem? Will Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) save the day? Are there other approaches to quickly increase agricultural output? Can we eat different foods that are less difficult or costly to produce?\"\n\nSaturday Morning Garden Blogging- Early Bird Edition\u2014by skohayes: \"I'm a huge fan of easy to grow flowers like petunias, because all they need is water and some nice flower booster fertilizer.

Sound Familiar?\u2014by Steven D: \"Scientists studying the Permian extinction event, the greatest die-off in Earth's history, when 90% of all life in the oceans went extinct roughly 250 million years ago (along with the extinction of two thirds of all land species), are finding troubling similarities to that crisis and the current mass extinction which is occurring in our lifetimes. Specifically, a new study shows that increased ocean acidification similar to what we are seeing today, was one of the prime drivers of extinction during the Permo-Jurrasic boundary. From the abstract of the research paper published in Science: Ocean acidification triggered by Siberian Trap volcanism was a possible kill mechanism for the Permo-Triassic Boundary mass extinction, but direct evidence for an acidification event is lacking. We present a high-resolution seawater pH record across this interval, using boron isotope data combined with a quantitative modeling approach. In the latest Permian, increased ocean alkalinity primed the Earth system with a low level of atmospheric CO2 and a high ocean buffering capacity. The first phase of extinction was coincident with a slow injection of carbon into the atmosphere, and ocean pH remained stable. During the second extinction pulse, however, a rapid and large injection of carbon caused an abrupt acidification event that drove the preferential loss of heavily calcified marine biota. In laymen's terms, increased absorption of carbon released from volcanic activity into the oceans led to an rapid increase in ocean acidification, much like we are observing today. The result? The mass die-off of ocean species.\"\n\nThe Buddhist Ecology Movement: Street Prophets Coffee Hour\u2014by Ojibwa: \"I live in a community in which logging has a long history. \u201cTree huggers\u201d are seen as traitors to the local economy and culture; \u201cEarth First\u201d simply means that the other planets will be clear cut later.

Black bears are the most unpredictable\u2014best to wave your arms around wildly, making a bunch of noise and make yourself look much bigger than you are. They scare pretty easily, comparatively. But, if they insist on eating you, drop to the ground and play dead (see 'Brown bears' for more on playing dead). Brown bears also will generally flee if you wave your arms around wildly and scream loudly. If they don't and come closer for a meal, drop to the ground, face down, covering the back of your neck with your hands and play dead until they leave. Polar bears, will eat you no matter what, so whatever you do, try to sock them in the nose, gouge their eyes or stuff mittens down their throats before you run: as Cobra Kai was wont to say, 'If he can't breathe, see or run, he can't fight!'

The U.S. Forest Service in Southern California just caught wind of the fact Nestl\u00e9's permit to pump water out of a national forest expired over 25 years ago. An investigation by the Desert Sun found that Nestle Waters North America's permit to transport water across the San Bernardino National Forest expired in 1988. The water is piped across the national forest and loaded on trucks to a plant where it is bottled as Arrowhead 100 percent Mountain Spring Water. Nestl\u00e9 is the #1 bottle water producer in the country and own the brands Arrowhead and Pure Life. The company's response? Don't worry, folks.

The amount of water a country uses on agriculture decreases as the country\u2019s wealth increases. Wealthier nations require more water for industrial practices and poorer nations must prioritize food supplies. For example, in the US, water used on industrial agriculture accounts for 38 percent of total freshwater withdrawals, while it accounts for over 80 percent of withdrawals in India. In the US, water usage varies greatly by state as production needs vary by state. Western states are responsible for much of the country\u2019s food production, but are notably arid as four different deserts, the Great Basin Desert, Mojave Desert, Sonoran Desert and Chihuahuan Desert, all call the American West home. As you might expect, farming in the desert requires tremendous amounts of water. This being the case, western states use more of their water on agriculture than their eastern counterparts.\"\n\nCity of Sacramento responds to my questions about Nestl\u00e9 \u2014by: \"Rhea Serran, Media and Communications for the City of Sacramento, today responded via email to my questions about Nestl\u00e9's water bottling plant in Sacramento.

The California Department Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) recently submitted the proposal to the commission, arguing that the closure 'in this critical holding and spawning area' would \u201censure added protection for the federal and state endangered winter-run chinook, which face high risk of extinction.\u201d The CDFW argues: 'Given the gravity of the current situation, it is imperative that each and every adult fish be given maximum protection. Current regulations do not allow fishing for Chinook salmon, but incidental catch by anglers targeting trout could occur.' 'At the department, it pains us to propose this action for the state,' said Stafford Lehr, CDFW Fisheries Branch Chief. 'But we are in unchartered (sic) territory here, and we believe this is the right thing to do if we want to help winter run and be able to fish for big rainbows in the long-run.'\"\n\nCalifornia Water Restrictions MUST Include Big Ag, Big Oil and Nestl\u00e9!\u2014by Dan Bacher: \"The mainstream media, state officials and corporate \"environmental\" groups have for years tried to portray California as the \"green\" leader of the nation. In reality, California suffers from some of the greatest environmental degradation of any state in the nation, since corporate agribusiness, the oil industry and other big money interests control the majority of the state's politicians and exert inordinate influence over the state's environmental policies. California is currently in a state of emergency, with NASA scientists saying that California has only about one year of water left in reserves, according to Food and Water Watch. This is largely due to the gross mismanagement of California's reservoirs, rivers and groundwater supplies, during a record drought, to serve the 1 percent. California Governor Jerry \"Big Oil\" Brown's recent water restrictions on cities and counties are woefully inadequate. Big agribusiness, oil interests and the Nestl\u00e9 corporation and other bottled water companies continue to deplete and pollute California's precious groundwater resources that are crucial for saving water. It's clear that the severity of this drought calls for much more than just individual action like cutting back on your showers or flushing your toilet less.\"\n\nWATER: California Needs its Democrats to Step Up\u2014by Wolf10: \"The California drought has set the stage for a great battle between the urban based economic interests and agriculture. Agriculture trumped mining by way of court cases and legislation as the dominant organized economic force in California in the late 1800s. But since then, in spite of the burgeoning abundance of agricultural production in California, it has been outpaced by the growth of other economic sectors to the point that agricultural sales now represent less than 2% of California's gross state product. Most of the state's publicly owned water supplies are the product of massive and complex public works systems and is derived from rain and snow melt runoff. There's only 1 year's worth of this water left stored in reservoirs. Groundwater (i.e. subsurface aquifers) belongs to those who own the land above them. Although it is estimated that there is perhaps 3 years of water in these aquifers nobody knows because landowners have not been required to monitor or report how much water to which they have access or use. I have no idea how long it would take or even if it would be possible or desirable for the state to wrest control from these aquifers from their current owners. Should the public get control of this water, deplete it, and the drought persists for more than three years, what then?\"\n\nAmy Goodman, speaking truth to power, takes on the livestock connection to California water crisis\u2014by VL Baker: \"Speaking truth to the powerful California livestock industry, Amy Goodman, as usual, doesn't pull punches.

This post is the latest in a series dedicated to the public dissemination of information about the impacts of the Fukushima Dai-ichi disaster on the health of the North Pacific Ocean ecosystem and health of North American residents. New results from the third sampling period (January through March 2015) of Kelp Watch 2015 were released on April 6, 2015, and can be found here. As with previously reported results here, here and here no radioactive isotopes from Fukushima were detected in kelp growing at sampling sites spread along our Pacific coast. The absence of 134Cs in kelp suggests that ocean transport of Fukushima contamination had yet to reach North American coastal water.

Corporate Collusion\u2014by GregWright: \"A strong and united government provides communities with the best defense against industrial pollution. Companies follow money. If it is cheaper for a company to pollute than to not pollute, they will pollute. When governments impose limits and fines that make producing waste and emissions more expensive than not producing any, the companies will compete for ways to pollute less\u2026 or move operations to a country where they can pollute freely in the name of profit. Industries that pollute heavily and their indentured servants in the US government often shout rhetoric to the effect that taxes are 'job-killers' or that 'government is getting in the way of business.' Government officials who are not beholden to these industries will point out that these taxes are both an incentive for corporations to do the right thing and an insurance policy that funds the clean-up effort when the companies violate regulatory policies. The Cap-and-trade system was adopted as national law in 1990 to combat the emerging problem of acid rain. The system limited the amount of sulfur dioxide that coal-fired power plants and other sulfur emitting facilities could expel. A company that emitted less than its allotted amount of sulfur dioxide could sell its unused credits to a facility that went over its limit. The number of credits issued in total was set at a number that was low enough to significantly reduce the amount of emissions over time. Did it work?\"\n\nForests, Wilderness & Public Lands\n\nStudy shows that tropical deforestation has accelerated, not slowed as previously reported\u2014by Walter Einenkel: \"Finds in a study published two months ago by University of Maryland researchers has revealed some disturbing news.The rate at which tropical forests were cut, burned or otherwise lost from the 1990s through the 2000s accelerated by 62 percent, according to a new study which dramatically reverses a previous estimate of a 25 percent slowdown over the same period. That previous estimate, from the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s (FAO) Forest Resource Assessment, was based on a collection of reports from dozens of countries.

Oregon Miners in Dispute With BLM Calls for Militia Help And Gets It\u2014by Steven D: \"Yes, we may have a repeat of the Le Affaire Bundy in in southern Oregon where a dispute between the Bureau of Land Management and gold miners may erupt into another standoff with domestic terrorists \"Constitutional rights activists\" such as the Oathkeepers, after the BLM ordered the miners of the federal land they'd worked for regulatory violations. Rather than fight the matter in the courts, the miners had a better idea. They put a call out for help from the men with the long guns who rallied around racist and Sovereign Citizen supporter Cliven Bundy in Nevada last year. From Raw Story: The owners of the Sugar Pine Mining Claim reached out to the Oath Keepers of Josephine County for help, and the pro-gun group issued a nationwide call for assistance that was picked up by websites such as Infowars and Before It\u2019s News. So, what is the BLM saying about all this? Acting like the jack booted thugs they must be, right? Well, not exactly. It seems the dispute is over the miners' surface rights and whether a 1955 law canceled any right the miners may have. The miners are relying on documents to support their claim, documents the BLM asserts were canceled out by a 1955 law. According to the BLM they have already been in touch with a lawyer representing the miners. But I guess either the miners don't trust the courts or they aren't all that confidant about their claims, because they asked for armed back-up from the same folks who aided Bundy and terrorized Federal officers, local law enforcement and an entire community in Nevada last year.\"\n\nMiscellany\n\nChesapeake Bay Restoration\u2014by hughesrowe: \"I am always curious why people with enormous wealth don't take advantage of it by funding a single eye-catching initiative that would enhance everyone's life and reap a tremendous amount of dignity and respect.

With each passing year, tons of plastic waste from packaging containers and bags end up in landfills and the ocean, at increasingly alarming rates. Marine life is under threat, greenhouse gases are seeping into the atmosphere, cities face the menace of scattered litter, and drains along with sewer systems are being clogged by plastic bags. Due to these issues, the need for recycling waste packaging instead of producing more of it has become a serious cause for concern. While recycling programs are still continuing success stories, we still have a long way to go. The future of recycling and packaging industries looks promising as governments and other stakeholders across the consumer supply chain continue to work together. As far as sustainable packaging and recycling is concerned, the following are some of the outcomes to expect from the zero waste strategies being implemented in different nations today.\"\n\nLegally Screwed\u2014by hannah: \"Some people prefer to believe there are some most powerful people who are doing them in. I'm not sure why. I'm more inclined towards the proposition that the U.S. has a very long history depriving some group or other of their rights surreptitiously, by screwing them legally. Perhaps that's the legacy of the explorers having arrived with charters in their hands. The Europeans have long relied on documents. And so it continues. I am about through reading the 261 pages I got from the Glynn County Attorney when I asked for the rewrite of Chapter VII of our ordinances, the zoning code. But, although I already have some 25 questions and comments to pull together, Section 762 deserves special consideration. It's not very long, but instructive. Although entitled Beach and Dune Protection Overlay Zone, 762 is not about protecting the beaches or dunes. That is, the law does not do what it says.
