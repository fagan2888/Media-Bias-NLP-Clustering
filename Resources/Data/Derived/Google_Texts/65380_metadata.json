(Pettypiece and Robertson, Bloomberg, 6/26)\n\nROUND TWO OF SHOCKING CDC ANTI-SMOKING CAMPAIGN\n\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention recently released the next round of \u201cshocking\u201d anti-smoking ads that are part of its \u201cTips From Former Smokers\u201d campaign, originally launched in 2012.\n\nOne of the most challenging and frustrating aspects of my 22-years of surgically treating patients with smoking related diseases, such as atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease and lung cancer, was managing their smoking habit and nicotine addiction and convincing, and in many cases cajoling, them to quit.\n\nUnfortunately, it frequently took a medical disaster and the consequences of surgery before they finally \u201cgot it.\u201d\n\nThe CDC says that the very aggressive and compelling $50-million-a-year multimedia tobacco education campaign portraying former chronic smokers dealing with the often dreadful consequences of their disease and treatment, is still needed.\n\nDespite declines in smoking, 18% of adults still smoke cigarettes and 21% use some form of tobacco product every day or most days. (Painter, USA Today, 6/24)\n\nOLDER MOMS LIVE LONGER\n\nAccording to research recently published in Menopause, the journal of the North American Menopause Society, older moms may be rewarded with longer lives.\n\nExtending the findings of several other studies, this one, which included over 4,800 people from 551 families, showed, \u201cWomen who bore their last child between the ages of 33 and 37 had the best shot at becoming a longevity champion,\u201d and \u201cwere 2.08 times as likely to live to an exceptional age as moms who had no more children after 29.\u201d\n\nThe research suggests that the robust health associated with women capable of conceiving and bearing children for several decades, and perhaps an evolutionary benefit to her offspring and their children may account for the findings. (Healy, Los Angeles Times, 6/25)\n\nNEW PEDIATRIC GUIDELINES: READ TO YOUR BABY\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics says it is never too early for parents to start reading to newborns.\n\nResearch shows that reading aloud to babies promotes the enhancement of cognitive, motor, language and developmental skills, and that families served by programs such as Reach Out and Read actually read together more often, while providing children entering kindergarten a larger vocabulary, stronger language skills, and a \u201cjump start\u201d to better prepare and achieve their potential throughout their academic careers. (Joyce, The Washington Post, 6/24)\n\nLIMIT TV TIME AND LIVE LONGER\n\nResearch out of the University of Navarra in Spain and recently published in the Journal of the American Heart Association revealed that study participants who watched 3 or more hours of TV a day doubled the risk of premature death compared with participants who reported watching 1 hour or less of TV a day.\n\nResearch team leader Dr. Miguel Martinez-Gonzalez of the Department of Public Health at the University of Navarra said, \u201cAs the population ages, sedentary behaviors will become more prevalent, especially watching television, and this poses an additional burden on the increased health problems related to aging.\n\nOur findings suggest adults may consider increasing their physical activity, avoid long sedentary periods and reduce television watching to no longer than 1-2 hours each day.\u201d\n\nOf note, computer use and time spent driving did not show an impact on premature death. (Whiteman, Medical News Today, 6/26)\n\nINSURANCE INDUSTRY BIG ACA WINNER\n\nThe contentious debate over the effectiveness and value of the Affordable Care Act (ACA, aka Obamacare) rages on in the political arena, and stakeholders across the spectrum are adapting and trying to cope with the law\u2019s outcomes and ramifications.\n\nAs the dust clears on the first 6 months of \u201cfull\u201d implementation of Obamacare, it appears that the biggest \u201cwinner\u201d among stakeholders is not the people, providers or politicians, but the insurance industry.
