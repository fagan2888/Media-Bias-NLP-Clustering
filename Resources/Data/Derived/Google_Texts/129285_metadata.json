The company will compete with Anthem, Blue Shield and in most of the county, except for Ojai and an area east of the Santa Barbara County line, Kaiser Permanente.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very good thing,\u201d said Cynthia Gabriela Aguilar, a Santa Paula insurance agent, noting that the market was dominated by Blue Shield and Anthem. \u201cWe need more competition.\u201d\n\nAt the end of open enrollment this year, 67,000 people in Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties were covered with plans purchased through Covered California. The exchange offers subsidies to people who meet income standards and was created through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPreliminary pricing data for 2016 shows that premiums in plans sold through Covered California in the three counties will increase a weighted average of 4.4 percent. That\u2019s slightly higher than the statewide average increase of about 4 percent.\n\nThe lowest-priced bronze plan in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties could jump nearly 7 percent in premiums, according to estimates. The lowest-priced sliver plan could fall almost 4 percent.\n\nA 40-year-old single person in the three counties who makes $23,450 a year and qualifies for subsidies would likely pay an average of $45 in monthly premiums in the lowest-tiered, or bronze, plan, in 2016. He or she would pay $114 for a silver plan.\n\nIf the person didn\u2019t qualify for a subsidy, he or she could pay an average of $280 for a bronze plan and $349 for a silver plan.\n\nAbout 52 percent of the people in Covered California plans in Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties are covered through Anthem.\n\nIf they stay in the plans, they could pay a weighted average of 9 percent more in 2016 than in the current year, according to the preliminary estimates.\n\nBlue Shield covers about 37 percent of the Covered California clients in the three counties.\n\nPeople who stay in the plans could see their premiums drop in price an average of 2.4 percent.\n\nPeople who stay in Kaiser plans bought in Covered California could see weighted increases of 5.5 percent.\n\nThe 40-year-old making $23,450 and receiving subsidies would pay the lowest premiums in Blue Shield plans at $89 a month, followed by Kaiser at $124.\n\nAnthem and United would charge $142 a month.\n\nThough premiums will rise on average, Covered California officials said people who pick the lowest-priced plan in a particular tier may be able to save money over their current premiums.\n\nSome observers note a 4.4 percent increase is relatively small in the world of health insurance.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re certainly happier than the regions that go up 8 or 9 percent,\u201d said Beth Capell of the Health Access California advocacy group. \u201cYou\u2019re not as happy as Los Angeles and Riverside/San Bernardino.\u201d\n\nIn northeast Los Angeles County premiums could decrease an average of 0.2 percent in 2016, according to Covered California. In San Bernardino and Riverside counties premiums could increase an average of 1 percent.\n\nThe premium price doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, said Carmen Balber, executive director of the Consumer Watchdog advocacy group. Deductibles in bronze-level plans will increase to $6,000 for an individual in 2016, up $1,000, she said. Some co-pays increase as well.\n\nOut-of-pocket prices could also be pushed by limited networks of doctors in some plans, she said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the sticker price is not the bottom line for the consumer,\u201d she said.\n\nCovered California officials note the shop-and-compare calculator that allows people to estimate the price of plans should be available for 2016 plans Monday.\n\nCovered California enrollment for 2016 coverage begins Nov. 1 and continues to Jan. 31.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Covered California offers more choices, slight hike in premiums", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/county/covered-california-offers-more-choices-slight-hike-in-premiums-ep-1213321483-351108621.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/coveredcalifornia_22175690_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 443}, "type": "article", "description": "Covered California insurance options increase in Ventura County.
