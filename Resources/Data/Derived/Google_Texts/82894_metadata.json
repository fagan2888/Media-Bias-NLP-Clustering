And how does a former U.S. Attorney, with his eye on a 2016 presidential campaign, not ask follow-up questions when told the closures were a result of a traffic test?\n\nHow indeed?\n\nMost people feel it\u2019s relatively easy to spot a liar, and judging by the media coverage on this scandal, many people feel that Christie is lying, but without a smoking gun, i.e. damning emails or personal testimony from his staff or the Port Authority, it\u2019s hard to prove.\n\nBut his press conference itself may offer some insights. In \u201cLiespotting: Proven Techniques to Detect Deception,\u201d author Pamela Meyer asserts that only when we step back from someone\u2019s words to view the whole picture can we begin to see the combination of indicators that will help us successfully identify a liar. She writes:\n\nAfter listening closely to the details of someone\u2019s speech, take a mental step back to consider what the combination of his facial expressions, body language, and verbal clues says about his attitude toward being questioned. Attitude is a crucial indicator. Is the subject interested in helping you solve a problem or answer a question? Is he forthright or evasive? How confidently does he speak? A deceptive person might be guarded and hesitant to firmly acknowledge or deny anything you suggest about his actions or behavior. A truthful person will cooperate from the start and will signal that he is on your side.\n\nBut what if that person is an expert at identifying liars? And what if that person knows how to look like he\u2019s telling the truth? As a former lawyer, Christie would be a master at it. In his speech he went out of his way to make the listener feel he was just as surprised as anyone and that he was going to do everything in his power to get to the bottom of the lane closures. But closer examination of what he said and what he didn\u2019t say offers a very different picture.\n\nWhile liespotting isn\u2019t an exact science, and there are always exceptions, knowing how to identify certain telltale behaviors can provide some very interesting clues. Below, five mistakes Christie made in his press conference that may be signs of less-than-truthful behavior.\n\n1. Too much detail regarding unimportant issues. According to Meyer, a subject will often offer specific details that have nothing to do with the question of his guilt as a way of validating his claim of innocence. It\u2019s as if the specificity will add credibility to what he\u2019s about to tell you. However, when you listen closely, you\u2019ll observe that the abundance of details does not lead to relevant information.\n\nWhen explaining how he learned of the breach in his office regarding the bridge lane closures, Christie said that he finished his workout at 8:50 and received a call from his director of communication at 8:55. Then he said, \u201cI found this out at 8:50 yesterday morning. By 9:00 this morning, Bridget Kelly was fired. By 7:00 yesterday evening, Bill Stepien was asked to leave my organization.\u201d\n\nThis may sound credible, but it begs the follow-up question, where\u2019s the inquiry? Why fire your deputy chief of staff without talking to her further to find out who else might have been involved and what her motive might have been. As a former attorney, Christie knows that establishing motive is critical to securing a conviction of guilt, and if she\u2019s the linchpin, why isn\u2019t he speaking to her to find the others involved? Instead, when asked why Kelly lied to him, he said, \u201cI have not had any conversation with Bridget Kelly since the email came out. And so she was not given the opportunity to explain to me why she lied because it was so obvious that she had. And I\u2019m, quite frankly, not interested in the explanation at the moment.\u201d\n\nNotably, Christie indicated nine separate times throughout the conference that he was interviewing his staff and would continue to interview them. He details conversations with people he said are not involved. But why spend so much time talking to innocent people? If you want to find the guilty, talk to those you know are guilty. At one point, he said,\n\nAnd so now, having been proven wrong, of course we\u2019ll work cooperatively with the investigations. And you know, I\u2019m going through an examination, as I mentioned to you, right now. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m going through an examination and talking to the individual people who work for me, not only to discover if there\u2019s any other information we need find, but also to ask them: How did this happen? How did, you know, how did this, you know, occur to us?\n\nHere again, he\u2019s giving the appearance of being cooperative by offering details, but those details lead to no real information except to tell us how serious he is about interviewing. In fact, though the conference lasted almost two hours, Christie said very little.\n\n2. Evading questions. During the question-and-answer period Christie stuck to his talking points: Apologize. Appear cooperative. Promise to do better next time. He also avoided answering this question from a reporter: \u201cSo, I\u2019m just asking, what do you ask yourself about \u2014 they either thought this is what the boss wanted, or they, as a group, they were willing to go rogue and do this and then try to cover it up.\u201d Christie\u2019s response:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Applying the techniques of lie detection to Christie's press conference yields some very interesting results", "author": "Amy Punt", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Applying the techniques of lie detection to Christie's press conference yields some very interesting results", "title": "5 reasons Chris Christie might be lying", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/11/5_reasons_chris_christie_might_be_lying/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/chris_christie8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Applying the techniques of lie detection to Christie's press conference yields some very interesting results", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/chris_christie8.jpg", "title": "5 reasons Chris Christie might be lying", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "5 reasons Chris Christie might be lying", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bridgegate, Chris Christie, Editor's Picks, George Washington Bridge, Lies, lying", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeed9\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Bridgegate, Chris Christie, Editor's Picks, George Washington Bridge, Lies, lying, Politics News\u201cI am embarrassed and humiliated by the conduct of some of the people on my team,\u201d New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said during his press conference on Jan. 9 regarding the George Washington Bridge scandal.\nBelow, five mistakes Christie made in his press conference that may be signs of less-than-truthful behavior.\nAnd you know, I\u2019m going through an examination, as I mentioned to you, right now.\nBut his press conference itself may offer some insights.\nLeft looming is: How could a man like Christie not know that his deputy chief of staff ordered lane closures on the George Washington Bridge?"}
