He was sacked three times, under pressure all afternoon and had Bengals players imitating his signature \u201cmoney-rubbing\u201d gesture more than once.\n\nThe Bengals overwhelmed the Browns on the field and in the boxscore, recording their first shutout since Dec. 21, 2008 \u2014 in Cleveland.\n\nCincinnati had 347 yards to Cleveland\u2019s 107. The Bengals picked up 23 first downs to 6 for the Browns, who went just 1 of 10 on third down.\n\nMike Nugent kicked two 44-yard field goals and added a 34-yarder for the Bengals, who turned a day of promise and potential for the Browns into Cleveland\u2019s worst nightmare.\n\nManziel didn\u2019t look ready for the big stage, panicking in the pocket and failing to deliver any of the magic that made him a college football star.\n\nJohnny Football has some work to do.\n\nThe Bengals put together a complete game to strengthen their grip on the division. They set the tone with a time-consuming, 81-yard touchdown drive to start the game and atoned for a 24-3 loss last month when they were dominated at home by the Browns and Hoyer.\n\nCincinnati led 20-0 at halftime, and spent the next two quarters making sure Manziel never got comfortable.\n\nThe shutout capped a week in which Manziel was called a \u201cmidget\u201d by Bengals coach Marvin Lewis, a comment that shows professionals aren\u2019t ready to let him come in and \u201cwreck the league\u201d like he boasted he would do before the Browns selected him with the No. 22 overall pick.\n\nThe Browns were blanked for the first time since a 16-0 loss to Baltimore in 2009.\n\nManziel\u2019s first half couldn\u2019t have gone much worse.\n\nWith Cincinnati\u2019s defense bent on stopping Manziel, the Browns didn\u2019t move the ball, committed costly penalties and the 22-year-old quaterback made several rookie mistakes.\n\nHe was intercepted twice and was lucky that a third pick was nullified by a penalty. The Browns managed just 58 total yards in the first half and their best scoring chance ended when Manziel scrambled and forced a pass to the end zone that was intercepted by Adam \u201cPacman\u201d Jones.\n\nCleveland had just four first downs, two of them coming on penalties against the Bengals defense. Cincinnati linebacker Rey Maualuga was whistled for taunting after he batted down one of the quarterback\u2019s passes and followed it up by getting in Manziel\u2019s face.\n\nHill gave the Browns motivation with his postgame comments after last month\u2019s loss, saying \u201cthey\u2019re probably worse than I thought\u201d despite Cleveland\u2019s dominant performance. Hill carried the ball on the game\u2019s first plays and gave the Bengals a 7-0 lead with his 2-yard TD run.\n\nAfter Nugent kicked a 44-yarder to make it 10-0, Hill scored again, breaking several tackles on a 16-yard run to make it 17-0 early in the second quarter. Hill tried to celebrate by leaping into the stands, but was turned back by a Browns fan wearing a Joe Haden jersey. It was one of Cleveland\u2019s best stops of the first 30 minutes.\n\nThe Browns lost star cornerback Joe Haden with a shoulder injury and rookie corner Justin Gilbert went out with a concussion.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bengals rough up Johnny Manziel in 30-0 blowout", "title": "Bengals rough up Johnny Manziel in 30-0 blowout", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/14/bengals-rough-up-johnny-manziel-in-30-0-blowout/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141214__460464522p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141214__460464522p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-14T14:30:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T06:07:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Bengals picked up 23 first downs to 6 for the Browns, who went just 1 of 10 on third down.\nBengals rookie Jeremy Hill rushed for 148 yards and two touchdowns, backing up his postgame trash talk of the Browns following a loss to them last month.\nManziel, promoted over the slumping Brian Hoyer to spark the Browns (7-7), finished 10 of 18 for 80 yards and two interceptions.\nThe Bengals overwhelmed the Browns on the field and in the boxscore, recording their first shutout since Dec. 21, 2008 \u2014 in Cleveland.\nHe was sacked three times, under pressure all afternoon and had Bengals players imitating his signature \u201cmoney-rubbing\u201d gesture more than once."}
