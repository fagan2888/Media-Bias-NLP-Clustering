Some simply don\u2019t know about the new exchange.\n\nWith the Obamacare marketplace offering hefty subsidies to individuals, some small business owners have stopped offering health insurance altogether. Others have chosen to stick with their off-exchange, small-market insurance plans.\n\nDr. Jay Neuhaus (top c.), owner of Gramercy Dental Arts near Gramercy Park, who recently checked out SHOP said his initial experience on the website was 'negative.' (Jeff Bachner for New York Daily News)\n\n\u201cMy clients take the well-being of their employees very seriously and they are hesitant to move to a carrier that doesn\u2019t have the strongest network available,\u201d said Kyle Sloane, a broker with Newtek Insurance Agency.\n\nBut as more small businesses learn about SHOP, enrollment could grow.\n\nIn addition to the tax credit, there are other potential advantages.\n\nSmall businesses can offer employees a single insurance option or a choice of options and let them choose the plan they want.\n\nBusiness owners have the ability to contribute whatever they want toward coverage, including nothing at all.\n\nThere is no minimum employee participation requirement, either. New York State of Health manages the administration, handing a small business a single monthly bill.\n\nTo participate, a firm must offer coverage to all eligible employees. Enrollment in SHOP is available all year long.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea is choice,\u201d said Danielle Holahan, deputy director of New York State of Health. \u201cThere is a lot of flexibility for employers.\u201d\n\nJon Gabel, a senior fellow with the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago, who conducted a recent study on SHOPs nationally, found prices on these small business insurance exchanges to be lower than non-SHOP prices for the same metal tier.\n\n\u201cI would tell (small business owners) to go online and see what\u2019s available,\u201d Gabel said. \u201cParticularly for small employers with large numbers of low-income workers, there are a number of advantages to buying on SHOP.\u201d\n\nJames Shanahan, the owner of printing and graphics firm Gotham Color, enrolled in a SHOP small business health insurance plan last year. (Marcus Santos)\n\nSome insurers are improving their offerings. For 2015, Health Republic launched a plan, Total Freedom, which allows small businesses to use out-of-network providers, said Health Republic CEO Debra Friedman.\n\nBarry Sloane, CEO of Newtek Business Services, said he likes the idea behind public and private exchanges, though in the long run he would want to see the government get out of the business of providing health insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a place to go to compare choices,\u201d Sloane said. \u201cThe great thing about technology is it makes information a lot more available.\u201d\n\nDr. Jay Neuhaus, owner of Gramercy Dental Arts near Gramercy Park, has been thinking about replacing the insurance plan that covers his employees. He recently checked out SHOP.\n\nHis initial experience on the website was \u201cnegative.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were asking for a lot of information,\u201d Neuhaus said. \u201cI thought it would be pretty easy to see if you qualify. Instead, it wants every single detail on every single person.\u201d\n\nBut SHOP has been a good fit for James Shanahan.\n\nFacing escalating health insurance costs, the owner of Gotham Color, a printing and graphics company in the Garment District, had been thinking about dropping employee coverage.\n\nLast year, he went shopping on SHOP and signed up for a Health Republic plan that is now covering five employees, including Shanahan. By switching plans, Shanahan said, he has seen a meaningful drop in his insurance costs. He expects to be eligible for the tax credit.\n\n\u201cThe key for me is, I am able to continue to offer health insurance,\u201d Shanahan said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Phyllis Furman", "twitter": {"description": "Jonathan Weber started looking into Obamacare coverage for employees after hearing about it from colleagues.", "title": "New York small businesses can easily SHOP for health care", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/new-york-small-businesses-easily-shop-health-care-article-1.2104579", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2104635.1423164786!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/jonathan-weber-talks-shop-health-care-exchange-sm.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "small business obamacare, small business insurance , obamacare", "parsely-author": "Phyllis Furman", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "small business obamacare, small business insurance , obamacare", "news_keywords": "small business obamacare, small business insurance , obamacare", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/new-york-small-businesses-easily-shop-health-care-article-1.2104579", "parsely-title": "New York small businesses can easily SHOP for health care", "sailthru.date": "2015-02-05T14:46:48-0500", "sailthru.title": "New York small businesses can easily SHOP for health care", "nydn_section": "Health", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-02-05T19:46:48", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2104635.1423164786!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/jonathan-weber-talks-shop-health-care-exchange-sm.jpg", "description": "Jonathan Weber started looking into Obamacare coverage for employees after hearing about it from colleagues.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Jonathan Weber started looking into Obamacare coverage for employees after hearing about it from colleagues.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Jonathan Weber started looking into Obamacare coverage for employees after hearing about it from colleagues.", "title": "New York small businesses can easily SHOP for health care", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/new-york-small-businesses-easily-shop-health-care-article-1.2104579", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2104635.1423164786!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/jonathan-weber-talks-shop-health-care-exchange-sm.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2104635.1423164786!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/jonathan-weber-talks-shop-health-care-exchange-sm.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Phyllis Furman", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3865\"", "article_summary": "He went to the New York State of Health website and studied the choices at SHOP, the Small Business Health Options Program offered on the exchange to small businesses and nonprofits.\nThe program aims to lower small businesses\u2019 health insurance costs, while providing flexibility and convenience.\nWith the Obamacare marketplace offering hefty subsidies to individuals, some small business owners have stopped offering health insurance altogether.\nNew York State of Health manages the administration, handing a small business a single monthly bill.\nFor 2015, Health Republic launched a plan, Total Freedom, which allows small businesses to use out-of-network providers, said Health Republic CEO Debra Friedman."}
