He called for an end to the Vietnam War.\n\nExactly one year later, King was assassinated in Memphis. He was 39 years old. King\u2019s speech in New York set the tone for the last year of his life.\n\nInside the church, he was hailed for his brave, outspoken stance against the war. Outside the church, he was roundly condemned \u2013 by the mainstream press, by other civil rights activists and, most decidedly, by President Lyndon Johnson.\n\nThis final year was one of the most challenging and controversial chapters of the civil rights leader\u2019s career, yet it has not been the focus of significant public attention. For many, the image of King is of a social and political leader at the height of his powers \u2013 especially the period up through 1965.But that's not the way he was viewed in the last year of his life. This program illuminates the profound personal, psychological and philosophical challenges King faced in his last year.\n\nIn this time, King tried to gain support for his Poor People\u2019s Campaign, fended off fierce critics inside and outside the civil rights movement, and endured an increasing sense of despair and isolation. King's Last March offers listeners a complex view of a man trying to push his philosophy of non-violence to a conclusion many people found more threatening than the dream he described on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial five years before his death.\n\nFor more photos, archival audio and the full documentary, visit American RadioWorks.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "On Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day, WNPR's Where We Live presents a documentary special from American RadioWorks, \"King's Last March.\" It explores the final", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Where We Live", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/kings-last-march", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201501/mlk-pulpit1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "On Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day, WNPR's Where We Live presents a documentary special from American RadioWorks, \"King's Last March.\" It explores the final", "title": "King's Last March"}, "story_id": 378331834, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@johndankosky"}, "author": "John Dankosky", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "King&#039;s Last March"}, "nid": 34508, "datePublished": "2015-01-19", "keywords": "civil rights, history, race", "wordCount": 394, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "On Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day, WNPR's Where We Live presents a documentary special from American RadioWorks, \"King's Last March.\"\nKing\u2019s speech in New York set the tone for the last year of his life.\nIt explores the final year of King's life.\nThis final year was one of the most challenging and controversial chapters of the civil rights leader\u2019s career, yet it has not been the focus of significant public attention.\nOn April 4, 1967, Martin Luther King, Jr. gave a landmark speech from the pulpit of Riverside Church in New York."}
