An Egyptian woman who was featured dancing in a sexy music video has been charged by the country’s authorities with “inciting debauchery,” according to regional reports.

Egyptian social media users were reportedly thrown into a frenzy after watching the video, which features a well endowed woman shaking her goodies from multiple angles.

The song, titled “Hands Off,” features much “booty-shaking,” according to the Times of Israel.

Egyptian authorities say the video “disrupted morality,” according to the Times of Israel, and ordered the woman’s arrest. The woman’s boyfriend also is being sought for arrest.

It remains unclear if the Kenny Powers look-a-like featured in the video also will face charges.
