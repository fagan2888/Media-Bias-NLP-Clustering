Re­pub­lic­an gains and Pres­id­ent Obama’s weak­ness have Demo­crats on their heels, pre­par­ing to fight for Sen­ate seats they nev­er thought they would have to de­fend and hop­ing that 2016 will give them a chance to win back the Sen­ate if they lose it next year.

Mark Warner, one of the most pop­u­lar Demo­crats in the Sen­ate, is now fa­cing a ser­i­ous chal­lenge from one of the few Vir­gin­ia Re­pub­lic­ans who can keep pace with his fun­drais­ing. Polls show the Re­pub­lic­an fa­vor­ite in Michigan run­ning evenly with Demo­crat­ic Rep. Gary Peters, and rais­ing more money than him as well. Re­pub­lic­ans are even watch­ing the Ore­gon Sen­ate race closely, where a Re­pub­lic­an phys­i­cian run­ning against Obama­care raised a half-mil­lion dol­lars against Demo­crat­ic Sen. Jeff Merkley.

Demo­crats are feel­ing the pres­sure and look­ing long­ingly at 2016, when the polit­ic­al land­scape should be nearly as fa­vor­able to them as the 2014 en­vir­on­ment is per­il­ous to their ma­jor­ity. This year, the party is de­fend­ing sev­en states that re­jec­ted Obama in 2012; the GOP will be de­fend­ing six seats in state that he car­ried that year in 2016.

“We al­ways knew this cycle would have a num­ber of dif­fi­cult seats to de­fend,” said Demo­crat­ic strategist Jef Pol­lock. “Everything stacks up bet­ter for us in 2016.”

What’s changed in the past month is that a hand­ful of states once thought to be safely Demo­crat­ic — such as Michigan, Ore­gon, and Vir­gin­ia — could be­come highly com­pet­it­ive in a best-case GOP scen­ario. If Pres­id­ent Obama’s ap­prov­al rat­ings don’t im­prove and Re­pub­lic­ans catch a few breaks, the GOP could ride a wave to a ma­jor­ity that could with­stand a small 2016 set­back.

“They’ve put can­did­ates on the bal­lot,” ac­know­ledged J.B. Po­er­sch, who ad­vises Sen­ate Ma­jor­ity PAC, a Demo­crat­ic su­per PAC fo­cused on the Sen­ate. But he ad­ded, “Six months from now, or even four months from now, how many of these are ac­tu­ally go­ing to be races? It’s great to be able to laun­dry list can­did­ates and an­oth­er to see how vi­able they’re go­ing to be.”

Among the signs that the field is ex­pand­ing in the GOP’s fa­vor.

1. Ed Gillespie, a former Re­pub­lic­an Na­tion­al Com­mit­tee chair­man with an en­vi­able fun­drais­ing net­work, an­nounced he would chal­lenge Demo­crat Mark Warner, who is pop­u­lar and has $7 mil­lion in the bank. But Vir­gin­ia is shap­ing up to be a true swing state, and Gillespie doesn’t have to worry about a com­pet­it­ive primary. On Monday, one pos­sible rival dropped out and an­oth­er de­clined to jump in.

2. Michigan Re­pub­lic­an Terri Lynn Land proved she could keep up with Peters’s fun­drais­ing and put in $1.6 mil­lion of her own money to boot. Polls show a tight race. Re­pub­lic­an Gov. Rick Snyder will also be on the bal­lot. “Every­one is bullish about Michigan right now,” said Re­pub­lic­an strategist Rick Wiley.

3. Demo­crats are so wor­ried about the pos­sib­il­ity of former Sen. Scott Brown chal­len­ging New Hamp­shire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen that they ran a pree­mpt­ive at­tack ad against him on tele­vi­sion. The former Mas­sachu­setts sen­at­or moved in­to his va­ca­tion home in the Gran­ite State last year.

“I think it will be a barn-burn­er if he gets in,” said Demo­crat­ic poll­ster John An­za­lone. “Bo­ston is the dom­in­ant TV mar­ket in New Hamp­shire, so he is uni­ver­sally known. He has a na­tion­al fun­drais­ing base at well.”

4. In North Car­o­lina, one of the bell­weth­er Sen­ate races, two auto­mated polls this month show Sen. Kay Hagan trail­ing one Re­pub­lic­an op­pon­ent, state House Speak­er Thom Tillis. One of those sur­veys is from North Car­o­lina-based Demo­crat­ic poll­ster, Pub­lic Policy Polling. The state backed Pres­id­ent Obama in 2008 and Mitt Rom­ney in 2012. Hagan has been a pro­lif­ic fun­draiser, but she is a first-term sen­at­or who isn’t par­tic­u­larly well-known throughout the state.

5. Amer­ic­ans for Prosper­ity, the con­ser­vat­ive jug­ger­naut bank­rolled by the Koch fam­ily, broadened its tele­vised at­tacks on Obama­care to two states car­ried by Obama — Michigan and Iowa. The group has spent $22 mil­lion already this cycle. A tongue-in-cheek post by the Cen­ter for Pub­lic In­teg­rity no­ticed that the sub­ject lines of the fun­drais­ing e-mails from the Demo­crat­ic Sen­at­ori­al Cam­paign Com­mit­tee have got­ten in­creas­ingly hys­ter­ic­al, from “deep trouble” to “doomed” to “cata­stroph­ic.”

6. Ore­gon Re­pub­lic­an Mon­ica We­hby an­nounced she raised $500,000 last year. It’s a solidly Demo­crat­ic state, but she’s a pe­di­at­ric neurosur­geon who sup­ports abor­tion rights and im­mig­ra­tion re­form. If she wins the GOP primary, she will face Demo­crat­ic Sen. Jeff Merkley.

Demo­crats have more reas­ons to worry. While nobody thought Arkan­sas Sen. Mark Pry­or’s reelec­tion would be easy in a state Pres­id­ent Obama lost by 24 points, get­ting out­raised by Re­pub­lic­an rival Rep. Tom Cot­ton at the end of 2013 makes the in­cum­bent look like the un­der­dog. Arkan­sas was among 10 states that gave the pres­id­ent his low­est ap­prov­al rat­ings in 2013, pegged by Gal­lup at 35 per­cent.

Even worse is the view from West Vir­gin­ia, where only 25 per­cent ap­proved of the pres­id­ent’s job per­form­ance last year. The likely Re­pub­lic­an nom­in­ee, Rep. Shel­ley Moore Capito, who got a year­long head start, has raised sev­en times as much money.

Sen­ate Minor­ity Lead­er Mitch Mc­Con­nell, who faces his own tough reelec­tion in Ken­tucky, couldn’t help but gloat re­cently on Fox News Sunday about ex­pand­ing the map.

“I’m very con­fid­ent in every single place where we have an op­por­tun­ity for a pickup, we’re go­ing to have a very elect­able can­did­ate, not just in the primary but in the gen­er­al as well,” he said. “The at­mo­sphere for us is so good that we’re also stretch­ing the play­ing field”¦. So, I think it could be a very good year.”

That view could change if the pres­id­ent has a more pro­duct­ive 2014 or if Obama­care pro­duces more suc­cess stor­ies. But for now, Re­pub­lic­ans are max­im­iz­ing their ad­vant­ages.
