(Robyn Beck/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images)\n\nBen Carson\u2019s woe-is-me whining about media scrutiny is more than just a sorry spectacle. It shows the extent to which a culture of victimization has infected the conservative movement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question I\u2019m getting special scrutiny, because there are lot of people who are very threatened,\u201d Carson said in a \u201cFace the Nation\u201d interview Sunday. \u201cThe whole point is to distract, distract the populace, distract me.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s rich, given how Carson\u2019s own mouth has proved to be such a powerful weapon of mass distraction. His \u201cpersonal theory\u201d that the pyramids of Egypt were built by the biblical patriarch Joseph as grain silos \u2014 rather than by Egyptians as pharaonic tombs \u2014 is but one example.\n\nThe retired neurosurgeon and novice politician, one of the leaders in the GOP presidential race, is aggrieved that journalists are looking into his background. Was he really \u201coffered a full scholarship\u201d to West Point, as he has claimed? Not exactly, it turns out. Was he really as much of a juvenile delinquent as he says? Maybe yes, maybe no.\n\nBecause Carson has never before sought public office, it should be no surprise that the thorough vetting given to any major presidential candidate comes as a shock. Moreover, since Carson has no record to run on, his main appeal to voters is his inspirational life story: Through sheer determination and unshakable faith in God, a young man rises from inner-city Detroit to become one of the most acclaimed brain surgeons of his time. If the story crumbles, Carson\u2019s candidacy goes with it.\n\nIt is clear that the good doctor exaggerated some events and, shall we say, misremembered others. Instead of finding a way to acknowledge these lapses and move on, he responds with the notion that the scrutiny he\u2019s getting is somehow \u201cspecial.\u201d This will come as a surprise to Marco Rubio, whose credit card bills and personal finances are being subjected to forensic accounting. Or to Hillary Clinton, who endured an 11-hour congressional grilling over Benghazi.\n\nMost absurd of all is Carson\u2019s assertion \u2014 supported by an amen chorus of prominent conservatives \u2014 that Republicans are generally subjected to tougher vetting than Democrats. This supposedly explains why Carson is being raked over the coals while President Obama somehow was given a free pass eight years ago.\n\n\u201cI do not remember this level of scrutiny for one President Barack Obama when he was running,\u201d Carson said Friday. \u201cIn fact, I remember just the opposite. I remember people saying, \u2018Oh, we won\u2019t really talk about that. We won\u2019t talk about that relationship. Well, Frank Marshall Davis, well, we don\u2019t want to talk about that. Bernardine Dohrn, Bill Ayers, well, we don\u2019t really know him. You know, all the things that Jeremiah Wright was saying, oh, not a big problem.\u2019 \u201d\n\nCarson definitively refutes his own point. Obama\u2019s friendships and associations were unearthed, reported and talked about incessantly. The stories he told in his books were truth-squadded. Critics suggested he was a secret Muslim while at the same time holding him responsible for sermons given by his Christian pastor.\n\nThe idea that Democratic presidential candidates are somehow not thoroughly examined is patently absurd. Yet Ted Cruz got a big ovation at the CNBC debate when he pushed back at the aggressive questioning and claimed that in the recent Democratic debate, \u201cevery fawning question from the media was \u2018Which of you is more handsome and wise?\u2019 \u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s tirade and Carson\u2019s complaining fit neatly into the conservative narrative of victimization by the liberal media. The idea seems to be that the conservative worldview would surely be adopted by more Americans if not for the dastardly intermediation of leftist reporters and editors.\n\nIn Carson\u2019s case, this argument is given an additional twist. Progressives are supposedly somehow \u201cthreatened\u201d by an African American conservative and thus seek to \u201cdestroy\u201d him.\n\n1 of 50 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Photos of Ben Carson on the campaign trail View Photos The retired neurosurgeon is seeking the Republican presidential nomination.

Let me go out on a limb and predict that a man who described the first black president as \u201clike most psychopaths\u201d and the Affordable Care Act as the worst thing since slavery will not prove to be much of a Pied Piper. The simple truth is that African Americans reject the GOP because it seems indifferent or hostile to their interests.\n\nImagining some kind of media conspiracy will not help the conservative movement. Instead, Republicans should try coming up with policies that voters see as reasonable, inclusive and fair.\n\nAnd as for Carson: Stop complaining, already, and start making sense.\n\nRead more from Eugene Robinson\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.
