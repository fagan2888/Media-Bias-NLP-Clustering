The supermodel says she is being audited after reportedly raking in $42 million between June 2012 and June 2013.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBut most taxpayers won\u2019t be scrutinized by the IRS like the world-famous beauty. In fact, a new report from the Associated Press says the chances of being audited are lower right now than they have been in years.\n\nBill Smith, managing director in the CBIZ MHM National Tax Office, says budget cuts have left the IRS with fewer agents. The IRS budget fell to $11.3 billion this year from $12.1 billion in 2010.\n\n\u201cCongress cut the IRS\u2019 budget by about $800 million, and they also have new obligations that they didn\u2019t have before,\u201d Smith says. \u201cA big one is that much of the health-care reform law is going into effect right now, and is being administered by the IRS.\u201d\n\nThe agency is tasked with enforcing the individual mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act, which requires every individual in the country have insurance or face a fine of $95 a year or 1% of their annual income.\n\nThe AP reports that last year, the IRS audited less than 1% of all returns from individuals, which was the lowest rate since 2005. And in the AP interview, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen says that number will be even smaller this year.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cOne of the areas that has been hit hard is exams,\u201d Smith says. \u201cCongress is asking [the IRS] to do more with less, and they have fewer resources to collect for exams.\u201d\n\nThis combination is making the average taxpayer\u2019s chances of being audited quite low, he says.\n\n\u201cIf you make less than $1 million, your chances of being audited are still under 3%, so the vast majority of Americans aren\u2019t having a problem in that area. Joe Taxpayer in the street, by and large, he isn\u2019t getting audited.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 02:57:25 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Supermodel Gisele Bundchen might be facing an audit from the IRS, but the average taxpayer\u2019s chances of landing in the hot seat are quite low.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/04/14/sigh-relief-irs-audit-rates-lower-than-ever.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/04/14/sigh-relief-irs-audit-rates-lower-than-ever/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452239854952.jpg?ve=1", "description": "Supermodel Gisele Bundchen might be facing an audit from the IRS, but the average taxpayer\u2019s chances of landing in the hot seat are quite low.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sigh of Relief: IRS Audit Rates Lower than Ever"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"Kate Rogers\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Sigh of Relief: IRS Audit Rates Lower than Ever\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/04/14/sigh-relief-irs-audit-rates-lower-than-ever/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452239854952.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-04-14T18:58:02Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/04/14/sigh-relief-irs-audit-rates-lower-than-ever.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"e2738e5f-b5f8-47e5-94be-682fb993ca20\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "Supermodel Gisele Bundchen might be facing an audit from the IRS, but the average taxpayer\u2019s chances of landing in the hot seat are quite low.", "dc.identifier": "e2738e5f-b5f8-47e5-94be-682fb993ca20", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "description": "Supermodel Gisele Bundchen might be facing an audit from the IRS, but the average taxpayer\u2019s chances of landing in the hot seat are quite low.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Sigh Of Relief: Irs Audit Rates Lower Than Ever", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-08 02:57:25 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "Supermodel Gisele Bundchen might be facing an audit from the IRS, but the average taxpayer\u2019s chances of landing in the hot seat are quite low.", "title": "Sigh of Relief: IRS Audit Rates Lower than Ever | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/04/14/sigh-relief-irs-audit-rates-lower-than-ever.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/04/14/sigh-relief-irs-audit-rates-lower-than-ever/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452239854952.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-04-14", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Kate Rogers\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"Sigh of Relief: IRS Audit Rates Lower than Ever\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2014/04/14/sigh-relief-irs-audit-rates-lower-than-ever/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452239854952.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-04-14T18:58:02Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2014/04/14/sigh-relief-irs-audit-rates-lower-than-ever.html\",\"post_id\":\"e2738e5f-b5f8-47e5-94be-682fb993ca20\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "dc.creator": "Kate Rogers"}, "article_summary": "The AP reports that last year, the IRS audited less than 1% of all returns from individuals, which was the lowest rate since 2005.\nThe IRS budget fell to $11.3 billion this year from $12.1 billion in 2010.\n\u201cCongress cut the IRS\u2019 budget by about $800 million, and they also have new obligations that they didn\u2019t have before,\u201d Smith says.\nBill Smith, managing director in the CBIZ MHM National Tax Office, says budget cuts have left the IRS with fewer agents.\nContinue Reading BelowBut most taxpayers won\u2019t be scrutinized by the IRS like the world-famous beauty."}
