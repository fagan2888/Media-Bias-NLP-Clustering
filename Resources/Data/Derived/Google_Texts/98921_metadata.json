To graduate high school, students would have to pass an exam similar to the naturalization test required for immigrants to become U.S. citizens.\n\nStill a work in progress, the bill will come up for debate during the upcoming legislative session and is being championed by Indiana Senate Education Chairman Dennis Kruse, a Republican of Auburn.\n\nKruse told The Daily Signal that he\u2019s eager to see Indiana students rise to the same standard as individuals applying for American citizenship.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why our own young people\u2014who are born citizens here, who go through our regular school system\u2014shouldn\u2019t know the same information,\u201d Kruse said.\n\nThe naturalization exam administered by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services requires a candidate to verbally answer 6 of 10 questions concerning American history and government. On average, 91 percent of candidates pass on their first try.\n\nThe test requires citizenship candidates to answer basic questions like \u201cWhat is the supreme law of the land?\u201d and \u201cWhat is the name of the president of the United States now?\u201d\n\n5 percent of students in Arizona and Oklahoma passed similar civics tests.\n\nHoosier high-school students would take a similar exam but with a few important differences. Required to answer 60 percent correctly, students would take a written, multiple choice, 100-question test.\n\nThe Indianapolis Star reports that less than 5 percent of students in Arizona and Oklahoma passed similar tests. Kruse said he\u2019s more optimistic for Hoosier students.\n\nMore than 15 other state legislatures are considering similar measures in 2015. Sam Stone of the Civics Education Initiative believes they meet a critical need.\n\n\u201cNo matter how much knowledge you have,\u201d Stone told the Indianapolis Star, \u201dif you don\u2019t know how to use that knowledge within our system of government, it\u2019s not much good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have an incredibly dangerous form of government for people who don\u2019t know how it works\u201d he said.\n\nThe Civic Education Initiative aims to pass similar bills in every state by Sept. 17, 2017, to commemorate the 230th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Indiana lawmakers wants high school students to pass an exam similar to the naturalization test required for immigrants to become U.S. citizens.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An Indiana lawmakers wants high school students to pass an exam similar to the naturalization test required for immigrants to become U.S. citizens.", "title": "Indiana Pushing Civics Exam to Graduate High School", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150103_CivicsTest.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-02T16:56:44+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/142tWBG"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An Indiana lawmakers wants high school students to pass an exam similar to the naturalization test required for immigrants to become U.S. citizens.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150103_CivicsTest.jpg"}, "title": "Indiana Pushing Civics Exam to Graduate High School", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2015-01-03T03:01:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T16:56:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "indiana, civics test, citizenship, exam, high school, legislation, united state, america, history"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff0f\"", "article_summary": "To graduate high school, students would have to pass an exam similar to the naturalization test required for immigrants to become U.S. citizens.\nKruse told The Daily Signal that he\u2019s eager to see Indiana students rise to the same standard as individuals applying for American citizenship.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why our own young people\u2014who are born citizens here, who go through our regular school system\u2014shouldn\u2019t know the same information,\u201d Kruse said.\nHoosier high-school students would take a similar exam but with a few important differences.\nThe Civic Education Initiative aims to pass similar bills in every state by Sept. 17, 2017, to commemorate the 230th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution."}
