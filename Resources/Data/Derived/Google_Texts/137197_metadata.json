The omission was not overlooked, as many criticized the president online.\n\nScreengrab/YouTube/The White House\n\nHe talked about spending the day outdoors, \"grilling burgers and dogs, and watching the fireworks with our family and friends.\" He also said the day would be more fun as it falls on Malia's birthday. He managed to mention the military, and spoke of how some would join him for a barbecue.\n\n\"As always, we\u2019ve invited some very special guests to our backyard barbecue \u2013 several hundred members of our military and their families,\" he added. \"On this most American of holidays, we remember that all who serve here at home and overseas, represent what today is all about. And we remember that their families serve, too. We are so grateful for their service and for their sacrifice.\"\n\nHe also remembered to mention the \u201cfounding patriots\u201d who declared independence from Britain 239 years ago and said \u201cthat all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights including the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d Obama wished the U.S. Women\u2019s National Team \"good luck\" in the World Cup Final. But instead of mentioning God in his closing, he issued a more politically-correct proclamation.\n\n\"Thanks, everybody,\" he said in closing. \"From my family to yours, have a safe and happy Fourth of July.\" The omission didn't sit too well with a number of right-leaning sites.\n\n\"He may as well have said, 'Tell all your friends you love Obamacare,'\" said a post at BizPac Review. \"I\u2019m beginning to think he does things like this just to tick people off,\" Michael Dorstewitz added. The Gateway Pundit's Jim Hoft said it helps show the kind of man Obama really is and what he \"truly stands for.\"\n\nThe Blaze said some might give Obama points for mentioning the word \u201cCreator\u201d in a paraphrase from the Declaration of Independence. \"We remember as well that this is the day when, 239 years ago, our founding patriots declared our independence, proclaiming that all of us are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights including the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" the president said.\n\nTwitter users also criticized Obama for the omission. One person, for example, called the president a \"Godless little man\" and wondered if anyone was truly surprised by the omission.\n\n\"What is wrong with him?\" another person asked. \"This proves he is muslim.\" Another person called Obama \"an atheist with Muslim tendencies.\"\n\nIn 2014, Obama ended his speech by saying: \"God bless you all.\" A year earlier, he closed out with: \"So, God bless you all. And may God bless the United States of America.' This year, he simply said, \"thanks.\" Video of Obama's comments can be seen above.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Saturday, President Obama addressed the nation in his weekly speech which happened to fall on July 4, but unlike previous speeches, he left out any mention o", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/barack-obama-omits-god-from-fourth-of-july-address", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/2a/68/2a686d80810d6301acf14555f49c925e.JPG?itok=8R1-S2wN", "type": "article", "title": "Barack Obama omits 'God' from Fourth of July address"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Saturday, President Obama addressed the nation in his weekly speech which happened to fall on July 4, but unlike previous speeches, he left out any mention of God.", "creator": "@jnewby1956", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/2a/68/2a686d80810d6301acf14555f49c925e.JPG?itok=8R1-S2wN", "title": "Barack Obama omits 'God' from Fourth of July address", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2015-07-05T08:39:19-06:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Government Topics, Barack Obama, Fourth of July, weekly speech, God, omission", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-05T08:39"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "On Saturday, President Obama addressed the nation in his weekly speech which happened to fall on July 4, but unlike previous speeches, he left out any mention of God.\nThe Blaze said some might give Obama points for mentioning the word \u201cCreator\u201d in a paraphrase from the Declaration of Independence.\nIn 2014, Obama ended his speech by saying: \"God bless you all.\"\nThe Gateway Pundit's Jim Hoft said it helps show the kind of man Obama really is and what he \"truly stands for.\"\nAnother person called Obama \"an atheist with Muslim tendencies.\""}
