Her campaign estimated that raising the income tax on the wealthy by 4 percentage points would generate $150 billion in revenues over 10 years.\n\nOn health care, Mrs. Clinton said that she wanted to build upon the Affordable Care Act, while Mr. Sanders wanted to scrap it in favor of a universal health plan that would empower the states \u2014 and potentially Republican governors, who she has said cannot be trusted. This, along with the other progressive policies of Mr. Sanders, who represents Vermont, would require raising taxes on more than just the rich, she argued.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way, if you do the arithmetic, to pay for what he has proposed without raising taxes on the middle class,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where he and I part ways.\u201d\n\nHer remarks came a day after a new poll showed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s lead in Iowa narrowing to three percentage points over Mr. Sanders. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign is counting on a victory here in the caucuses on Feb. 1 because the next contest is eight days later in New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders has held a durable lead in polls.\n\n\u201cI feel really good about where we are, but I\u2019m not taking anything for granted,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\n\nHer comments on Monday echoed the language she used in December 2007 when she told reporters in Cedar Rapids that \u201cnow the fun part starts\u201d \u2014 a promise to make clear to Iowans the deficiencies of Barack Obama\u2019s policies. She placed third in the Iowa caucuses, which Mr. Obama won.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re into the last month, and we\u2019re going to start drawing the contrasts, because I want every Iowan to have accurate information when they make their decisions,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nMr. Sanders also campaigned in Iowa on Monday, similarly pressing an economic argument in trying to coax voters out to support him on caucus day. Speaking to reporters in Pleasantville, he said that Mrs. Clinton was attacking him because of polls that showed he was gaining support \u2014 and that she was realizing she could lose.\n\n\u201cSecretary Clinton and her campaign now know that she is in serious trouble,\u201d Mr. Sanders said. \u201cAnd, I think a candidate who was originally thought to be the anointed candidate, to be the inevitable candidate, is now locked in a very difficult race here in Iowa and in New Hampshire. Obviously, in that scenario, what people do is start attacking.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanders highlighted how he has called for increasing Social Security benefits, and would pay for it by raising the cap on income that is eligible for taxation to finance the program. That way, the wealthy would pay more into the system.\n\n\u201cIn 2008, as I recall, President Obama introduced very similar-type legislation,\u201d Mr. Sanders said of his Social Security bill. \u201cThat legislation was then opposed by Senator Clinton, who was running against him. I would hope that now in the year 2016, when so many of our seniors and disabled vets are struggling, that Secretary Clinton will join me in demanding that we raise the cap on taxable income, that we expand benefits for our seniors and our disabled vets, and that we extend the life of Social Security for 50 years.\u201d\n\nAs the candidates\u2019s squabbled in Iowa, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made it clear he is paying close attention to the race. In an interview with CNN on Monday, Mr. Biden praised Mr. Sanders\u2019s approach to income inequality, saying that he \u201cis speaking to a yearning that is deep and real. And he has credibility on it.\u201d\n\nThe issue, he added, was \u201crelatively new for Hillary,\u201d but added that she had \u201ccome forward with some really thoughtful approaches.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s pointed remarks \u2014 and the sparring between the candidates \u2014 suggested that the Democratic presidential debate on Sunday could take a sharper tone than the previous ones, which were largely cordial affairs.\n\nFact Check: Hillary Clinton Says Law Bars All Suits Against Gun Industry Mrs. Clinton said legislation that Bernie Sanders supported in 2005 forbids all lawsuits against gun makers and sellers. Not all, but nearly. See all Election 2016 fact checks \u00bb After President Obama said last week that he would not support any Democrat who does not favor new gun control measures, Mrs. Clinton has tried to call attention to Mr. Sanders\u2019s vote in 2005 for a bill that shields gun manufacturers and dealers from liability lawsuits. Mr. Sanders was a House member at the time; Mrs. Clinton, then a senator from New York, voted against the bill. On MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball\u201d on Friday, Mrs. Clinton claimed that the legislation said \u201cno one can sue a gun maker or a gun seller,\u201d and on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday, she said it provided the gun industry with \u201cabsolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability.\u201d The bill, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, followed a flurry of lawsuits against the industry by municipalities. It shields gun manufacturers, sellers and their trade associations from liability lawsuits \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse\u201d of firearms and ammunition. When President George W. Bush signed the measure into law, the National Rifle Association called it \u201cthe most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in 20 years.\u201d But Mrs. Clinton is overstating the breadth of the law. \"This statute does not grant blanket immunity to the firearms industry,\" said Timothy D. Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University who edited the book \"Suing the Gun Industry: A Battle at the Crossroads of Gun Control and Mass Torts.\" Though its protections are quite expansive, the law specifies six exceptions to the prohibition on civil actions. For example, a victim can sue a dealer who has been convicted of selling a firearm knowing that it would be used to commit a violent crime. Suits are also allowed in matters involving injuries or property damage resulting from manufacturing or design defects, as long as the firearm in question was not used in a criminal act. Another exception allows lawsuits when a gun maker or seller \u201cknowingly violated a state or federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of the product.\u201d These exceptions are narrow, and they do provide broad protections to the gun industry, as Mrs. Clinton suggests. Whether the exceptions would ultimately prove meaningful was a subject of debate when Congress passed the legislation in 2005. \u201cThe aim of this bill is clear: to allow legitimate lawsuits against a manufacturer when the legal principles to do so are present,\u201d Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said at the time. Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, took the opposite view: \u201cThese exceptions in the bill have been carefully crafted to prevent lawsuits, not to enable appropriate lawsuits to go forward.\u201d Mr. Lytton, the law professor, said the law \"pretty much shut down attempts to use the court system in a broad way to try to push for greater industry self-regulation of marketing and distribution of firearms.\" But the exceptions have not put a complete halt to litigation. In 2008, a lawyer for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence wrote that \u201creports of the demise of gun liability cases were premature,\u201d adding that \u201cwell-pleaded, carefully crafted cases can still proceed against irresponsible gun companies.\u201d While courts have barred claims in numerous instances because of the 2005 law, there have also been cases in which suits were allowed to proceed because of the exceptions, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. How courts interpret the exceptions is still unfolding, and lawyers have tried to craft lawsuits that could meet their criteria. As one example, families of some of the victims of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., are suing Remington Outdoor, the maker of the Bushmaster rifle used in the shooting, among other defendants. The families are arguing that the gun maker knew, or should have known, that selling assault rifles to civilians \u201cposed an unreasonable and egregious risk of physical injury,\u201d and that its conduct violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act. Remington Outdoor is seeking the suit\u2019s dismissal. The 2005 law, it said in court papers last month, \u201cwas enacted to protect firearm manufacturers against the very claims plaintiffs make in this case.\u201d \u2014 Thomas Kaplan Close\n\nShe also used her visit to Waterloo to press a recurring theme of recent days, calling Mr. Sanders weak on gun control. She pointed to his vote in 2005, as a member of the House, for a bill limiting the liability of gun makers and sellers. She also embraced President Obama\u2019s recent executive actions on guns.\n\nThe crowd at the Electric Park Ballroom in Waterloo cheered Mrs. Clinton\u2019s arrival and gathered around her to take selfies after she spoke. However, many in the audience said that they remained undecided and that they were hoping that seeing her in person might help them choose.\n\n\u201cI have no dislike for her or anything like that,\u201d said Floyd Bumper, 32, of Waterloo. \u201cBut she\u2019s my second choice.\u201d\n\nYamiche Alcindor contributed reporting from Pleasantville, Iowa.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "Political News, Now.", "title": "First Draft", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/11/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytdesign/2014/politics/logo-flag-150.png", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/2016/01/11", "PT": "Blogs", "BN": "first-draft", "CG": "Politics", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "robots": "noodp", "sourceApp": "blogs", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-01112016.jsonp", "keywords": "politics, congress, midterms, elections, 2014, 2016, house, senate, advertising, political advertising, campaign finance, senator, Obama, Boehner, Clinton, Hillary, Hillary Clinton, Reid, McConnell, Christie, Paul, Washington, capitol", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "article": {"section": "Politics"}, "nyt_active_day": 0, "SCG": "First Draft", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI feel really good about where we are, but I\u2019m not taking anything for granted,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said.\n\u201cIn 2008, as I recall, President Obama introduced very similar-type legislation,\u201d Mr. Sanders said of his Social Security bill.\nMr. Sanders was a House member at the time; Mrs. Clinton, then a senator from New York, voted against the bill.\nThis, along with the other progressive policies of Mr. Sanders, who represents Vermont, would require raising taxes on more than just the rich, she argued.\n\u201cSecretary Clinton and her campaign now know that she is in serious trouble,\u201d Mr. Sanders said."}
