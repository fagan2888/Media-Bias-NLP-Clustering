The magazine\u2019s \u201cR.I.P.\u201d feature in one of the latest posts received a lot of social backlash.\n\nIn this Cosmopolitan feature, the idea was to give a comparison of how and how not to contour makeup, mostly. That was the \u201cidea.\u201d However, Twitter followers didn\u2019t perceive it that way. This is because a four-comparison block featured a model of African-descent aside a Caucasian model, and each of the comparisons left the former with \u201cR.I.P.,\u201d while the latter received a \u201cHello Gorgeous!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s definitely a \u201cno bueno\u201d for Cosmopolitan\u2019s image, as deems the Twitterverse.\n\nThis happened: Cosmopolitan uses women of color for trends that need to \u201cdie\u201d http://t.co/zfz0DZWXpt pic.twitter.com/wLNAYgxMRb \u2014 GlobalGrind Style (@GlobalGrindStyl) April 2, 2015\n\nSince the editorial, Cosmopolitan has been receiving a lot of feedback about it. However, the magazine seems to be going on with its day and has not addressed the issue. After a while, trends tend to die down and things resume back to normal. Maybe that\u2019s the hope?\n\n@Cosmopolitan so you\u2019re just gonna act like your website isnt subtlety racist? and continue on with your day? \u2014 imaniiiii (@imaniunchained) April 2, 2015\n\nWhatever the case, the onslaught seems to be full steam ahead.\n\nThe fact that everyone is so shocked #Cosmopolitan is racist is beyond comical. Now we wait for the #fauxpology, as if we need it though \ud83d\ude09 \u2014 Teiarra Jackson (@TeiarraJackson) April 2, 2015\n\nAs a BLACK woman who has bought practically every issue of @Cosmopolitan since the age of 14, I find this offensive. http://t.co/x5owykJrSw \u2014 Montana Williams (@MontanaSymone) April 2, 2015\n\nLOL @Cosmopolitan did what? it probably wasn\u2019t intentionally racist, but\u2026this is why you need more POC working in the editorial depts. \u2014 ANA (@full_of_moxie) April 2, 2015\n\n@thatjileybutera @KillioussBey @Cosmopolitan and then they wanna say black people always pulling out the racist card \u2014 Asia (@Asialoveee_) April 2, 2015\n\n@MakeupWhoreder @heavensdesign8 @Cosmopolitan no idea, but it\u2019s extremely racist and Cosmo needs to dish out apologizes \u2014 ashley binder (@ashbinda) April 1, 2015\n\nHowever, believe it or not, this racially-fused coincidence wasn\u2019t intentional. Cosmopolitan\u2019s full article shows others sized up alongside each other, and the focus is more about the models\u2019 makeups and hair \u201cdos and don\u2019ts.\u201d Yet, as aforementioned, the underlying issue taken away from the article is the implication that only \u201cCaucasian-descent\u201d women are \u201cgorgeous.\u201d\n\nThings have gotten so heated that there\u2019s talk of a boycott. Though Twitter users are upset about it, there are those who show Cosmopolitan support and aren\u2019t focusing on the racist accusations.\n\nPlease don\u2019t join a bandwagon without the full facts the @Cosmopolitan article was not racist see the full thing \u2013> http://t.co/fvM3zV1ugt \u2014 jennifer edwards (@ArtbyJaed) April 1, 2015\n\nPlease do not boycott cosmopolitan. If they were racist they wouldn\u2019t write stories like these pic.twitter.com/lmXVB3MIf0 \u2014 savana (@savanamarieee) April 1, 2015\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the Cosmopolitan racial conflict? Do you think people are overreacting? Or do you think Twitter users have the right response to the feature?\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts in the comments below.\n\n[Photo Credits: Carlos Alvarez | Getty Images Entertainment]", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Cosmopolitan' finds itself in a bit of a pickle via Twitter.
