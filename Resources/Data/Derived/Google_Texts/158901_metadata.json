Gov. Peter Kinder, former House Speaker Catherine Hanaway and businessman John Brunner answered questions about why the people of Missouri should turn out in August to give them the Republican nomination. Below is a summary of Monday\u2019s main contentions from the three candidates.\n\nHow will you beat Chris Koster?\n\nHanaway argued that while Koster won the attorney general\u2019s seat by saying he would be \u2018no politics, all prosecutor.\u2019 She said the reverse had happened. \u201cHe is all politics, no prosecutor.\u201d\n\nKinder touted his ability to win and have success in urban areas.\n\n\u201cThat record has been crowned with success in three statewide elections. I show up everywhere and fight for every vote.\u201d\n\nBrunner touted his outsider status and said that he offered voters \u201ca compelling difference\u201d as a businessman against a lifelong politician.\n\nWhat will you do to stop Obamacare?\n\nKinder noted that he fought against the Obama administration by filing a lawsuit almost as soon as the law was passed.\n\nBrunner said that he initially ran for Senate to try to make a conservative difference because of his displeasure with Obamacare.\n\nHanaway, however, took a dig at Eric Greitens, the only one of the four Republican candidates who was unable to attend the evening before candidate filings.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do what our absent opponent did,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get in the car and go to the Democratic convention.\u201d\n\nWill you institute toll roads?\n\nNot one of the candidates said they intended to institute toll roads.\n\n\u201cNo more taxes, no more toll roads, the people have spoken,\u201d Brunner said.\n\n\u201cMODOT is like a stray dog,\u201d said Hanaway. \u201cYou feed it once and they keep coming back for more and more.\u201d\n\nKinder said added that \u201cMissourians will not invest more in transportation, nor anything else in state government.\u201d\n\nHow far will you go to protect the Second Amendment?\n\nBrunner quoted Reagan and called for a need to protect the entire Constitution, not only the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cFreedom is always one generation away from extinction. We need a governor that can stand strong for our Constitution.\u201d\n\nKinder made it clear that he was in favor of the Second Amendment with his A+ NRA rating.\n\n\u201cSome of these candidates, you\u2019ve got to wonder what they\u2019ll do\u2026 but you\u2019ll know what I do,\u201d he said.\n\nHanaway cited the need for people to protect themselves and said was pro campus and constitutional carry.\n\n\u201cEven our best first responders can\u2019t be an immediate response.\u201d\n\nWill you stand up for pro-life issues?\n\nHanaway said, \u201cThe right to life is the most important right\u2026 I\u2019ll defund Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nWhile each of the candidates came out against embryonic stem cell research, Kinder said that he would remove public funding for it, but still allow private institutions to pursue the practice if they chose, calling it a \u201crough compromise.\u201d\n\nBrunner said that using embryonic stem cells to save lives was a false compromise.\n\n\u201cI stand with life and I do not compromise. I do not believe there is a compromise between science and upholding life.\u201d\n\nHow would you handle the situation at the University of Missouri and what would you do about the school\u2019s board of curators?\n\nBrunner said, \u201cThe University of Missouri is a tragedy for all Missourians. It casts a shadow across our great state.\u201d\n\nHanaway said Gov. Jay Nixon had filled the Board with his \u201clawyer buddies\u201d and that the Board should better represent the state.\n\nKinder said student-athlete strikes should be punished with revocation of scholarships.\n\nWill you cut taxes?\n\nThey each said yes.\n\nWhat have you done that you are most proud of that shows your conservative values?\n\nBrunner cited his experience as an evangelical missionary and said that he appreciated the tenet of freedom of religion.\n\nKinder said that he has fought in the political arena for most of his life for conservative values.\n\n\u201cYou name a conservative value in the last 30 years, I\u2019ve been in the thick of it.\u201d\n\nHanaway said she had focused on her family.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I have tried to instill Midwestern values [in our children] and that opportunities come by the sweat of your brows.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "PHOTO/SAMUEL SAFFA \u00a0 At the Missouri Times\u2018 #mogovdebate, Lt.
