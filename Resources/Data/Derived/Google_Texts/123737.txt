Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) announced Thursday that the state had reached its first-year goal of signing up 322,000 residents for the Healthy Michigan Plan eight months early.

About 477,000 Michigan residents are eligible for the Health Michigan Plan, the state’s expanded Medicaid program for low-income residents. To be eligible, individuals cannot qualify for or be enrolled in Medicare or other Medicaid programs and must have income at or below 133 percent of the poverty level.

Michigan also exceeded enrollment predictions for its individual marketplace, with 272,539 enrolling by March 31, according to the Detroit Free Press. The estimate was about 190,000.

There are some areas where the state underperforms. A number of counties lack market competition; more than two dozen have three or fewer insurers, and in the Upper Peninsula, 11 counties have two or fewer. As a result, rural areas often have the highest rates, up to $300 a month more than other parts of the state, the Detroit Free Press reported.

Medicaid enrollment increased across the country, especially in states such as Michigan that expanded Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced in June. By the end of April, 6 million more people were enrolled in Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program compared with the six-month period before the Affordable Care Act.
