A school district in Washington State has decided to play hardball with a football coach who refused to stop his mid-field, post-game prayers.

I received an exclusive copy of a three-page letter sent to Bremerton High School Coach Joe Kennedy from Superintendent Aaron Leavell.

The nutshell? Coach Joe must stop praying or he will be punished.

“Any further violations will be grounds for discipline, up to and including discharge from District employment,” Leavell wrote in an Oct. 23 letter.

I can only imagine what might happen should the coach have to call a Hail Mary play.
