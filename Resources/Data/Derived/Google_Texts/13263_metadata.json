So far, it\u2019s not even close to keeping that pledge and probably never will.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, a pro-ObamaCare organization that, among other activities, keeps up with health care data, says that more than \u201c47 million nonelderly Americans were uninsured in 2012.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no broad agreement with the accuracy of that number, though. The actual figure is unlikely to be that high. Not every one of those 47 million was chronically uninsured \u2014 millions go without coverage for short periods due to job changes, for instance, yet are still counted among the uncovered.\n\nMany others simply make a conscious (and often rational) decision to not buy insurance, though they can afford it. As many as 8 million of the \u201cuninsured\u201d use Medicaid, and another estimated 10 million aren\u2019t citizens.\n\nBut whatever the number is, ObamaCare will fall short of providing \u2014 or even establishing the conditions for \u2014 universal coverage.\n\nFour months ago, the administration happily reported that 8 million had signed up for ObamaCare coverage. But now, in the middle of August, that number looks to have fallen to about 6 million or less, according to IBD staff writer Jed Graham.\n\nReporting Tuesday, Graham said that, based on attrition at Aetna, one of the larger insurers participating in the ObamaCare exchanges, there are \u201cindications that enrollment has turned down.\u201d\n\nGraham noted that Cigna also expects to lose enrollees. \u201cOther major insurers\u201d avoided \u201cquestions about attrition,\u201d but none denied that it was occurring.\n\nReasons for attrition vary, says Graham, from high premium costs to the plans\u2019 high deductibles to enrollees changing plans \u201cso they wouldn\u2019t have to switch doctors.\u201d Others landed jobs that have health benefits, and some \u201clost income and qualified for Medicaid.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for the fall from the 8 million-enrollee peak is simply bad faith on the part of the White House.\n\nAs we\u2019ve covered in our Issues & Insights pages, the administration used an artificially inflated number because it tallied enrollees who dropped out before ever paying a single premium. We said in May that the White House counted anywhere from \u201c800,000 to 1.4 million people\u201d who never enrolled. We also said that readers shouldn\u2019t \u201cbe surprised if more stop paying or cancel their plans once they realize how little they\u2019re getting for their bloated premium payments.\u201d\n\nUniversal coverage will never be achieved without the establishment of an authoritarian system such as in Great Britain. And let\u2019s not confuse coverage with care \u2014 remember that in Britain, there is a high quantity of the former and a low quality of the latter.\n\nAmericans don\u2019t deserve to have that forced on them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Death Spiral: The Affordable Care Act was a promise to provide health insurance for all those tens of millions of Americans who weren't covered.
