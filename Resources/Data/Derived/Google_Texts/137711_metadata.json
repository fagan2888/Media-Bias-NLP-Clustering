Apple-size blossoms bow over the iron railings of the stately Ashkenazi Synagogue; a few blocks across the Miljacka River, thorny rose bushes rise in the courtyard of the 16th-century Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ijska Mosque. The flowers struck me, when I visited earlier this month, as a kind of unifying emblem in a city famous for its sometimes-fractious diversity.\n\nAsk anyone here what a Sarajevo Rose is, though, and they will point you not to the park but to the pavement, where you can still see the scattered pockmarks left by mortar bombs during the Siege of Sarajevo. More than 11,000 people were killed during that 44-month battle, which, when it ended in 1996, had become the longest siege of the modern era. During the first two years of fighting, Bosnian Serb militias launched an average of 329 mortars a day at Sarajevo, damaging 97 percent of the city\u2019s building stock. Each mortar that hit the pavement left a cluster of scars that, when filled in with a reddish resin, became known as a Sarajevo Rose.\n\nIt\u2019s a double meaning that speaks neatly to the way in which the city\u2019s charms have been tarnished by war, its legacy laced with violence. Like Vedran Smajlovi\u0107\u2019s violin performance in the charred core of the National Library, or the wooden Olympic Stadium seats repurposed to construct coffins, the rose is a symbol of both triumph and pain.\n\nA nearby intersection also harbors a dual symbolism. On this street corner, on June 28, 1914, a 19-year-old Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip assassinated the Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sofia, setting in motion a chain of events that led to the First World War.\n\nToday, the adjacent museum labels it \u201cthe street corner that started the 20th century.\u201d But that simple historical phrasing is a recent innovation. Over the past century, this unremarkable stretch of sidewalk has hosted a half-dozen memorials, each expressing the contemporary political attitude toward Princip\u2019s deed.\n\nIn 1914, this street corner changed history. Since then, it has reflected how history changes.\n\nThe fundamental question plaguing this historic site, and one that still paralyzes Bosnia today, is whether Princip and his accomplices were terrorists or heroes. Most of Europe has been firmly of the former mind since 1914, while Serbs in particular have always considered the assassination a noble blow against imperial oppression. This little street has lurched between those interpretations, an urban symbol whose impact has reached not just Bosnians, or Yugoslavians, but global political leaders like Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe only story that can be told without caveat or argument is the story of the killing itself. Franz Ferdinand, the nephew of the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I, toured Sarajevo with his pregnant wife on June 28, 1914. The royal couple survived an initial assassination attempt, in the form of a grenade that bounced off their open-top car and exploded behind them. But later, on their way to visit the wounded at the hospital, their car halted in front of Princip, who shot the archduke and his wife at close range with a semi-automatic Belgian pistol.\n\nThat sidewalk was put into political service shortly afterward, on June 28, 1917, when the Austro-Hungarian rulers of Bosnia dedicated the Spomenik Umorstvu, or the \u201cMonument to Murder.\u201d In this wartime shrine, a bronze relief of the archduke and his wife was suspended by putti between two 30-foot columns.\n\nThe next year, Austria-Hungary fell, Yugoslavia was born, and the monument was dismembered. The medallion now rests in the basement of the nearby Art Gallery.\n\nYet the new South Slav kingdom \u2014 as Paul Miller, a professor of history at McDaniel College, has shown in a new paper \u2014 was initially reluctant to use the stones of Sarajevo to confront the European consensus. When, in 1930, Yugoslav authorities finally commemorated the incident with a small inscription noting that Princip had \u201cproclaimed freedom,\u201d they immediately faced international opposition from public figures who considered the assassination a despicable casus belli \u2013 not a justified act of anti-colonial rebellion. Churchill called the memorial an \u201cinfamy,\u201d and the associated outrage convinced Yugoslavia to disown its own dedication ceremony.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Franz Ferdinand was killed 100 years ago, few could have anticipated the ripples it would send through history", "title": "Ghosts of an assassination: The chaotic history of Franz Ferdinand\u2019s demise", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "When Franz Ferdinand was killed 100 years ago, few could have anticipated the ripples it would send through history", "title": "Ghosts of an assassination: The chaotic history of Franz Ferdinand\u2019s demise", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/29/ghosts_of_an_assassination_the_chaotic_history_of_franz_ferdinands_demise/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/franz_ferdinand.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When Franz Ferdinand was killed 100 years ago, few could have anticipated the ripples it would send through history", "title": "Ghosts of an assassination: The chaotic history of Franz Ferdinand\u2019s demise", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/franz_ferdinand.jpg", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Henry Grabar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Dream City, Editor's Picks, Franz Ferdinand, History, Nationalism, Political Violence, sarajevo, serbia, World War I", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Franz Ferdinand, the nephew of the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I, toured Sarajevo with his pregnant wife on June 28, 1914.\nEach mortar that hit the pavement left a cluster of scars that, when filled in with a reddish resin, became known as a Sarajevo Rose.\nIn 1914, this street corner changed history.\nAsk anyone here what a Sarajevo Rose is, though, and they will point you not to the park but to the pavement, where you can still see the scattered pockmarks left by mortar bombs during the Siege of Sarajevo.\nTopics: Dream City, Editor's Picks, Franz Ferdinand, History, Nationalism, Political Violence, sarajevo, serbia, World War I, Life News, News, Politics NewsIn June, magnificent roses bloom in the Sarajevo valley, from residential gardens on the hillsides down to the river and the city center."}
