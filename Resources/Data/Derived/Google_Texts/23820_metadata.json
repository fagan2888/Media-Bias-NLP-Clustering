The IRS\u2019s $11.3 billion budget for 2014 is $840 million or 7 percent below the level appropriated in 2010 \u2014 the last year before Congress began cutting discretionary programs.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nThe current U.S. tax gap\u2014the uncollected taxes each year due to fraud, underpayment, or accounting errors\u2014is roughly $400 billion a year. Collecting even a quarter of that treasure would be worth an investment of less than half a billion dollars.\n\nLast week, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen warned that the latest $346 million in cuts are going to further cripple the agency from fulfilling its expanding responsibilities\u2014including enforcing the more than 40 new provisions under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: Budget Cuts and Mismanagement Boost IRS Tax Cheats\n\nHe also said the dwindling resources will likely cost taxpayers about $2 billion in uncollected revenue that the agency could have collected, if they were staffed sufficiently. He called the budget cuts a \u201ctax cut to tax cheats,\u201d saying it will be easier for people to get away with collecting fraudulent refunds since there will be fewer auditors to enforce the tax code.\n\n\u201cThat means some people cutting corners on their taxes or not complying are going to get away with it, and that is a decision that Congress has made,\u201d Koskinen said.\n\nThe issue is not new to the IRS. Over the last few years, the agency has experienced significant budget cuts and hiring freezes while at the same time dealing with an expanded role. But the latest cuts seem to have agency officials more concerned than ever.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re well beyond cutting out any fat,\u201d Koskinen told reporters at a press conference. \u201cAnd we\u2019re now into cutting, as people say, muscle headed toward bone.\u201d\n\nRelated: Get Ready for the Tax Collector to Come Calling\n\nKoskinen had previously told his workers to expect a hiring freeze and no overtime next year. But now the IRS chief said the budget cuts could mean another round of furloughs at the agency\u2014adding that doing so would mean effectively shutting down the entire operation for a few days, as they did in the summer of 2013 under sequestration.\n\n\u201cPeople call it furloughs; I view it as: Are we going to have to shut the place down?\u201d Koskinen said at a press conference on Thursday. \u201cThere is no way right now we can say that won\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nHe said the final decision about how the IRS will proceed will be made by management officials in the coming weeks.\n\nBut the IRS won\u2019t likely get sympathy from lawmakers on Capitol Hill--especially Republicans who targeted the agency\u2019s budget in retaliation for unfairly scrutinizing Tea Party groups. The IRS has also previously been in trouble for its budgeting practices\u2014including lavish spending on conferences in Las Vegas\u2014which have given lawmakers more reason to be in favor of cutting the agency\u2019s budget.\n\nMeanwhile, Koskinen, who took office earlier this year in the aftermath of the spending scandals, has tried to convince Congress that slicing the IRS\u2019s budget is detrimental to the country\u2019s bottom line. He argued that the latest budget cut will directly lead to billions less in revenue.\n\nAs The Fiscal Times previously reported IRS collections have dropped in recent years. In 2013, the agency collected about $53.35 billion\u2014down from $59.2 billion in 2007. The decline is likely explained by the reduction in front-line revenue agents whose job is focused solely on enforcement and collections. In 2010, the IRS had 6,042 of these workers\u2014that dropped to 4,748 in 2013. And, overall, tax enforcement workers at all levels dropped from number 22,710 in fiscal 2010 to just 19,531 last year.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s not going to be a very happy holiday at the Internal Revenue Service.", "title": "More Budget Cuts at the IRS Could Cost Billions", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/22/More-Budget-Cuts-IRS-Could-Cost-Billions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-05-30T210345Z_1_CBRE94T1MIL00_RTROPTP_2_USA-TAX-IRS-CRITERIA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/22/More-Budget-Cuts-IRS-Could-Cost-Billions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-05-30T210345Z_1_CBRE94T1MIL00_RTROPTP_2_USA-TAX-IRS-CRITERIA.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s not going to be a very happy holiday at the Internal Revenue Service.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae94\"", "article_summary": "Related: Budget Cuts and Mismanagement Boost IRS Tax CheatsHe also said the dwindling resources will likely cost taxpayers about $2 billion in uncollected revenue that the agency could have collected, if they were staffed sufficiently.\nOver the last few years, the agency has experienced significant budget cuts and hiring freezes while at the same time dealing with an expanded role.\nHe called the budget cuts a \u201ctax cut to tax cheats,\u201d saying it will be easier for people to get away with collecting fraudulent refunds since there will be fewer auditors to enforce the tax code.\nThe IRS\u2019s $11.3 billion budget for 2014 is $840 million or 7 percent below the level appropriated in 2010 \u2014 the last year before Congress began cutting discretionary programs.\nHe argued that the latest budget cut will directly lead to billions less in revenue."}
