**UPDATE, Thursday, April 9, 2015: Sling TV now says HBO is available as of today.**

For those keeping track, HBO goes live on Sling TV this Saturday (April 11, 2015) giving fans a day to prep for the Game of Thrones season premiere. While the Douglas County company had originally planned to go live today, the launch was scrapped to coincide with new apps and service improvements.

Sling TV obviously doesn’t want a repeat of last weekend’s Final Four fiasco, where the service was overloaded and customers saw errors during sign up. Roger Lynch, Sling TV’s CEO, told tech-news site Re/Code that “outages and quality issues only affected around 1,000 users — ‘a fraction’ of Sling’s base.”

In a statement on Wednesday, Sling said that Saturday’s launch will update apps to improve several things, including:

1. Various enhancements to reduce overhead and load on our servers. This will allow us to provide a more seamless experience to all customers during periods of heavy viewership.

2. Addition of parental controls across all channels that give customers the ability to manage TV shows by rating.

3. Mini guide updates that make it easier for customers to find shows by subject/genre on the following devices: Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Roku players, Roku TV models and Xbox One.

HBO on Sling now arrives about five days after Apple released the HBO Now app, which is more of a on-demand streaming HBO service available to non cable-TV customers. You can only view shows on Apple products.

Sling’s provides the actual live channel. Cablevision, meanwhile, is also offering HBO Now.

Either way, consumers must pay about $15 a month to access HBO, though all the streaming options offer a free trial. Sling TV users must have the regular $20 basic TV package before they can add HBO.
