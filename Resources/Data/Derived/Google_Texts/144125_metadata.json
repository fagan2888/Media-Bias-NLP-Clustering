Do something. About those kids.\n\nOnly this time, the anxious appeal is coming from Jai Sanders, an African-American parent in Nashville, Tennessee, who has a stake in the matter: The something about to be done is aimed squarely at him and his children.\n\nSanders, pausing briefly before assembling a bagel with lox and cream cheese, explains, \u201cBut what we\u2019re currently doing is throwing solutions at the wall to see what sticks, without any research or any consultation with the people who are affected the most.\u201d\n\nHis tone of voice doesn\u2019t carry a trace of the anger or resentment that could be inferred from what he just said. Actually, Sanders exudes affability. With a green ball cap tipped slightly back from his cherubic face, he gestures broadly and smiles incessantly. His impossibly well-behaved 3-year-old daughter seated beside him only occasionally diverts him as she carefully navigates her bagel.\n\nThey live with mom and the rest of the family in the same house where Jai grew up \u2013 the third generation of Sanders to live in their home in East Nashville.\n\nSanders, who attended both public and private schools while growing up in East Nashville, has chosen, along with his wife, to send their children to their neighborhood public school, Inglewood Elementary. Inglewood was \u201cthe default for us,\u201d he says.\n\nAn older daughter who attends the school has been identified gifted and talented which has enabled her to be included in a program where she is provided with an Individual Education Plan so she receives specific attention to her abilities.\n\nYet now Sanders finds himself and his family swept into a raging Music City controversy. Conversations about public education \u2013 where you send your kid to school, where other parents send their kids, and who gets to decide \u2013 have exploded into acrimonious bickering, full of charges and counter-charges.\n\nThe debate pits parents against parents, schools against schools, and communities against communities. School board meetings have turned into raucous events that sometimes descend into boisterous demonstrations. And public officials swipe at each other in social media and opinion columns, accusing one another of having ulterior motives.\n\n\u201cNone of this was in the \u201cdad manual\u201d when I started a family,\u201d Sanders explains, making quote marks in the air. \u201cI\u2019d much rather go back to being a PTO dad planning the Christmas party rather than going to meetings and shouting my head off to save our school.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe love Inglewood Elementary,\u201d Sanders says, although he admits, \u201cnot all parents agree with me.\u201d\n\nApparently, neither does the state of Tennessee.\n\nWe\u2019ve Made Your School a \u201cPriority\u201d\n\nAs state media outlet The Tennessean reported recently, low scores on student standardized tests and other indicators led the state to designate 15 Metro Nashville Public Schools, including Inglewood, as \u201cPriority Schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cPriority Schools are the lowest-performing 5 percent of schools in Tennessee,\u201d according to the state\u2019s education department, making them \u201celigible for inclusion in the Achievement School District or in district Innovation Zones. They may also plan and adopt turnaround models for school improvement.\u201d\n\nThe plain English translation of that benign bureaucratic speak is that Inglewood has been labeled a failure by the state, which gives the state or district power to do something to it. Often, the something that gets done to a Priority School in Tennessee is to fire the school\u2019s principal or teachers, hand the school over to a charter school management organization, or a mixture of the above.\n\nOne of the potential options the district has chosen for Inglewood is for the school to be taken over by the KIPP nationwide charter school management organization. The outgoing district superintendent, Jesse Register, has already disclosed the district has signed a contract with KIPP, only he won\u2019t say which school KIPP is destined to take over.\n\nSanders is not the only Nashville parent dreading the fate that could befall a local school.\n\n\u201cNot In Favor Of Chaos\u201d\n\nAcross town, Ruth Stewart shares a similar perspective about the fate of a different Nashville elementary school.\n\nLike Inglewood, Kirkpatrick Elementary has also been designated a Priority School and potentially targeted for a charter takeover. Superintendent Register has promised to announce soon which of the two schools \u2013 Inglewood or Kirkpatrick \u2013 will be turned over first.\n\nAlso like Inglewood, Kirkpatrick serves a disproportionate percentage of children from low-income African-American and Hispanic households. Although Stewart does not have a child attending Kirkpatrick, she speaks admiringly of its teachers, describing how they \u201ctake on the duties of social workers \u2013 make sure kids get home okay, make sure they have warm coats to wear in the winter.\u201d\n\nStewart, who is white but has an adopted African-American child, says, \u201cKids at Kirkpatrick don\u2019t get the privileges my kids have gotten. So why aren\u2019t we divvying up resources equitably to help solve that?\u201d\n\nAt a lunch spot in West Nashville known for serving healthful fare, she speaks about her situation in Metro Nashville Public Schools. Between forkfuls of a salad of chicken and mixed greens she describes the \u201cchaotic\u201d situation in Nashville, contrasting it often to what she is familiar with in the practice of medicine. She is a physician.\n\n\u201cNothing has been transparent about the current agenda. This sows anxiety and division in the community,\u201d she says.\n\nStewart sees the consequences of new education policies in Tennessee as having a \u201cnegative impact on people\u2019s feelings that schools are part of the community \u2026 I\u2019m not sure what to do, but I\u2019m not in favor of chaos.\u201d\n\nNashville has two middle schools facing a similar fate. The two schools, Neely\u2019s Bend Middle Prep and Madison Middle Prep, have both been placed on the state\u2019s Priority list, removed from the oversight of the Nashville district, and grouped with other troubled Tennessee schools in the state\u2019s Achievement School District.\n\nThe ASD was founded as part of Tennessee\u2019s effort to qualify for the Obama administration\u2019s Race to the Top grant.\n\nWhat state takeover means to the students, parents and teachers of Neely\u2019s Bend and Madison is that one of their schools \u2013 again, to be announced at a later date \u2013 will be handed over to a charter management operation.\n\nBecause the ASD is a charter authorizer, it can designate any of its schools for charter takeover, and indeed has done so numerous times. In fact, the superintendent of the ASD, Chris Barbic, is the founder and ex-CEO of the Yes Prep chain of charter schools. When the ASD rolled into Memphis, another troubled Tennessee school district, the ASD immediately began targeting the district\u2019s schools for takeover by charter operations, as a 2013 report from The Atlantic recounted.\n\nEnforced charter takeovers like the ones being carried out in Tennessee are happening across the country.\n\nWe\u2019re All Nashville Now\n\nThe debate in Nashville echoes themes the nation has heard from New York City and Los Angeles where students, teachers and parents have engaged in prolonged battles over decisions to co-locate charter schools in public school buildings.\n\nIn Newark, New Jersey, a state-imposed plan enacted this year intends to move charter schools into the district\u2019s facilities. In Detroit, the state agency in charge of that city\u2019s schools has a new plan to convert over 30 percent of the districts into charter schools. In Wisconsin, a bill has been introduced in the state legislature that would make all public schools deemed to be \u201cfailures\u201d become charter schools.\n\nMost recently, the school district of York, Pennsylvania, made national headlines when the state announced the city\u2019s schools would be turned into an \u201call charter\u201d district. As a report at The Daily Caller explained, a legal path has been cleared for a state \u201crecovery officer\u201d to proceed with \u201ca plan to place all of the city\u2019s public schools under the control of Charter Schools USA, a for-profit school management company.\u201d\n\nThe idea of an \u201call charter\u201d school district has been tried before, in Muskegon Heights, Michigan. The results were disastrous as the charter operator promptly alienated most of the teachers and then backed out of the deal. But that seems to deter no one directing these efforts.\n\nIn every one of these charter takeover cases, there have been large numbers of students, parents and teachers who have spoken out in opposition.\n\nAnd although takeovers of \u201cfailed\u201d schools are often justified as rational responses to \u201curban decay\u201d or \u201cunderutilization,\u201d none of these arguments apply to Nashville. Nashville is a city that is experiencing strong growth in population and employment, and public schools are experiencing problems with overcrowding because of high demand for their services. Nashville is a neither a union bastion nor a hardened, bitter battleground of Big City politics. So it\u2019s not hard to imagine that if a fight like this can break out here, it could break out anywhere.\n\nWhat policy leaders and charter advocates contend, in nearly every one of these takeover cases, is that they are following the reform model from Louisiana\u2019s state-operated Recovery School District, which took over most of New Orleans\u2019 public schools after Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThing is, there hasn\u2019t been another Katrina. Instead, there\u2019s been a manmade disaster.\n\nDue to the influence of federal policies, such as Race to the Top, and relentless marketing by charter school advocates, virtually every state has a methodology for designating \u201clow performing\u201d schools as Priority and targeting them for radical solutions like charter school takeover.\n\nAccountability Gone Awry\n\nBack when these plans for targeting the nation\u2019s \u201clow performing\u201d schools were unveiled by the Obama administration, the National Center for Education Policy, an education policy research think tank affiliated with the University of Colorado, Boulder, warned in a brief that the Obama plans\u2019s accountability system, \u201cwhich determines how schools will be evaluated\u201d is not substantiated by any legitimate research, and that the \u201cintervention models for low-scoring schools is not developed, much less supported in the research.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the notion that education performance of public schools can be turned around by taking them over and converting them to charter schools or co-locating charters in their buildings is particularly unproven.\n\nEven in New Orleans, mass charter conversion has been \u201cdisastrous,\u201d writes Kristen Buras for The Progressive. After the charter takeover of NOLA public schools post Katrina, the state began issuing letter grades for all schools in 2011, and 79 percent of charter schools in the New Orleans district received a \u201cD\u201d or \u201cF.\u201d In 2014, RSD-New Orleans schools are still performing below the vast majority of the state\u2019s other districts at the fourth and eighth grades in subjects tested by the Louisiana Educational Assessment Program, including English language arts, math and science.\n\nIn Tennessee, state takeovers of public schools have so far yielded mostly disappointing results too, according to math teacher and statistical whiz Gary Rubenstein. \u201cThey are still in the bottom 5 percent, dead last with the second to last district not even close to them,\u201d he writes.\n\nDespite these troubling results, there are powerful advocates for continuing charter takeovers of public schools. Takeovers and other methods of proliferating charters, such as vouchers, have helped push the number of charter schools in America over the 6,400 mark in 2013-14, with more than 2.5 million students enrolled, according to The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. Charters are now the fastest growing segment of our public education system.\n\nDoing the Math\n\nIn Nashville, charter school performance varies widely, with some performing significantly better than the rest of the state and better than Nashville public schools, while others are at the bottom of state rankings.\n\nBut academic performance doesn\u2019t seem to be the most important factor in selecting which schools are targeted for charter takeover and which are not, at least not in Nashville. As Nashville school board members Amy Frogge and Jill Speering point out in a recent op ed, one of the middle schools targeted for state takeover, Neely\u2019s Bend, performs better on state assessments than many other Nashville schools do \u2013 and better than schools already taken over by the state.\n\nAlso, charter schools may pose a drain on public school finances. According to a recent study conducted by the Florida-based research firm MGT of America, growth of charters will harm Nashville public schools overall. \u201cThe loss of even a single student will reduce the revenue received,\u201d the report states, because \u201cthe reduction of a single student in a classroom will not alleviate the need to have a teacher in that classroom \u2026 In fact, the per-pupil cost for that classroom or school would increase because the fixed expenses would remain, but the revenue to support them would be decreased.\u201d\n\nThe report estimates that the net negative fiscal impact of charter school growth on the district\u2019s public schools would be more than $300 million in direct costs over a five-year period. This figure is likely an under-estimate, the report contends, as there are \u201cother indirect costs\u201d of charter schools related to administration that are \u201cnot easily identified.\u201d Meanwhile, there are no new revenue sources being considered to offset the additional costs. \u201cThere appears to be an assumption,\u201d the report notes, \u201cthat the central organizations supporting the charter schools can continue to do so within existing resources.\u201d\n\nThe MGT report is mostly supportive of the idea of charters and recommends ways to ensure their success without harming public schools. Nevertheless, it concludes, \u201cNew charter schools will, with nearly 100 percent certainty, have a negative fiscal impact\u201d on the school district.\u201d (emphasis added)\n\nWhen It\u2019s Your Kid\n\nThe numbers arguments don\u2019t even begin to capture what\u2019s driving a lot of parent anxiety in Nashville.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not anti-charter,\u201d Jai Sanders declares. \u201cI don\u2019t advocate closing any East Nashville charters.\u201d But he does have specific reservations about turning Inglewood into a KIPP charter school.\n\nHe strongly objects to the heavy handed, top-down way Nashville Metro school leaders have gone about the process of pushing charter governance on neighborhood schools. For instance, he is worried about the principal of his child\u2019s school, who he is happy with, being forced out.\n\nSanders says the district has enough charter schools as it is. \u201cCharter schools should be something on the periphery. They were originally supposed to be incubators of ideas and not the standard for schools in the community.\u201d\n\nSanders also has \u201cphilosophical problems\u201d with the way some charter schools \u201cgo about their business,\u201d specifically how they are governed by boards of directors rather than school boards. \u201cThis way of doing education doesn\u2019t seem like education to me.\u201d\n\nSanders mentions KIPP charter schools in particular, as a model of education he has \u201creservations\u201d about. KIPP is known for practicing an approach to schooling loosely labeled as \u201cNo Excuse,\u201d which relies on strict behavioral controls of students. He describes KIPP\u2019s approach as a \u201cmilitary school for civilians, with the extreme tracking of students, requiring SLANT, and no excuses.\u201d SLANT is a foundational practice in KIPP schools that dictates students must Sit up, Listen, Ask and answer questions, Nod and Track the teachers\u2019 movements. There have been numerous, verified reports of KIPP and other charter schools practicing the No Excuse approach, using very harsh disciplinary practices, including high rates of suspensions and expulsions, on students.\n\nRuth Stewart \u2013 who describes herself as \u201canti-charter\u201d but \u201cwilling to work with my pro-charter colleagues to have an outcome we all can live with\u201d \u2013 also expresses reservations with the charter school she visited, Liberty Collegiate Academy in the RePublic School charter chain. \u201cNot for my kid,\u201d she states. \u201cIt was very tightly controlled \u2026 eye contact, hand clapping, too controlling.\u201d\n\nShe contrasts the \u201ccontrolling\u201d environment of No Excuse charter schools to what she has observed in public schools, where she has experienced \u201ca much more nurturing learning environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand some parents would choose KIPP and the No Excuse approach,\u201d she says. \u201cBut something leaves me very uneasy about that kind of control exerted on children of color. So all white kids get to go to a school with a Montessori approach while children of color get eye control?\n\n\u201cWhat we all want are children who are autonomous, responsible and intrinsically motivated. But I\u2019m not sure these types of charter schools get us where we want to go.\u201d\n\n[Editorial note: A pro-charter Nashville parent contacted for this article declined to be quoted on record.]\n\nAnother oft-stated reservation with charter schools is their unquestionable link to increased segregation of students based on race and income.\n\n\u201cStudies in a number of different states and school districts in the U.S. show that charter schools often lead to increased school segregation,\u201d writes Iris C. Rotberg, a research professor of education policy at The George Washington University\u2019s Graduate School of Education and Human Development, in Education Week.\n\n\u201cEven schools that employ a seemingly randomized under lottery system for enrolling students,\u201d Rotberg explains, \u201calso choose \u2013 sometimes explicitly and sometimes indirectly \u2013 and increase the probability of segregation. They limit the services they provide, thereby excluding certain students, or offer programs that appeal only to a limited group of families.\u201d\n\nRotberg cites studies showing, \u201cIn some communities, charter schools have a higher concentration of minority students than traditional public schools,\u201d while \u201cIn others, charter schools serve as a vehicle for \u2018white flight.\u2019 \u2026 School segregation increases in both cases.\u201d\n\nSome Nashville parents also feel charter school proliferation has led to increased racial segregation of students. \u201cA lot of charter school rationale is based on racial diversity, but it seems to me we\u2019re getting less diverse due to charters,\u201d Stewart states.\n\nStewart\u2019s observations may or not be accurate. That would require statistical analysis. But parent perceptions are often stronger influencers of public opinion than statistics.\n\nCharter school advocates understand that all too well.\n\nEvolution of a Movement that Is \u201cBad for Kids\u201d\n\nIndeed, the rhetoric driving charter school advocacy has changed dramatically over the years as proponents of charter schools condition public perceptions to accept the expansion of these schools.\n\nThat evolution has been documented extensively in the recently published book \u201cA Smarter Charter: Finding What Works for Charter Schools and Public Education,\u201d by Richard D. Kahlenberg and Halley Potter.\n\nThe original vision of charter schools, the book contends, was to provide \u201claboratory schools\u201d to \u201cexperiment\u201d with different approaches that could eventually be considered for adopting on a much larger scale. Two foundational tenets to these experimental schools, the authors maintain, were for teachers to have a stronger voice in determining the management of the school and for the student body to have higher degrees of economic and racial diversity than traditional public schools.\n\nHowever, as states began enacting legislation to create and spread charter schools \u2013 beginning with Minnesota in 1991, then ramping up significantly under the presidential administration of Bill Clinton \u2013 there was a \u201cmore conservative vision\u201d repeated again and again that reinforced charter schools as \u201ccompetitors\u201d to the public school system \u2013 even to the extent of replacing public schools, some argued.\n\n\u201cThe public policy rhetoric changed from an emphasis on how charters could best serve as laboratory partners to public schools to whether charters as a group are \u2018better\u2019 or \u2018worse,'\u201d the book argues. And \u201cover time, the market metaphor came to replace the laboratory metaphor.\u201d\n\nDesires to break public school teachers\u2019 unions crept into arguments for the spread of charters as well, as \u201cconservative charter school advocates argued that having a nonunion environment was a key advantage \u2013 perhaps the defining advantage \u2013 over regular public schools,\u201d and influential voices in public school policy, such as former Assistant Secretary of Education Chester Finn, who had been initially skeptical of charter schools, gradually became strong advocates for creating more of them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A fight over education in Nashville might come your way next: It's a proxy for dangerous right-wing education ideas", "title": "Koch brothers/charter school nightmare: \u201cWhite kids get to go to a school with a Montessori approach while children of color get eye control\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A fight over education in Nashville might come your way next: It's a proxy for dangerous right-wing education ideas", "title": "Koch brothers/charter school nightmare: \u201cWhite kids get to go to a school with a Montessori approach while children of color get eye control\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/17/koch_brotherscharter_school_nightmare_white_kids_get_to_go_to_a_school_with_a_montessori_approach_while_children_of_color_get_eye_control/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/david_koch_classroom.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A fight over education in Nashville might come your way next: It's a proxy for dangerous right-wing education ideas", "title": "Koch brothers/charter school nightmare: \u201cWhite kids get to go to a school with a Montessori approach while children of color get eye control\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/david_koch_classroom.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jeff Bryant", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Charter schools, Editor's Picks, Education, Koch Brothers, nashville", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Superintendent Register has promised to announce soon which of the two schools \u2013 Inglewood or Kirkpatrick \u2013 will be turned over first.\nAccording to a recent study conducted by the Florida-based research firm MGT of America, growth of charters will harm Nashville public schools overall.\nSo all white kids get to go to a school with a Montessori approach while children of color get eye control?\nRuth Stewart \u2013 who describes herself as \u201canti-charter\u201d but \u201cwilling to work with my pro-charter colleagues to have an outcome we all can live with\u201d \u2013 also expresses reservations with the charter school she visited, Liberty Collegiate Academy in the RePublic School charter chain.\nIn Newark, New Jersey, a state-imposed plan enacted this year intends to move charter schools into the district\u2019s facilities."}
