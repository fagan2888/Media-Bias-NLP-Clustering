Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who recently called for amending the Constitution to allow the public to vote on Supreme Court judges, says strict constructionist Supreme Court justices with a solid paper trail are needed.\n\nCruz believes that the main problem is that Supreme Court justices are being chosen without a proven paper trail. He points to former Supreme Court Justice David Souter, who he says was not vetted properly by President George H.W. Bush and turned into one of the most liberal justices the court has seen in some time.\n\n\u201cIn one room was Edith Jones, the rock-ribbed conservative on the 5th Circuit Court Of Appeals who follows the Constitution, who doesn\u2019t legislate from the bench,\u201d Cruz tells The Daily Signal. \u201cIn the other room was David Souter. He chose David Souter because it would be easier. He had never defended conservative principles so there was nothing to defend and David Souter turned into a racial, liberal judicial activist.\u201d\n\nCruz has more criticism for George W. Bush and his nomination of current Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\n\u201cIn one room, was John Roberts and in another room was Mike Luttig, my former boss, the strongest conservative appellate judge in the country, someone who had been Antonin Scalia\u2019s very first law clerk, who had spent over a decade following the law and Constitution faithfully and once again, George W. Bush chose the easier decision.\u201d Cruz laments. \u201cJohn Roberts didn\u2019t have a paper trail. You couldn\u2019t prove he was a conservative.\u201d\n\nCruz believes that if Edith Jones and Mike Luttig were on the Supreme Court today, America would be a vastly different place.\n\n\u201cObamacare would have been struck down three years ago,\u201d Cruz says. \u201cThe marriage decision, I am certain, would have come out the other way because those are jurists who would have followed the Constitution and law, rather than legislating their own radical agendas from the bench.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "They need to prove their conservatism.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "They need to prove their conservatism.", "title": "Ted Cruz: Supreme Court Nominees Need 'Paper Trail'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/724tedcruz.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-25T22:22:37+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1CZIMtl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "They need to prove their conservatism.", "title": "Ted Cruz: Supreme Court Nominees Need 'Paper Trail'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/724tedcruz.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "supreme court", "published_time": "2015-07-24T17:14:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-25T22:22:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, supreme court, edith jones, mike luttig"}, "article_summary": "Cruz believes that the main problem is that Supreme Court justices are being chosen without a proven paper trail.\nSen.
