His abandon might even have affronted the Barack Obama of 2008, who ran for president against a political system \u201cthat\u2019s divided us for too long.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama has long since concluded that pursuing dreams of reconciliation in his final two years in office is a fool\u2019s chase. So he is offering an alternative model for 21st-century presidential success.\n\nIt does not hinge on job approval ratings. As Mr. Obama\u2019s weak poll numbers make clear, he has failed to unite the country.\n\nHis current approach does not depend on bipartisan deal making or good cheer. The president has failed to win over congressional Republicans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt does not even turn on protecting the political interests of his party. Fellow Democrats were hammered on Election Day last month, as in 2010, which explains Senator Charles E. Schumer\u2019s recent complaint that the party blew it by following Mr. Obama\u2019s lead on health care.\n\nIt turns, instead, on advancing the major policy goals that Mr. Obama embraced as a candidate. Through that prism, he continues to make progress.\n\nWhen Democrats controlled Congress in 2009-10, Mr. Obama won passage of a major economic stimulus package and Wall Street regulation legislation. Those measures have been followed by a stronger recovery from the financial crisis than other advanced economies have enjoyed.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act fulfilled a goal that had eluded Democratic presidents from Harry Truman to Bill Clinton.\n\nMr. Obama kept his promises to wind down the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. After Republican election victories blocked his agenda in Congress, Mr. Obama shifted to executive action for his domestic goals. His Environmental Protection Agency is devising rules to curb carbon emissions. He invoked prosecutorial discretion to shield some five million illegal immigrants from deportation.\n\nNeither executive move accomplished as much as Mr. Obama could have through legislation, but may have been the only realistic routes forward that a polarized political system allowed him.\n\nGeorge C. Edwards III, a Texas A&M professor who edits Presidential Studies Quarterly, wrote last year that critics of Washington dysfunction \u201ctake their frustrations out on the president, declaring that he should more effectively move the public and Congress to support his initiatives. There is little prospect for success in these endeavors, however.\u201d\n\nPresidents, Mr. Edwards noted, \u201ccannot create opportunities for change. Instead, effective presidents recognize and exploit opportunities that exist in their environments.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Edwards\u2019s view rests on his conclusion, after poring over data since the advent of political polling, that the persuasive power of the bully pulpit has always been \u201ca myth.\u201d Public approval tends to drift away from any president\u2019s views over time.\n\nLacking the power to shift public opinion, presidents hold scant leverage over members of Congress not already inclined to support them, Mr. Edwards said in an interview. Moreover, they now have fewer means of persuasion.\n\nWhen President Lyndon Johnson pursued the Great Society, he could woo moderate Republicans on the basis of ideology and conservative Democrats in the name of partisan unity. In today\u2019s polarized system, lawmakers have grown increasingly uniform in opposition to a president from the other major party. And levers that had been used to broker compromise, like pending earmarks for pet projects, have mostly been eliminated.\n\nFrom the outset of Mr. Obama\u2019s presidency, Mr. Edwards argued, aspirations for a post-partisan transformation in Washington were unattainable. But he says Mr. Obama\u2019s advancement of key domestic and foreign policy goals \u201cmakes him a consequential president\u201d \u2014 for good or ill.\n\nGiven partisan and ideological divisions, roughly half the country would almost invariably choose \u201cill.\u201d The last president to muffle the trend toward increasing polarization was George Bush. Not coincidentally, he failed to win re-election.\n\nSince then, assessments of the Oval Office occupant have grown increasingly divided by partisan affiliation. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last month, 77 percent of Democrats approved of Mr. Obama\u2019s job performance; only 8 percent of Republicans did.\n\nThat ensures continued rancor over the health care law, Mr. Obama\u2019s approach to business regulations and his foreign policy, particularly whether his commitment to ending George W. Bush-era military campaigns blinded him to new emerging threats from the Islamic State and other foes. On issues like immigration, Democrats\u2019 dependence on nonwhite voters and Republicans\u2019 reliance on big majorities of whites add a racial charge to the debate.\n\nThis landscape, except in extreme circumstances, does not offer the emotional balm of consensus about a president\u2019s performance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnilateral White House action, even if it furthers a president\u2019s goals, cannot provide as durable a basis for national policy as law enacted with at least some support from both Republicans and Democrats. That is one reason the president\u2019s health care law, which passed with only Democratic votes, remains unpopular.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t define success as reversible executive orders,\u201d said William A. Galston, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and an advocate of bipartisan problem solving through the organization No Labels. \u201cThat\u2019s defining success down.\u201d\n\nMr. Galston, once Mr. Clinton\u2019s top domestic policy adviser, faults Mr. Obama for not courting Republicans as effectively as Mr. Clinton did. That did not stop House Republicans from impeaching him.\n\nAnd the affable Mr. Bush, who left his mark by cutting taxes and going to war after Sept. 11, 2001, did not get far with his pledge to be \u201ca uniter not a divider\u201d in Washington.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way politics works in America,\u201d Mr. Edwards said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141207202936,
