A man who ran to the field during a Reds game in July pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges.

Justin Buchanan, 19, recorded himself on his cellphone as he ran through center field, hopped the 10-foot outfield wall and escaped.

Buchanan was sentenced to one year probation, 100 hours of community service at the Reds Urban Youth Academy, and he must stay away from Great American Ballpark for one year.
