It\u2019s kind of a way to really stimulate demand, which is really what has been lacking as the economy has slowly recovered.\u201d\n\nFerree also said it would force a switch to alternative fuels faster than current federal policy. He doesn\u2019t accept arguments that assert a higher gas tax could be harder on the working Americans he wants to help with his income tax changes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because people have a choice about how much gas they use,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can easily transfer to a vehicle that uses less gasoline. \u201cTo me, that is an argument that is frequently used (but isn\u2019t valid.)\u201d\n\nFerree Spent 30 years as a pilot with Delta Airlines, retiring in 2003. From 2005 to 2008, he ran A Third Place in Eustis, an eatery formerly known as Ferran\u2019s Moonlight Grill.\n\nAfter closing the restaurant, Ferree helped found and served as president of a bootstrap volunteer-run environmental technology business incubator, his website states. Out of it came the start-up company WattNext, a company that installs electric car charging stations.\n\nFerree also served on the city commission from 2009-12.\n\nHe is one of three candidates in the Aug. 26 Democratic primary who are vying for the chance to challenge Webster, who lives in Winter Garden, in the November general election. Democrats Shayan Modarres of Orlando and Michael McKenna of Davenport are also running in the district that won\u2019t exist for long with its current boundaries.\n\nModarres is a civil rights lawyer from Orlando who has practiced for three years, and was one of five attorneys who represented the parents of Trayvon Martin after the boy was shot in killed in Sanford in February 2012. If elected, Modarres said, he will fight for equal rights for women and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered community, support the Affordable Care Act and work across the aisle if it can be done.\n\nMcKenna works the night shift as a supervisor of security at Walt Disney World. He has made tax and spending reform leading to a balanced federal budget his top priority. McKenna also supports gay marriage and strongly backs civil rights, especially for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered citizens, he said.\n\nFirst elected in 1980, Webster served for 28 years in the state legislature, leaving in 2008 because of term limits. He was elected to Congress in 2010 and defeated former Orlando Police Chief Val Demings to secure re-election in 2012.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Commercial", "description": "A Eustis Democrat hoping to challenge Republican incumbent Dan Webster for a congressional seat in November says he would push for drastic changes in the tax law to curb carbon emissions.", "title": "Webster challenger wants to cut income tax, raise gas tax", "url": "http://www.dailycommercial.com/news/article_221aa2e3-b8c3-5bfb-84b1-a1f0ecc8e5c6.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dailycommercial.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/31/631e6599-95c1-5c21-bd93-c3e29efeef68/53e6d05ddffd9.preview-620.jpg?resize=620%2C620", "height": 620}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailycommercial", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A Eustis Democrat hoping to challenge Republican incumbent Dan Webster for a congressional seat in November says he would push for drastic changes in the tax law to curb carbon emissions.", "fb": {"app_id": 108599415991304}, "keywords": "elections,eustis,taxes,income tax,gas tax,lake_county,eustis,news", "google-site-verification": "h_JIwo5TKFCMaJN3XKwQEjqiSRq1nDT50zFNlwpyIqo", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "elections,eustis,taxes,income tax,gas tax,lake_county,eustis,news"}, "article_summary": "He doesn\u2019t accept arguments that assert a higher gas tax could be harder on the working Americans he wants to help with his income tax changes.\nFirst elected in 1980, Webster served for 28 years in the state legislature, leaving in 2008 because of term limits.\nMcKenna also supports gay marriage and strongly backs civil rights, especially for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered citizens, he said.\nHe was elected to Congress in 2010 and defeated former Orlando Police Chief Val Demings to secure re-election in 2012.\nHe has made tax and spending reform leading to a balanced federal budget his top priority."}
