Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, and Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, spent a week together last month on a remote island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean as co-stars of a Survivor-type reality television show being filmed for the Discovery Channel. In the process, the two telegenic freshmen managed to spear fish, find water and build shelter \u2013 and live to tell about it.\n\n\u201cWe spent all that time together and we\u2019re both still standing,\u201d Heinrich told the Journal.\n\nThe one-episode show \u2013 called \u201cRival Survival\u201d \u2013 is scheduled to air on Wednesday, Oct. 29, at 8 p.m. MDT, less than a week before the Nov. 4 elections. Neither of the surviving senators is up for re-election.\n\nHeinrich said no taxpayer money was used to fund their travel expenses or Discovery\u2019s production costs.\n\nThe show\u2019s premise aims to demonstrate that people with opposing viewpoints can get past them and cooperate. The two senators spent six days on the island with nothing but three pieces of gear and their wits.\n\n\u201cAt a time when partisanship in U.S. politics litters the media landscape \u2026 \u2018Rival Survival\u2019 brings together two real-world political adversaries and maroons them on a remote island for a week,\u201d the Discovery Channel said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\u201cDisconnected from the world on an uninhabited island surrounded by shark-infested waters that mirror the seemingly treacherous terrain of the U.S. Congress, (Flake and Heinrich) must put their political differences aside and work together to find common ground through compromise if they want to survive.\u201d\n\nThe senators spent their week on the island of Eru, home to the wreckage of a downed WWII aircraft. The island \u2013 halfway between Hawaii and Australia \u2013 is in the largest protected shark sanctuary in the world.\n\nWhile the show will play up the senators\u2019 political differences, the fact is they have been pretty good friends during their first term in the Senate. In April, the two lawmakers traveled to New Mexico and Arizona together on a fact-finding mission to discuss forest restoration and wildfire prevention. Heinrich and Flake have also sat together at bipartisan congressional functions.\n\nA Discovery Channel representative told the Journal the idea for the show was the senators\u2019 and that additional episodes could be filmed featuring other lawmakers, or rivals from other walks of life. The challenge is finding people with the skills to survive on the island, the representative said.\n\nThe Discovery Channel\u2019s headquarters is located in Silver Spring, Md., where Heinrich lives. The two men, both married with children, are experienced outdoorsmen. Heinrich is an avid angler, hunter and camper who proudly displays an elk rack in his Senate office.\n\nFive years ago, on a personal mission, Flake spent a week alone (later highly publicized) on a small island in the middle of the Pacific, subsisting on coconuts and fish, and sleeping in a hammock.\n\nIn a joint statement, Heinrich and Flake said they hoped their novel approach to bipartisanship would serve as an example to their congressional colleagues and others.\n\n\u201cBoth of us know just how frustrated people are with Washington right now,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cWe can both attest that no one is more frustrated than those of us trying to get things done in this environment,\u201d the senators\u2019 statement said. \u201cWe recognize how difficult it can be to cut through the partisanship. So we decided to do something completely out of the ordinary and frankly a little extreme to show the world and our colleagues that, even if you have serious differences, if you want to survive, you have to work together.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The answer is &#39;yes&#39; in a novel approach to bipartisanship on the Discovery Channel", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Michael Coleman | Journal Washington Bureau", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/460444/sen-martin-heinrich-to-star-in-survivor-style-reality-show.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/heinrich-1000x666.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "The answer is 'yes' in a novel approach to bipartisanship on the Discovery Channel", "title": "Updated: Will Martin Heinrich survive?"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd51b\"", "article_summary": "In a joint statement, Heinrich and Flake said they hoped their novel approach to bipartisanship would serve as an example to their congressional colleagues and others.\n\u201cWe can both attest that no one is more frustrated than those of us trying to get things done in this environment,\u201d the senators\u2019 statement said.\nThe two senators spent six days on the island with nothing but three pieces of gear and their wits.\n\u201cWe spent all that time together and we\u2019re both still standing,\u201d Heinrich told the Journal.\nHeinrich is an avid angler, hunter and camper who proudly displays an elk rack in his Senate office."}
