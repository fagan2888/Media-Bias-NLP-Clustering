ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) Flowers were placed at the entrance of Rostov-on-Don airport in Southern Russia in memory of the 62 people killed aboard a passenger jet flying from Dubai which crashed in the early hours of Saturday (March 19). All passengers and crew members died when the plane crashed on its second attempt to land, according to Russian officials. Mourners laid flowers and stuffed animals and lit candles for the victims. Russia's emergencies ministry said the aircraft was a Boeing 737-800 operated by Dubai-based budget carrier Flydubai, and that most of those on board were Russian. A spokesperson for the investigative committee said they were examining two possible causes for the crash. "The investigation is currently looking into two main versions for the plane crash, a mistake by the pilot due to the harsh weather conditions or a malfunction in the plane," said Oksana Kovrizkhnaya. The names of victims of the crashed plane were displayed on a wall inside the airport building. The Investigative Committee has said one of the flight recorders had been recovered. The plane came down inside the airport's perimeter, about 250 meters short of the start of the runway.
