Some studies say that up to 30 percent of lower back pain cases are attributed to sacroiliac joint dysfunction \u2013 that is, when the sacrum and ilium bones fuse incorrectly.\n\nThe company\u2019s iFuse Implant System is meant to be minimally invasive. It uses titanium implants coated with a porous titanium spray that works to allow the bones to fuse correctly.\n\nThis new round of growth capital financing from new investor Redline Capital Management, to expand sales of its surgical device that can help with sacroiliac joint fusion. Its rationale:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nProcedure growth in the U.S. alone, as predicted by iData Research\u2019s 2014 SI joint fusion market report, is expected to grow six-fold over the next three years from the more than 8,000 surgeries performed in 2014. Additional proceeds will be used to support entry into markets outside the U.S. and Europe, including countries in the Middle East, Asia and South America.\n\nThe company just appointed a new CFO as well: Laura Francis, the former CFO of the well-funded Bay Area IVF testmaker Auxogyn.\n\n\u201cI could not be more excited to welcome Laura to the SI-Bone team. She has extensive corporate finance experience in both large and small, public and private, companies,\u201d Jeffrey Dunn, president and CEO of SI-Bone, said in a statement. \u201cThis, coupled with her experience with acquisition transactions in global markets and managing a successful public offering, will help us achieve our growth goals in the coming years.\u201d\n\nThe company has had 510(k) clearance since 2008, and a CE market for European commercialization since 2010. It has a decent CMS reimbursement profile; you can see details here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Bay Area startup has a minimally invasive treatment for lower back pain that's caused by sacroilial joint dysfunction.
