Ready-to-eat gourmet meals have improved tremendously in recent years, thanks to new cooking techniques, the hiring of top chefs, and supermarkets\u2019 focus on delivering quality food to customers.\n\nRelated: Why the Government\u2019s New Dietary Guidelines Could Set Off a Food Fight\n\nThe quality of the food in these meals, which can be pre-chopped, pre-assembled, or even pre-cooked in some cases, has improved, as supermarkets are partnering with restaurants and chefs.\n\nThe packaging has also changed. It used to be less than appetizing, with cardboard boxes featuring a picture of what the meal should look like but rarely did. The new ready-to-eat meals, frozen or not, are now often presented in clear air sealed packages that are simple and show the food the way it really is.\n\nIn the past couple of years, Caf\u00e9 Spice, which opened several restaurants in the late 1990s on the East Coast, has become one of the pioneers in distributing fancy, ready-to-eat meals, both Indian and Mexican, to supermarkets including Foodtown, Key Food, Whole Foods Market and Fairway Market in the New York area.\n\nIn Chicago, Mariano\u2019s has been forging relationships with local chefs to develop its prepared food programs within its stores, which can be both eaten on the premises or taken home.\n\nOther retailers like Central Market, Wegmans and Whole Foods, have also been successful with ready-to-go meals by targeting younger consumers and urban dwellers.\n\nOf course, there are some downsides with ready-to-go meals. You\u2019ll pay more than if you cooked a whole meal from scratch at home, although you\u2019ll save compared to eating out at a restaurant, or even ordering in.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If like most Americans you\u2019re so busy juggling work, friends and family that you don\u2019t", "title": "Supermarket Gourmet Meals Click with Working Women", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/24/Supermarket-Gourmet-Meals-Click-Working-Women", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Channa-Masala-sm.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/24/Supermarket-Gourmet-Meals-Click-Working-Women", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Channa-Masala-sm.png", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If like most Americans you\u2019re so busy juggling work, friends and family that you don\u2019t", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe7f\"", "article_summary": "Of course, there are some downsides with ready-to-go meals.\nOther retailers like Central Market, Wegmans and Whole Foods, have also been successful with ready-to-go meals by targeting younger consumers and urban dwellers.\nReady-to-eat gourmet meals have improved tremendously in recent years, thanks to new cooking techniques, the hiring of top chefs, and supermarkets\u2019 focus on delivering quality food to customers.\nIf like most Americans you\u2019re so busy juggling work, friends and family that you don\u2019t have time to cook on most nights, you might already be shopping for gourmet ready-to-eat meals, which supermarkets are increasingly promoting.\nThe new ready-to-eat meals, frozen or not, are now often presented in clear air sealed packages that are simple and show the food the way it really is."}
