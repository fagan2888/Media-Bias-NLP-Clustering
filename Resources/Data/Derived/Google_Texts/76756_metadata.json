Congress didn\u2019t. Congressional Democrats, famously, had to pass it to find out what was in it. To this day, it\u2019s doubtful that any member of Congress has read Obamacare from start to finish.\n\nSo what a gift it is that President Obama has afforded the American public the opportunity to read his administration\u2019s latest legislative pride and joy: the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. It\u2019s only twice as lengthy as the Obamacare bill that Congress couldn\u2019t be bothered to read. As Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) observed in a tweet earlier this week, the stacked TTP document is roughly 3 feet tall \u2014 almost tall enough to go on roller coasters.\n\nShould bills and laws be available and easily accessible to the people whom those laws both govern and (ostensibly) protect? Yes.\n\nShould a law\u2019s biggest partisan supporter claim a moral victory by hoarding away the key to its availability \u2014 and then begging praise when he unlocks the door? You tell us. \u201cBarack Obama\u201d himself introduces the TPP on the website the White House established for its public release. There\u2019s even a little picture of him out beside his name \u2026 almost like this is all just a silly post on Instagram.\n\nAside from being 5,554 pages long, the TPP \u2014 like most other word jumbles that pass as laws these days \u2014 is jam-packed with acronyms, jargon and convoluted legal expressions that are meaningless to anyone who isn\u2019t getting paid (read: lawyers) to write, interpret and exploit it.\n\nHere\u2019s a completely random sample from a TPP section on how we\u2019re all going to handle trading in encryption-capable electronic goods. Printed out, it\u2019s about one page in length. When you\u2019re done reading this, you can smile with the satisfaction of knowing that there are only 5,553 pages standing between Barack Obama\u2019s transparency and your enlightened gratitude:\n\nSection A: Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Products that Use Cryptography This section applies to information and communication technology (ICT) products that use cryptography. For greater certainty, for purposes of this section, a \u201cproduct\u201d is a good and does not include financial instruments. For the purposes of this section: cryptography means the principles, means or methods for the transformation of data in order to hide its information content, prevent its undetected modification or prevent its unauthorized use; and is limited to the transformation of information using one or more secret parameters (e.g., crypto variables) or associated key management; encryption means the conversion of data (plaintext) into a form that cannot be easily understood without subsequent re-conversion (ciphertext) through the use of a cryptographic algorithm; cryptographic algorithm or cipher means a mathematical procedure or formula for combining a key with plaintext to create a ciphertext; and key means a parameter used in conjunction with a cryptographic algorithm that determines its operation in such a way that an entity with knowledge of the key can reproduce or reverse the operation, while an entity without knowledge of the key cannot. With respect to a product that uses cryptography and is designed for commercial applications, no Party may impose or maintain a technical regulation or conformity assessment procedure that requires a manufacturer or supplier of the product, as a condition of the manufacture, sale, distribution, import or use of the product, to: (a) transfer or provide access to a particular technology, production process, or other information (such as a private key or other secret parameter, algorithm specification or other design detail), that is proprietary to the manufacturer or supplier and relates to the cryptography in the product, to the Party or a person in the Party\u2019s territory; (b) partner with a person in its territory; or (c) use or integrate a particular cryptographic algorithm or cipher, other than where the manufacture, sale, distribution, import or use of the product is by or for the government of the Party. Paragraph 3 shall not apply to: (a) requirements that a Party adopts or maintains relating to access to networks that are owned or controlled by the government, including those of central banks; or (b) measures taken pursuant to supervisory, investigatory or examination authority relating to financial institutions or markets. For greater certainty, nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent law enforcement authorities from requiring service suppliers using encryption they control from providing, pursuant to legal procedures, unencrypted communications.\n\nDocuments like this one are keys to the kingdom. If you\u2019re among the political class with a stake in writing it, explaining it, benefiting from it, or knowing where its lapses lie, you\u2019re in. You\u2019re a shareholder in an exclusive and self-enriching club. By design, everyone else is out. Their only role in a law like this one is to buy stuff and, for the relative handful who still have jobs, to make and move the stuff.\n\nAs Bob Livingston said:\n\nAs various GOP presidential candidates have pointed out, the TPP doesn\u2019t have to look like this. The U.S. tax code doesn\u2019t have to look like this. The Constitution on which our nation is founded doesn\u2019t look like this. Perhaps that\u2019s one small reason why people who read and understand it can take justifiable civic pride in its power: It was written to serve the citizens, for any educated person to understand. Almost any sentient person \u2014 even a foreigner who reads our founding documents and dreams of becoming an American \u2014 can be a shareholder.\n\nBut to put a document like this one in front of people, under the moral aegis of being open and honest, is to be so confident in its impenetrable, lengthy and loophole-laden verbiage that it amounts to hiding the truth in plain sight.", "article_metadata": {"projectnami": {"version": "1.3.3"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Personal Liberty\u00ae", "description": "To put a 5,554-page document in front of people, under the moral aegis of being open and honest, is to be so confident in its impenetrable, lengthy and loophole-laden verbiage that it amounts to hiding the truth in plain sight.", "title": "Obama: 'Transparency' means you, too, can read his 5,554-page trade bill", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2015/11/paper111115.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-12T09:25:35+00:00", "url": "http://personalliberty.com/obama-transparency-means-can-read-5554-page-trade-bill/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2015/11/paper111115.jpg", "description": "To put a 5,554-page document in front of people, under the moral aegis of being open and honest, is to be so confident in its impenetrable, lengthy and loophole-laden verbiage that it amounts to hiding the truth in plain sight.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama: 'Transparency' means you, too, can read his 5,554-page trade bill"}, "description": "To put a 5,554-page document in front of people, under the moral aegis of being open and honest, is to be so confident in its impenetrable, lengthy and loophole-laden verbiage that it amounts to hiding the truth in plain sight.", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 135282966636750}, "article": {"section": "Bell Ringer", "published_time": "2015-11-11T15:06:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-12T09:25:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "bvYDjX4XBto8stfZA3uAxLxNaRlmJGvc5BQnIbK_wQo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Trans-Pacific Partnership, Personal Liberty, Ben Bullard, Jeff Sessions, Transparency, TPP"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s only twice as lengthy as the Obamacare bill that Congress couldn\u2019t be bothered to read.\nTo this day, it\u2019s doubtful that any member of Congress has read Obamacare from start to finish.\nSo what a gift it is that President Obama has afforded the American public the opportunity to read his administration\u2019s latest legislative pride and joy: the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.\n\u201cBarack Obama\u201d himself introduces the TPP on the website the White House established for its public release.\nShould bills and laws be available and easily accessible to the people whom those laws both govern and (ostensibly) protect?"}
