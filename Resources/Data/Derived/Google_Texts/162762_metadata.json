Mr. Cowen wrote:\n\n\u201cSince 1973, for workers as a whole, wages have stagnated largely because of a severe productivity slowdown.\u201d\n\nCynical Jack of Washington D.C.:\n\nYes, there has been a productivity slowdown, but it is not responsible for the stagnation in wages. According to the Economic Policy Institute, real average hourly compensation has grown 113 percent since 1973 for production/nonsupervisory workers, whereas productivity has grown 254 percent.\n\nPhoto\n\nBob of Portland:\n\nProductivity growth may have slowed but productivity still has increased a great deal since the 1970s, while wages have not. The cause of wage stagnation is the decoupling of productivity growth and wage growth. The wealthy have figured out how to keep ever more of the pie for themselves and meanwhile they work to convince everyone else that what\u2019s good for them is also good for the rest of us.\n\nKaleberg of Port Angeles, Wash.:\n\nThe claim that all we need is higher productivity has been debunked for anyone looking back at the last 30 years. We\u2019ve had plenty of productivity growth, but reduced mobility and greater inequality. Basically, been there, done that. Maybe it\u2019s time to attack the problem instead.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nKyle of Indianapolis defended the claim:\n\nProfessor Cowen is writing about total factor productivity (TFP), which accounts for both capital and labor, and it is a better measure of an economy\u2019s production over time. Think of it as a measure of our return on capital. And yes, TFP growth has slowed since 1973. As stated by The Economist, the U.S. TFP growth rate from 1947-1969 was 1.9 percent, slowing to 0.8 percent from 1970-present.\n\nMore:\n\n\u25a0 Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research posted a rebuttal here.\n\n\u25a0 In a Q. and A. with Eduardo Porter for The Upshot in July, Mr. Cowen discussed inequality at length, including this passage, which touched on productivity:\n\n\u201cIf today we had a rate of technological innovation comparable to say 1890-1930, the middle class and the poor would benefit tremendously from those new goods and services. Income inequality might go up or down but we could stop worrying so much about it.\n\n\u201cThat earlier period brought such innovations as electricity, the automobile, radio, the airplane, basic advances in public health, and much better fertilizers, among many others. In more recent times we\u2019ve had a lot of innovations in the manipulation and storage of information, but this just hasn\u2019t benefited ordinary lives as much.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150407103153, "twitter": {"description": "An assertion in the economist Tyler Cowen\u2019s article \u201cIt\u2019s Not the Inequality; It\u2019s the Immobility\u201d drew the scrutiny of readers.", "title": "Readers\u2019 Turn: It\u2019s Not the Productivity; It\u2019s the Plutocracy", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/upshot/readers-turn-its-not-the-productivity-its-the-plutocracy.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003614911"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/08/upshot/08UP-Letter/08UP-Letter-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/upshot/readers-turn-its-not-the-productivity-its-the-plutocracy.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003614911", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/upshot/readers-turn-its-not-the-productivity-its-the-plutocracy.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 7, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Productivity,Income Inequality,Labor and Jobs,Cowen  Tyler", "news_keywords": "Productivity", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Upshot Staff", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/08/upshot/08UP-Letter/08UP-Letter-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Cowen, Tyler", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THE UPSHOT STAFF", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "An assertion in the economist Tyler Cowen\u2019s article \u201cIt\u2019s Not the Inequality; It\u2019s the Immobility\u201d drew the scrutiny of readers.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/08/upshot/08UP-Letter/08UP-Letter-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "An assertion in the economist Tyler Cowen\u2019s article \u201cIt\u2019s Not the Inequality; It\u2019s the Immobility\u201d drew the scrutiny of readers.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 7, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-04-07", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Cowen, Tyler", "published": "2015-04-07", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "08up-reader-newsletter", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150407121315, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/upshot/readers-turn-its-not-the-productivity-its-the-plutocracy.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/08/upshot/08UP-Letter/08UP-Letter-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An assertion in the economist Tyler Cowen\u2019s article \u201cIt\u2019s Not the Inequality; It\u2019s the Immobility\u201d drew the scrutiny of readers.", "title": "Readers\u2019 Turn: It\u2019s Not the Productivity; It\u2019s the Plutocracy"}, "pdate": 20150407, "des": "Labor and Jobs", "articleid": 100000003614911, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Readers\u2019 Turn: It\u2019s Not the Productivity; It\u2019s the Plutocracy", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The cause of wage stagnation is the decoupling of productivity growth and wage growth.\nAs stated by The Economist, the U.S. TFP growth rate from 1947-1969 was 1.9 percent, slowing to 0.8 percent from 1970-present.\nWe\u2019ve had plenty of productivity growth, but reduced mobility and greater inequality.\nAn assertion in the economist Tyler Cowen\u2019s article \u201cIt\u2019s Not the Inequality; It\u2019s the Immobility\u201d drew the scrutiny of readers.\nPhotoBob of Portland:Productivity growth may have slowed but productivity still has increased a great deal since the 1970s, while wages have not."}
