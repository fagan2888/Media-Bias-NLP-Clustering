(Olivier Douliery via Bloomberg News)\n\nThe president paused, the thump of the helicopter\u2019s blades filling the otherwise silent cabin. He had planned to tweet some statistics later that day comparing gun violence in the United States and other developed countries, but now he told his staff to cancel that.\n\nInstead, in the Oval Office two days later, he seized upon something that seemed more important to him than any argument about gun control \u2014 an idea central to his political identity and his conviction that he could unify the divided nation.\n\n\u201cThe essence of what is right about Christianity is embedded here,\u201d he said of the families, according to notes taken during the meeting.\n\nAs Obama saw it, the parishioners and their families met the most demanding teachings of Christ. \u201cThey welcomed the stranger,\u201d he said in the Oval Office meeting. \u201cThey forgave the worst violence.\u201d\n\nThese were Obama\u2019s thoughts as he prepared to deliver the eulogy for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney. He wanted to use the moment to talk about the example that the pastor, who was killed in the attack, his parishioners and their families had set for a country that had grown so suspicious and gridlocked over the course of his presidency.\n\n\u201cHow do we conduct ourselves?\u201d he asked. \u201cDon\u2019t we have to do something more than just praise how wonderful these folks were and then go about our daily lives?\u201d\n\nObama did not grow up in a religious household and became a practicing Christian as an adult. He has written more extensively about his spiritual awakening than almost any other modern president, addressing it in two books before he was elected to the White House and in more than a dozen speeches since.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The quiet impact of Obama\u2019s Christian faith", "generator": "Piklist 0.9.9.7c", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Why the president\u2019s convictions led him to believe he could unite a divided country \u2014 and why he failed.", "title": "The quiet impact of Obama\u2019s Christian faith", "url": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/2015/12/22/obama-faith/", "image": "http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/national/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/12/obamafaithD03.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "barack obama, obama, christian, Christianity, religion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "barack obama, obama, christian, Christianity, religion"}, "article_summary": "Above: President Obama attends a memorial service on Dec. 16, 2012, at Newtown High School in Newtown, Conn., for victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.\nHe had planned to tweet some statistics later that day comparing gun violence in the United States and other developed countries, but now he told his staff to cancel that.\n\u201cThey forgave the worst violence.\u201dThese were Obama\u2019s thoughts as he prepared to deliver the eulogy for the Rev.\nObama arrived in Newtown two days after the tragedy and as authorities were still trying to piece together a motive for the second-deadliest mass shooting in the United States.\nAs Obama saw it, the parishioners and their families met the most demanding teachings of Christ."}
