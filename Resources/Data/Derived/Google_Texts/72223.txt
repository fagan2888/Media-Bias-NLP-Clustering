Apple, technology giant recently announces that October 16th event will be a live stream. An American multinational corporation headquartered in Cupertino, California, stated in its live page: “Join us here at apple.com/live on October 16th at 10 a.m. PT to watch our special event live.”

Currently, the web page is displaying the message, “It’s been way too long.”

According to the recent reports, Apple’s special media event will reveal new iPads including new gold model and Macs with a 27-inch model having a high-resolution Retina display along with the Mac OS X Yosemite, the next-generation Mac operating system and Apple Pay on cards.

Moreover, iPad Air believes to be the thinnest tablet ever to hit the market.

The pre-requisite is to have the Safari Web Browser (version 5.1.10) or later on an Apple device and there are certain operating system constraints too, such as your machine should have OS X v10. 6.8 or later, though going by what the website says is that the event will be streamed live at Apple.com.

iPhone and iPad, running at least iOS 6 is needed and you can watch the stream via Apple TV units with second- or third-generation Apple TV software 6.2 or later.

Moreover, the Microsoft Windows and other operating system users can get the opportunity to watch the live stream only via live blog on Apple’s Website that is formerly used by Apple on the 9th Sept event.

The event is going to take place at Apple’s headquarters. The former uproar event of the company was the launch of Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus but the live streaming provided that time was too hitchy and slow. Hoping it works better this time.

Certainly, iPhone 6 live streaming was a disaster, as lots of fans complained that the streaming never worked on the Apple’s devices, though we were meeting the requirements of Safari Browser. This disastrous incident has also given the chance to the Samsung marketing, media team to make fun of live streaming failure.
