At the same time, HIV infection rates have fallen among injectable-drug users by 10 percent since the mid-1990s, according to Don Des Jarlais, a psychiatry and preventive medicine professor at Mount Sinai Beth Israel who led the study.\n\n\"Heterosexual intercourse is usually not very efficient for transmitting HIV, but the efficiency of heterosexual transmission nearly triples in the presence of herpes simplex virus type 2,\" Des Jarlais said in a press release. \"In New York City, we have done an excellent job of reducing HIV among persons who inject drugs and we must now put more efforts into reducing sexual transmission associated with non-injecting drug use.\"\n\nBut the study doesn\u2019t necessary mean that HIV infection rates are rising in general, according to Des Jarlais, who also serves as deputy director of New York University\u2019s Research Methods and Infectious Diseases Cores at the Center for Drug Use and HIV Research. Rather, co-infections involving herpes (HSV) and 2/HIV are becoming increasingly more common. And while it\u2019s good that community organizers and public health officials discourage the sharing of dirty needles among injection-drug users, additional interventions should be targeted at other populations within the city, and elsewhere, to prevent the spread of HIV.\n\nPresently, New York City\u2019s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has initiated an effort to treat people infected with HIV as part of a broader effort to prevent transmission to others. Those residents are given anti-viral medications for free as a public health measure. However, the Obama administration has just upped the ante for best practices, recommending that people who are not infected but deemed highly at risk begin receiving antiviral medications, too.\n\n\"If we can implement these programs on a large scale, we should be able to control sexual transmission of HIV in the city, and achieve the goal of an \"End to the AIDS Epidemic,\" Des Jarlais said.\n\nSource: Des Jarlais Don C, Arasteh K, McKnight C, et al.
