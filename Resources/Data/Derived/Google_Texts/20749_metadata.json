From there, the little plastic cars bump, thump and collide as they descend. The riders try their best to stay on board, hands on the tiny steering wheel and legs hanging over the sides or folded in the little seats.\n\nAt stake were donated prizes and \u201credneck braggin\u2019 rights,\u201d organizer Lolli Bunce said.\n\nThe race is reserved for people over the age of 18, and helmets are required for good reason: One particularly gnarly wreck left a man with a broken collarbone. But participant Ron Anderson said he wasn\u2019t too concerned about the injury and is already gearing up for next year.\n\n\u201cI give it to the racers,\u201d Bunce said. \u201cIt\u2019s a risky event.\u201d\n\nThe event took place on private land in Mendon, about 80 miles north of Salt Lake City. It was a fundraiser for Rocky Mountain Rebels, a 4x4 club of off-road enthusiasts that has grown to include about 17 families since it was started in April.\n\nBunce, who is the club\u2019s president, said she wants to put on affordable, family-friendly events and support efforts to keep public lands accessible.\n\nShe got the idea for Barbie Jeep racing from videos of events put on by the motorsports production company Busted Knuckle Films. With its blessing, the Utah group planned its event and advertised with thousands of fliers, signs posted all over town and postings on social media.\n\nThey also secured the services of an announcer, a spare Jeep that was auctioned off to a prospective racer and prizes for top Barbie racers. A special prize went to the winner of \u201cThe Bash for the Last,\u201d a last-ditch all-in race. Fittingly, the Racer\u2019s Choice crown for most gnarly wreck went to Anderson and his broken collarbone.\n\nThe turnout was higher than expected, and Bunce said she\u2019s hoping to make the race an annual tradition.\n\n\u201cPeople have already been begging us to bring this event back next year,\u201d she said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Herald Journal, http://www.hjnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Plastic Barbie Jeeps aren't just for kids anymore.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Plastic Barbie Jeeps aren\u2019t just for kids anymore.", "title": "Extreme Barbie Jeep racing comes to northern Utah", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/6/extreme-barbie-jeep-racing-comes-to-northern-utah/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/06/91b215df17454628810f6a70670083c6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/06/91b215df17454628810f6a70670083c6.jpg", "description": "Plastic Barbie Jeeps aren't just for kids anymore.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Extreme Barbie Jeep racing comes to northern Utah"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15b6\"", "article_summary": "She got the idea for Barbie Jeep racing from videos of events put on by the motorsports production company Busted Knuckle Films.\nMENDON, Utah (AP) - Plastic Barbie Jeeps aren\u2019t just for kids anymore.\nA new northern Utah group recently held its first \u201cExtreme Barbie Jeep Racing\u201d event, with grown men and women squeezing on the tiny jeeps as they hurl down a steep hill, The Herald Journal newspaper in Logan reports (http://bit.ly/1IJIwdX ).\nThey also secured the services of an announcer, a spare Jeep that was auctioned off to a prospective racer and prizes for top Barbie racers.\n\u201cI give it to the racers,\u201d Bunce said."}
