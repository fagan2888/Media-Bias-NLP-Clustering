Democrats need to tap what scares their base most: fear of an unrestrained GOP.\n\nWe\u2019ve known for a long time now that the Democrats have a lot of Senate seats to defend in red states where Barack Obama\u2019s approval numbers aren\u2019t much higher than George Zimmerman\u2019s\u2014indeed, in these states, surely lower.\n\nBut I feel like the fear has just set in here in the last couple of weeks; that is, Democrats coming to terms with the possibility-to-likelihood that they might lose the Senate this November, and after that, the utter bleakness of a final Obama two years with both House and Senate in GOP hands, saying no to anything and everything except, of course, any remote whiff of an opportunity to bring impeachment charges over something.\n\nRepublicans need a net pickup of six seats. Democrats are trying to defend incumbent status in six red states (North Carolina, Louisiana, Arkansas, Montana, West Virginia, and Alaska); also in two blue ones (Michigan and Iowa). They\u2019re hoping for upsets in two red states (Georgia and Kentucky).\n\nYou\u2019ll read a lot about Obamacare and the minimum wage and the War on Women and everything else, and all those things will matter. But only one thing really, really, really matters: turnout. You know the lament: The most loyal Democratic groups\u2014young people, black people, single women, etc.\u2014don\u2019t come out to vote in midterms in big numbers. You may dismiss this as lazy stereotyping, but sometimes lazy stereotyping is true, and this is one of those times.\n\nSo how to get these groups energized? Because if core Democratic voting groups turn out to vote in decent numbers, the Democrats will hold the Senate. Two or three of the six will hold on, the Democrats will prevail in the end in Michigan and Iowa, and either Alison Lundergan Grimes in Kentucky or Michelle Nunn in Georgia will eke out a win. Or maybe both\u2014if Democratic voters vote. And if not? Republicans could net seven, eight.\n\nThe other side will be motivated: They\u2019re older, white, angry that Obama continues to have the temerity to stand up there and be president, as if somebody elected him. This will be their last chance to push the rage button (well, the Obama-rage button; soon they\u2019ll just start pushing the Hillary-rage button). But what will motivate the liberal side?\n\nI call this the vampire-slayer election. I\u2019ll explain that farther down. But first, let\u2019s hear from Matt Canter, deputy executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, making his team\u2019s most plausible case for why 2014 isn\u2019t destined to be a repeat of 2010.\n\nCanter acknowledges that the Democrats talk about \u201cfield\u201d in every off-year election. But now, he vows, \u201cThis is the year we\u2019re going to say it and mean it.\u201d In the 10 states I mention above, Canter says, the goal is to spend $60 million on field operations alone, with an aggregate 4,000 paid staff in those states. It\u2019s called the Bannock Street Project, after the street that housed the campaign HQ of Michael Bennet, the successful Democratic Senate candidate in that state in 2010. Bennet, you might recall, was one of the few Democrats not running against witches who held on to beat a Tea Party GOPer. The effort will be to quasi-nationalize what happened in Colorado then.\n\nLook also, Canter says, at what happened in Montana and North Dakota in 2012. In both of those states, Obama was getting walloped by Mitt Romney\u2014by 14 and 20 points, respectively. And yet, Democratic Senate candidates won in both states. Turnout was much higher in these two states: It was 53.4 percent nationally, but 59.4 in North Dakota and 61.5 in Montana. In both cases, Jon Tester and Heidi Heitkamp ran well ahead of Obama and are senators today.\n\nCanter says the operations in those 10 states will look like this. Every voter in those states\u2014yes, every single voter in those 10 states, he says\u2014will be given two scores on a scale of 1 to 100: a support score and a turnout score. So if Molly Jones in Paducah is a 58 likely to support the Democrat and 38 likely to turnout, she can expect a lot of contacts from field operatives this fall.\n\nBut\u2026 contact her saying what? This is where I was a little less impressed by the things Canter had to say. I think he makes a plausible logistical argument. The Colorado, Montana, and North Dakota examples are real things. So are 60 million simoleons and 4,000 operatives. But they still need a compelling, unifying message. This is where we get to Buffy.\n\nOne of the all-time great Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes was Season 3\u2019s \u201cThe Wish,\u201d when a female demon grants Cordelia, the classic senior-class Queen Bee-beeyatch, one wish. Cordelia wishes instantly that Buffy Summers\u2014who makes her life far more complicated than she wishes it to be\u2014had never come to Sunnydale. The wish is granted. The next thing you see is, indeed, what would have happened to Sunnydale if Buffy, the vampire slayer, had never hit town. The high-school population is reduced by more than half. There\u2019s a 6 p.m. curfew. Those who remain live in fear. The vamps have taken over. It\u2019s a death town.\n\nSee where I\u2019m going here? That\u2019s Washington if the Republicans get the Senate. Vamp town. Imagine if Ruth Bader Ginsberg retires. If the Republicans control the Senate, will they even give a mildly left-of-center Supreme Court nominee a hearing? What about less high-profile federal judgeships across the country? How many of those are going to go vacant? If a Cabinet official or high-ranking sub-Cabinet member resigns, will they even permit the position being re-filled? Remember\u201441 of the 45 current GOP senators voted against confirming Chuck Hagel as defense secretary. And he was a former senator. And a Republican one at that!\n\nPicture the mad Darrell Issa having a counterpart in the Senate to launch baseless investigations. It\u2019s one thing for the House to be banging on about phony IRS and Benghazi scandals, but the Senate doing it is another matter entirely\u2014far more serious. You really think a Republican Senate won\u2019t? And I haven\u2019t even gotten to regular policy. You think a GOP House and Senate combined won\u2019t try every trick in the book to pressure Obama to fold on Social Security and Medicare?", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "Republican Party, u.s. poli, Democratic Party, United States Senate", "publicationDate": 201402211045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Control of the Senate depends on turnout in November.
