About how recruitment takes place, how that training takes place. So the details of that are not yet worked out.\"\n\n\u2014 Said that the United States and other countries want to make sure world soccer is \"conducted in an upright manner.\"\n\nObama would not comment specifically on the American corruption indictment of FIFA executives, which helped force the resignation of Sepp Blatter, the most powerful man in soccer.\n\nBut he said that soccer is \"a massive business, it is a source of incredible national pride, and people want to make sure that it operates with integrity.\"\n\n\u2014 Pledged that the United States and European countries will keep up the pressure on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine.\n\nHe said that the Russian economy has been \"seriously weakened\" by economic sanctions. \"Russia's actions in Ukraine are hurting Russia and hurting the Russian people,\" he said.\n\n\u2014 Said that the United States is not ready to say publicly who may have launched a massive cyberattack on the federal government. Suspicion has fallen on China.\n\nObama said: \"This problem is not going to go away. It's going to accelerate. We have to be as nimble as aggressive and as well-resourced as those who are trying to break into these systems.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama spoke after meeting with leaders of the world's biggest industrial countries.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Obama spoke after meeting with leaders of the world's biggest industrial countries.", "title": "President Barack Obama Speaks on Obamacare Challenge, Iraq, Soccer", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/watch-live-president-barack-obama-speaks-g-7-summit-germany-n371541", "image": "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_24/1064406/150608-obama-g7-summit-germany-yh-0920a_a0d9fe5f5ad5b2900a8b1cbabe2ddca7.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Obama spoke after meeting with leaders of the world's biggest industrial countries.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2015_24/1064406/150608-obama-g7-summit-germany-yh-0920a_a0d9fe5f5ad5b2900a8b1cbabe2ddca7.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "President Barack Obama Speaks on Obamacare Challenge, Iraq, Soccer - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-08", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/watch-live-president-barack-obama-speaks-g-7-summit-germany-n371541", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "News,World,Barack Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5caa\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Said that the United States and other countries want to make sure world soccer is \"conducted in an upright manner.\"\n\u2014 Pledged that the United States and European countries will keep up the pressure on Russia for its aggression in Ukraine.\nThe court is expected to rule later this month on the challenge, which argues that people who buy insurance through the federal health care exchange, rather than state exchanges, should not receive subsidies.\nHe said the United States is \"reviewing a range of plans\" to help Iraq after ISIS militants last month captured the city of Ramadi in a humiliating defeat for the Iraqis.\n\u2014 Said that the United States is not ready to say publicly who may have launched a massive cyberattack on the federal government."}
