Mitch McConnell dismissed any potential conservative attempt to block funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no education in the second kick of the mule,\u201d McConnell said, referring to an attempt by Cruz and other conservatives to block the funding for ObamaCare. \u201cWe\u2019ve been down this path before.\u201d\n\nNow, Cruz is urging pastors to speak to their congregations about the recent undercover investigative videos that revealed top medical directors at Planned Parenthood discussing the harvesting of the body parts of aborted babies for potential sale on the open market.\n\n\u201cPreaching from the pulpit Biblical values on life and comparing those values, the teachings of Jesus, to this nationwide business of trafficking in the body parts of unborn children is a message that needs to be heard around this country,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt is important that [Congress] hear also that a show vote will not suffice. An empty vote with no teeth on it will not suffice. Now is the time for Congress to act and actually end taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nComing off a rally in Des Moines, Iowa last Friday with over 2,500 participants \u2013 called a \u201cRally for Religious Liberty,\u201d Cruz is reaching out for conservative Christians to join him in the \u201cwar on faith.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wonder why we have a federal government that comes after our free-speech rights, that comes after our religious liberty, that comes after life, that comes after marriage, that comes after our values,\u201d Cruz said at the rally, observing that 54 million evangelical Christians stayed home during the 2012 presidential election that re-elected Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you we will stay home no longer,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, in an op-ed last week in USA Today, Cruz wrote:\n\nI intend to lead the fight in the United States Senate to defund Planned Parenthood, even while investigations continue. The time for show votes is over. Funding the federal government does not require funding Planned Parenthood. But basic decency and our commitment to the right to life does require that we stop taxpayer funding of abortions and any trade in baby parts.\n\nOn Tuesday during a Newsmax TV interview on The Hard Line, Cruz repeated his pledge to immediately defund Planned Parenthood if he were elected president next year.\n\n\u201cI will instruct the United States Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and to prosecute any and all criminal violations by that organization,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz urged all Americans to watch the Planned Parenthood videos produced by the Center for Medical Progress.\n\n\u201cIn this latest video, they describe a little boy who after an abortion his heart was still beating and yet the technicians took scissors and cut the child\u2019s face open to remove his brain, to sell it for profit,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThat is inhuman.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\nIt is a federal crime. It is a felony to sell the body parts of unborn children. What a sad statement about our government today that nobody in the media, nobody in the political world, thinks there\u2019s any chance whatsoever \u2014 zero chance \u2014 that the Obama Justice Department would even investigate Planned Parenthood because they\u2019re a political ally of the president. It doesn\u2019t matter that they\u2019re caught on tape admitting to multiple felonies. The administration of justice should be blind to party and ideology and should follow the laws and the Constitution.\n\nForAmerica president David Bozell tells Breitbart News that Cruz\u2019s outreach to evangelicals and focus on Planned Parenthood is a \u201csmart play.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt enables him to gain some traction and chip away at the Mike Huckabee vote, the Rick Santorum vote, and some of your other cultural conservative candidates in the race who are speaking largely about the same things and promising the same things,\u201d Bozell said during a phone interview. \u201cThe advantage for Ted Cruz is that in just a couple of weeks, this is going to be front and center news, they\u2019ll consider funding Planned Parenthood in the 2016 fiscal budget.\u201d\n\n\u201cCruz is basically planting the seed, saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to be at the ready, and not just Day One of a Ted Cruz administration, but in just a couple of weeks,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cGuys like Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, the rest of the establishment, they were counting on Ted Cruz being quiet during the budget process in a couple of weeks,\u201d Bozell continued. \u201cBut they were counting on the wrong senator being quiet.\u201d\n\nBozell explained Cruz\u2019s aggressive strategy will be an opportunity for him to improve his standing in the polls.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for him to distinguish himself from some of the other cultural conservative candidates, and being a sitting senator, he has that opportunity,\u201d he said, adding that the issue of the Planned Parenthood videos cannot be ignored.\n\n\u201cThese folks are caught on video tape seven times now, embarking on a criminal enterprise that involves cutting off the heads of children and cutting their faces off to get to their brains to sell them for money,\u201d Bozell emphasized. \u201cIf the Republican Party can\u2019t stand up against that, can\u2019t protect the American taxpayer against funding that, they are of no use to us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz told pastors when it comes to the funding Planned Parenthood, Democrats and Republicans seek an \u201cempty show vote\u201d with \u201cno teeth.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Cruz told pastors when it comes to the funding Planned Parenthood, Democrats and Republicans seek an \u201cempty show vote\u201d with \u201cno teeth.\"", "title": "Ted Cruz Vows To Defund Planned Parenthood, Prosecute Criminal Violations - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Cruz-Plannned-Parenthood-protest.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/26/ted-cruz-vows-to-defund-planned-parenthood-prosecute-criminal-violations/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cruz told pastors when it comes to the funding Planned Parenthood, Democrats and Republicans seek an \u201cempty show vote\u201d with \u201cno teeth.\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Cruz-Plannned-Parenthood-protest.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz Vows To Defund Planned Parenthood, Prosecute Criminal Violations - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Center for Medical Progress, criminal investigation of Planned Parenthood, David Bozell, defund Planned Parenthood, Establishment Republicans, evangelical vote, Evangelicals, ForAmerica, Human Organ Trafficking, Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood videos, Religious freedom, sale of aborted baby parts, Sen.
