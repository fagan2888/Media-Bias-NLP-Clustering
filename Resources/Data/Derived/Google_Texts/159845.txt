Six climbers apparently fell to their deaths on the north side of Mount Rainier in Washington state, in the second-worst climbing tragedy on the mountain.

It happened On Liberty Ridge, described as one of the most technical and advanced routes up the mountain. Family members met privately yesterday with park officials even as other climbers prepared to summit the mountain.

From the Here & Now Contributors Network, Austin Jenkins reports.
