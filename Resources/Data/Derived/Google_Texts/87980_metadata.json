If the groups of doctors, known as Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), end up keeping costs below the target, they get to keep some of the leftover money, providing an incentive to keep costs down.\n\nThe Obama administration is touting the pilot program, claiming it's paid off and generated savings.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act gave us powerful new tools to test better ways to improve patient care and keep communities healthier,\u201d HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said in a statement. \u201cThe Pioneer ACO Model has demonstrated that patients can get high quality and coordinated care at the right time, and we can generate savings for Medicare and the health care system at large.\u201d\n\nThe independent Office of the Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has now certified that the program can be expanded. It currently applies to about 600,000 Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nThe program was not without its bumps. Thirteen of the 32 participating hospital systems dropped out along the way after failing to meet their targets.\n\nOfficials said Monday that two of the ACOs had to pay significant amounts back to Medicare. That is because the incentives in the program work both ways, meaning if costs come in too high, they have to pay penalties.\n\nEarlier this year, the Obama administration announced the goal of tying 30 percent of Medicare payments to programs like ACOs by 2016, and 50 percent by 2018.\n\nOfficials painted Monday\u2019s announcement as a step toward that goal.\n\n\u201cThis gives CMS greater confidence in scaling elements of the model to benefit people across the nation,\u201d Patrick Conway, a senior CMS official, said in a statement. \u201cAnd we are working to determine the best strategies for embedding the lessons we have already learned from the Pioneer Model into permanent Medicare programs and our nation\u2019s health system.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Officials touted a pilot program to change Medicare's payment system.", "description": "Officials touted a pilot program to change Medicare's payment system.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Officials touted a pilot program to change Medicare's payment system.", "title": "ObamaCare program saves Medicare $400M", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/240971-obamacare-trial-program-saving-money-report-finds", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/medicare_071012getty_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/240971-obamacare-trial-program-saving-money-report-finds", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-04T14:55-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Medicare,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-04T14:55:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/240971-obamacare-trial-program-saving-money-report-finds", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Officials touted a pilot program to change Medicare's payment system.", "card": "summary", "title": "ObamaCare program saves Medicare $400M"}, "dcterms.title": "ObamaCare program saves Medicare $400M"}, "article_summary": "A pilot program created under ObamaCare to change Medicare\u2019s payment system saved almost $400 million and will be expanded, the administration announced Monday.\nThe pilot program, called Pioneer Accountable Care Organizations, is part of an effort to shift Medicare to paying for quality instead of quantity of care.\nThe Obama administration is touting the pilot program, claiming it's paid off and generated savings.\nUnder the program, groups of doctors agree to accept lump payments under Medicare instead of individual payments for each service they provide, as in the traditional Medicare payment system.\nADVERTISEMENTAn independent report released by the Department of Health and Human Services on Monday finds that the pilot program saved Medicare more than $384 million across 2012 and 2013."}
