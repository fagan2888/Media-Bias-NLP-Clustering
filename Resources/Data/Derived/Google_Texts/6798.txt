U.S. Soccer stayed in-house Friday hiring Jillian Ellis as the head coach of the women’s national team.

Ellis, a Brit who had been serving as the interim coach after the firing of Tom Sermanni last month, coached youth national teams for the federation and has been serving as the director of player development.

In taking over the U.S. women just 13 months before next year’s World Cup in Canada, Ellis becomes the central character in a crucible where the only measure of success is whether her team captures the championship that has eluded them since 1999. Qualifying matches for the tournament begin this fall.

“I love the fact that qualifiers are right around the corner because it does bring laser focus,” Ellis said during a conference call Friday. “I know the expectation, I embrace the expectation, I know we want to win.”

Sunil Gulati, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, said Ellis’ familiarity with the program made her the right choice.

“She gets top marks in all the work she has been doing on the technical side,” Gulati said.

Ellis now must hone the style of play for the top-ranked U.S. women, who have tried to become a more refined, possession-oriented team but usually end up relying on their athleticism and physical advantages to overwhelm the competition with fast-paced attacks.

That strategy has been more challenging of late, as the quality of the women’s game has improved substantially in places like Japan and France. The team had a disappointing 7th place performance at the Algarve Cup earlier this year.

Ellis suggested that coaching this team was about building a balance–recognizing the importance of holding the ball and building an offense from the back to the front. But, she added. “I recognize we do have unique players,” she said. “The counter is going to be a part of our weaponry.”
