Meanwhile, hundreds of academically comparable but needier students were put on the waitlist for admission because they lacked the financial resources.\n\nRELATED: ONE MAN'S UNCOMMON FIX FOR OUTRAGEOUS STUDENT DEBT\n\nMany colleges and universities like to tout \u201cneed-blind\u201d admissions processes, or the practice of judging their applicants\u2019 academic qualifications strictly on their merits and making decisions without factoring in applicants\u2019 wealth. In recent years, some colleges that have traditionally been need-blind have weighed whether to become more need-aware.\n\nUntil a few days ago, the undergraduate admissions page for George Washington University stated, \u201cRequests for financial aid do not affect admissions decisions.\u201d That language was removed over the weekend. (Here\u2019s the archived version.)\n\nThe updated page now explains that the admissions committee \u201cevaluates\u201d candidates initially without factoring in their financial need, but then considers applicants\u2019 financial resources \u201cat the point of finalizing admissions decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe using the phrase \u2018need aware\u2019 better represents the totality of our practices than using the phrase \u2018need blind,\u2019\u201d Laurie Koehler, senior associate provost for enrollment management, said in a statement to ProPublica.\n\nRELATED: WHY STUDENTS ARE REJECTING THE TOP COLLEGES\n\n\u201cWhat we are trying to do is increase the transparency of the admissions process,\u201d said Koehler.\n\nTop GW administrators have repeatedly stated over the years that the university is need-blind. When the student newspaper in 2011 did a story about how some colleges are moving away from need-blind admissions, one administrator told the paper, \u201cWe\u2019re still need-blind.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the \u201cneed-blind\u201d label can be as much about marketing as it is about giving all applicants a fair shot.\n\nMany schools are \u201cneed-blind\u201d but don\u2019t actually give out much need-based aid. We recently detailed how universities, looking to boost their bottom lines, are increasingly using financial-aid dollars to attract wealthier students.\n\n\u201cIt sounds better to people to say, \u2018We're need-blind.\u2019 People think that's a badge of courage,\u201d said Matt Malatesta, vice president for admissions, financial aid, and enrollment at Union College, a small liberal arts college in New York that practices need-aware admissions.\n\nRELATED: WHY COLLEGES GIVE MORE AID TO THE WEALTHY\n\nUnless schools pony up the aid dollars to meet students\u2019 financial needs, touting the need-blind label isn\u2019t particularly meaningful for students, who may simply get the offer of admission along with an offer to take on unsustainable debt.\n\n\u201cThere are pluses and minuses on both sides of the debate,\u201d Malatesta said in an earlier interview. \u201cI\u2019m not a believer that one is better than another.\u201d\n\nBut in contrast to GW, many of the schools that have weighed the pluses and minuses of need-blind versus need-aware have done so quite publicly. Grinnell College, for instance, announced earlier this year that after considering whether to become need-aware, it would remain need-blind for the time being, but would still look to wealthier students in the recruitment process and use merit aid to help attract them.\n\nWesleyan University last year took the other route, announcing it would give up the \u201cneed-blind\u201d label and start to consider students\u2019 financial need once its aid dollars were given out.\n\nBoth institutions are part of a handful of colleges across the country that promise to meet the full needs of all admitted students. George Washington University has not offered any such guarantee.\n\nEarlier this year, George Washington University was featured in the Washington Post as trying to buck its \u201crich-kid reputation.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to deny we have a lot of students that come from wealthy families,\u201d GW President Steven Knapp told the Post in April. \u201cBut we are increasingly trying to diversify, and I think we have been diversifying compared to where we were 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nAbout 13 percent of undergraduates at George Washington University receive the federal Pell grant for low-income students. That\u2019s low, according to a recent report by the New America Foundation that also noted that the university charges its few low-income students, on average, a high net price even after grants and scholarships.\n\nTuition alone is more than $47,000 a year, and room and board costs another $11,000. The majority of students at the university pay less than the full sticker price, due to the university\u2019s strategy of offering grants as discounts.\n\nBut even after grants are applied, low-income students at GW still pay a heavy price. Federal data for the 2011-2012 school year show that students at the university coming from families making $30,000 or less paid, on average, $21,000 to attend the university.\n\nThis article originally appeared in ProPublica.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "George Washington University, which got in trouble", "title": "When 'Need Blind' Universities Really Aren't", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/10/23/When-Need-Blind-Universities-Really-Arent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06152012_Campus_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/10/23/When-Need-Blind-Universities-Really-Arent", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06152012_Campus_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "George Washington University, which got in trouble", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc33f\"", "article_summary": "George Washington University, which got in trouble last year for misreporting admissions data to bolster its college ranking, is making yet another confession.\nGeorge Washington University has not offered any such guarantee.\nUntil a few days ago, the undergraduate admissions page for George Washington University stated, \u201cRequests for financial aid do not affect admissions decisions.\u201d That language was removed over the weekend.\nWe recently detailed how universities, looking to boost their bottom lines, are increasingly using financial-aid dollars to attract wealthier students.\nWesleyan University last year took the other route, announcing it would give up the \u201cneed-blind\u201d label and start to consider students\u2019 financial need once its aid dollars were given out."}
