Curling up with a good book by the fireplace on a chilly night? Retirement planning?\n\nWait \u2026 what?\n\nIf you\u2019re like most people, that last option probably doesn\u2019t rank high on your list of happy activities\u2014and that\u2019s partly why a lot of people have trouble reaching their retirement savings goals.\n\n\u201cSaving money in itself can be a drag,\u201d admits John Beshears, an assistant professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. \u201cMy research, as well as that of others, suggests that humans have an innate taste for instant gratification\u2014and it\u2019s difficult to make short-term sacrifices in the pursuit of a long-term gain.\u201d\n\nRelated: 3 Ways to Close the Retirement Gap\n\nSo when we\u2019re faced with a tempting form of instant gratification\u2014say, binge-watching a new show on Netflix\u2014more often than not, we\u2019ll opt for that over \u201cgoing to the trouble of spending a Saturday afternoon enrolling in an employer\u2019s 401(k) plan or setting up an IRA,\u201d Beshears says.\n\nBut what if we told you there were some strategies that could help make retirement planning\u2014and reaching your goals\u2014feel a bit more bliss-inducing?\n\nThe truth of the matter is that if you approach the planning process from a happy place now, you can help set yourself up for a happy retirement later.\n\nAnd there\u2019s research to back that up: According to a statistic in Northwestern Mutual\u2019s guide, \u201cRetirement Saving: 5 Key Insights You Need to Know,\u201d a whopping 91% of highly disciplined planners say they are happy in retirement.\n\nWant to be part of that 91%? Check out these five optimistically minded approaches to heart-happy (and disciplined) retirement planning.\n\nStep #1: Indulge in a Goal-Based Guilty Pleasure\n\nTurns out Mary Poppins was right: A spoonful of sugar can help the medicine go down\u2014and that includes the act of saving for retirement.\n\nLet\u2019s face it: Saving for the future can be a tough pill to swallow because you often have to make sacrifices in order to reach your goal.\n\nRelated: 7 Common Myths that Can Ruin Your Retirement\n\nOne way to outsmart that not-so-happy feeling of deprivation? Try spoiling yourself.\n\nResearch from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business found that linking your savings progress to enjoyable treats\u2014a concept dubbed \u201ctemptation bundling\u201d\u2014can help boost motivation and push you to reach your goals.\n\nOf course, we\u2019re not talking about a big-ticket splurge. Rather, it should be a small indulgence that can provide a significant happiness boost\u2014like indulging in an ice cream sundae when you up that nest egg savings contribution by 1%!\n\n\u201cThink of something fun and only give yourself permission to enjoy it when you take a virtuous step toward your financial retirement intention,\u201d suggests Beshears.\n\nBottom line: If you tie happy splurges to retirement-planning milestones, each time you achieve one of your goals, it can help motivate you to keep hitting them.\n\nRELATED: Splurge Smart!

She currently has $80,000 in retirement savings and contributes 5% of her salary toward her nest egg each year.\n\nIf she maintains that 5% savings rate, assuming a 7% annual return on her investment, she\u2019ll have accumulated over $850,000 by that 25-year mark.\n\nHowever, if she were to increase her savings percentage by 1% each year until she reached a 15% savings rate, she could accumulate at least $650,000 more\u2014for a total of $1,502,281 in 25 years.\n\nSo think about running your own compound growth digits\u2014an exercise that could help get you happily psyched about finding even small ways to funnel more money into your nest egg.\n\nRelated: Baby Boomers Face a Shocking Retirement Savings Shortfall\n\nStep #3: Dabble in Some Wishful Thinking\n\nPositive thinking is often touted as a key to wish fulfillment: Simply envision yourself achieving your dream\u2014and abracadabra\u2014it will manifest!\n\nThe only problem? It doesn\u2019t really work.\n\nResearch by Gabriele Oettingen, a psychology professor at New York University and author of \u201cRethinking Positive Thinking: Inside the New Science of Motivation,\u201d found that people who fantasized about success\u2014from losing weight to getting a good grade on a test\u2014actually fared worse in the results department than those who didn\u2019t.\n\nYes, imagining a good outcome can lower your blood pressure and put you in a good mood, but as a result of feeling so satisfied, you\u2019re less likely to take the action necessary to achieve your goal.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to goal attainment, sheer positive thinking is counterproductive,\u201d Oettingen explains. \u201cYou also need to explore the inner obstacles that stand in the way of your dream.\u201d\n\nIn other words, in order to succeed, optimistic thinking should be paired with practical methods to overcome the challenges you\u2019ll inevitably encounter.\n\nBased on these findings, Oettingen developed a four-step method she calls WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan) to help you bring your dreams to happy fruition.\n\nWhen it comes to retirement planning, step one is to formulate a specific wish you\u2019re truly passionate about, such as being able to afford traveling the world.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve nailed down your wish, step two is to visualize the best possible outcome. \u201cAsk yourself: What would my life look like? What would it mean to me? How would I feel?\u201d Oettingen says. \u201cThen identify the outcome in a short sentence.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s time to tackle the obstacle step. \u201cIdentify what it is inside of you that\u2019s holding you back [from reaching your goal],\u201d Oettingen says. \u201cOnly then will you be able to find the behavior that will allow you to overcome it.\u201d\n\nFor example, perhaps your obstacle is that you\u2019d rather buy a new car now than save for retirement because you like how it makes you feel successful in the present.\n\nAfter you\u2019ve pinpointed your obstacle, the last step is to create an \u201cif-then\u201d plan by asking yourself what you can do to circumvent this challenge.\n\nYour plan could be something along the lines of \u201cif I attend my friend\u2019s birthday dinner, I\u2019ll derail my budget, so I\u2019ll meet everyone for a drink after instead.\u201d\n\nAccording to Oettingen, envisioning an if-then plan helps build cognitive links between your retirement ideals, the hurdles you\u2019ll encounter and the action needed to overcome those hurdles.\n\n\u201cAs a result, you\u2019ll do the right thing without having to think about it,\u201d she explains, \u201cbecause your brain is wired to make the choice that\u2019s in line with your goals.\u201d\n\nRELATED: 5 Ways to Retrain Your Brain to Save More for Retirement\n\nStep #4: Take a Fresh Start Approach to Your Planning\n\nWhat do New Year\u2019s Day, your birthday and the first of the month all have in common?\n\nThey\u2019re apparently ideal times to embark on a new course of retirement planning action, thanks to what researchers have dubbed \u201cthe fresh start effect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is evidence that people experience a peak in motivation to engage in long-term changes during so-called fresh start moments like these,\u201d Beshears explains. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re entering a new era when you can shed your past self and create a better version.\u201d\n\nAccording to Beshears, you\u2019re more effective at setting and achieving goals when you do so at a temporal landmark, because it allows you to shed failures, break out of habitual thinking and see the big picture\u2014all key ingredients for beginning anew.\n\nSo consider galvanizing your retirement plans during a fresh start moment\u2014like using the first of the month as the day you\u2019ll finally increase your 401(k) contribution.\n\nStep #5: Envision 80-Year-Old You\n\nWhen you\u2019re climbing the career ladder or chasing after your toddler, it can be hard to picture yourself playing bingo decades from now.\n\nAccording to a stat in Northwestern Mutual\u2019s retirement saving guide, more than two-thirds of Americans say today\u2019s fast-paced life makes it hard to stick to long-term goals like saving for retirement.\n\nBut finding the time to envision your AARP years could help you stash more cash for that down-the-road you.\n\n\u201cLooking ahead in time and feeling a sense of connection to one\u2019s future self can impact long-term financial decision-making, turning a spender into a saver,\u201d Hal Hershfield, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of California, Los Angeles, has said.\n\nIn a study conducted by Hershfield, half of the participants were shown digital avatars of their current selves, while the other half looked at avatars resembling a senior-citizen version of themselves.\n\nAfterward, they were asked to divide $1,000 into four vessels: a present for someone they cared about, a fun event, a retirement fund, and a checking account.\n\nThose who had viewed older versions of themselves allocated nearly twice as much money toward retirement.\n\n\u201cSeeing that image made people feel a greater connection to their future self, which made retirement savings more meaningful and led to an increase in savings,\u201d Beshears says.\n\nTo try this exercise for yourself, visualize your retirement as vividly as you can. Where will you live? How will you spend your days? What might you look like?\n\nClose your eyes and bring in as many sensations as possible: the smell of the sea breeze at your beach cottage, the sound of your grandchildren laughing, the feel of grass beneath your feet as you vacation in the European countryside.\n\nOnce you conjure what your golden years could really look like, you can take it a step further by creating a vision board to display in a prominent place to help keep you motivated to save.\n\nBy having a concrete vision of the future you that you\u2019re saving for\u2014as opposed to an abstract destiny\u2014you can help set yourself up to retire with a bang. And that\u2019s something to get pretty happy about.\n\nRELATED: 3 Retirement Experts Dish: My Dream Retirement\u2014and My Plan for Getting There\n\nThis piece originally appeared in LearnVest.
