With more and more baby boomers over 65 retiring and taking full advantage of health care and retirement benefits, public spending earmarked for seniors will continue to rise exponentially \u2013 with serious long term consequences for the budget.\n\nRelated: Federal Health Care Costs Surge to 17 Percent of GDP\n\nGary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institute, wrote this week, \u201cA crucial question for future policymaking is whether rising outlays on programs for the aged will squeeze out spending on programs for children, especially investments in their schooling. Many pessimists think this outcome is inevitable, and they urge us to reduce government commitments to the elderly to make room for spending on the young.\u201d\n\nAmong those \u201cpessimists\u201d are Julia Isaacs, C. Eugene Steuerle and other economists and senior fellows at the Urban Institute who recently published the latest annual estimates of federal outlays on children and adults over 65 in a document entitled, \u201cKids\u2019 Share 2015.\u201d Not surprisingly, the document shows a huge disparity between federal funding for older Americans \u2013 many of whom regularly vote and are represented by powerful advocacy groups \u2013 and children.\n\nFor example, in 2011, federal spending for elderly Americans amounted to almost $28,000 per person over 65. In the same year, per capita spending on Americans under 19 amounted to just $4,900 per person, according to the study. What this means is that older Americans received $5.72 in federal spending for every $1 received by a child 18 or younger.\n\n\u201cFederal spending on children has remained fairly flat, in real dollars, over the past three years,\u201d the Urban Institute report declares. \u201cBetween 2012 and 2014, spending fell for children\u2019s education, nutrition, social services, and early education and care, and increased for children\u2019s health. In the future, overall federal spending is projected to increase substantially, but virtually none of the additional funds will be directed toward children.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why the U.S. Is Being Gouged on Drug Prices Compared to Other Countries\n\nAs their argument goes, the \u201cshare of the economic pie\u201d devoted to children is scheduled to decline.\u201d Practically all of the projected growth in federal spending will go for one of three things: retirement and health spending on adults and interest on the national debt. \u201cAs federal spending continues to outpace revenues, interest payments continue to rise; payments on the debt will soon outstrip federal spending on children, underlining the extent to which the federal budget has been made dependent on past policy decisions rather than on current assessments of how best to invest in the future,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nThe argument reflects the conventional wisdom of many lawmakers and policy experts \u2013 not to mention the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office -- that the nation is locked into a time-honored network of retirement and health care programs for the aged that will become ever more costly in years to come. In the process, those programs will crowd out new spending for other priorities vital to younger Americans, including education, research and job development. While the major federal programs for the aged seemingly run on automatic pilot, with spending tied to change in the cost of living, spending on many federal programs that assist children are financed out of discretionary programs requiring periodic reauthorization.\n\nFederal expenditures on children in 2014 totaled $463 billion, which is practically the same as it was in 2013, according to the Urban Institute report. \u201cThis includes $354 billion in outlays or 10 percent of the $3.5 trillion spent by the federal government in 2014, and nearly $110 billion in tax breaks for families with children,\u201d the study stated. \u201cThe 10 percent spent on children compares with 44 percent spent on adults.\u201d\n\nRelated: Medicare Sees Striking Increase in Specialty Drug Costs\n\nBut Burtless, a former Department of Labor economist, takes a contrarian view. In his essay first published by Real Clear Markets, Burtless argues that while federal spending indeed is heavily concentrated on the elderly, state and local government spending \u201ctilts toward programs that help children, notably, through public school budgets.\u201d\n\nBurtless argues that while seniors receive $5.72 in federal spending for each $1 received by someone under 19 years of age, those young Americans receive $10.11 in state and local spending for each $1 someone who is 65 or older receives.\n\n\u201cTo be sure, total federal spending is considerably greater than that of state and local governments, but the imbalance of public spending on the young and the old is less extreme than federal budget statistics suggest,\u201d he wrote. Moreover, government spending on children's health has also increased over time as public insurance for children has been expanded. \u201cIn 2014 just 6 percent of Americans under age 19 lacked health insurance for the entire year. The only age group with higher health insurance coverage was the population past 65, which is covered by Medicare,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Burtless expressed pique with progressives and others who make the case that government-spending policy is heavily stacked against younger Americans. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that they\u2019re looking at the evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they know something about the evidence they don\u2019t want to mention the evidence because what they would prefer to do is make people worried that this is an inevitable clash.\u201d\n\nRelated: New CBO Director Renews Warning on Long-Term Debt\n\n\u201cI think their hearts are in the right place,\u201d he added. \u201cI too am disgusted whenever I hear governors and state legislators and conservative members of the Congress say we don\u2019t have enough money to fund our public schools or we don\u2019t have enough money to pay the teachers or the pensions for the janitors. I think that they are wrong, but I also think the way public decision makers have operated over the past 60 years has been consistent with the view that actually they do summon up money to pay for obligations for the children under 18. Whether they do to the same degree for people between 19 and 25 or 26 is another question.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new Obama administration report out this week showing that federal government spendi", "title": "Rising Federal Health Care Costs Could Widen the Generation Gap", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/04/Rising-Federal-Health-Care-Costs-Could-Widen-Generation-Gap", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01092012_Health_Costs_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/04/Rising-Federal-Health-Care-Costs-Could-Widen-Generation-Gap", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01092012_Health_Costs_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new Obama administration report out this week showing that federal government spendi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c9f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFederal spending on children has remained fairly flat, in real dollars, over the past three years,\u201d the Urban Institute report declares.\nFor example, in 2011, federal spending for elderly Americans amounted to almost $28,000 per person over 65.\nWhat this means is that older Americans received $5.72 in federal spending for every $1 received by a child 18 or younger.\n\u201cTo be sure, total federal spending is considerably greater than that of state and local governments, but the imbalance of public spending on the young and the old is less extreme than federal budget statistics suggest,\u201d he wrote.\nWhile a considerable chunk of the $844 billion of federal health care spending last year went for children and younger adults, Medicare spending for seniors hit a total of $618.7 billion in 2014 and accounted for 20 percent of total health expenditures."}
