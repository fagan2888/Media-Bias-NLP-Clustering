Also seeing increases are patient-provider communication and business-to-business administrative tools. In contrast, the smallest number of products are in search, privacy & identity, and clinical trials & recruitment healthcare technologies.\n\nMost interesting, notes Holt, is the \u201cUber\u201d-fication of healthcare companies creating apps and online services that allow users to call healthcare providers on demand. Eleven companies call themselves the \u201cUber of Health Care\u201d: Plushcare, OnCall, Uberdok, Zeel, StudioDental, Uberhealth, ViaHealth, Uber Dx, Curbside Care, Pager and Medicast. These services promise to treat conditions, such as urinary tract infections, sore throat, and sexually-transmitted diseases over the Internet.\n\nA panel of venture capitalists at Health 2.0 noted a shift towards consumer health technologies due to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cconsumerization of healthcare\u201d, according to 7wire Ventures\u2019s Glen Tullman.\n\n\u201cWhen consumers spend their money, they do it by looking for value, competition, and the like. Things have changed. Consumers are going to be in charge. Technology is going to make a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe macro trend is that the healthcare system is unsustainable the way it is right now.\u201d said former cardiologist Milena Adamian, now at Azimuth Partners. \u201cThere are ways to improve access and delivery, and that\u2019s where money is flowing right now.\u201d\n\nCardiologist Eric Topol also noted this trend in his Health 2.0 keynote, labeling on-demand medical care as \u201cIWWIWWIWI\u201d, or \u201cI Want What I Want When I Want It.\u201d These preceded Google\u2019s recent October 2014 telemedicine search tests. When particular users searched for healthcare terms, they were presented with not only search results, but also a direct link to its Google Helpouts videoconferencing payment service to telemedicine providers.\n\nTopol further declared that more of healthcare will shift towards portable smartphone and wearable devices. For instance, companies like Theranos, Colorimetrix, Qloudlab for testosterone labs, and Holomic for radioimmunoassay labs are driving this trend to increase the availability of common tests, such as liver function tests and thyroid function tests.\n\n\u201cVirtually any test will be available on a smartphone,\u201d said Topol at his Health 2.0 speech.\n\nTopol also stated that more and more mobile technologies will replace traditional medical equipment. Oregon State Health University, for instance, recently published results in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Cardiovascular Imaging that a portable ultrasound device was much more sensitive than a physical exam. And, companies such as OScan, Stanford University\u2019s Eye-Phone slit lamp device, and Cellscope are extending this trend further in visual smartphone diagnostics.\n\n\u201cA consumer could do their own physical exam and send it over the cloud!\u201d said Topol, citing companies such as Tyto and MedWand that could replicate traditional physical exams. Both companies\u2019 portable handheld devices, for instance, can enable doctors to remotely measure heart rate, listen to heart and lungs, look into eyes and ears, and take a user\u2019s temperature.\n\nIn Topol\u2019s eyes, the future of medicine is a \u201cDigitized, Democratized, Data Science\u201d. More and more patients will be able to read their notes and contribute towards their own medical records. Topol predicts more of healthcare will shift towards a \u201cdoctorless\u201d treatment model in which users can manage more of their own conditions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Physicians, venture capitalists, and healthcare business leaders at Health 2.0 noted the increasing empowerment of patients in medicine.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "iMedicalApps", "description": "Physicians, venture capitalists, and healthcare business leaders at Health 2.0 noted the increasing empowerment of patients in medicine.", "title": "Why money flows into mobile, wearable health tech", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://assets.imedicalapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/66921-image00.jpg", "height": 561}, "updated_time": "2014-11-06T15:09:02+00:00", "url": "http://www.imedicalapps.com/2014/11/money-flows-mobile-wearable-health-technology/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Physicians, venture capitalists, and healthcare business leaders at Health 2.0 noted the increasing empowerment of patients in medicine.", "title": "Why money flows into mobile, wearable health tech", "image": "http://assets.imedicalapps.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/66921-image00.jpg", "creator": "@StevenChanMD", "site": "@imedicalapps", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "keywords": "iphone health, ipad health, android health, mobile health, mHealth, digital health, iphone medical app, iphone medical apps, medical apps for iphone, ipad medical apps, ipad medical app, medical apps for ipad, android medical apps, android medical app, medical apps for android, android medical, ipad medical, iphone medical, iphone health, ipad health, android health, telehealth, telemedicine, Health 2.0, Silicon Valley, venture capital, entrepreneurs, entrepreneurship, health informatics, patient empowerment, primary care, PPACA, Obamacare, ACA, Affordable Care Act, lab tests, blood tests, physical exam, wearables, wearable devices, funding, healthcare administration, business of medicine", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/iMedicalApps/", "section": "Commentary", "tag": "wearable devices", "published_time": "2014-11-07T07:55:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-06T15:09:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf357\"", "article_summary": "In contrast, the smallest number of products are in search, privacy & identity, and clinical trials & recruitment healthcare technologies.\nEleven companies call themselves the \u201cUber of Health Care\u201d: Plushcare, OnCall, Uberdok, Zeel, StudioDental, Uberhealth, ViaHealth, Uber Dx, Curbside Care, Pager and Medicast.\n\u201cVirtually any test will be available on a smartphone,\u201d said Topol at his Health 2.0 speech.\nA panel of venture capitalists at Health 2.0 noted a shift towards consumer health technologies due to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cconsumerization of healthcare\u201d, according to 7wire Ventures\u2019s Glen Tullman.\nThe biggest increase in funding, in terms of absolute numbers, has flowed to wearable technologies and technologies that encourage users to manage their own health conditions."}
