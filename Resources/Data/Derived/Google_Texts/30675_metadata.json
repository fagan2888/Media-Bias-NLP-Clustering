The location of the story\u2019s split has been a hot topic of conversation for Hunger Games fans for months. Unfortunately, Lawrence remained tight lipped about the exact location of the split, instead opting to tease fans by saying it will be \u201cone of the really good surprises\u201d of the films.\n\nLawrence stated that there wouldn\u2019t be any major changes to the book\u2019s story, \u201cInstead of changing the plot and changing characters what we did was have the opportunity to show scenes that could have been happening at different times in the book.\u201d The Hunger Games books are told solely from the perspective of protagonist Katniss Everdeen, somewhat limiting the scope in which readers can experience the story.\n\n\u201cFor us it\u2019s world expansion instead of changing things. I think it\u2019s exciting for the fan[s] to see certain things. So we\u2019ve been able to open the world up in this and see some new places. We get to see some new districts this time and the scope gets quite large.\u201d\n\nMany stories have a love triangle, and The Hunger Games is no different. Francis Lawrence acknowledged that there were some challenges with the love triangle story for Mockingjay. \u201cWith Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1 it\u2019s tricky because Peeta is out of reach for her. Obviously he becomes an objective for her, but Gale is right there, so that\u2019s always a tricky situation.\u201d\n\nShowing that he understands the importance of the message of the books, Lawrence assured fans that he\u2019s very motivated to bring that across accurately in Mockingjay. \u201cThis is where the meaning of the entire [Hunger Games] series comes into play. The answer to why these books exist exists in Mockingjay, and that\u2019s really been exciting to me. That\u2019s been kind of what I\u2019ve hung on to through these stories.\u201d\n\nLawrence also talked about how actress Julianne Moore approached the studio about the role because of her kids\u2019 interest in The Hunger Games. Moore will play District 13\u2019s President Alma Coin on both Mockingjay films. \u201cShe didn\u2019t audition. Once we knew she wanted it, that was it\u2014done,\u201d Lawrence says, laughing. \u201cI sat down with her, she had great ideas, we got along and that was it.\u201d\n\nMarketing for the first film has begun to ramp up, with the first still of Katniss released last week and the teaser trailer released at San Diego Comic Con last month.\n\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 hits theaters November 21, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a recent interview by Entertainment Weekly, the Mockingjay director Francis Lawrence talked about splitting the books and new surprises for book fans.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "In a recent interview by Entertainment Weekly, the Mockingjay director Francis Lawrence talked about splitting the books and new surprises for book fans.", "title": "\u2018The Hunger Games: Mockingjay\u2019 Director Francis Lawrence Promises Two Distinct Stories", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1419526/the-hunger-games-mockingjay-director-francis-lawrence-promises-two-distinct-stories/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Mockingjay-Francis-Lawrence.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-19T00:18:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-19T02:37:34+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Mockingjay-Francis-Lawrence.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-08-19T00:18:34+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "the hunger games: mockingjay,francis lawrence,julianne moore,the hunger games,suzanne collins,movies", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Mockingjay-Francis-Lawrence.jpg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "In a recent interview by Entertainment Weekly, the Mockingjay director Francis Lawrence talked about splitting the books and new surprises for book fans."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb8de\"", "article_summary": "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 hits theaters November 21, 2014.\nThe location of the story\u2019s split has been a hot topic of conversation for Hunger Games fans for months.\nThe Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is now less than 100 days from theatrical release and in a recent interview by Entertainment Weekly, the Mockingjay director Francis Lawrence talked about splitting the books and new surprises for book fans.\nThe final two Hunger Games movies are split into two parts and are based upon the novel Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins.\n\u201cThis is where the meaning of the entire [Hunger Games] series comes into play."}
