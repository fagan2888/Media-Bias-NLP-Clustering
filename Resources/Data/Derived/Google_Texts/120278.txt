A new Minnesota proposal is aiming to provide equal opportunity to transgender students who are looking to join extracurricular activities and sports.

A Minnesota policy that would allow transgender students to choose sports teams based on their gender identity has entered round four, and is waiting to be approved by the Minnesota High School League’s (MSHSL) Board of Directors.

The policy would allow “participation for all students regardless of their gender identity or expression.” It states that it “is designed to guide member school personnel as they create an environment free from discrimination and provide an equal opportunity for participation in athletics in accordance with applicable state and federal laws, rules, and regulations.”

The MSHSL has already gone through several drafts because “each revision attempts to clarify the issues that have been addressed by individuals and persons representing groups,” MSHSL Executive Director Dave Stead said, according to the Morrison County Record.

In order to qualify as transgender, the student must provide the school with documentation of their identity and held gender identity, as well as a statement from a health care professional who works with the student to verify the gender identity. Minnesota schools would also accommodate the transgender student when it comes to locker rooms, especially since the Minnesota Child Protection League (MNCPL), which is fighting against the new policy, brought up the argument that showering among transgenders might wreak havoc among cisgenders. “You tell me, where is the research that a biological male or a biological female is not a biological male or a biological female,” said MNCPL state coordinator Michelle Lentz, according to the Record. “Where is the research, where is the science that says that a boy that feels like a girl is every bit a girl.”

As a result of those against transgender equal opportunity, the policy has had to go through several different drafts to address these issues. And recently, the Minneapolis Star Tribune printed a full-page ad condemning the proposal and thus discriminating against transgender students.

The draft defines transgender as “a person whose gender identity is different from and does not match the gender assigned at birth;” gender identity as “a person’s deeply-felt internal sense of being male or female;” and gender expression as “a person’s external characteristics and behaviors that are socially defined as either masculine or feminine.”

Perhaps everyone can take note from Brooke Guinan, a transgender who joined the New York City Fire Department amid complete acceptance from her fellow firefighters:
