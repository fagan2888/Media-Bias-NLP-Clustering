Bones had torn through his flesh. His left foot was nearly severed. As he lapsed into and out of consciousness, a jarring thought crossed the Baptist preacher\u2019s mind: he no longer had health insurance.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the first thoughts I had after I got hit,\u201d Matthew told me in a telephone interview from his home in Indianola, Miss.\n\nMatthew is a bi-vocational pastor. He ministers to two congregations and works a full-time job at the Indianola Pecan House. The 27-year-old is married and has four children. His oldest is five, the youngest is one. And on Feb. 17th he became a victim of ObamaCare.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nMatthew Morgan was a creature of habit. Every morning before the sun rose over the Mississippi Delta, he would lace up his running shoes, and pound the pavement with three other runners. Twelve mile runs were the norm but on the 17th \u2013 they decided on a lighter run. The nine-mile run that day would take them deep into the countryside.\n\nIt was Monday. 5:45 a.m. The runners had just reached the turn-around point. Two were setting the pace. Matthew and another runner trailed behind. He saw a car approaching and Matthew crossed over to the other side. It was a move that would soon have life-altering implications.\n\n\u201cI remember hearing tires squeal,\u201d he told me. \u201cI turned around and saw very dim headlights. I tried to move out of the way.\u201d\n\nBut it was too late.\n\nThe 1999 Dodge Ram slammed into the young preacher. He was thrown onto the hood of the truck. His head swung around and busted out the passenger\u2019s side window. And then he was dumped onto the pavement.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I was hit, I felt my leg break,\u201d he said. \u201cI hit the ground in the fetal position.\u201d\n\nBlood was everywhere. Bones were sticking out of his arm and leg. His injuries were graphic and grotesque. His left leg was shattered, ankle broken, the tibia completely ripped away. A bit of skin was the only thing holding his foot together. His left arm was broken.\n\nNot once did Matthew lose consciousness. He remembers everything. And for a moment, he was alone in the darkness on that quiet stretch of country road. On one side was farm land. On the other a bayou.\n\n\u201cI remember praying, \u2018Lord, I don\u2019t mind coming home but I feel like I have a little more work to do here,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nUsing his broken arm, Matthew was able to pull the phone from his other arm and called his wife.\n\n\u201cI did not want to call her but I had to,\u201d he said. \u201cI told her I was broken all up. I had been hit by a truck and needed her to come and get me.\u201d\n\nThe other runners heard his screams and came to his side. Help was summoned \u2013 but it would take nearly 45 minutes for the ambulance to arrive. One of the runners called her husband \u2013 a doctor. Another doctor was also alerted.\n\nThe pain was unbearable. But there was nothing they could do \u2013 but wait and pray.\n\n\u201cIt was the most amazing worship service I ever had in my life,\u201d he told me. \u201cThrough the grace of God I was able to be sustained out there.\u201d\n\nThe doctors arrived first and assessed that Matthew was in grave danger of losing his foot. They would have to reduce the compress fracture on site \u2013 the middle of the road \u2013 without any medication.\n\n\u201cHe took my foot and put it back on my leg,\u201d he said. \u201cHe put everything back in place and wrapped it up.\u201d\n\nA bit later, the police and paramedics arrived and rushed the preacher to the nearest hospital \u2013 miles away. He was allowed to come home after a week in the hospital, but he still has to endure eight hours of daily antibiotic treatments. He\u2019s confined to a wheelchair \u2013 and he faces more surgery in the coming days.\n\nAs if that\u2019s not enough to worry about, Matthew has to figure out how to pay for his medical treatment. Because of the Affordable Care Act, he doesn\u2019t have health insurance \u2013 and he\u2019s now on the hook for more than $100,000 in medical bills.\n\nMatthew and his wife used to have insurance through Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Like many Americans, they received a letter in 2013 informing them of a hike in premiums. The couple had been paying $550 per month for their plan and Blue Cross was raising the rate by more than 15 percent. Even though they liked their insurance plan, Matthew said it was no longer in their budget. They were forced to drop their plan.\n\n\u201cIt was a significant increase that we could not afford,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to let it go and find something new that would be better for us financially.\u201d\n\nThe Morgans tried to sign up for ObamaCare on the Healthcare.gov website, but Matthew said that was a fruitless effort.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get on the website,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was one of our issues as we shopped around. Then, we received the notification from the Internal Revenue Service that we would be penalized if we didn\u2019t have health insurance. We were in the process of trying to get it as soon as possible. The website being down did not help.\u201d\n\nThe Morgans eventually found an insurance plan. It goes into effect in April \u2013 too late to help with their current predicament.\n\n\u201cThe only reason our other insurance became expensive is when the Affordable Care Act came into play,\u201d he told me. \u201cI would still have the same health insurance if ObamaCare had not been around.\u201d\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, we learned Wednesday that those whose plans were cancelled have now been given a extra year's reprieve from the individual mandate. Matthew Morgan could have kept his original health insurance all along. Instead, he's on the hook for $100, 000 and years of rehabilitation while President Obama goes shopping at the Gap.\n\nThank you, Mr. President.\n\nEditor's note: A fund has been set up to help the Morgan family.
