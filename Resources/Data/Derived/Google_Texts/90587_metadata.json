The \"don't panic\" news is that this is not an unexpected pattern. December isn't March, and the experience of Massachusetts was that younger people were disproportionately likely to sign up late. If you use Commonwealth Care as a baseline, the exchanges are ahead of pace:\n\nBut here's the problem. The federal Health Insurance Marketplace isn't a single insurance risk pool. Because insurance is regulated at the state level, even the \"federal\" exchange is essentially an administrative mechanism for a couple of dozen separate risk pools. Each state needs a demographically balanced set of clients, it's not good enough to just be balanced on average. And even though the variance between the different states isn't huge, it's not nothing either. The odds that at least one or two states will fall short are much higher than the odds that the federal exchange on the whole will fall short. Now in a sense, a program that works in 48 states is doing a lot of good even if for some reason it doesn't come together right in North Dakota and Maine (or wherever). But it would be a huge embarrassment for a program that's already witnessed a lot of embarrassing failures.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.tags": "exchange, exchange demographics, obamacare demographics, obamacare young people, health care young invicibles", "sailthru.author": "Matthew Yglesias", "description": "Back in August when Obama administration officials were giving reporters briefings about how amazing healthcare.gov was going to be (they were really e ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Back in August when Obama administration officials were giving reporters briefings about how amazing healthcare.gov was going to be (they were really e ...", "title": "Not Enough Young People Have Signed Up for Obamacare\u2014Yet", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/14/obamacare_demographics_not_enough_young_people_have_signed_up_yet.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/14/obamacare_demographics_not_enough_young_people_have_signed_up_yet/458901749-angel-rivera-and-his-wife-wilma-rivera-sit-with-amada.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Back in August when Obama administration officials were giving reporters briefings about how amazing healthcare.gov was going to be (they were really e ...", "creator": "@mattyglesias", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/14/obamacare_demographics_not_enough_young_people_have_signed_up_yet.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/14/obamacare_demographics_not_enough_young_people_have_signed_up_yet/458901749-angel-rivera-and-his-wife-wilma-rivera-sit-with-amada.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "title": "Not Enough Young People Have Signed Up for Obamacare\u2014Yet", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-14T11:03:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Not Enough Young People Have Signed Up for Obamacare\u2014Yet", "sailthru.headline": "Too Few Young People Are Signing Up for Obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Not Enough Young People Have Signed Up for Obamacare\\u2014Yet\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/14/obamacare_demographics_not_enough_young_people_have_signed_up_yet.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/14/obamacare_demographics_not_enough_young_people_have_signed_up_yet/458901749-angel-rivera-and-his-wife-wilma-rivera-sit-with-amada.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"221140114003\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-14T11:03:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Business\",\n  \"author\": \"Matthew Yglesias\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"obamacare\",\n    \"health care\"\n  ]\n}", "fb-share": "Not Enough Young People Have Signed Up for Obamacare\u2014Yet", "tw-line": "Not Enough Young People Have Signed Up for Obamacare\u2014Yet", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "http://www.Facebook.com/mattyglesias"}, "keywords": "exchange, exchange demographics, obamacare demographics, obamacare young people, health care young invicibles", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.description": "Back in August when Obama administration officials were giving reporters briefings about how amazing healthcare.gov was going to be (they were really e ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/01/14/obamacare_demographics_not_enough_young_people_have_signed_up_yet/458901749-angel-rivera-and-his-wife-wilma-rivera-sit-with-amada.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08bf\"", "article_summary": "And even though the variance between the different states isn't huge, it's not nothing either.\nThe federal Health Insurance Marketplace isn't a single insurance risk pool.\nEach state needs a demographically balanced set of clients, it's not good enough to just be balanced on average.\nNow the numbers are out, and through December they have 2.2 million sign-ups of which 30 percent are under the age of 35.\nBut it would be a huge embarrassment for a program that's already witnessed a lot of embarrassing failures."}
