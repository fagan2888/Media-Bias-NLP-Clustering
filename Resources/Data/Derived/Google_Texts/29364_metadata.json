Insurance premiums for companies that offer health benefits increased less than 3 percent this year, the lowest rate in 16 years. While Wal-Mart Stores Inc. became the latest large employer to scale back its health benefits this month, the change affects only part-time workers -- saving the retailer an estimated $51 million a year.\n\n\u201cTo the extent they thought that the employer market would explode because of it, or there would be severe disruption or anything like that, we certainly didn\u2019t see that,\u201d Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Menlo Park, California-based Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group, said in a telephone interview.\n\nOne critical prediction came from Tom Donohue, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce president, who said in January 2011 that many companies were thinking about ending their employer-based plans to cope with the law\u2019s new mandates.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t happened. None of the more than 600,000 employers who are clients of Automatic Data Processing Inc., the largest U.S. payroll firm, is planning to eliminate health benefits for full-time workers in response to the law known as Obamacare. While there are costs imposed on employers by the law, the amounts are nominal for most companies, according to benefits consultants.\n\n\u2018In Line\u2019\n\n\u201cCompanies view the Affordable Care Act as a compliance mechanism, as opposed to it changing, completely overhauling the landscape of America,\u201d said Tim Nimmer, chief actuary for Aon Hewitt, a benefits consulting firm. Costs under the law \u201care pretty much right in line with what they expected,\u201d he said.\n\nDonohue wasn\u2019t available for an interview, Blair Latoff Holmes, a spokeswoman for the Chamber, said in an e-mail.\n\nSlower increases in insurance premiums and national health-care spending have mitigated the impact of the law on U.S. companies. Many employers are also shifting costs to workers with higher co-payments and deductibles.\n\nAmong corporations that saw little impact from the health-care law is Ruth\u2019s Hospitality Group Inc. The Winter Park, Florida-based operator of a chain of steakhouses offers benefits that exceed minimum requirements under the law for employees working as few as 23 hours.\n\nAbout half of the workers took the health plan and more are expected to join to avoid the penalty for not carrying insurance, Chief Financial Officer Arne Haak said in an April conference call with analysts.\n\nLower than Projected\n\n\u201cOur claims experience is actually lower than what we were projecting in the first quarter,\u201d he said. \u201cSo nothing precipitously bad.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s impact on U.S. companies has been an increase of about 3.6 percent in the cost of health benefits, said Brian Marcotte, president of the National Business Group on Health, a trade group that represents 395 large employers.\n\nNational spending on health care has also slowed, a phenomenon that was first observed shortly before the Affordable Care Act became law. At least part of it may be attributed to the law, according to Katherine Baicker, a Harvard University health economist.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible a more general effect arises from health-care providers, insurers, groups aiming to slow health-care spending on their own in advance of any provisions binding from the law,\u201d Baicker said.\n\n\u2018Under-Appreciated\u2019 Trend\n\nThe White House estimates that the Affordable Care Act has shaved at least a half of a percentage point annually from the growth of health-care costs, said Jason Furman, chairman of President Barack Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. Health insurance premiums for employers are $1,800 less today than they would have been had health-care costs continued to grow at pre-2010 rates, he said.\n\n\u201cThe change in health cost growth is one of the most under-appreciated economic trends relative to its importance,\u201d he said in a phone interview.\n\nEmployers have \u201cabsolutely\u201d done better than expected under the law, he said, noting comments from the end of the last decade by business leaders, including the former chairman of General Motors Co., Rick Wagoner, that health-care costs would render U.S. companies uncompetitive.\n\n\u2018Good Thing\u2019\n\nEmployers and their workers have benefited in the form of lower premium increases for their insurance plans. Other than a spike in 2011, after the law required plans to cover children until age 26 and eliminated cost limits on care, premium increases have averaged less than 5 percent a year since 2010, according to Kaiser.\n\n\u201cTo the extent that health care can be provided more efficiently, that\u2019s a good thing for everyone, employers and employees,\u201d said Baicker, the Harvard economist.\n\nIn a trend that began before the Affordable Care Act, many companies have held insurance premiums in check partly by shifting health-care costs to their workers. Their methods include increased co-payments and deductibles, plans that encourage the use of lower-cost drugs or other services, and wellness programs that penalize workers who don\u2019t participate.\n\nCost Management\n\nOne increasingly popular move is to offer workers a health-care savings account coupled with an insurance plan that carries a high deductible. A June survey by the National Business Group on Health found that about 57 percent of the 136 companies that responded are implementing or expanding this type of plan, including some planning to offer it as the only option. Companies on average contribute about $600 a year to the accounts, said Marcotte, the trade group\u2019s president.\n\n\u201cThere is a cost-savings and a cost-management element to them,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the survey, the companies said that they expected such benefit changes would shave 1.5 percentage points from increases in health-care costs.\n\nCompanies employing a high proportion of low-paid and part-time workers are likely to see the greater impact from the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, because they previously didn\u2019t offer insurance to those workers -- or the employees often refused it.\n\n\u201cTheir costs could easily go up 50 percent or more as a result of complying with the ACA,\u201d said John Haslinger, vice president for strategic advisory services at ADP, the payroll firm.\n\n\u2018Very Burdensome\u2019\n\nWal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, has said its health-care costs will grow $500 million this year, attributing an unspecified share of the increase to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRetailers, restaurants and hospitality companies have created a lobbying coalition in Washington, called \u201cEmployers for Flexibility in Health Care.\u201d The group sent a letter to U.S. regulators on Oct. 9 asking them to simplify employer record-keeping slated to begin in January.\n\n\u201cThe reporting requirements are going to be very burdensome to employers,\u201d said Christine Pollack, vice president of government affairs at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nEmployers may accelerate their cost-cutting with two new Affordable Care Act requirements beginning next year. In January, companies with 100 workers or more must begin to offer insurance to most of them or risk fines of $2,000 per employee. And in 2018, the government will begin to levy a new 40 percent excise tax on so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d health plans that cost more than $27,500 for a family.\n\nThe hope is that policies in the Affordable Care Act that promise to brake cost growth, including incentives for doctors and hospitals to work more efficiently, will bear fruit.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act may well have had a dampening effect, and there are aspects of the Affordable Care Act in years ahead that have the potential to not only reduce costs but improve care delivery,\u201d Randall Abbott, senior health strategist at Towers Watson, said in a phone interview.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne and Thomas Black", "twitter": {"description": "Business groups said soon after Obamacare became law in 2010 that the sweeping health-care overhaul would impose huge new costs on U.S. employers, leading to job losses.", "title": "Obamacare Refutes Warning of Corporate America Cost Surge", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-16/obamacare-refutes-warning-of-corporate-america-cost-surge", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i1ZosbfsQzmU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne and Thomas Black", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Wal-Mart Stores Inc,Markets,Law,Health", "news_keywords": "Wal-Mart Stores Inc,Markets,Law,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-16/obamacare-refutes-warning-of-corporate-america-cost-surge", "parsely-title": "Obamacare Refutes Warning of Corporate America Cost Surge", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-10-16T04:01:00.019Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Business groups said soon after Obamacare became law in 2010 that the sweeping health-care overhaul would impose huge new costs on U.S. employers, leading to job losses.", "parsely-tags": "Wal-Mart Stores Inc,Markets,Law,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-10-16T04:01:00.019Z", "parsely-section": "industries", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Business groups said soon after Obamacare became law in 2010 that the sweeping health-care overhaul would impose huge new costs on U.S. employers, leading to job losses.", "title": "Obamacare Refutes Warning of Corporate America Cost Surge", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-16/obamacare-refutes-warning-of-corporate-america-cost-surge", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i1ZosbfsQzmU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Business groups said soon after Obamacare became law in 2010 that the sweeping health-care overhaul would impose huge new costs on U.S. employers, leading to job losses."}, "parsely-post-id": "ND6ZAV6KLVRW01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i1ZosbfsQzmU/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb6f4\"", "article_summary": "Three years later, with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in effect, none of the most dire predictions has come to pass.\nEmployers may accelerate their cost-cutting with two new Affordable Care Act requirements beginning next year.\nThe hope is that policies in the Affordable Care Act that promise to brake cost growth, including incentives for doctors and hospitals to work more efficiently, will bear fruit.\nNational spending on health care has also slowed, a phenomenon that was first observed shortly before the Affordable Care Act became law.\nAmong corporations that saw little impact from the health-care law is Ruth\u2019s Hospitality Group Inc."}
