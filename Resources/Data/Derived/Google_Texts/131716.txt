NEW YORK (MainStreet) — The Republican cohort of presidential candidates is considerably more fleshed out than that of the Democrats. For better or worse there’s much more of a contest on the Right to see who will be the party’s nominee in 2016. Better because it allows the party to avoid the tasteless spectacle of having a candidate polish her scepter in the back of a Scooby Doo van. Worse because it means that anyone seeking the nomination has to preserve a shred of dignity for the general election while still winning the support of voters who chant “keep your government hands off my Medicare” and mean it.

Economically there’s not a whole lot of daylight between many of the Republican candidates. Much as with the Democrats, the party is coalescing around a few general principles, and for pocketbook voters, the big choice will really be Blue Team or Red. Still, there are some variations on the theme, and those can matter. Below MainStreet has broken each candidate down into our three almost-certainly speculative categories.

Let’s get to it.

Jeb Bush

Big Picture – A hard return to supply side tax theory, which means heavy cuts focused largely at the top. Although Bush is trying to position himself as a new breed of Republican, different from his brother or Mitt Romney, his advisors have largely been assembled from the teams of George W. Bush and Romney. In particular, Columbia Business School Dean Glenn Hubbard has a large role in the nascent campaign. Although we don’t know any details yet, Hubbard was a major author of Romney’s tax plan in 2012, and the bones of his economic thinking will almost certainly play a role in Bush’s.
