So foods that are relatively low in saturated fat but high in cholesterol \u2014 primarily shellfish and eggs \u2014 have been freed from the restriction.\n\nEggs have a lot going for them. For just 70 calories, a large egg provides 6 grams of satisfying protein, vitamin D, a variety of B vitamins, essential minerals such as iron and zinc, choline, which is important for brain health, and lutein and zeaxanthin, which promote eye health.\n\nActually, deciding which carton of eggs to grab at the market can be the most difficult thing about them. Here\u2019s some information to make the egg hunt a bit easier.\n\n\u25a0 Farm-fresh or all-natural: These are marketing terms; they have no official meaning whatsoever. Disregard these words \u2014 and any images of bucolic fields, for that matter.\n\n\u25a0 Cage-free, free-range or pasture-raised: These labels pertain to the way the egg-laying hens are treated. Cage-free means the birds are housed in barns where they can walk freely, rather than being confined to cages. Free-range means they are not only uncaged, they also have at least some access to the outdoors. And pasture-raised hens are kept outdoors for most of the year and brought indoors at night for protection.\n\nThere is no mandatory regulation of these terms. To ensure that these claims are verifiabl, look for products with third-party certifications, such as \u201ccertified humane\u201d or \u201canimal welfare approved.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Organic: Eggs with the USDA Organic seal come from hens that are raised on organic feed (grown without synthetic pesticides, fungicides or fertilizers) and are free-range (uncaged with outdoor access). Facilities are checked by accredited inspectors.\n\n\u25a0 Hormone-free or antibiotic-free: Hormones or antibiotics are not used in egg production, so these claims are irrelevant.\n\n\u25a0 Vegetarian-fed: This means the chicken\u2019s feed contained no animal byproducts. But because the bird\u2019s natural behavior is to forage for insects, it also implies they did not spend time outdoors.\n\n\u25a0 Pasteurized: These eggs are heated until just below the temperature at which they coagulate, so they can be used in recipes that call for raw eggs, such as many Caesar dressings.\n\n\u25a0 Omega-3: Eggs enhanced with this good-for-you fat come from hens whose feed is spiked with omega-3-rich ingredients such as flaxseed, marine algae or canola. The eggs contain anywhere from 100 mg to 600 mg omega-3 each, whereas a regular egg has about 30 mg.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the predominant type of omega-3 in eggs is a form that is the considerably less potent than that found in fish.\n\n\u25a0 Grade: There are three grades bestowed by the U.S. Agriculture Department: AA, A and B. Grade AA is best, with thick, firm whites, high, round yolks and clean, unbroken shells. Grade A eggs, most common in stores, have the same qualities as AA but with slightly less firm whites. Grade B, rarely sold retail, is primarily used in prepared egg products.\n\n\u25a0 Color: Different hen breeds lay different colors of eggs. They are no different in quality, flavor or nutrition.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/04/hfnutri07.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe6289\"", "article_summary": "\u25a0 Hormone-free or antibiotic-free: Hormones or antibiotics are not used in egg production, so these claims are irrelevant.\nFree-range means they are not only uncaged, they also have at least some access to the outdoors.\n\u25a0 Omega-3: Eggs enhanced with this good-for-you fat come from hens whose feed is spiked with omega-3-rich ingredients such as flaxseed, marine algae or canola.\nGrade B, rarely sold retail, is primarily used in prepared egg products.\n\u25a0 Cage-free, free-range or pasture-raised: These labels pertain to the way the egg-laying hens are treated."}
