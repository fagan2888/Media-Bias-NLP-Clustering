A Jersey City man is behind bars after getting hot under the collar and allegedly attempting to stab a Pop Warner football coach with a set of barbecue tongs, police reports state.

The incident occurred Sept. 1 at the Caven Point recreational facility off Caven Point Road and Chapel Avenue around 3:20 p.m., reports state.

During a football game between the Jersey City Gators and the Orange Bengals, a player was injured and was slow to get up, reports state.

A man identified in the police report as Tylik Lesuer, 18, of Jersey City, the brother of the injured player, then ran onto the field, but was advised by referees that he was not allowed on the field, reports state.

Lesuer then began to curse at referees, saying, “F*** you, that’s my brother,” reports state.

Referees told Lesuer that his brother was not injured and that he would have to leave the field, reports state. Lesuer refused to listen to the referees, screaming at them and the team’s coach, “F*** you, I’ll kill you,” reports state.

Lesuer then ran off the field in a rage and returned with a pair of steel barbecue tongs from the concession area, then ran toward the coach, a 28-year-old Jersey City man, “in a menacing manner” with the tongs before fleeing the scene in an unknown vehicle, police said.

Early yesterday morning, police officials arrested Lesuer at a Brinkerhoff Street residence, reports state.

Lesuer is charged with aggravated assault, possession of a weapon for unlawful purpose, unlawful possession of a weapon and terroristic threats, reports state.
