We are less than two months away from the primary elections.

Lynn Coleman, a candidate for Indiana's 2nd congressional district, gathered Monday with constituents who have seen their jobs sent abroad.

Coleman wanted to highlight Rep. Jackie Walorski's record on trade.

The news conference took place in front of the former South Bend Controls, a building where dozens of 2nd district residents used to work before their jobs were sent to Mexico.

Coleman says Walorski voted to fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal last year, even though America has lost five million manufacturing jobs since 2000, and Indiana has lost nearly 70,000 jobs.

Coleman says the TPP will open the door to even more outsourcing to other countries.

"I would never vote for a trade deal that would take jobs out of the United States across the country, or out of the country," Coleman said. "I would never support a deal like that, because when we do that, it hurts everyday people."

We contacted Walorski's office, but she has not yet responded.
