Yes, Martin Scorsese\u2019s new feature is undeniably topical: the story of a rogue Wall Street trader, Jordan Belfort, who made himself and his partners fabulously wealthy at the expense of the broader American public and got off\u2014even after multiple fraud convictions\u2014nearly scot-free. But the film displays almost no interest whatsoever in Belfort\u2019s victims, and it is extravagantly incurious regarding the mechanisms by which he took their money. If this is a message movie, it\u2019s one that features a message suitable for a cue card. None of which, incidentally, is intended as an indictment. The Wolf of Wall Street is a magnificent black comedy, fast, funny, and remarkably filthy. Like a Bad Santa, Scorsese has offered up for the holidays a truly wicked display of cinematic showmanship\u2014one that also happens to be among his best pictures of the last 20 years.\n\nRelated Story American Hustle's Stylish Lies Based on the memoirs of the real-life Belfort, the story follows his meteoric rise from a penny-stock broker operating out of a strip mall in the late 1980s to a twentysomething tycoon, complete with mansions, a lingerie-model wife, a yacht nearly the size of the QE2, a helicopter, and two bodyguards\u2014\u201cboth of them named Rocco.\u201d Oh, and drugs and hookers. Lots of drugs and hookers. The latter he estimates he frolicked with five or six times a week on average. The former included Quaaludes, Adderall, Xanax, pot, cocaine (of course), and morphine \u201cbecause it\u2019s awesome.\u201d Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Belfort, narrating his own tale with the help of frequent demolitions of the fourth wall. (\u201cNo, no, no. My Ferrari was white\u2014like Don Johnson\u2019s in Miami Vice\u2014not red.\u201d) As a Wall Street newbie, he absorbs wisdom from an older broker-guru (Matthew McConaughey, in a magnificent but all-too-small role), who offers invaluable lessons about money, coke, and masturbation (\u201cWhen you get really good at it, you\u2019ll be stroking and thinking about money\u201d). Soon enough, Belfort is in turn imparting such wisdom to his own acolytes (including a very good\u2014and very funny\u2014Jonah Hill), and the brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont is born. This may be the highest-velocity three-hour movie ever, a delirious and borderline addictive wash of adrenaline, testosterone, and controlled substances. Stratton Oakmont is essentially a white-shoe criminal enterprise that fleeces its clients by day and throws sex-booze-and-drug-suffused \u201cmotivational\u201d exercises by night\u2014and, for that matter, by day, too. (Eventually these activities require the posting of a sign in the office declaring, \u201cNo fucking in the bathroom between 9 and 7.\u201d It is, of course, ignored.) These and related depravities continue for about two and a half hours of the movie\u2019s running time, with a few close calls from the SEC and FBI along the way, until the final act, when the tone turns darker and Belfort finally gets his astonishingly belated (and decidedly insufficient) comeuppance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scorcese&#39;s new film is fast, funny, filthy\u2014and among his best of the last 20 years.", "author": "Christopher Orr", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Scorcese&#39;s new film is fast, funny, filthy\u2014and among his best of the last 20 years.", "title": "The Vulgar Genius of The Wolf of Wall Street", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/wallstreet/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/the-vulgar-genius-of-em-the-wolf-of-wall-street-em/282611/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Wolf of Wall Street is a magnificent black comedy, fast, funny, and remarkably filthy.\nStratton Oakmont is essentially a white-shoe criminal enterprise that fleeces its clients by day and throws sex-booze-and-drug-suffused \u201cmotivational\u201d exercises by night\u2014and, for that matter, by day, too.\nParamount Let\u2019s be clear from the outset: The Wolf of Wall Street is not a \u201cscathing indictment of capitalism run amok\u201d or a \u201ccautionary fable for our time\u201d or any of the comparable high-minded plaudits that are likely to be thrown its way.\nYes, Martin Scorsese\u2019s new feature is undeniably topical: the story of a rogue Wall Street trader, Jordan Belfort, who made himself and his partners fabulously wealthy at the expense of the broader American public and got off\u2014even after multiple fraud convictions\u2014nearly scot-free.\nSoon enough, Belfort is in turn imparting such wisdom to his own acolytes (including a very good\u2014and very funny\u2014Jonah Hill), and the brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont is born."}
