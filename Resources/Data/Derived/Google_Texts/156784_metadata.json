Cruz criticized Obama for proposing more government spending and debt without addressing taxes and regulations that were choking job growth, suggesting that he was running out of new ideas to stimulate the economy. \u201cAll of America needs to be a real \u2018Promise Zone\u2019 \u2014 with reduced barriers to small businesses creating private-sector jobs \u2014 and we should start by repealing every word of Obamacare, building the Keystone pipeline, abolishing the IRS and rolling back abusive regulations,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n(Quote courtesy of the Washington Examiner.) Personally, my favorite \u201cPromise Zone\u201d is the one where they tell you there are no promises, no guarantees, and you have both the liberty and responsibility to find your own future\u2026. and then you grow up. But of course, this increasingly childlike electorate has to be baby-talked with soothing noise about how the right people in Washington can guarantee you income and a job, without being so cruel as to suggest those two benefits are inextricably linked, if you just vote for them a little harder.\n\nThe Promise Zones in question \u2013 San Antonio, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Southeastern Kentucky, and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, according to CBS News \u2013 are supposedly bountiful fields of opportunity that await only a driving rain of taxpayer cash to blossom. They\u2019re already swimming in government money, but a bit more should do the trick, coupled with the wise stewardship of the brilliant central planners who brought you ObamaCare.\n\nCBS relates what President Obama said about his Promise Zone idea in his last State of the Union speech:\n\n\u201cThere are communities in this country where no matter how hard you work, it is virtually impossible to get ahead,\u201d Mr. Obama said in that speech. \u201cFactory towns decimated from years of plants packing up. Inescapable pockets of poverty, urban and rural, where young adults are still fighting for their first job. America is not a place where the chance of birth or circumstance should decide our destiny. And that\u2019s why we need to build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class for all who are willing to climb them.\u201d The president\u2019s \u201cpromise zone\u201d plan is being put into action 50 years after President Lyndon Johnson first declared a \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d and around six years after the start of the recession. It also comes as Democrats and Republicans compete to convince voters they have the right formula for helping still-struggling lower- and middle-income Americans. Democrats so far have largely focused on income inequality, calling for a higher minimum wage, closing tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy, and extending emergency long-term unemployment benefits. Yet by framing his \u201cpromise zone\u201d initiative as a matter of improving mobility, Mr. Obama could blunt the GOP\u2019s argument that the Democrats\u2019 economic philosophy leaves out a significant part of the equation.\n\nHow is extending a bit of federally-subsidized \u201cmobility\u201d to a few select communities going to \u201cblunt\u201d Republican arguments in favor of national prosperity through increased liberty and opportunity? Especially since Obama\u2019s snake oil has given us either the longest recession or weakest \u201crecovery\u201d in history (depending on how charitably you wish to describe the past five years) and he just keeps plumping for the same failed policies, bereft of either new ideas or self-awareness? Another round of bitterly divisive class warfare over \u201cincome inequality\u201d isn\u2019t going to do a damn thing for America, and there\u2019s a growing sense that a critical mass of voters realizes it \u2013 not necessarily because they\u2019ve become supply-side enthusiasts, but because five years of doing the same thing without results is going to exhaust the patience of even the more disaffected voters.\n\nAlso, to the chagrin of Team Obama, a lot of people still remember his confident assurances during the 2012 presidential campaign that happy days were here again, the economy was \u201cpoised\u201d for imminent growth, yadda yadda yadda. Well, it\u2019s a year later, and instead of the roaring trumpets of growth, we hear the feeble kazoo of more topline unemployment rate \u201cdeclines\u201d due to workforce collapse. Reworking the growth metrics to cook up headlines about a decent quarter or two isn\u2019t going to change the reality Americans see outside their window, any more than touting activity in the same stock market Democrats spent years telling us to loathe made them forget about the economic realities affecting their own lives.\n\nObama\u2019s policies crushed the economy through heavy-handed regulation and government spending, which both added to our alarming national debt burden, and filled the economy with confusion and uncertainty. Now he wants to spend more of our money in a few choice areas to help them overcome the effects of his policies. That sounds like the kind of racket we\u2019ll never see the end of.\n\nMarco Rubio delivered part of the Republican response by calling for welfare programs to be shifted back to the states, along with other reforms to anti-poverty programs. Ted Cruz offers another important component here, by reminding us that the private sector only grows when government shrinks, and the last thing we need is Obama mixing more of our money into a paste so he can patch a few holes in the hull of a sinking national economy. Obama\u2019s malaise is not going to be resolved with more aggressive anti-poverty outreach or special attention to the hardest-hit areas. On the contrary, such measures serve only to relieve the political pressure that could bring real, productive change. Everyone struggling to escape poverty should turn to those would increase the size of the private sector that would give them jobs, not the size of the government that would give them benefits. Otherwise, you\u2019re not really trying to escape poverty\u2026 you\u2019re just trying to make it more tolerable.\n\nThe first step has to involve reconstituting the strength of the national private sector economy. An overweening government must acknowledge that it doesn\u2019t have the answers, and back off, to let the bold, messy, unruly, and glorious power of our widely distributed private-sector intelligence take a shot at finding them. Millions of people acting in nothing even vaguely resembling \u201cunison\u201d can accomplish what central planners can\u2019t even dream of. The threadbare nature of their dreams is part of the problem, because they can\u2019t see any solution \u2013 either inside a Promise Zone, or beyond it \u2013 that doesn\u2019t involve a larger, stronger government spending more money. Restore the wealth and vitality of American business, reduce the cost and risk of employment, make it easier to invest capital, and then look at what can be done to encourage more investment in troubled areas.\n\nHere\u2019s a tip: an important part of bringing capital into blighted cities is putting a firm leash on the predatory political machines that made them blighted. Here\u2019s another tip: the people who accept the risk of those hotly desired investments will expect to profit handsomely when their bets pay off. Otherwise, they won\u2019t make them, and \u201cincome inequality\u201d will be resolved by everyone growing equally poor. I can see why socialist politicians regard that condition as ideal, but nobody else should be interested. On the other hand, if all of America becomes a Promise Zone, the socialists would be stripped of power, so it\u2019s not surprising to see them treat opportunity as one more resource the elites should redistribute as they see fit.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Socialists see \"opportunity\" as one more resource for them to redistribute.", "title": "Ted Cruz: \"All of America needs to be a real Promise Zone.\" | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ted_cruz_flag-480x320.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/01/10/ted-cruz-all-of-america-needs-to-be-a-real-promise-zone/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Socialists see \"opportunity\" as one more resource for them to redistribute.", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ted_cruz_flag-480x320.jpg", "description": "Socialists see \"opportunity\" as one more resource for them to redistribute.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cAll of America needs to be a real \u2018Promise Zone\u2019 \u2014 with reduced barriers to small businesses creating private-sector jobs \u2014 and we should start by repealing every word of Obamacare, building the Keystone pipeline, abolishing the IRS and rolling back abusive regulations,\u201d Cruz said.\nPersonally, my favorite \u201cPromise Zone\u201d is the one where they tell you there are no promises, no guarantees, and you have both the liberty and responsibility to find your own future\u2026.\nOtherwise, they won\u2019t make them, and \u201cincome inequality\u201d will be resolved by everyone growing equally poor.\nOn the other hand, if all of America becomes a Promise Zone, the socialists would be stripped of power, so it\u2019s not surprising to see them treat opportunity as one more resource the elites should redistribute as they see fit.\nDemocrats so far have largely focused on income inequality, calling for a higher minimum wage, closing tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy, and extending emergency long-term unemployment benefits."}
