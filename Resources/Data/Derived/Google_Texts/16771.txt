DENVER/NORTHEAST COLORADO — Although Interstate 25 is completely open between Denver and the Wyoming state line, numerous other highways remain closed throughout northern Colorado and parts of Denver today as a result of the recent floods. In addition to maintaining road closures, Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) crews are beginning to assess the damage and review the structural integrity of state roads and bridges.

CDOT is advising motorists to exercise extra caution when traveling across the Front Range, as some highways may appear structurally sound but could have been damaged by water, rocks, or debris. In addition to driving carefully, motorists should not pull over to view flood damage or water flows because it creates a safety hazard on the highways.

Motorists also are reminded that the route that opened to Estes Park last night is only for emergency personnel, Estes Park residents, delivery vehicles, and other essential visitors. CDOT is enforcing checkpoints at varying locations to ensure only those with critical missions can enter and exit the town until more permanent repairs can be made. Rocky Mountain National Park remains closed to tourists.

Many highways and bridges remain closed until further notice as a precaution until crews can evaluate whether or not they are safe for travel.
