Reporter Napp Nazworth focuses mainly on the comments made by Vincent Phillip Mu\u00f1oz, Tocqueville associate professor of religion and public life at the University of Notre Dame. Read his comments and be afraid \u2013 or simply amused. (Do note that this story gets one thing wrong. It reads as if Lipper compared opposition to birth control to racial segregation. Actually, he compared religious opposition to racial integration to the current religious opposition to LGBT integration.)\n\nMu\u00f1oz argued that \u201cthe left\u201d really won the Hobby Lobby case. His reasoning seems to be that our side won because the discussion all along was about the scope of the contraceptive mandate, not whether there would be such a mandate.\n\nMu\u00f1oz asserted that the case was really a clash between two views of human sexuality. He said the \u201ctraditional view\u201d holds that \u201cmen and women are called to live to a normative standard of human sexuality that they themselves do not create.\u201d The competing perspective, which Mu\u00f1oz called the \u201cmodern view,\u201d says that \u201cmen and women are and ought to be their own authors of what constitutes the proper use of sexuality.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this a bit. I\u2019m especially interested in Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s claim that human beings did not create the \u201cnormative standard of human sexuality\u201d that they are expected to adhere to. So who did, then?\n\nIf you guessed \u201cGod,\u201d that\u2019s not quite right. Rather, this standard, which we are all expected to honor and cling to unquestioningly, was created by (surprise!) the all-male clergy of the church that just happens to own the University of Notre Dame. Sure, they say they speak for God, but, you know, a lot of people have made that claim over the years.\n\nFurthermore, this standard of \u201cnormative\u201d human sexuality was hammered out by these clergymen something like, oh, 1,500 years ago and it hasn\u2019t moved one iota because we all know that social norms certainly haven\u2019t changed in that time.\n\n\u201cThe Hobby Lobby case wasn\u2019t really a contest between the traditional and modern views of human sexuality,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz added. \u201cThe only dispute was how thoroughly the modern view was going to route the traditional view.\u201d\n\nAllow me to interpret for you: \u201cYou\u2019re not listening to the leaders of the Catholic Church when everyone at my college knows full well that the leaders of the church are right! You\u2019re making me very mad!\u201d\n\nActually, the Hobby Lobby case was a clash between the reality community and the \u201cmy-religion-gets-to-tell-you-what-to-do\u201d community. Sadly, the reality community lost because the Supreme Court decided in part that what matters is not facts but what people believe to be true (even if it\u2019s not).\n\nYet those pesky facts won\u2019t go away. Here are some that are interesting:\n\n* Ninety-five percent of Americans have sex before marriage.\n\n* Most Americans who want children say two children is the ideal number to have.\n\n* Women can start bearing children during their teen years. A woman, generally speaking, can remain fertile until into her 40s.\n\n* Virtually all sexually active women, at some point in their lives, use some form of birth control. Eighty-eight percent have used birth control pills, patches or intrauterine devices.\n\n* Several studies have shown that access to affordable, safe contraceptives has made it possible for more women to take part in higher education and more fully participate in economic life.\n\nAdd it up. What all of this means is that most heterosexual women are going to spend a lot more time trying to avoid pregnancy than they are trying to get pregnant. Hence, birth control is a vital public health issue. It was included in the Affordable Care Act for that reason, not as a way to annoy the Roman Catholic bishops.\n\nSee, what\u2019s really bothering Mu\u00f1oz and his ilk isn\u2019t the contraceptive mandate. Their beef goes much deeper. What troubles him is that people are 1) having sex before marriage; 2) engaging in sex because they happen to enjoy it and not just because they want to have babies 3) taking part in family planning. These things bother Mu\u00f1oz because people are not listening to his church\u2019s bishops.\n\nAnd, get this: Many of those people who are not listening to Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s bishops are members of his own church. That stings.\n\nThis is a bitter truth for the theocrats to face, so it all must be a conspiracy: \u201cThe left\u201d is trying to force religion out of public life. \u201cThe left\u201d hates God and Christianity. \u201cThe left\u201d favors hedonism.\n\nNot quite. \u201cThe left\u201d (and plenty on \u201cthe right\u201d too) happen to live in the real world, the world where consenting adults have sex and engage in responsible forms of family planning because they realize that, in an ideal society, every child would be wanted and loved and not brought into a family that can\u2019t afford to raise him or her.\n\nNo one in America is being forced to use birth control. Most people do it voluntarily and want access to it because it improves their quality of life. It makes no sense to put roadblocks in their way.\n\nPerhaps instead of constantly carping about the overheated machinations of \u201cthe left,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz and his bishops should look inwardly. The fact is, they had every right to make an argument against birth control and did in fact make one. It just wasn\u2019t a very good argument, and the people consciously rejected it.\n\nIn that sense \u2013 in the sense of cultural realities and the way Americans choose to live their lives \u2013 Mu\u00f1oz is right: The anti-contraception forces did win the battle of Hobby Lobby but are steadily losing the war.\n\nWe can\u2019t force these folks to join the reality community; I wouldn\u2019t want to. But we can do this: We can stop them from elevating their rejected, outmoded, out-of-touch dogma to the status of public policy that all must follow.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"admins": "756885656, 10150361922348092"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "You\u2019re making me very mad!\u201dActually, the Hobby Lobby case was a clash between the reality community and the \u201cmy-religion-gets-to-tell-you-what-to-do\u201d community.\nIt reads as if Lipper compared opposition to birth control to racial segregation.\nThe fact is, they had every right to make an argument against birth control and did in fact make one.\nPerhaps instead of constantly carping about the overheated machinations of \u201cthe left,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz and his bishops should look inwardly.\n\u201cThe Hobby Lobby case wasn\u2019t really a contest between the traditional and modern views of human sexuality,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz added."}
