Two Omahans who died in a one-vehicle accident early Sunday were in a car that police said didn’t slow before slamming into a warehouse.

Sgt. Joe Collins, a police spokesman, said the driver, Brooke M. Mace, 28, and her passenger, Claudio Perea-Perez, 27, were pronounced dead at the scene. Neither person had been using a seat belt.

Investigators determined that the two were traveling south on 89th Street at a high rate of speed in a 1995 Honda Accord. The vehicle speeded through a stop sign at a T intersection and smashed into the front of the building at 8833 J St.

Collins said there were no skid marks or other signs of braking. The crash was discovered about 7 a.m., but police still were checking surveillance cameras to try to determine what time the accident occurred.

Officers discovered several tools and copper wiring inside the car, Collins said. Officers are awaiting the results of toxicology tests to determine whether alcohol or drugs were factors in the crash.

Douglas County court records show Mace pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol and was sentenced to six months’ probation on May 10. Her license, which was suspended for 60 days, had not yet been reinstated.

An arrest warrant was issued last month for Perea‑Perez for failure to appear in court on a charge of driving with a suspended license and failure to comply with a citation. In 2011 he also was sentenced to 90 days in jail after being found guilty of assaulting Mace.

Anyone with any information about the accident is asked to contact Crime Stoppers at 402-444-STOP (7867) or the accident office at 402-444-5626.
