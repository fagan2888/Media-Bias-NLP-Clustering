The share of Americans either working or looking for work sank to 62.8 percent in December, tying October for the lowest level since 1977 \u2013 an era when women were much less likely to work.\n\nOne explanation is that baby boomers are shuffling into retirement. The trend is demographic rather than economic. People are not working because they are old.\n\nAnother explanation is that people have abandoned hope of finding jobs.\n\nBoth explanations are true for some people. What we don\u2019t know are the proportions. We don\u2019t know how many of the people who have stopped looking for work might want to return to the ranks of working adults as the economy rebounds.\n\nEconomic forecasts from before the recession are a potentially valuable source of insight. The demographic trends, after all, were relatively easy to predict. The number of baby boomers is stable \u2013 or at any rate, it does not increase.\n\nIt is therefore striking that in 2005, when the labor force participation rate stood at 66 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicted that the rate would fall only a bit to 65.6 percent by 2014 \u2013 far above the current rate of 62.8 percent.\n\nRecent studies, including a much-discussed paper by a pair of Federal Reserve economists working at the International Monetary Fund, have similarly concluded that the recession is the primary cause of the decline in the labor force.\n\nAs is often the case in economics, however, the truth has proven elusive.\n\nSome economists did predict that demographics would produce a decline like the one we have seen. Notably, a 2006 paper by a different group of Fed economists predicted that labor force participation would fall to 62.9 percent in 2014.\n\nAnd a competing set of recent studies has found validation for these predictions in the latest data. According to an analysis by Shigeru Fujita, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the aging of the American population accounts for about two-thirds of the decline in labor force participation since 2000.\n\nWhy are answers so hard to find? In part because the data is subject to multiple interpretations. Those who say they\u2019ve retired may mean that they never want to work again, or they may be taking shelter in the dignity of retirement because they can\u2019t find work \u2013 and they might be willing, even eager, to reconsider.\n\nThe Fed, in theory, could determine the answer by stimulating the economy until the participation rate stops rising. But the Fed is not going to do that, because officials believe that pushing unemployment below a certain level, known as the \u201cnatural rate,\u201d will cause inflation to increase. Instead, they will set policy based on a best guess about the share of people who might return to the work force.\n\nIt is quite likely the argument will therefore be resolved by default.\n\nA sobering piece of economic modeling by the St. Louis firm Macroeconomic Advisers, published last summer, concluded that the participation rate was not likely to rebound because the damage done by the recession would not be reversed quickly enough to keep ahead of the long-term demographic trends.\n\nDecisions made for economic reasons have a way of hardening into demographic facts. Those who announce that they are retired are less likely to return to the labor force. People who qualify for disability benefits rarely return to work. And baby boomers keep getting older. As time goes by, many of those people who might have returned to the work force will become people who never did.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140110110324, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 10, 2014", "keywords": "Baby Boomers,Labor and Jobs,Unemployment,United States Economy,The Jobs Report", "GBLC": "The Jobs Report", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/Debating Why the Work Force Is Shrinking ( 20140110 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Binyamin Appelbaum", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Binyamin Appelbaum", "byl": "Binyamin Appelbaum", "twitter": {"description": "With the share of Americans in the labor force at a low, the challenge is sorting out how many are shuffling into retirement and how many have abandoned hope of finding jobs.", "title": "Debating Why the Work Force Is Shrinking", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/debating-why-the-work-force-is-shrinking/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "creator": "@BCAppelbaum", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002642928, "description": "With the share of Americans in the labor force at a low, the challenge is sorting out how many are shuffling into retirement and how many have abandoned hope of finding jobs.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 10, 2014", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "The Jobs Report", "published_time": 1389369804, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-01-10T16:03:24-05:00"}, "utime": 20140110160324, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140110, "pdate": 20140110, "des": "Baby Boomers;Labor and Jobs;Unemployment;United States Economy", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "With the share of Americans in the labor force at a low, the challenge is sorting out how many are shuffling into retirement and how many have abandoned hope of finding jobs.", "title": "Debating Why the Work Force Is Shrinking", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/debating-why-the-work-force-is-shrinking/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/10/debating-why-the-work-force-is-shrinking/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Debating Why the Work Force Is Shrinking", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0dce\"", "article_summary": "As time goes by, many of those people who might have returned to the work force will become people who never did.\nNotably, a 2006 paper by a different group of Fed economists predicted that labor force participation would fall to 62.9 percent in 2014.\nInstead, they will set policy based on a best guess about the share of people who might return to the work force.\nThose who announce that they are retired are less likely to return to the labor force.\nPeople keep leaving the labor force."}
