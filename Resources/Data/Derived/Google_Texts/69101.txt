Now that President Obama has signed the Protecting Affordable Coverage for Employees Act (PACE), attention turns to implementation of the legislation that gives states broader flexibility in determining how to treat small businesses.

The bill scrapped a provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which would have moved firms with between 51 and 100 employees into the small group health insurance market beginning in 2016. Instead, states can decide whether or not such companies will be moved into that category, along with smaller firms.
