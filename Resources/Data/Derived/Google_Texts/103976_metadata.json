He leans his crutches against the wall and takes a seat in the corner. His seven pill bottles, of varying heights, create a miniature skyline of orange and white.\n\nA heavyset man with a scraggly beard, Alvarez has diabetes, high blood pressure and asthma. He\u2019s here at this clinic in East Los Angeles for his 2 p.m. appointment with Sangeeta Salvi.\n\n\u201cI was in denial for a very long time,\u201d Alvarez, 42, says about his diabetes. Now he comes in every three weeks to discuss his medications, diet and exercise with Salvi.\n\nDespite the white coat slung over the back of her chair, Salvi isn\u2019t a physician, but a pharmacist.\n\nPush to reduce costs\n\nShe\u2019s one of a growing number moving out from behind grocery store pharmacy counters across the country and seeing patients in new ways, part of a push to reduce health care costs, address social issues that impede people\u2019s health and ease a national shortage of primary care physicians.\n\nSteven Chen, a University of Southern California clinical pharmacy professor, runs this pilot initiative at 10 clinics belonging to AltaMed, a nonprofit clinic network that serves largely low-income populations in L.A. and Orange counties.\n\nIn a health care system that often seems impersonal and intimidating, pharmacists can act as a much-needed sympathetic ear and source of advice, spending extra time with patients.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the reason why we\u2019ve been very successful,\u201d Chen says, \u201cbecause someone is taking the time to sit with the patient.\u201d\n\nTeam-based medical care, in which multiple health care professionals work together to treat a patient, is a central feature of the Affordable Care Act. But as different workers collaborate, there\u2019s concern that pharmacists could overstep their bounds.\n\nNot like doctors\u2019 role\n\nPharmacists\u2019 role is fundamentally different from doctors\u2019; whereas doctors try to diagnose a root problem, pharmacists just try to make the symptoms better. Pharmacists are best trained to determine appropriate uses and dosages of medications to help patients with their problems.\n\nNearly 90 percent of patients with chronic illnesses take medication as the first line of treatment. In the United States, between a third and a half of patients don\u2019t take their medicines properly, which \u2014 along with poor prescribing and diagnoses \u2014 costs the health care industry as much as $290 billion a year, according to the New England Healthcare Institute.\n\nOn average, clinical pharmacists in the USC program find 10 drug-related problems per patient \u2014 things such as taking the wrong dosage or missing a needed medicine.\n\nBut they also act as a sort of medical counselor, helping patients with a range of issues, including diet, exercise and stresses of all kinds. Many pharmacists taking part in the USC initiative \u2014 funded by a $12 million federal grant \u2014 also call insurance companies and drug manufacturers to make sure patients can get needed medications.\n\n\u201cOur patients need that,\u201d says Rosie Jadidian, director of pharmaceutical services for Community Clinic Association of Los Angeles County. \u201cThey\u2019re waiting on bus schedules, and their lives are organized in different ways. They need that one-stop shopping.\u201d\n\nClinical pharmacists are part of a burgeoning number of recent medical interventions that aim to increase access to medical care. Across the country, patients can see a nurse or a pharmacist at new retail clinics, urgent-care clinics and kiosks. Some patients can also now talk to a health care professional on video chat.\n\nBecause these innovations often take care out of the hands of doctors, many of them also help with the shortage of providers across the country that worsened with the expansion of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA California law went into effect last year that allows pharmacists to bill for medical care \u2014 seen as a step toward solidifying their expanded roles outside pharmacies. Congress is considering a similar bill, but critics say an already costly health care system can\u2019t afford to pay another provider.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "sailthru.author": "Los Angeles Times", "description": "Steven Chen, a University of Southern California clinical pharmacy professor, runs this pilot initiative at 10 clinics belonging to AltaMed, a nonprofit clinic network that serves largely low-income populations in L.A. and Orange counties.
