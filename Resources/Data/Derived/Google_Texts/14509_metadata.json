That\u2019s a step backward from 2014, when Harvard Pilgrim lost $18 million on its insurance business and overall posted a net surplus.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, insurers that serve relatively healthy populations pay hefty fees to subsidize the insurance and care of riskier patients.\n\nSome smaller insurers have called for caps on these so-called \u201crisk adjustment\u201d payments; officials at the federal Department of Health and Human Services recently said they will review the program later this year.\n\nFor Harvard Pilgrim, which has 2.7 million customers in four states, those risk adjustment payments were more than $40 million, \u201ca substantial increase\u201d from 2014, a spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cOur industry continue to adjust to major changes related to implementation of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Charley Goheen, the plan\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cIn light of these burdens, it is increasingly important for us to find effective ways to contain health care costs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoheen said Harvard Pilgrim was able to keep the cost of providing medical care in check, saying it had a lower growth rate of medical expenditures in 2015 than other major insurers.\n\nSome observers called the risk adjustment fees fair, saying they remove any incentive for insurers to avoid covering patients who are sick or at higher risk of illness. And besides, they said, the fees are no surprise.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea is that you reward insurers for managing costs, not for finding the healthiest patients,\u201d said Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was an adviser on the state and federal health care laws.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that if Harvard Pilgrim didn\u2019t have to make that payment, they would have been closer to breaking even, but that\u2019s not the only reason,\u2019\u2019 Gruber said. \u201cThere\u2019s a constellation of things that affect profitability.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield, the state\u2019s largest insurer with 2.8 million members and one of the recipients of risk adjustment payments, reported an operating loss of more than $30 million in its core insurance business.\n\nThe company said the loss stemmed in part from payments for taxes and health care subsidies that increased by $14 million, to $300 million, for the year, and from the high price of new medications for chronic conditions.\n\nOverall, the Boston-based health plan posted a modest $15.1 million net surplus for 2015, thanks to income from investments and other sources.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s operating losses were less severe than in 2014, when its insurance operations lost $118 million. It reported net income of $7.9 million for 2014.\n\n\u201cFor us, the biggest issue in the year was weathering the investment markets,\u201d said Allen Maltz, the plan\u2019s chief financial officer. \u201cWe did earn money, despite the fact that there\u2019s great volatility in the markets, so we\u2019re very happy about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the operating side, we\u2019re not thrilled about losing $30 million, but that\u2019s within our range,\u201d Maltz added.\n\nTufts Health Plan, which had an operating surplus of $7.1 million in 2014, reported only a small operating loss of $139,000 in 2015. Meanwhile, membership in the plan grew by about 20,000 to more than 1,035,000.\n\nTufts said that in 2016 it will face a \u201cchallenging revenue environment and rising costs,\u201d particularly prescription medicines.\n\nAs at Blue Cross Blue Shield, Tufts Health Plan\u2019s investment income in 2015 shrank by about half compared with the prior year, amid a turbulent stock market.\n\nFallon Health, the smallest of the four insurers with around 222,300 members, reported an operating loss in its insurance business of $17.5 million, and an overall loss of $6.8 million.\n\nThat\u2019s a step backward for the plan from 2014, when it posted a lower operating loss, $11.5 million.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.2651714109", "eomportal-id": 348085, "description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield and other plans blamed the red ink on payments under the Affordable Care Act and the rising cost of drugs.", "eomportal-instanceid": 17, "og": {"site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield and other plans blamed the red ink on payments under the Affordable Care Act and the rising cost of drugs.", "title": "Four Massachusetts health insurers post operating losses - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2016/03/01/four-massachusetts-health-insurers-post-operating-losses/9Qjdq2SEgtC83DObSo4TeO/story.html", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BostonGlobe/Framework/images/logo-bg-small-square.jpg", "state": "MA", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Thu May 26 17:48:59 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "insurance,health,health insurance,blue cross,blue shield,bcbs,blue cross blue shield,harvard pilgrim,harvard pilgrim health care,financial,results,2015,revenue,loss,income,profit,obamacare,aca,affordable care act,fees,taxes,tax, Dan Adams, Jonathan  Gruber,Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Health and Human Services Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "eomportal-uuid": "2fe11ede-dfe4-11e5-bd43-e5e844012c76", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "insurance,health,health insurance,blue cross,blue shield,bcbs,blue cross blue shield,harvard pilgrim,harvard pilgrim health care,financial"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05bf\"", "article_summary": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Fallon Health, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, and Tufts Health Plan \u2014 which together insure nearly 7 million people in New England \u2014 released their 2015 financial results Tuesday.\nTufts Health Plan, which had an operating surplus of $7.1 million in 2014, reported only a small operating loss of $139,000 in 2015.\nFour of the state\u2019s largest nonprofit health insurers suffered operating losses in 2015, blaming the rising cost of prescription drugs and fees they were charged under the Affordable Care Act.\nThat\u2019s a step backward for the plan from 2014, when it posted a lower operating loss, $11.5 million.\nFallon Health, the smallest of the four insurers with around 222,300 members, reported an operating loss in its insurance business of $17.5 million, and an overall loss of $6.8 million."}
