How serious is the ailment, really? How long will the convalescence take? And, most important, what if the leader\u2019s health deteriorates? Those worries are especially intense in Argentina, where in her six years as president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez has established a highly personalised, and often tricksy, style of rule\u2014and where, on October 8th, she underwent emergency surgery to drain a build-up of blood near her brain.\n\nThe story began on October 5th, when Ms Fern\u00e1ndez checked into hospital complaining of an irregular heartbeat and headaches. Tests revealed the bleeding, apparently caused by an earlier wound. Since Ms Fern\u00e1ndez had not disclosed any previous accident, Argentines were surprised when Alfredo Scoccimarro, her press secretary, nonchalantly mentioned that she had also gone to hospital in August. Apparently the president fell and hit her head the day after her Front for Victory party (FPV) was trounced in nationwide primary elections (a preliminary vote before the impending mid-term congressional elections).\n\nOn October 7th Ms Fern\u00e1ndez was rushed back to hospital. Her doctors, who had earlier advised rest, decided to operate. They did so on October 8th; the president is now said to be recovering. But since she instructed her team not to disclose all the findings of her medical tests, the exact state of her health is uncertain. And the questions about her future remain acute.\n\nTo begin with, how long Ms Fern\u00e1ndez will be incapacitated is unknown. At a minimum, she is likely to miss the mid-term elections on October 27th. Before her operation she had been campaigning with her usual zeal, including setting up a photo-op with Pope Francis for one of her candidates. But the results of August\u2019s primaries and recent polls suggest the FPV will do worse than ever before in its ten-year existence as a party\u2014discredited as it is by high inflation and other economic woes.\n\nDay of the sock-lickers\n\nHow this week\u2019s events will affect the outcome is also unclear. In the past Ms Fern\u00e1ndez has used her vulnerability to political advantage. After the death of her husband and predecessor, N\u00e9stor Kirchner, in 2010, her approval ratings jumped. The following year she translated this outpouring of sympathy into an inflow of votes, securing an unprecedented 54% of the ballot in her re-election.\n\nShe is unlikely to be so lucky this time. According to a survey by Polldata, a research firm, only 15% of respondents thought the president\u2019s fragile health would translate into more votes for her party. Juan Cruz D\u00edaz of Cefeidas, a political-risk consultancy, says the \u201csympathy effect\u201d is likely to be strong only among people who already support her.\n\nTwo other factors are working against her. First, this is only the latest in a string of health scares for the president. In January 2012 she was out of action for several weeks after being mistakenly diagnosed with thyroid cancer. This week\u2019s events will fuel suspicions that she is not physically fit to govern.\n\nThe second negative is the centralised system of government that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez has created. She has stuffed her cabinet with obsequious puppets\u2014or \u201csock-lickers,\u201d as Argentines call them\u2014thus building an administration that cannot exist without her. Faced with the possibility that it might have to, tension in Argentina is high. And the reputation of the man who will act as president while she convalesces may well prove especially damaging to Ms Fern\u00e1ndez and the FPV.\n\nAmado Boudou, her shaggy-haired vice-president, helped her to win re-election in 2011 by strumming his guitar around the country. But now he has the worst reputation of any member of the government. Last year he faced allegations of illegal enrichment and influence peddling. Prosecutors failed to provide convincing evidence to substantiate them\u2014and Mr Boudou denies all wrongdoing\u2014but Argentines will be reminded of the imbroglio by his temporary role. Instead of allaying the anxiety sparked by his boss\u2019s health, Mr Boudou is likely to exacerbate it.\n\nAll this could have long-lasting consequences. Before her operation, rumours swirled that, if she secured the requisite two-thirds majority in Congress, Ms Fern\u00e1ndez would try to change the constitution to allow herself to run for a third term as president in 2015. That idea now looks fanciful. Instead Ms Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s power in the last two years of her mandate may prove as frail as her health.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20131012_AMP002_0.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez", "description": "Suddenly, Argentines have reason to be concerned about their president\u2019s future\u2014and their country\u2019s", "pubdate": 20131012, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "Suddenly, Argentines have reason to be concerned about their president\u2019s future\u2014and their country\u2019s", "title": "No sympathy vote", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/americas/21587786-suddenly-argentines-have-reason-be-concerned-about-their-presidents-futureand-their", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131012_AMP002_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "Suddenly, Argentines have reason to be concerned about their president\u2019s future\u2014and their country\u2019s", "sailthru.date": "1970-01-01 00:00:00", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131012_AMP002_0.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20131012_AMP002_0.jpg", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "The Americas", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20131012_AMP002_0.jpg", "articleid": 21587786, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20131012_AMP002_0.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.printdate": "2013-10-12 00:00:00", "news_keywords": "Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39a4\"", "article_summary": "The story began on October 5th, when Ms Fern\u00e1ndez checked into hospital complaining of an irregular heartbeat and headaches.\nThe second negative is the centralised system of government that Ms Fern\u00e1ndez has created.\nTo begin with, how long Ms Fern\u00e1ndez will be incapacitated is unknown.\nIn the past Ms Fern\u00e1ndez has used her vulnerability to political advantage.\nJuan Cruz D\u00edaz of Cefeidas, a political-risk consultancy, says the \u201csympathy effect\u201d is likely to be strong only among people who already support her."}
