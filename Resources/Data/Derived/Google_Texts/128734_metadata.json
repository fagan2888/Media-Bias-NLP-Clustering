Arron Afflalo made a 3-pointer at the buzzer of regulation to send the game to the extra frame.\n\nAnd then Houston\u2019s Mr. Everything, James Harden, took it from there.\n\nIn overtime, Harden made all the shots he was asked to make, the game\u2019s most critical plays, and assisted on another \u2013 all part of his 41 points and 10 assists, all of that production very necessary to beat a Nuggets team that scrapped but could not come out with the win.\n\nIt was bittersweet to Nuggets coach Brian Shaw, who got the effort that had been missing half of the time in the last 10 days or so. And so he was left kind of shrugging his shoulders and saying, \u201cI\u2019m proud of the guys and the way they played. So these kinds of losses I can stomach a little bit better.\u201d\n\nBut what is becoming harder for the team to stomach is their slippage down the Western Conference standings. This is normally much too early to keep daily tabs on playoff races, but the Nuggets know the consquences if the losses keep coming at this rate.\n\nThey\u2019ve lost seven of their last eight games, and while they remain just 2 \u00bd games out of the eighth spot, they also know the bleeding has to stop for them to remain realistic about making a postseason run.\n\nNUGGETS MAILBAG: Pose a question for Christopher Dempsey\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day we have 15 losses,\u201d said Nuggets guard Arron Afflalo, who finished with 22 points. \u201cAnd we understand what it\u2019s going to take to make the playoffs in this conference, and with each passing game\u2026we\u2019ve got to start stringing (wins) together. We\u2019re discouraged by some of these gut-wrenching losses, some of these close games that we\u2019re not winning, especially here on our home floor.\n\n\u201cHopefully, the big picture perspective allows us to remain confident and start getting on a winning streak, get back to .500 in the next week or two and then have an impressive month of January and move forward.\u201d\n\nA Nuggets offensive power outage in the second half set up the late game drama. The offense mustered just 39 points in the third and fourth quarters after scoring 60 by halftime. Some of the individuals responsible for getting the Nuggets\u2019 offense going in the first 24 minutes couldn\u2019t keep it going in the second.\n\n\u201cThe ball was not moving like it as in the first half,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cSometimes we were not running as much as we did in the first half. We missed some open looks.\u201d\n\nWhen Kenneth Faried slammed through a put-back dunk with 1:24 left in regulation, the Nuggets had a 96-93 lead.\n\nDwight Howard is no free-throw superstar, but he knocked down two when it counted to draw the Rockets within one point with just over a minute to play. The Nuggets got two cracks at stretching the lead back out but couldn\u2019t convert.\n\nRockets rebounded a Ty Lawson miss and had 21.4 seconds to win the game. Harden faced down Darrell Arthur and nailed a 3-pointer with 10.4 seconds left, putting the Rockets up by two.\n\nAnd on the next possession, the Nuggets threw the ball away. Faried\u2019s turnover gave the Rockets the ball back, but Harden made 1-of-2 free throws and the Nuggets had one chance left.\n\nThey sprinted the ball up, got it to Afflalo, and he nailed a 3-pointer to send the game into overtime.\n\nThe teams traded buckets in the first couple minutes of overtime. With 1:36 left, Arthur made 1-of-2 free throws to reduce the Nuggets\u2019 deficit to 107-105. Harden and Arthur exchanged jump shots to keep the Rockets lead at two with under a minute to go.\n\nAn offensive goaltending call on Houston with 39.3 seconds left gave the Nuggets the ball with a chance to tie.\n\nAfflalo was fouled but made 1-of-2 at the line.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even get past it,\u201d Afflalo said. \u201cI felt like that was the killer.\u201d\n\nHarden made two free throws. So with 23.9 seconds left, the Nuggets had another chance to tie the game with a 3-pointer. But Danilo Gallinari missed his attempt, and it was rebounded by Patrick Beverley, who was fouled. He made two to give the Rockets a 113-108 lead to seal it.\n\n\u201cWe got the looks that we wanted,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThey got the looks they wanted. They made the key plays, they made their free throws down the stretch when they needed to, and that was the difference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Nuggets fall in overtime to Houston Rockets", "title": "Denver Nuggets fall in overtime to Houston Rockets", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/17/denver-nuggets-fall-in-overtime-to-houston-rockets/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141217__nuggets-rocketsp1.jpg", "height": 570}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141217__nuggets-rocketsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-17T23:52:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T09:48:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2a5\"", "article_summary": "An offensive goaltending call on Houston with 39.3 seconds left gave the Nuggets the ball with a chance to tie.\nFaried\u2019s turnover gave the Rockets the ball back, but Harden made 1-of-2 free throws and the Nuggets had one chance left.\nThe Nuggets lost 115-111 in overtime to the Houston Rockets at the Pepsi Center.\nHarden faced down Darrell Arthur and nailed a 3-pointer with 10.4 seconds left, putting the Rockets up by two.\nSo with 23.9 seconds left, the Nuggets had another chance to tie the game with a 3-pointer."}
