I\u2019m going to give you a few examples of how the English media don\u2019t understand Scottish culture and our customary jests and banter.\n\nThe other day there was a wee intern who was making a hell of a din, and I towl him \u201cOh houl\u2019 yer wheesht, ye wee faggie, would ye?\u201d\n\nAnd now, given the deliberate and malicious bias of the English media against my party, and more importantly against me in particular, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me in the least if they were going to call that one a \u201chomophobic\u201d comment.\n\nWell, obviously this is purely rooted in the bigoted English assumption that any time anyone to the north of Hadrian\u2019s wall says something vaguely resembling an English word, they must mean precisely what a Britisher would mean by it. Whether it\u2019s \u201cbehave yourself, woman,\u201d or \u201choul\u2019 yer wheesht, ye wee faggie.\u201d\n\nNow listen you here and don\u2019t interrupt me, now! When us people say \u201cye wee faggie,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean that homosexuals aren\u2019t allowed in politics. I mean, it\u2019s just like when I always say to my colleagues, \u201cYe straighty wee divvil, ye!\u201d or \u201cYe silly oul\u2019 heterish!\u201d\n\nBut of course, it\u2019s too much to expect the bigoted Anglo-Saxon media to understand that.\n\nOr what if we had an Afro-Caribbean member? If I call my friend \u201cBlacky,\u201d it\u2019s not like calling him an \u201cN-word\u201d or none o\u2019 that, it\u2019s just purely to have a wee bit of a lively debate, and to humorously express our solidarity and comradeship.\n\nAgain, you have to understand that in Scotland, if you want to be really antisemitic, you have to say something really really nasty, like the K-word or something like yon. But if you want some traditional Celtic banter, you just ask the boy, \u201cCan ye buy us the next round? I hear you and your lads are not short of a bob these days.\u201d\n\nI mean, you have to understand, this is how we grew up. People in Scotland, we\u2019re used to speaking like this all the time. It\u2019s not malicious, it\u2019s just a wee bit of fun, you know. Nobody takes it amiss.\n\nWell, that said, there\u2019s always going to be some sad-faced, Stalinistic, oversensitive bigots who overreact to perceived slights, real or imagined, and get really worked up about it.\n\nBut that\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles, lad, isn\u2019t it? Are we supposed to just spend our whole lives eavesdropping for the merest insult or slightest sign of disrespect?\n\n\u2026\n\nWell, I hope you\u2019re transcribing this here good and proper, now.\n\nHmph. What kind of handwriting is that?\n\nAh. You\u2019re dyspraxic, maybe.\n\nOr dyslexic.\n\nAh well, same difference. Can\u2019t keep track of all that now.\n\nAye, I thought ye were a bit special the moment I saw ye stagger in there.\n\n\u2026\n\nNo offence intended, of course.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "BJRhhAX0-HMwLuYcMtPOB6NAdO7bUX3D7seeI_tQT-Q", "generator": "Woo Framework Version 1.0.8"}, "article_summary": "Whether it\u2019s \u201cbehave yourself, woman,\u201d or \u201choul\u2019 yer wheesht, ye wee faggie.\u201dNow listen you here and don\u2019t interrupt me, now!\nI\u2019m going to give you a few examples of how the English media don\u2019t understand Scottish culture and our customary jests and banter.\nWhen us people say \u201cye wee faggie,\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean that homosexuals aren\u2019t allowed in politics.\nIt\u2019s not malicious, it\u2019s just a wee bit of fun, you know.\nAgain, you have to understand that in Scotland, if you want to be really antisemitic, you have to say something really really nasty, like the K-word or something like yon."}
