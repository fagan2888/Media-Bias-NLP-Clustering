(Hudson Star-Observer photo by Randy Hanson)\n\nDuring a meeting with constituents in Hudson Thursday morning, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy said he anticipates voting against President Barack Obama\u2019s request for Congress to authorize a military strike against Syria.\n\n\u201cI look at American involvement and what we want to get out of any kind of military action, and I have to tell you, I\u2019m confused,\u201d the Republican told the group of around 40 people inside Erbert and Gerbert's sandwich shop.\n\nDuffy said the rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar Assad include many radical Islamists and members of al-Qaeda, and that Obama has ruled out regime change as the objective.\n\nChemical weapons could be released if they are hit by bombs, he said, and the president has telegraphed his intention to strike for a month, allowing Assad time to hide airplanes, tanks and other military assets. Some have been placed in civilian neighborhoods, he said.\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t know what the end outcome is. And for every action \u2013 especially in the Middle East, but anywhere \u2013 there is a reaction. And I don\u2019t know what the reaction is going to be,\u201d Duffy said.\n\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve seen it as just a shot across the bow because the president drew a red line in the sand. That\u2019s not a good enough reason.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration is calling for the strike in response to a chemical weapons attack by the Syrian government that reportedly killed 1,429 people, including 426 children. There have also been earlier chemical attacks in which few people were killed, the administration says.\n\nDuffy said he would listen to the intelligence briefing he and other members of Congress receive when he returns to Washington, D.C., on Monday, but he doesn\u2019t expect it to change his mind.\n\n\u201cThose who I have talked to who have already had theirs, they\u2019re not swayed, and I anticipate voting no on Syria when I get back next week,\u201d the congressman said.\n\nDuffy also addressed the call by some Republicans to defund the Affordable Care Act by rejecting any appropriation bill that includes spending for it in the coming weeks.\n\nDuffy said a bill defunding Obamacare doesn\u2019t have a chance of making through the Democratic-controlled Senate and the president would never sign it.\n\nThe result would be a government shutdown that the \u201cliberal media\u201d would blame on Republicans, he said, adding, \u201cI\u2019ve been to this rodeo before.\u201d\n\nDuffy said his approach will be to delay implementation of the health care law and bring about its ultimate demise.\n\nThat didn\u2019t sit well with some of the people at the 7 a.m. \u201cCoffee With Your Congressman\u201d event. They encouraged him to join with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and other Republicans willing to shut down the government over funding for the law.\n\nMore on the Hudson event that lasted a little more than an hour will be reported in the Sept. 12 Hudson Star-Observer.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,government,politics", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Randy Hanson", "og": {"site_name": "Hudson Star Observer", "description": "During a meeting with constituents in Hudson Thursday morning, U.S. Rep.
