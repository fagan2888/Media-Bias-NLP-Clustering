If you find you\u2019ve already Hulu-ed The Bachelor and finally come to grips with the fact that Fraiser is never coming back, you may have to end up watching it.\n\nSigh.\n\nThe only way to get through life is to have fun. Games are fun. Drinking is fun. Drinking games are the most fun.\n\nOut of the goodness of our hearts and the creative passion of our souls, HE has created an entertaining diversion to make Obama\u2019s speech tolerable. (And with any luck you won\u2019t remember any of it!)\n\nEvery time the president says \u201cincome inequality,\u201d drink a Boilermaker. But make sure it\u2019s equal parts 12 ounce beer and 12 ounce whisky shot. It just wouldn\u2019t do to ingest more of one spirit over the other.\n\nEach time the president brings up immigration, eat the worm from the bottom of the tequila bottle. We need to make room in this country for more border hoppers.\n\nWhenever the camera pans to John Boehner, take a swig of Campari to commiserate with him and the sour taste he must constantly have left in his mouth from sitting through things like Obama speeches.\n\nIf and when Barry brings up Obamacare (he might want the American people to forget that one), chug that bottle of Cupcake Whipped Cream Vodka you have left over from that Christmas gift basket. Cupcake brand has been distilled six times, kind of like the multiple delays of the law\u2019s mandates. It is also sugar-coated,vapid, and bad for your health, just like something else we know\u2026\n\nEvery time the president uses the word \u201cfolks,\u201d drink some \u201cOld Grand-dad,\u201d because that is the only sort of person who should be using such a term.\n\nWhen the president doesn\u2019t mention the Keystone Pipeline, crack open a Keystone (obviously), and shotgun it for Second Amendment Rights Awareness.\n\nIf the minimum wage is mentioned, feel free to sip an icy O\u2019Doul\u2019s NA, which makes about as much sense.\n\nFinally, keep a bottle of wine handy to honor the theme of the whole experience. (Wine = whine, get it?) Any kind will do.\n\nWarning* You will likely wake up the same headache you\u2019ve had every day you\u2019ve woken up and remembered Obama is president.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "It's the only way.", "title": "The SOTU drinking game", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/180956593-480x320.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/01/28/the-sotu-drinking-game/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "It's the only way.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/180956593-480x320.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "It's the only way."}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6c56\"", "article_summary": "Warning* You will likely wake up the same headache you\u2019ve had every day you\u2019ve woken up and remembered Obama is president.\nWhen the president doesn\u2019t mention the Keystone Pipeline, crack open a Keystone (obviously), and shotgun it for Second Amendment Rights Awareness.\nFinally, keep a bottle of wine handy to honor the theme of the whole experience.\nDrinking is fun.\nDrinking games are the most fun."}
