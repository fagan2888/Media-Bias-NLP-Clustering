(AP) - A Nebraska city\u2019s ordinance that bans renting homes to immigrants living in the country illegally is having little effect because Fremont officials haven\u2019t been able to determine applicants\u2019 citizenship status.\n\nThe Omaha World-Herald reports (http://bit.ly/1D9v2Zw ) the federal government is refusing to provide information about an individual\u2019s immigration status because Fremont doesn\u2019t collect enough information.\n\nSo Fremont officials haven\u2019t revoked any rental permits since the city of about 26,000 started enforcing the ordinance last year. Voters originally passed the ordinance in 2010, but its enforcement was delayed while lawsuits were resolved.\n\nMayor Scott Getzschman said the city is working to address the problem without amending the ordinance.\n\n\u201cWe are following the letter of the law and doing what we have to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing not being done is verification.\u201d\n\nThe rules require Fremont residents to pay $5 and swear they have legal permission to live in the United States. Landlords are prohibited from renting to anyone without a permit.\n\nPeople who say they aren\u2019t U.S. citizens have their information submitted to a federal database for review. At least 35 people have said they aren\u2019t citizens in the past year.\n\nFremont\u2019s form collects only basic identifying information. Getzschman said federal officials have said the city doesn\u2019t collect enough to determine citizenship.\n\n\u201cOur form doesn\u2019t require a Social Security number or driver\u2019s license number,\u201d Getzschman said. \u201cThere\u2019s no additional documentation. That\u2019s why the verification process is not being used.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the ordinance were surprised to hear about this latest setback. John Wiegert of Fremont said he thought the ordinance had been quietly working since roughly 60 percent of the city\u2019s voters decided to keep it last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not heard anyone complain,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job was to get out the vote, and then I was done with it.\u201d\n\nAnother section of Fremont\u2019s immigration ordinance that requires employers to use a federal online system to check whether prospective employees are permitted to work in the U.S. has been in place since 2012. Many larger employers, including the major meatpacking plants just outside Fremont, were already using that federal E-Verify system before the ordinance was adopted.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Omaha World-Herald, http://www.omaha.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Nebraska city's ordinance that bans renting homes to immigrants living in the country illegally is having little effect because Fremont officials haven't been able to determine applicants' citizenship status.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/12/nebraska-city-struggles-to-enforce-its-immigration/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Nebraska city\u2019s ordinance that bans renting homes to immigrants living in the country illegally is having little effect because Fremont officials haven\u2019t been able to determine applicants\u2019 citizenship status.", "title": "Nebraska city struggles to enforce its immigration rules"}, "twitter": {"title": "Nebraska city struggles to enforce its immigration rules", "description": "A Nebraska city's ordinance that bans renting homes to immigrants living in the country illegally is having little effect because Fremont officials haven't been able to determine applicants' citizensh", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd1e\"", "article_summary": "So Fremont officials haven\u2019t revoked any rental permits since the city of about 26,000 started enforcing the ordinance last year.\nGetzschman said federal officials have said the city doesn\u2019t collect enough to determine citizenship.\nThe Omaha World-Herald reports (http://bit.ly/1D9v2Zw ) the federal government is refusing to provide information about an individual\u2019s immigration status because Fremont doesn\u2019t collect enough information.\nMayor Scott Getzschman said the city is working to address the problem without amending the ordinance.\n(AP) - A Nebraska city\u2019s ordinance that bans renting homes to immigrants living in the country illegally is having little effect because Fremont officials haven\u2019t been able to determine applicants\u2019 citizenship status."}
