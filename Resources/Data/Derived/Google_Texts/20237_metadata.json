Infectious disease physicians help facilities to achieve safety; improve quality, care and outcomes; and avoid penalties in a cost-effective way.\"\n\nThey also can assess which infection control interventions work well and which ones consume too many resources without much impact, according to Bleasdale. \"Their expertise enables them to identify where the hospital is vulnerable, prioritize improvement practices and implement those practices.\"\n\nRecent reports show that infection control specialists spend more time collecting and analyzing data than in implementing infection control policies.They typically spend five hours a day on data collection, leaving little time for other responsibilities such as rounding, safety drills, practice observation or answering safety-related questions.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nInfection preventionists spend more time on data collection than prevention\n\nWhat the future holds for infection control nurses\n\nHospital infection control in the era of superbug outbreaks [Special Report]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals that use their infectious disease specialists only to reduce hospital-acquired infections and prevent the spread of contagious diseases aren't maximizing their full potential,\u00a0according to\u00a0a blog post at\u00a0Hospital & Health Networks Daily.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals that use their infectious disease specialists only to reduce hospital-acquired infections and prevent the spread of contagious diseases aren't maximizing their full potential,\u00a0according to\u00a0a blog post at\u00a0Hospital & Health Networks Daily.", "title": "How hospitals can maximize the full potential of infectious disease specialists", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/how-hospitals-can-maximize-full-potential-infectious-disease-specialists/2015-09-25", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,hospital-acquired infections (HAI),Infection Control,Infectious Disease Specialists,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9d8\"", "article_summary": "Infectious disease physicians help facilities to achieve safety; improve quality, care and outcomes; and avoid penalties in a cost-effective way.\"\nHospitals that use their infectious disease specialists only to reduce hospital-acquired infections and prevent the spread of contagious diseases aren't maximizing their full potential, according to a blog post at Hospital & Health Networks Daily.\n\"Infection disease physicians can have a positive influence throughout a healthcare system, yet their full potential remains untapped at many facilities,\" Bleasdale writes.\nThey also can assess which infection control interventions work well and which ones consume too many resources without much impact, according to Bleasdale.\nTo learn more:- here's the postRelated Articles:Infection preventionists spend more time on data collection than preventionWhat the future holds for infection control nursesHospital infection control in the era of superbug outbreaks [Special Report]"}
