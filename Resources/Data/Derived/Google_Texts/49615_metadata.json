John McCain struggled to be heard over the booming voice of Sen. Ted Cruz, who yards away had assumed the stakeout position usually reserved for leaders in the Capitol\u2019s Ohio Clock Corridor.\n\nCruz was railing on Senate Republican leadership, on the president\u2019s health care law and on the \u201cestablishment,\u201d in front of a swarm of reporters. Cruz\u2019s words rang like a triumphant victory speech, even though his strategy to link defunding of the Affordable Care Act to funding the government had failed. In the shadows of cameras trained on the Texas Republican, McCain, a 26-year Senate veteran, was peeved and a touch incredulous as to how this debacle played out for his party.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. He\u2019s entitled to that,\u201d the Arizona Republican said, when asked about the impromptu Cruz news conference in front of him.\n\nMcCain then quickly shifted to praising a bipartisan group of 14 senators, led by Maine Republican Susan Collins, who served as a catalyst for the agreement leaders eventually brokered. \u201cThere are 14 of us who have already joined together. Many more wanted to join that group \u2014 a lot more \u2014 so there\u2019s a real impetus to prevent this from happening again and for us to work together,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI hope we have learned ... in 1995, we learned a lesson then, hopefully it will be another decade or so until we try this again.\u201d\n\nBut there is residual fear from aides in both parties that it won\u2019t be 10 years before another standoff, that the conservative faction mobilized by Cruz (especially in the House) won\u2019t be moved by recent polls showing a huge hit to the Republican brand, and that, perhaps most dangerously for GOP leaders, Cruz and his acolytes won\u2019t care. Asked time and again whether they were concerned that Cruz would draw a similar line in the sand in the months ahead when it comes time to fund the government and pay its bills again, multiple senators demurred or laughed nervously. They\u2019ve seen this show before.\n\nCruz is the Senate heir apparent to former senator and current Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, a man who once famously said of a moderate colleague who later was forced out of the party: \u201cI\u2019d rather have 40 Marco Rubios than 60 Arlen Specters, and the reason for that is if you want 60 Republicans, you\u2019ve got to have at least 40 to start with who stand on principle.\u201d\n\nCruz has starred in ads for DeMint\u2019s former PAC, the Senate Conservatives Fund, which is actively campaigning against incumbent Republicans, and so these past two weeks have only expedited the process of his falling out of favor with many colleagues.\n\nThe question is whether the Republicans who pushed this deal to reopen a government shuttered for more than two weeks have the strength to resist Cruz if he pushes a similar strategy again.\n\n\u201cWe have larger constituencies to answer to \u2014 a whole state,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham said of the differences between Senate Republicans and the House members led by Cruz. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve got a primary, but I care about the party, not just my place in the party. I care about how many Republicans are up here, not just the fact that I am one of them.\u201d\n\nThe South Carolina Republican easily could have been one of the members pressured by his right flank. He has a challenger this cycle and made brief moves that underscored that. (He came out in favor of an amendment sponsored by Sen. David Vitter that would have revoked congressional staffers\u2019 employer contributions to their health care, for example.) But on par he seems to be more a leader of a growing group of Republicans fighting against the tea party machine than he does a resigned participant in it.\n\n\u201cThe question is, how do you handle that pressure [from outside conservative groups]? I\u2019m not mad at a group wanting their way. I am trying to focus all the Republican Party to chart a better way,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe way we\u2019re behaving and the path we\u2019ve taken over the past couple of weeks leads to a marginalized party in the eyes of the American people, a form of conservatism that is probably beyond what the market would bear. It has been the best two weeks for the Democratic Party in recent times because they were out of the spotlight and didn\u2019t have to showcase their ideas. They do poorly when the spotlight\u2019s on them. Apparently we do poorly when the spotlight\u2019s on us.\u201d\n\nRepublican senators such as Bob Corker of Tennessee and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma have pushed back on the Cruzification of Congress by arguing that forcing a shutdown over the health care law has detracted from the GOP\u2019s message of reining in spending. Many of their colleagues were frustrated by the strategy and the tanking in the polls, even if Cruz did bring in his own pollster to a conference meeting last week to try to calm their nerves.\n\nFor now, Senate Republicans who overcame Cruz and jammed House conservatives seem to be holding their collective breath.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Talking to a small group of reporters Wednesday, Sen.
