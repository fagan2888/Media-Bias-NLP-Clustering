This is the second time the Davis campaign has come under criticism for mocking Abbott\u2019s disability.\n\nConservative activist James O\u2019Keefe released the video today:\n\nWhile investigating Obamacare Navigators, Battleground Texas, and their connection to Obama\u2019s Organizing for America, we caught some deeply offensive comments on tape.\n\nIt seems Battleground Texas and Wendy Davis\u2019 strategy to win the Governor\u2019s seat is to mock Attorney General Abbott\u2019s disability. We caught Davis supporters and Battleground Texas staff on tape making crude statement such as \u201cisn\u2019t that amazing to think of? He\u2019s in a wheelchair and we want to stand with Wendy?\u201d\n\nEven more disturbing was an election official who when asked about forging signatures covered her ears and then went on to admit, \u201cPeople do that all the time.\u201d A Battleground Texas volunteer then added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s legal but I didn\u2019t hear you say that.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: Davis has responded to the video, calling it \u201cabhorrent:\u201d\n\n\u201cGreg Abbott has persevered through great personal challenge to raise a family, have a productive career, and for that he deserves our respect,\u201d she said.\n\nAt age 26, Abbott was struck by a falling oak tree that injured his back as he jogged by. He has used a wheelchair ever since and has become an eloquent pro-life advocate \u2014 speaking up for both the disabled and the unborn.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nThe accident serves as a reminder that regardless of someone\u2019s circumstances, he or she deserves a chance at life, Abbott has said.\n\n\u201cAs I laid there motionless on the ground, gripped with pain, as helpless as a child in the womb, I knew my life had changed forever,\u201d he said at the National Right to Life convention in June. \u201cSome people think it\u2019s easy to write off the lives of the disabled or the different. But every day, God reminds us that all life has value, no matter the form.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wendy Davis' Backers Caught on Tape Making Fun of Greg Abbott for Being Paralyzed", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "A new undercover videotape may spell further doom for the campaign of Wendy Davis, the pro-abortion candidate for governor in Texas whose sole claim to fame is", "title": "Wendy Davis Backers Caught on Tape Making Fun of Greg Abbott for Being Paralyzed", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/01/23/wendy-davis-staff-caught-on-tape-making-fun-of-greg-abbott-for-being-paralyzed/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/wendydavis12-190x106.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "wendy davis,staff,tape,fun,greg abbott,paraluyzed,pro-life,abortion", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The tape has the Davis campaign mocking her pro-life opponent, Greg Abbott, for being paralyzed.\nIt seems Battleground Texas and Wendy Davis\u2019 strategy to win the Governor\u2019s seat is to mock Attorney General Abbott\u2019s disability.\nWe caught Davis supporters and Battleground Texas staff on tape making crude statement such as \u201cisn\u2019t that amazing to think of?\nThis is the second time the Davis campaign has come under criticism for mocking Abbott\u2019s disability.\nThe accident serves as a reminder that regardless of someone\u2019s circumstances, he or she deserves a chance at life, Abbott has said."}
