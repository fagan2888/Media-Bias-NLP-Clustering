Four hundred thousand people in Georgia is not a sliver; nor is 900,000 in California or 800,000 in New Jersey.\n\nThe map reflects only individual policy cancelations and doesn\u2019t consider the effects of Obamacare on employer-sponsored group plans. And it\u2019s a snapshot of a moment in time in the early days of the Obamacare rollout. Across the board, these numbers will increase. And it only shows data gathered from 16 States and Washington, D.C.\n\nJust for fun, here\u2019s a link to a Fox News story about Obamacare\u2019s effect on insurance costs hitting Republican States harder than Democratic States.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a story about a Virginia school district that\u2019s considering hiring a gaggle of substitute teachers because it can\u2019t afford the ballooning cost of employee benefits for full time teachers under Obamacare.\n\nAnd one more about doctors at small New York offices defecting from their line of work or retiring early because of the market push toward larger, cheaper, inferior centralized health care that Obamacare is bringing about.\n\nLooks like 2014 is not the year to get sick.", "article_metadata": {"projectnami": {"version": "1.3.3"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Personal Liberty\u00ae", "description": "Remember Jay Carney on NBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d last week, telling a former Bush appointee that \u201conly a sliver or cut\u201d of the American population was getting policy cancelation notices thanks \u2026", "title": "Here\u2019s A Map Of Jay Carney\u2019s \u2018Small Sliver\u2019 Of Americans Whose Insurance Has Been Canceled Thanks To Obamacare - Personal Liberty\u00ae", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2013/11/canceled.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-05T21:47:01+00:00", "url": "http://personalliberty.com/heres-a-map-of-jay-carneys-small-sliver-of-americans-whose-insurance-has-been-canceled-thanks-to-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://plnami.blob.core.windows.net/media/2013/11/canceled.jpg", "description": "Remember Jay Carney on NBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d last week, telling a former Bush appointee that \u201conly a sliver or cut\u201d of the American population was getting policy cancelation notices thanks [\u2026]", "card": "summary", "title": "Here\u2019s A Map Of Jay Carney\u2019s \u2018Small Sliver\u2019 Of Americans Whose Insurance Has Been Canceled Thanks To Obamacare - Personal Liberty\u00ae"}, "fb": {"app_id": 135282966636750}, "article": {"section": "Liberty News", "published_time": "2013-11-05T17:31:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-05T21:47:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "bvYDjX4XBto8stfZA3uAxLxNaRlmJGvc5BQnIbK_wQo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca2f7\"", "article_summary": "But here\u2019s a map that illustrates just how many people on individual health plans have been dropped by their providers because of Obamacare.\nThe map reflects only individual policy cancelations and doesn\u2019t consider the effects of Obamacare on employer-sponsored group plans.\nFour hundred thousand people in Georgia is not a sliver; nor is 900,000 in California or 800,000 in New Jersey.\nAnd it\u2019s a snapshot of a moment in time in the early days of the Obamacare rollout.\nRemember Jay Carney on NBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d last week, telling a former Bush appointee that \u201conly a sliver or cut\u201d of the American population was getting policy cancelation notices thanks to Obamacare\u2019s one-size-fits-all coverage mandates?"}
