And when Americans are afraid, our country\u2019s response is often to declare \u201cwar\u201d on our opponent, to send police, guns, bombs, or troops to fight it, lock it up, destroy it.\n\nExcept you can\u2019t do that to a disease.\n\nThis latest Ebola epidemic happened to come to Americans\u2019 attention at about the same time as ISIS, the militant group in Iraq and Syria that is the latest target of American military strikes. This has led to many unfortunate comparisons between the two, including a chyron at CNN asking if Ebola was \u201cthe ISIS of biological agents?\u201d Apparently we can only understand a virus if we can compare it to armed fighters.\n\nNational security reporter Ali Gharib joked on Twitter last month, \u201cObama announces $500 million-dollar fund to train and equip 5000 anti-Ebola fighters.\u201d Two days later, on September 15, he found that he\u2019d actually been more correct than he thought, when the announcement came that President Obama would indeed commit $500 million and 3000 U.S. military forces (the number has since grown to a possible 4000). The president called the fight a \u201cnational security priority.\u201d The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has deployed over 100 to the ground.\n\nWe are to be reassured, it seems, that the U.S. troops \u201cwill not be directly treating infected patients.\u201d Instead, they will be doing \u201ccommand and control,\u201d setting up facilities, and delivering medical supplies. Meanwhile, tiny Cuba has sent the largest medical team from any single nation, 165 health professionals with 296 more on the way.\n\nObviously, the U.S. military isn\u2019t going to actually try to eradicate a disease with military force. But the national security response, the all-too-accurate jokes should tell us something about our priorities.\n\nWhat it takes to save Ebola patients, according to a man who survived the disease, is care, not security. And care is something that is not particularly valued in the United States. Foday Galla, a medical student and ambulance driver who was infected with the disease while bringing an infected four-year-old boy to receive treatment, told Time it was the compassion and care of the doctors and nurses with medical NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) that brought him through. He now says he will apply this lesson from his Ebola experience to his work as a doctor: \u201cYou have to care, you have to give encouraging words, you have to tell them they will survive. Because if you don\u2019t have that [as a patient] you are going to want to die.\u201d\n\nEbola is particularly treacherous because the people who care are the ones who are most likely to be infected. Medical workers like Galla put themselves at risk trying to help. Even Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian man diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas, Texas, contracted the disease helping a friend and neighbor get to the hospital in a taxi because no ambulance was available.\n\nAccording to Liberian officials, women make up about 75 percent of the cases they are seeing because women tend to be primary caregivers and nurses. Health officials consider educating and training women to be crucial to fighting the spread of the disease. \u201cBy reaching the women, they are reaching those who can best protect their families, and their own health,\u201d said Maricel Seeger, a WHO spokeswoman in Monrovia, Liberia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We're fine at sending troops and money.
