So I would like to state to the public that if one intersection\u2019s distance is set for a three-second duration for a yellow light, then why is it that an intersection twice that distance (at least) has only a three-second yellow light duration also?\n\nSo if you have any concerns, please observe for yourself and write to our city to voice your concerns.\n\nAs for me, I will be still paying the fine and will avoid going through any traffic lights in Marshfield from now on. I did start the voice of concern of these intersections along Veterans Parkway. Now it\u2019s the voice of others concerned that need to be heard.\n\nNow I can shake off the dust from my feet and move on. Thank you to all that have heard my concerns, and your support.\n\nJodi Pankratz,\n\nMarshfield\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mnhne.ws/1JopL0J", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "I\u2019ll pay my ticket for violating a yellow light, but we should talk about lights\u2019 timing.", "og": {"site_name": "News-Herald Media", "description": "I\u2019ll pay my ticket for violating a yellow light, but we should talk about lights\u2019 timing.", "title": "Letter: Real talk about Marshfield\u2019s traffic lights", "url": "http://www.marshfieldnewsherald.com/story/opinion/2015/01/22/letter-real-talk-marshfields-traffic-lights/22179285/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/marshfieldnewsherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I\u2019ll pay my ticket for violating a yellow light, but we should talk about lights\u2019 timing.", "title": "Letter: Real talk about Marshfield\u2019s traffic lights", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/413e60545a7ef3ce891a6e4e9c19db691c54d9ac/c=0-0-1733-1733&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Marshfield/2015/01/22/B9315970721Z.1_20150122170240_000_GGD9OGVLM.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@mnherald", "site": "@mnherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883744842", "fb": {"app_id": 127108344020788}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca73d\"", "article_summary": "Traffic Light Yellow (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)EDITOR: On Wednesday, a judge declared me guilty of violating a yellow light from Oct. 4, 2014.\nI\u2019ll pay my ticket for violating a yellow light, but we should talk about the way Marshfield\u2019s lights are timed.\nBecause the observations I made of the yellow light duration were not scientifically backed by someone other than myself, I could not use this data.\nAs for me, I will be still paying the fine and will avoid going through any traffic lights in Marshfield from now on.\nSo if you have any concerns, please observe for yourself and write to our city to voice your concerns."}
