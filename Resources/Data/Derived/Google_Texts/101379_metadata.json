Gonzalez allowed four earned runs in 2 2/3 innings Saturday afternoon against the Miami Marlins, who were minus crusher Giancarlo Stanton. Two of the runs resulted from three consecutive hits to start his outing. He settled off after that.\n\nMost important, Gonzalez said he feels tremendous.\n\n\u201cStrength of the arm feels great,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cBody feels great. Composure, just excitement, all in all, I feel like I was back in 2012, just having fun, smiling.\u201d\n\nGonzalez threw 158 2/3 innings last year, his fewest since 2009 in Oakland, because of shoulder inflammation last May which put him on the 15-day disabled list. He went just more than a month in between starts for the Nationals.\n\nSaturday, Gonzalez said he \u201ctried to do the Jump Man logo\u201d when leaping for a wayward throw home from Bryce Harper and tweaked his knee. That immediately brought injury weary and wary Nationals manager Matt Williams out of the dugout to check on Gonzalez. After a couple practice pitches, he remained in the game.\n\n\u201cJust a little burn in the knee, felt fine the next pitch,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nGonzalez tends to throw a lot of pitches, even in good outings. He said that\u2019s the way he has been and it works for him. He\u2019s not going to change to worry about pitch-count conservation. Gonzalez, a two-time all-star, has a career 3.59 ERA.\n\n\u201cI think it comes with the package,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a long time, the same style of pitching. You\u2019re going to get one or two walks, or you\u2019re going to get no walks. That\u2019s the way baseball is. Some hitters are going to be very patient, some are going to be very aggressive. You\u2019re not going to tell a hitter that hits 30 bombs, hey, slow down because you\u2019re hitting too many.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same thing as a pitcher. You\u2019re not going to tell him to stop what you\u2019re doing if you\u2019re getting outs.\u201d\n\nA 2012 version of Gonzalez would be a staggering supplement to the Nationals\u2019 vaunted rotation, especially as the lone left-hander. That season, Gonzalez finished third in Cy Young voting. His 2.89 ERA was a career low and his 207 strikeouts were a career high.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gonzalez allowed four earned runs in 2 2/3 innings Saturday afternoon against the Marlins.
