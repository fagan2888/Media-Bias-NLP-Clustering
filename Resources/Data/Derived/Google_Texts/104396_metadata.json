Although e-cigarettes, battery-operated tobacco products that emit vapors, are thought to be a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, its risks and benefits are still not fully understood. Since the use of tobacco products mostly begin during youth and young adulthood, researchers at the CDC aimed to understand the prevalence and trends of current tobacco products.\n\nThe study, which was done in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), analyzed data from the 2011-2015 National Youth Tobacco Surveys. Researchers found regular cigarette use dropped from 15. 3 percent to 9.3 percent during this time period; meanwhile, the use of e-cigarettes jumped from 1.5 to 16 percent among the same group.\n\nIn 2015, more than one in four high school students reported using a tobacco product at least once within the past 30 days, and e-cigarettes were the most commonly used product.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned that one in four high school students use tobacco, and that almost half of those use more than one product,\u201d Dr. Corinne Graffunder, director of CDC\u2019s office on smoking and health, said in a statement.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, electronic cigarettes seem to have become popular among tweens. The report found that in 2015, the electronic devices were also the most commonly used tobacco product among middle school students, rising from 0.6 to 5.3 percent.\n\nWith researchers still working out how exactly e-cigarette use impacts health, the trend is cause for concern. Some research may deem the electronic devices as a safe alternative to regular cigarettes, but other studies have shown it hurts the immune system worse than old-fashioned cigarettes and can even serve as a gateway to its conventional counterparts. E-cigs also still contain nicotine, a highly addictive drug.\n\n\u201cE-cigarettes are now the most commonly used tobacco product among youth, and use continues to climb,\u201d said CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden. \u201cNo form of youth tobacco use is safe. Nicotine is an addictive drug and use during adolescence may cause lasting harm to brain development.\u201d\n\nIn addition to e-cigs and cigarettes, middle and high school students are also using other tobacco products, including cigars, hookah, and bidis. Overall, an estimated 4.7 million high school and middle school students reported current use of any tobacco product. While researchers have observed significant decreased in the use of conventional cigarette products such as cigarettes and cigars, the significant increase in e-cigarettes use among this group resulted in no decline in tobacco use overall.\n\nIn an effort to reduce youth tobacco use and initiation, the FDA is currently working on plans to bring additional tobacco products such as e-cigarettes and hookahs under their authority. This way they can regulate the manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of tobacco products, while using \u201cproven population-based strategies,\u201d such as increasing prices of tobacco products, implementing and enforcing comprehensive smoke-free laws, to reduce tobacco product use in this age group.\n\nSource: Singh T, Arrazola R, Corey C, et al.
