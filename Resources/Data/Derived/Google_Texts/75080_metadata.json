It doesn't even matter what time I went to bed.\n\nA: What you are experiencing is probably a normal period of relative alertness that happens in the middle of the night, said Dr. Carl W. Bazil, director of the division of epilepsy and sleep at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center.\n\n\"Most people realize that there is a natural drowsiness midday, usually around lunchtime,\" Bazil said. \"This is why many fortunate cultures developed the siesta.\"\n\nBut the reverse normally happens at night. The two interludes are both part of the body's circadian rhythm, which he said is \"controlled by an internal clock but of course influenced by lots of external things,\" like caffeine, light, exercise and stress.\n\nBazil said it might also help those who wake up midsleep to know that \"before the advent of electrical lighting, it was normal for people to go to bed at sundown, sleep for about four hours and arise during that natural alertness for a few hours before returning for a 'second sleep.'\"\n\nQ: Is it best to sleep on your back, side or stomach?\n\nA: \"This mainly matters if you have sleep apnea, which is often worse on your back,\" said Dr. Carl W. Bazil, director of the division of epilepsy and sleep at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. \"Snoring is often worse as well, as many bed partners can attest.\"\n\nOtherwise, for adults, comfort is much more important, Bazil said. Even in a favored position, nerve compression can occur if you do not move during sleep, which is why you sometimes awaken with a bit of numbness. Fortunately, the body tends to reposition itself naturally.\n\nFor infants, the advice is different. Since 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics has said that babies should sleep on their backs, even if being put down for a short nap.\n\n\u2013C.
