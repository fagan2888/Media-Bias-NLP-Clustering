But in the world of business, it\u2019s a bill in Congress that\u2019s been drawing much of the attention in recent days.\n\nThe Auto Enroll Repeal Act (S. 2546), introduced by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) last month, would remove a provision in the law that requires large employers to automatically enroll employees in a healthcare plan if they don\u2019t sign up for one. A similar House bill (H.R. 1254) was introduced last year by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC).\n\nThe Senate measure has received wide support from trade groups in the retail and food service industries, including the Retail Industry Leaders Association and the National Restaurant Association. On Tuesday, RILA sent a letter to Isakson\u2019s office, signed by 170 trade groups and businesses, supporting the bill.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that automatic enrollment may create additional confusion for our employees in an already complex benefit area and could result in unnecessary hardship if they find themselves automatically enrolled in a plan in which they do not wish to participate,\u201d the letter states [PDF]. \u201cIn addition, the automatic-enrollment requirement is redundant, expensive, and unnecessarily burdensome for employers without increasing employees\u2019 access to coverage.\u201d\n\nThe letter notes that the Department of Labor has cited the complexity of the auto-enroll provision as a reason for delays in implementing the law.\n\nIn comments on the letter, Scott DeFife, executive vice president of policy and government affairs at the National Restaurant Association, added: \u201cAs it stands, the auto-enrollment requirement will have damaging impacts on both restaurant owners and their employees\u2014leaving much misinterpretation for employees about their decision on coverage and creating additional administrative burdens for employers.\u201d\n\nShare this article", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Senate bill that would remove the Obamacare requirement to auto-enroll employees into a health insurance plan earned trade group support.", "pocket-site-verification": "f7059b70f081a1e1ced322fc1d9787", "og": {"site_name": "Associations Now", "description": "A Senate bill that would remove the Obamacare requirement to auto-enroll employees into a health insurance plan earned trade group support.", "title": "Trade Groups Back Obamacare Rollback Bill En Masse", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/0723_erase.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-23T16:15:36+00:00", "url": "http://associationsnow.com/2014/07/trade-groups-back-bill-end-obamacare-auto-enroll-provision/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Associations Now", "description": "A Senate bill that would remove the Obamacare requirement to auto-enroll employees into a health insurance plan earned trade group support.", "title": "Trade Groups Back Obamacare Rollback Bill En Masse", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/0723_erase.jpg", "creator": "@associationsnow", "site": "@associationsnow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 502961619}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AssociationsNow", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2014-07-23T16:30:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-23T16:15:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Money & Business, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "Trade Groups Back Bill to End Obamacare Auto-Enroll Provision AND What's this?\nOn Tuesday, RILA sent a letter to Isakson\u2019s office, signed by 170 trade groups and businesses, supporting the bill.\nThe Senate measure has received wide support from trade groups in the retail and food service industries, including the Retail Industry Leaders Association and the National Restaurant Association.\nBut in the world of business, it\u2019s a bill in Congress that\u2019s been drawing much of the attention in recent days.\nBy Ernie Smith / Jul 23, 2014 (iStock/Thinkstock) (iStock/Thinkstock)A Senate bill that would remove the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement to auto-enroll employees into a health insurance plan earned support from dozens of trade groups and companies this week."}
