Either time. I have voted Republican for the entirety of my life. I proudly wore pins and planted banners displaying my Republican loyalty. I was very vocal in my opposition to you -- particularly the ACA. Before I briefly explain my story allow me to first say this: I am so very sorry. I was so very wrong.\n\n\"You saved my life. My President, you saved my life, and I am eternally grateful.\n\n\"I have a 'pre-existing condition' and so could never purchase health insurance. Only after the ACA came into being could I be covered. Put simply to not take up too much of your time if you are in fact taking the time to read this: I would not be alive without access to care I received due to your law. Thank you for serving me even when I didn't vote for you. Thank you for being my President.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "No matter what the GOP candidates say, Obamacare has at least one fan.", "copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 Cond\u00e9 Nast 2016", "author": "Jack Moore", "og": {"site_name": "GQ", "description": "No matter what the GOP candidates say, Obamacare has at least one fan.", "title": "In Letter to the President, Republican Who Opposed Obamacare Says It Saved His Life", "url": "http://www.gq.com/story/obamacare-saved-his-life", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/56dd8705beb4a66323ebb824/16:9/pass/president-obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "gq.com", "description": "No matter what the GOP candidates say, Obamacare has at least one fan.", "title": "In Letter to the President, Republican Who Opposed Obamacare Says It Saved His Life", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/56dd8705beb4a66323ebb824/16:9/pass/president-obama.jpg", "site": "@GQMagazine", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 108943, "app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "Brent Brown,President Obama,Barack Obama,Politics", "article": {"section": "News & Culture", "published_time": "2016-03-07T13:51:05.133Z", "modified_time": "2016-03-08T18:50:17.584Z"}, "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Brent Brown,President Obama,Barack Obama,Politics"}, "article_summary": "I have voted Republican for the entirety of my life.\nMy President, you saved my life, and I am eternally grateful.\n\"You saved my life.\nI proudly wore pins and planted banners displaying my Republican loyalty.\nThank you for being my President.\""}
