For most people, it\u2019s a time of decline. Why do both the White House and Congress think this is fine?\n\nSo far it\u2019s been a rocky week for the Dow, as it has fallen below its recent 17,000 plateau. Still, have no fear. The New York Times reports that assets across the world are at record levels. But to reap the benefits of the asset boom, you need to be an asset-holder, and that\u2019s not a club that everyone can join. One needs to have cash on hand to buy a Manhattan office building, Brazilian bonds, or even Iowa farmland \u2014and lots of it.\n\nFor most working Americans, the story is very different. Income ticks upwards at a crawl. Year to year, private sector wages were up just 2 percent and that was before inflation, which stands at a little over 2 percent. That\u2019s called running in place, but Democrats and Republicans ignore the hollowing out of working and middle-income America.\n\nIn contrast, life for the donor base is good, regardless of party. The S&P 500 has grown more than 19 percent over the past year, and more than 6 percent since January 1st. It\u2019s the best of times for a relative few, and the worst of times for many.\n\nWant more stats? To say the least, the recovery is uneven. Overall, our economy shrunk by almost 3 percent in the first three months of 2014\u2014even as the economy of Canada, our neighbor to the north, managed to grow in the midst of the same harsh winter. Yes, unemployment has dropped, but so too has workforce participation.\n\nAt the same time, both parties have eagerly seized upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Hobby Lobby case to vindicate their respective world views, and to rally tribe and troops in an election year. Yet matters that cry out for serious national attention are ignored.\n\nOur infrastructure is antiquated and crumbling. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, one in nine of America\u2019s bridges is structurally deficient, while the average age of our 607,380 bridges is 42 years. Back when the Soviet Union was threatening us, we made sure that our highways and bridges were world class; not anymore. Sadly, the end of the Cold War has given license to structural decay.\n\nCalls for better roads and bridges are met with denunciations from the right, much as calls for energy development and independence are greeted with instant derision from the left. Getting the highway bill through Congress has emerged as a major challenge.\n\nOr take America\u2019s youth. More than seven-in-ten are ineligible for military service because of poor education, obesity, meds, emotional instability, and extreme body art. That\u2019s right, less 30 percent of young Americans can be considered as prospective soldiers, and no one is sounding an alarm. Younger America is our lost generation, and it\u2019s not just about student loans.\n\nApparently, this state of misery and decline is fine, or fine enough, for both the White House and the Congress. For the Democrats, their upstairs-downstairs coalition is doing great, or to be more precise, all are doing as well as are to be expected. Upstairs is savoring the stock market\u2019s upward journey. On the low end, Obamacare and expanded Medicaid are now the law of land. There\u2019s something for everyone, except working and middle America, but they\u2019re not part of the Democrats\u2019 coalition.\n\nOver in Republican World there\u2019s enough resentment out there to power the GOP to taking control of both houses of Congress. And to be sure, one can disapprove of Barack Obama without believing that his birth certificate was hand-crafted by space-aliens. The reality is that Obamacare stands to literally cost the Republican base, as it is an income transfer from America\u2019s working and older heartland to the country\u2019s urban precincts, and insurance premiums are expected to rise later this year\u2014just in time for the midterms.\n\nYet, beyond resentment, the Republicans have little to offer except cuts to Social Security and Medicare, and that\u2019s not smart long-term politics when the party\u2019s base these days is working and middle class, grandma and grandpa. Playing the role of the not-so-loyal opposition may be all that\u2019s needed for Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to become the Senate Majority Leader, but it won\u2019t likely be enough to elect a Republican as president, or to keep the Senate past 2016, when the GOP will be defending the lion\u2019s share of seats during a presidential election year.\n\nYet not everyone is caught up this vortex of paralysis and resentment. At least Hillary Clinton and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) aren\u2019t. Unlike many in her party, Clinton is talking about how the recovery hasn\u2019t reached a lot of people. In her words, people are \u201creally, really nervous\u2026 They don\u2019t think the economy has recovered in a way that has helped them or their families.\u201d\n\nSure, Clinton sees herself as having the rectitude of a bishop, but entitled to live as well as her congregants\u2014that is, if her flock were in Davos. Her claims of being \u201cdead broke\u201d or \u201cnot truly well off\u201d sound almost as empathetic as Marie Antoinette telling folks to eat cake. And Clinton\u2019s mien of acting as though she\u2019s entitled to it all has jogged memories, and started to cost Clinton, as the white working class has moved away from her after a gaffe-filled book tour.\n\n\n\nStill, Clinton gets it, at least theoretically or just as a matter of expedience, and so too does Rubio. In a recent speech, Rubio hit upon the right combination of anxiety and hope. According to Rubio, \u201cThe American Dream is still attainable. But it has gotten increasingly difficult to achieve for far too many. Wages have stagnated; everyday costs have risen\u2026 millions go to sleep each night overcome with the sense that they are one bad break from financial ruin.\u201d Not bad for a party that hated on the 47 percent.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "economy, Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201407101715, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "economy, Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Stock Market America and the Rest of Us", "tags": "education:economy,entity:person/marco_rubio,entity:person/hillary_clinton,entity:person/barack_obama,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "For the donor class, things are great.
