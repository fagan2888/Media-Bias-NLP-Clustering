But other prominent schools, such as Columbia University, UCLA, Colorado State University and the University of Oklahoma, continue to welcome Confucius Institute on their campuses, according to the CI website.\n\nUniversity of Chicago professor Bruce Lincoln said the Institute doesn\u2019t honor academic freedom and its governing board is filled with members of the Chinese Communist Politburo.\n\n\u201cThey have a story they want told, and that is to not be seen as a military and economic giant, but they want to persuade people [China is] a lovely place,\u201d said Lincoln, who teaches the history of religion. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve been enormously successful.\u201d\n\nLincoln said the institute\u2019s books and materials place Tibet and Taiwan as parts of Chin, although University of Chicago didn\u2019t accept those texts. He said teachers are trained to stop any conversations about Tibet or the 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square if students raise the topics in class.\n\nUniversity of Chicago didn\u2019t renew its five-year agreement with the institute last month, citing comments in a Chinese publication by Xu Lin, executive director of Confucius Institute headuarters.\n\nUniversity spokesman Steve Kloehn refused to provide additional information, but Lincoln said Lin bragged that she bullied the university president into ignoring faculty concerns.\n\nThe American Association of University Professors urged schools to break with the institute unless universities can retain control of recruitment and course work and protect professors\u2019 academic freedom.\n\n\u201cNorth American universities permit Confucius Institutes to advance a state agenda in the recruitment and control of academic staff, in the choice of curriculum, and in the restriction of debate,\u201d according to an AAUP statement in June.\n\nThe U.S. State Department expressed concerns in 2012 when it issued a guidance directive about Confucius Institute, saying only teachers, not professors or researchers, should be in K-12 schools and institute programs need U.S. accreditation. The directive did not refer to propaganda allegations.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "College administrators grow concerned about the content and actions of Confucius Institute programs on their campuses.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "College administrators grow concerned about the content and actions of Confucius Institute programs on their campuses.", "title": "Confucius Institute Under Fire as Conduit of Chinese Propaganda", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/niphotos113271.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-15T18:36:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/10010sE"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "College administrators grow concerned about the content and actions of Confucius Institute programs on their campuses.", "title": "Confucius Institute Under Fire as Conduit of Chinese Propaganda", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/niphotos113271.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "higher ed", "published_time": "2014-10-16T03:01:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-15T18:36:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "China, Confucius Institute, University of Chicago, Penn State, Colorado State, University of Oklahoma, UCLA,"}, "article_summary": "University of Chicago didn\u2019t renew its five-year agreement with the institute last month, citing comments in a Chinese publication by Xu Lin, executive director of Confucius Institute headuarters.\nNow some professors are urging schools to break with the Chinese language and cultural nonprofit, charging it is a \u201cpropaganda\u201d arm of the Chinese government.\nBut other prominent schools, such as Columbia University, UCLA, Colorado State University and the University of Oklahoma, continue to welcome Confucius Institute on their campuses, according to the CI website.\nDuring the past decade, the Confucius Institute has established itself at nearly 500 universities and K-12 schools in the United States and about 500 others around the world.\nThe U.S. State Department expressed concerns in 2012 when it issued a guidance directive about Confucius Institute, saying only teachers, not professors or researchers, should be in K-12 schools and institute programs need U.S. accreditation."}
