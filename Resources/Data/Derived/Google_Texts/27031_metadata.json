(File, Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nIn 1999, the Institute of Medicine published the famous \u201cTo Err Is Human\u201d report, which dropped a bombshell on the medical community by reporting that up to 98,000 people a year die because of mistakes in hospitals. The number was initially disputed, but is now widely accepted by doctors and hospital officials \u2014 and quoted ubiquitously in the media.\n\nIt seems that every time researchers estimate how often a medical mistake contributes to a hospital patient\u2019s death, the numbers come out worse.\n\nIn 2010, the Office of Inspector General for Health and Human Services said that bad hospital care contributed to the deaths of 180,000 patients in Medicare alone in a given year.\n\nNow comes a study in the current issue of the Journal of Patient Safety that says the numbers may be much higher \u2014 between 210,000 and 440,000 patients each year who go to the hospital for care suffer some type of preventable harm that contributes to their death, the study says.\n\nThat would make medical errors the third-leading cause of death in America, behind heart disease, which is the first, and cancer, which is second.\n\nThe new estimates were developed by John T. James, a toxicologist at NASA\u2019s space center in Houston who runs an advocacy organization called Patient Safety America. James has also written a book about the death of his 19-year-old son after what James maintains was negligent hospital care.\n\nAsked about the higher estimates, a spokesman for the American Hospital Association said the group has more confidence in the IOM\u2019s estimate of 98,000 deaths. ProPublica asked three prominent patient safety researchers to review James\u2019 study, however, and all said his methods and findings were credible.\n\nWhat\u2019s the right number? Nobody knows for sure. There\u2019s never been an actual count of how many patients experience preventable harm. So we\u2019re left with approximations, which are imperfect in part because of inaccuracies in medical records and the reluctance of some providers to report mistakes.\n\nPatient safety experts say measuring the problem is nonetheless important because estimates bring awareness and research dollars to a major public health problem that persists despite decades of improvement efforts.\n\n\u201cWe need to get a sense of the magnitude of this,\u201d James said in an interview.\n\nJames based his estimates on the findings of four recent studies that identified preventable harm suffered by patients \u2013 known as \u201cadverse events\u201d in the medical vernacular \u2013 using use a screening method called the Global Trigger Tool, which guides reviewers through medical records, searching for signs of infection, injury or error. Medical records flagged during the initial screening are reviewed by a doctor, who determines the extent of the harm.\n\nIn the four studies, which examined records of more than 4,200 patients hospitalized between 2002 and 2008, researchers found serious adverse events in as many as 21 percent of cases reviewed and rates of lethal adverse events as high as 1.4 percent of cases.\n\nBy combining the findings and extrapolating across 34 million hospitalizations in 2007, James concluded that preventable errors contribute to the deaths of 210,000 hospital patients annually.\n\nThat is the baseline. The actual number more than doubles, James reasoned, because the trigger tool doesn\u2019t catch errors in which treatment should have been provided but wasn\u2019t, because it\u2019s known that medical records are missing some evidence of harm, and because diagnostic errors aren\u2019t captured.\n\nAn estimate of 440,000 deaths from care in hospitals \u201cis roughly one-sixth of all deaths that occur in the United States each year,\u201d James wrote in his study. He also cited other research that\u2019s shown hospital reporting systems and peer-review capture only a fraction of patient harm or negligent care.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it is time for a national patient bill of rights for hospitalized patients,\u201d James wrote. \u201cAll evidence points to the need for much more patient involvement in identifying harmful events and participating in rigorous follow-up investigations to identify root causes.\u201d\n\nDr. Lucian Leape, a Harvard pediatrician who is referred to the \u201cfather of patient safety,\u201d was on the committee that wrote the \u201cTo Err Is Human\u201d report. He told ProPublica that he has confidence in the four studies and the estimate by James.\n\nMembers of the Institute of Medicine committee knew at the time that their estimate of medical errors was low, he said. \u201cIt was based on a rather crude method compared to what we do now,\u201d Leape said. Plus, medicine has become much more complex in recent decades, which leads to more mistakes, he said.\n\nDr. David Classen, one of the leading developers of the Global Trigger Tool, said the James study is a sound use of the tool and a \u201cgreat contribution.\u201d He said it\u2019s important to update the numbers from the \u201cTo Err Is Human\u201d report because in addition to the obvious suffering, preventable harm leads to enormous financial costs.\n\nDr. Marty Makary, a surgeon at The Johns Hopkins Hospital whose book \u201cUnaccountable\u201d calls for greater transparency in health care, said the James estimate shows that eliminating medical errors must become a national priority. He said it\u2019s also important to increase the awareness of the potential of unintended consequences when doctors perform procedure and tests. The risk of harm needs to be factored into conversations with patients, he said.\n\nLeape, Classen and Makary all said it\u2019s time to stop citing the 98,000 number.\n\nStill, hospital association spokesman Akin Demehin said the group is sticking with the Institute of Medicine\u2019s estimate. Demehin said the IOM figure is based on a larger sampling of medical charts and that there\u2019s no consensus the Global Trigger Tool can be used to make a nationwide estimate. He said the tool is better suited for use in individual hospitals.\n\nThe AHA is not attempting to come up with its own estimate, Demehin said.\n\nDr. David Mayer, the vice president of quality and safety at Maryland-based MedStar Health, said people can make arguments about how many patient deaths are hastened by poor hospital care, but that\u2019s not really the point. All the estimates, even on the low end, expose a crisis, he said.\n\n\u201cWay too many people are being harmed by unintentional medical error,\u201d Mayer said, \u201cand it needs to be corrected.\u201d\n\nSee how you can help ProPublica investigate patient safety and join our Facebook group on the topic.\n\nLike this story?
