They played up Denver\u2019s weather, robust downtown and fundraising that, despite trailing others\u2019 totals, relies on private dollars, with no public money. They downplayed the importance of legal pot sales.\n\nTheir message, during an airport news conference, was that Denver is the only option for a successful gathering, given its infrastructure and experience with the 2008 Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe arriving delegation was set to attend a reception Monday night at the posh, high-rise City Park South condo of Don and Linda Childears, a power couple in banking and philanthropy.\n\nThe schedule for Site Selection Committee members, Republican staffers and advisers is jam-packed. Venue visits, security and transportation briefings and other activities are set mostly for Tuesday.\n\nAfter a morning tour of the Pepsi Center, the potential convention hall, other activities include a working lunch at Coors Field and a tour of the Brown Palace Hotel.\n\nThe group leaves Wednesday for the last site visit, in Republican donor-rich Dallas, which some see as Denver\u2019s major competitor. The party is expected to settle on a host city in late summer or fall.\n\nOn Monday, local Republican staffers and volunteers met delegation members at their airport gates and treated them like VIPs.\n\nBut compared with some frills in Kansas City and Cleveland last week \u2014 including a motorcade escort, fireworks and celebrity appearances \u2014 Denver\u2019s treatment will be more spartan, bid leaders said. The only celebrity appearance planned is by Thunder, the Denver Broncos mascot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve pitched to the RNC the way we think they want it to be pitched,\u201d Coors said, \u201cand that is, this is a business meeting.\u201d\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "RNC 2016 visit: No frills, but Colorado GOP leaders draw contrasts", "title": "RNC 2016 visit: No frills, but Colorado GOP leaders draw contrasts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/09/rnc-2016-visit-no-frills-but-colorado-gop-leaders-draw-contrasts/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140609__rnc-bid-denver-2016p1-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140609__rnc-bid-denver-2016p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-09T18:17:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:33:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0690\"", "article_summary": "Pete Coors, the bid committee\u2019s chairman, and Colorado GOP chairman Ryan Call drew sharp contrasts with Dallas, Cleveland and Kansas City, Mo.\nOn Monday, local Republican staffers and volunteers met delegation members at their airport gates and treated them like VIPs.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve pitched to the RNC the way we think they want it to be pitched,\u201d Coors said, \u201cand that is, this is a business meeting.\u201dJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray\nThe schedule for Site Selection Committee members, Republican staffers and advisers is jam-packed.\nBid leaders for Denver\u2019s 2016 Republican National Convention threw some elbows at competitors Monday as they welcomed about two dozen site scouts to town."}
