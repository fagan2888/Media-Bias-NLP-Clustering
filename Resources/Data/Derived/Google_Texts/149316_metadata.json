So it\u2019s no wonder you may be finding it harder to find a doctor or to schedule an appointment with the one you have.\n\nWhat\u2019s fueling this problem? The baby boom generation pouring into older age, an aging physician workforce preparing to retire and an estimated 30 million Americans joining the ranks of the insured since enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\n\nWhat that means is that you may not be seeing a doctor at all the next time you go for health care.\n\n\u201cThe impending physician shortage is an opportunity to move to a health care model where the physician can be more of a quarterback on a team of health care providers, rather than being on the front lines,\u201d said Dr. David Gorstein, managing director of Health Innovations, a health care consulting firm in Charleston, S.C., focusing on new models of health care. It\u2019s time to look to other, more affordable and accessible settings, he said.\n\nHere are five options for addressing shortages and reining in costs.\n\nRetail clinics\n\nMaybe you have a scratchy throat and suspect another cold, but there\u2019s a two-week wait to see your doctor. Or you\u2019re out of town on business or are self-employed without health insurance.\n\nTypically located in pharmacies, groceries and \u201cbig box\u201d stores, these walk-in clinics began cropping up in 2000 and served more than 20 million patients in 2014, according to their trade association, the Convenient Care Association. To date, they number more than 1,800 in 40 states and Washington, D.C., offering lower-cost options for health services with transparent pricing, so consumers know what they are paying for.\n\nVisits typically range from $40 to $75 and address acute conditions, such as bronchitis and ear infections, as well as provide immunizations and physicals.\n\nUsually staffed by nurse practitioners, who are highly trained registered nurses, some incorporate pharmacists into ongoing care (which is particularly valuable in medication counseling for chronic diseases like diabetes or asthma). The clinics generally accept health insurance and can send a record of your visit to your primary-care physician.\n\n\u201cWhile the care can be excellent and the wait times and cost to the patient much less than emergency rooms, it\u2019s important to understand that walk-in clinics only treat a limited list of problems,\u201d said Dr. John W. Rowe, professor of health policy and aging at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. They should not be relied on as a source of ongoing care, he cautioned. Yet Dr. Don Goldmann, chief medical and scientific officer at the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Cambridge, Mass., sees their growth as proof that they fill important needs, providing \u201ceasier access to providers and quick, convenient care.\u201d\n\nUrgent-care centers\n\nAlthough they\u2019ve been around for decades, the more than 6,400 urgent-care centers in the U.S. are seeing an upswing in growth (from 8,000 to 9,300 since 2008), fueled by consumer frustration with long waits in emergency rooms and for appointments with primary-care physicians. These same-day walk-in clinics focus primarily on emergency medicine for acute (but less severe) medical problems. Typically staffed by trained and licensed physicians and medical assistants, registered nurses and X-ray technicians, nearly one-third of them are hospital owned and operated.\n\nMany offer evening and weekend hours, perform X-rays and some on-site lab tests (like urinalysis and pregnancy and strep tests) and provide procedures like suturing and casting, usually more economically and with less wait time than hospital emergency rooms. In some communities, they function as primary-care practices for some patients.\n\nOne study estimated that up to 27 percent of emergency room visits could be handled appropriately at retail clinics and urgent-care centers, offering cost savings of $4.4 billion per year.\n\nNurse-led practices\n\nNurse practitioners, nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives: You find them in every setting where patients receive care, including doctor\u2019s offices (where they often treat patients with more routine complaints, thus freeing up doctors), retail clinics, hospitals, nursing-care facilities, schools, clinics, freestanding practices and hospices.\n\nKnown as advanced-practice registered nurses, or APRNs, they are nationally certified registered nurses who have completed master\u2019s or doctoral programs and have advanced clinical training in patient-centered primary care. They can practice independently in 19 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nNurse practitioners, a subgroup of APRNs, perform a range of duties, from diagnosing and treating conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, infections and injuries to prescribing medications, promoting disease prevention and providing health education and counseling.\n\nAlthough U.S. nurse practitioners have been providing health care for half a century, the health care system now is seeing the benefits of patient access to nurse practitioner-provided health services, said Tay Kopanos, vice president, state government affairs for the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, who added that many patients are choosing NPs as their primary-care providers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates job growth for APRNs to rise by 31 percent between the years 2012 and 2022.\n\nCould physicians want to \u201cprotect their turf\u201d by limiting the practice of nurse practitioners? \u201cI would think they\u2019d welcome this arrangement,\u201d Gorstein said. \u201cThe doctor would see the interesting patients \u2014 the ones who have more than a minor ear infection or sore throat \u2014 and also would be getting referrals and income from a network of NPs. This is the Walgreens and CVS clinic model; while not perfect yet, it\u2019s on the right track.\u201d\n\nTeam-based care\n\nThe average length of a health care visit is less than 15 minutes, hardly enough time to address all of a patient\u2019s needs. That\u2019s why many practices are creating physician-led teams. Nurses, doctors, community health workers and other health care providers work together so the patient receives comprehensive care.\n\nThis approach can be more efficient and effective, allowing more time with the professional who has the right expertise, said Dr. Andrew Morris-Singer, president of Primary Care Progress, a grass-roots organization working to revitalize the primary-care system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing team-based care in large groups, solo practices, hospital-based clinics and community-based settings,\u201d he said. For instance, for some patients with diabetes, a pharmacist can set up a medication plan, while a registered dietitian can advise on proper nutrition guidelines, eliminating the need for physician visits.\n\nThe American Medical Association supports this approach to help meet the surge in demands on health care.\n\nPhysician assistants\n\nThe need for them emerged out of a shortage of primary-care physicians in the mid-1960s. Their training was based on the accelerated training doctors got during World War II. Now, nearly six decades later, physician assistants are part of team-based care and are found in doctor\u2019s offices, hospitals and other health care settings.\n\nThough they don\u2019t practice independently like nurse practitioners (most states require the presence of a supervising physician), they typically undergo 26 months of medical training, including about 2,000 hours of supervised clinical practice.\n\nApplicants to an accredited PA program must have a two-year minimum of college education, with a basic focus on science and behavioral science. Many students have worked as paramedics or registered nurses before pursuing their degrees. PA duties typically include performing physicals, taking patient histories, ordering/interpreting tests, developing treatment plans, prescribing medication and assisting in surgery.\n\nGeneral internist Dr. Jane Orient, a member of the American Association of Physicians and Surgeons, recommends looking for a PA \u201cwho has experience and has been practicing for a while, rather than someone fresh out of school.\u201d\n\nIn some states, constant on-site presence of a doctor is not always necessary; in many rural and underserved areas, a PA may be the only primary-care provider for miles. As the need for health care increases, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates, the number of PA jobs will increase by 39 percent between 2008 and 2018.\n\nTelemedicine\n\nOnce a way to connect rural or disabled residents with licensed physicians, this year about 800,000 remote visits will take place in urban areas as well, according to the American Telemedicine Association. \u201cPatients increasingly will want to take advantage of advances in mobile technology via their smartphones and remote monitoring,\u201d said Goldmann, who thinks that they have the potential to change the traditional face-to-face physician visits.\n\nFor patients, telemedicine offers convenience and time and money saved on travel. Many physicians favor this approach as a way to cut down on overhead and allow more time with patients.\n\nRemotely, they can diagnose a condition and prescribe medication or advise patients to visit a specialist or an emergency room.\n\nWhile some office-based physicians add these consultations to their offerings, it\u2019s more common for providers to practice telemedicine exclusively, either at call centers or telecommuting from their video-equipped home offices.\n\nRetail clinics are getting into the game, too: Rite Aid, the first to enter telemedicine, offers it at some of its stores in 22 states with its NowClinic program, allowing patients a 10-minute, $45 virtual visit with a physician from OptumHealth. (Walgreens and CVS have gotten into the telemedicine business, including mobile apps, too.) Some experts caution that this cannot and should not replace regular office visits, especially for more complex medical issues.\n\nDr. Ronald Weinstein, co-founder and director of the Arizona Telemedicine Program, said telemedicine state parity laws require private insurers to cover telemedicine-provided services that are comparable to in-person visits.\n\nConsidering that the number of states with those laws has doubled in the last three years, there may be a lot more physician-patient online chatter in the future.\n\nWhen you don\u2019t have a doctor\n\nIt\u2019s good to have an established relationship with a physician before you need one in an emergency situation, said Dr. Robert Wergin, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, but if you seek care beyond your own physician, or you don\u2019t have one, here are some tips:\n\n\u2014 Make the provider aware of your medical background and history.\n\n\u2014 Be prepared to describe your symptoms, their severity and duration.\n\n\u2014 Get a treatment plan at the end of your visit. Ask: What do I do if I don\u2019t get better? Are there other health concerns I should have?\n\n\u2014 Get a list of qualified physicians or specialists in your area.\n\n\u2014 Request that the report of your visit be sent to your personal physician (if you have one) to ensure coordination of care. You don\u2019t want important information to fall through the cracks.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Doctor shortage looms", "og": {"url": "http://www.gosanangelo.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-shortage-looms-ep-1394399629-361025291.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/life_health-doc-shortage_tb_27681656_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 443}, "type": "article", "description": "The Association of American Medical Colleges projects that the nation will face a shortage of 12,000 to 31,000 primary-care physicians by 2025.
