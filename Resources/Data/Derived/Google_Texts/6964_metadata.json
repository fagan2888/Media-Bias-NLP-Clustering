During its peak years in the late 1990s, the chain had over 1,300 locations.\n\nHarof said Davoudpour systematically improved integral parts of the brand, such as the menu, buffet bar and general layout.\n\n\u201cHe started from the bottom and worked his way up,\u201d she said.\n\nThe changes to the Shoney\u2019s brand focus on store appearances and the menu.\n\n\u201cThe brand achieved its place as an American icon with fresh quality food at a great value and we cannot wait to show it off to a new generation,\u201d Davoudpour said in a press release.\n\nShoney\u2019s will add chicken wings, chicken club sandwiches, chicken florentine, and grilled white fish to its menu, and remove turkey burgers and chicken salad sandwiches.\n\nHarof said the changes fit naturally into the Shoney\u2019s brand.\n\n\u201cReally our theme is American food with southern hospitality. That\u2019s who we\u2019ve always been,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of the changes come from customer requests, Harof said.\n\n\u201cEric Cleveland, our executive chef, keeps his pulse on trends, and we also listen to our customers. If they\u2019re on Facebook saying, \u2018I miss this\u2019 or \u2018Why don\u2019t you have that,\u2019 we\u2019re listening,\u201d she said.\n\nHarof said the restaurant will also focus on providing healthier options.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not freezer to fryer, it\u2019s fresh, great food,\u201d she said.\n\nThe property where Shoney\u2019s Columbia restaurant is located was sold in 2014 for $1 million to Steve Bostleman, who owns several other properties on Carmack Boulevard.\n\nBostleman said he had no comment on his plans for the property.\n\nHarof said the change in ownership will not affect Shoney\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no discussion. We\u2019ve been there and we plan on staying there,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Columbia location will be updated in the future.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate goal is for all restaurants to be remodeled,\u201d Harof said. \u201cNot all will be updated right away and it depends on demographics. We\u2019ll be going store by store.\u201d\n\nPlans for the redesign include a full bar and flat screen TVs.\n\n\u201cThe plan is to bring a whole new look to Shoney\u2019s. The colors are vibrant and it\u2019s modern,\u201d Harof said. \u201cOur customers love the new look, and we love the new look.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Southern institution, where teenagers used to circle their cars as a place to been seen on Friday and Saturday nights, is getting a new look.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "SAVANNA WALKER swalker@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "A Southern institution, where teenagers used to circle their cars as a place to been seen on Friday and Saturday nights, is getting a new look.", "title": "Shoney\u2019s restaurants schedule makeover", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/shoney-s-restaurants-schedule-makeover", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_EditedShoneys1_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/shoney-s-restaurants-schedule-makeover", "creator": "@thedailyherald", "card": "summary", "title": "Shoney\u2019s restaurants schedule makeover"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1459186", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1459186", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,Business,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-06T10:45:09-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "The changes to the Shoney\u2019s brand focus on store appearances and the menu.\nShoney\u2019s will revamp its menus and remodel its restaurants as part of a revitalization effort spearheaded by new Chairman and CEO David Davoudpour.\nShoney\u2019s had only 282 restaurants nationwide when Davoudpour bought the company.\nShoney\u2019s will add chicken wings, chicken club sandwiches, chicken florentine, and grilled white fish to its menu, and remove turkey burgers and chicken salad sandwiches.\nHarof said the changes fit naturally into the Shoney\u2019s brand."}
