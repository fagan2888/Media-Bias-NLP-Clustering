Republicans\u2019 job: make sure America knows.\n\nOne of these Clintons is not like the other.\n\nAs the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign behemoth gets seemingly closer to raising itself and beginning its plod toward its great Philadelphia coronation, Republicans are giddy at the prospect of being able to remind Americans about the return of Clintonism. They should stop it, now, for three reasons.\n\nFirst, while many Republicans never liked Bill Clinton and do not have universally positive memories of the mid- to late-90\u2019s, many Americans\u2014including conservatives and libertarians\u2014 look back on that period with fondness and nostalgia.\n\nSecond, too few Americans are or were then sufficiently politically engaged or news-addicted to remember the Clinton drama (aside from the Lewinsky scandal) that so many Republicans and media figures warn is already returning, much less treat it as a top priority.\n\nBut third, and most importantly, tying Hillary Clinton to her husband is an act of political malpractice that ignores the fact that on economic issues, she was\u2014during his presidency, during her 2008 campaign, and still today\u2014significantly to the left of him.\n\nFor whatever else one may say about him, Bill Clinton was and is a centrist. His presidency is remembered for the taming of the deficit, his advocacy for free trade, his signature of welfare reform, his legislation cutting the long-term capital gains tax rate, and perhaps most famously, his declaration that \u201cthe era of big government is over.\u201d\n\nThat would not have been true if Hillary had had it her way. And if she has her way now\u2014and if she makes it to the White House\u2014a very un-Bill-like big government will remain in the cards for some time. Leon Panetta, who served as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and then Chief of Staff during the earlier Clinton years, writes in his 2014 book that Hillary Clinton \u201cpicked at [the Clinton administration\u2019s] economic program\u201d of deficit reduction, \u201casking why there wasn\u2019t more room for health care reform or other initiatives.\u201d Panetta apparently felt that such \u201cinitiatives\u201d would have proved too expensive, and would have undermined efforts to slash the deficit.\n\nMoreover, after Bill Clinton passed his first budget, Hillary apparently opposed treating welfare reform as the next priority, again pushing for health care reform. Panetta also details this in his book, and it is significant given what we know about Hillary Clinton\u2019s views on health care.\n\nHer Hillarycare proposal, as it was dubbed in the 90\u2019s, was a textbook example of government overreach that proved politically unviable. Obamacare, which remains loathed by so many across America, much more closely resembles the version of health care reform that Hillary Clinton advocated during her 2008 presidential run than that pushed by then-candidate Obama.\n\nIt may surprise those who have recently joined the political game to know that candidate Obama\u2019s plan was decidedly smaller-government and less interventionist than Clinton\u2019s, and that his was swapped for hers once Obama entered the White House. But that is a fact that cannot be avoided, though Hillaryland may in due course try to convince voters otherwise.\n\nDuring Hillary\u2019s failed 2008 presidential run, she explicitly pledged to increase the federal government\u2019s role in the economy, presenting a contrast against her husband\u2019s record and approach. In a late January 2008 interview with The New York Times, she talked up an \u201ceffective, vigorous government.\u201d She also appeared dismissive of opposition to confiscatory taxation, speaking of the \u201cnostalgia and pride\u201d with which Americans look back on the period just after World War II, when the highest marginal tax rates ran above 90 percent.\n\nAs of 2007, Hillary Clinton was on record opposing future free trade agreements and calling for an overhaul of NAFTA, one of Bill Clinton\u2019s signature accomplishments. In a November 2007 CNN debate in Las Vegas, she called NAFTA a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nThis was interesting, given that even as Hillary had begun trashing the agreement and was set to continue to do so, Bill confirmed that he still supported it, and said in a September 2007 interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that knowing everything he knew then, he would still have tried to pass it. Contrary to Hillary\u2019s claims, Bill said, NAFTA had not hurt American workers.\n\nMore recently, Hillary and Bill have appeared to disagree over the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2012, the State Department, then headed by Hillary, \u201crecommended to President Obama that the presidential permit for the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline be denied and that at this time, the TransCanada Keystone XL Pipeline be determined not to serve the national interest.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Bill Clinton went on record saying of Keystone XL that \u201cI think we should embrace it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Hillary Clinton, u.s. poli, Bill Clinton, 2016 Election", "publicationDate": 201504051045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton, US Politics, Bill Clinton, 2016 Election", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Dont Be Fooled: Hillary Is Way to Bills Left!", "tags": "entity:person/hillary_clinton,topic:politics,entity:person/bill_clinton,obsessional:2016-election", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "She\u2019ll try to wrap herself in her husband\u2019s legacy, but the record shows she\u2019s way to his left.
