His interests are unabashedly broad \u2014 from Hegel to psychoanalysis to film and pop culture. And his topics are unapologetically grand: the future of global capitalism; the nature of ideology; the experience of reality.\n\n\u017di\u017eek has written more than 60 books, and starred in a number of documentaries. In \u201cTrouble in Paradise\u201d \u2014 recently released in the United States \u2014 \u017di\u017eek searches out ways to \u201cthink beyond capitalism and liberal democracy as the ultimate framework of our lives.\u201d His principal subject is the melding of capitalism with various forms of authoritarianism \u2014 and the kinds of discontent that may emerge from within that melding. In typical \u017di\u017eek style, the book also includes an exegesis of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises,\u201d extended meditations on North Korea and dozens of jokes.\n\nI reached \u017di\u017eek by phone at his home in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. Over the course of two conversations, we spoke about Bernie Sanders, televangelists and why \u017di\u017eek wants to move to Alaska.\n\nIn \u201cTrouble in Paradise,\u201d you\u2019re talking about revolution \u2014 about an \u201cauthentic emancipatory process.\u201d Where is this going to come from?\n\nMaybe it will not come. I\u2019m very clear about this, and rather a pessimist.\n\nReally?\n\nI don\u2019t see any historical guarantee that some big revolutionary event will happen. The only thing I\u2019m certain of is that if nothing happens, we are slowly approaching \u2014 well, if not a global catastrophe, then a very sad society. Much more authoritarian, with new inner apartheids clearly divided into those who are in and those who are out.\n\nOkay, maybe I should have asked, where would this change come from, if it were to emerge?\n\nIt\u2019s not a specific place. I see potential spaces of tensions. For example, you have literally hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of students in Europe who are doing their studies. And they\u2019re well aware that they don\u2019t even have a chance of getting a job.\n\nSo this is one stratum. Then I think more and more, this problem of Europe \u2014 should there be a wall? Should those outside Europe \u2014 immigrants, refugees \u2014 be allowed to enter Europe? I\u2019m not a utopian here. I\u2019m not a stupid leftist liberal who is saying, \u201cOh, you know, horror, people are drowning in the Mediterranean from Africa, we should open our gates to them.\u201d No, that\u2019s stupidity. If Europe totally opens its borders, you would have in half a year a populist anti-immigrant revolution. I\u2019m just saying this problem will grow \u2014 those who are in, those who are out.\n\nThere does seem to be a kind of upheaval underway \u2014\n\n\u2014 I don\u2019t have too high hopes. Like those old, stupid, pseudo-Marxists who claim, \u201cWe see the beginning, we just have to wait. The crowds, masses will organize themselves.\u201d No, you can\u2019t beat global capitalism in this old-fashioned way.\n\nYou talk about this idea of \u201ccapitalism with Asian values,\u201d which challenges the old idea that capitalism and democracy are the only possible partners.\n\nIt\u2019s not only this, that we will get more states like China and Singapore, and so on \u2014 that is to say, authoritarian capitalism. I think that even in the West where we do have some kind of democracy \u2014 and I do acknowledge it\u2019s a real achievement, definitely better than some dictatorial regime \u2014 it\u2019s becoming more and more relevant.\n\nThat\u2019s for me \u2014 I\u2019m very na\u00efve here \u2014 the importance of all these agreements, TiSA and so on. These are agreements which will determine the basic coordinates of our economic and social life, flux of capital money, flux of information for decades to come. And it\u2019s done in secret; nobody controls it. You know, this is where we are moving. The big decisions are done in top secret. They are not even debated. And what are politicians doing? They\u2019re fighting cultural wars, [while] real big economic decisions are simply made by experts in shadows, and so on and so on.\n\nDo you think there are cases where voters have genuine options?\n\nMy ironic remark would be here that when voters really do have a choice, it\u2019s usually perceived as a crisis of democracy.\n\nOK.\n\nFor example, Greek voters had a kind of a choice at least, in voting for Syriza or against. That\u2019s why everyone was in a panic.\n\nIn Europe, comments along these lines are more and more open. I think I quoted somewhere a comment in the \u201cFinancial Times\u201d where a guy says something like, \u201cEurope\u2019s biggest problems are voters.\u201d Like they don\u2019t really understand the necessity of certain decisions, and so on. If this is true, this means that democracy, that how shall I put it? It means that we are basically returning to pre-democratic times, in the sense of majority cannot be trusted.\n\nWe live really in an era of ideology. Neoliberalism, it\u2019s a myth. The role of state apparatuses, state interventions in economy \u2014 they are more and more important. I saw a report on the state of Mali in Central Africa. They produce excellent cotton, and the price, of course, is low. They cannot make or break through \u2014 why not? Because United States, in subsidizing their own cotton farmers producing cotton, spends more money for helping their cotton farmers than the entire state budget of Mali.\n\nI read a wonderful interview on CNN, years ago, with Mali\u2019s Finance Minister, who said, \u201cPlease, we don\u2019t need any socialist help. Give the market a chance. Don\u2019t unfairly support your farmers, and Mali is saved economically.\u201d And it was incredible, how the United States Ambassador in Mali answered this. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as that, there is also corruption, Mali, blah, blah, blah.\u201d [The ambassador] was totally bullshitting. But I think that\u2019s the reality of global capitalism. Everyone is violating the rules.\n\nOr everyone is talking about one set of rules, but actually following another.\n\nYou have certain rules, but you are never really expected to follow those rules, you know. There are rules which you are expected to violate. And, a situation that interests me even more \u2014 there are not only things which are prohibited, but you are expected silently to do it, nonetheless.\n\nIt\u2019s very culturally specific up to the everyday level. For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a rich guy, and I\u2019m a poor guy. I invite you out to dinner. In Europe at least, it\u2019s custom that when the bill arrives, although we both know that I will pay, you have to pretend, \u201cNo, no, let me pay,\u201d and so on. We have to go through this performance, although we absolutely both know exactly what will happen, that I will pay.\n\nThis seems like a basic premise in a lot of ethnographic research.\n\nLet me tell you another horror story. Don\u2019t you have, now, in the United States this madness with \u201cyes means yes\u201d? The idea is that when two people, if they want to have sex, it\u2019s not enough if there is no no. There must be an affirmative \u201cyes.\u201d And even then, okay, a little bit ironically, they have those contract papers, or you take a photo, or whatever.\n\nThe point is not just to make fun of this, but this is exactly not how sexual seduction works. A little bit of a chauvinist example: You are seducing a lady. She would like to do it. But if you ask her openly, \u201cOkay, can I fuck you now?\u201d it would be too humiliating for her. Now I\u2019m not saying this means that we can rape, or whatever. I\u2019m just saying that things are much more subtle here.\n\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s quite what those rules and guidelines are intended to \u2026 okay, I see what you\u2019re saying. We have this implicit back-and-forth.\n\nNo, no, no \u2014 let me be specific here. I\u2019m extremely brutal against rape, sexual exploitation and so on. I\u2019m just saying that flirting, seduction and all this is structured in such a way that it precisely resists this clear translation into explicit rules.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what happens in the cotton trade between Mali and the United States, yes? Instead of the United States explicitly saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to use protectionist trade policies and screw you over,\u201d there\u2019s a delicate back-and-forth through which this power relationship gets expressed.\n\nIn contrast to sex, in a market economy, we should push a little bit more towards explicit rules. If you play that game in [the] economy, it simply means you ignore certain very brutal power relations.\n\nFor the first time in decades, the United States has a competitive socialist candidate for president. Do you think Bernie Sanders is providing a genuine critique of the economic and political system?\n\nOf course I sympathize with him. But I\u2019m a pessimist here. Okay, he can play a positive role, blah, blah, blah. But I don\u2019t see the beginning of something that will amount to a real, serious change. Maybe one has to begin with small things. For example, as I always emphasize also in my book, I still have some sympathy for Obama. I don\u2019t buy that leftist stuff, you know, Obama betrayed the Left. What did they expect, that Obama will introduce communism into the United States, or what? But what I like about Obama, which for me is a good operation, you remember, universal healthcare. He touched a very important point of American ideology.\n\nWhich was what?\n\nObviously, because certain Republicans even wanted to bring him to the Supreme Court. What I\u2019m saying is that this is how we should proceed. Don\u2019t say \u201cbig revolution.\u201d You just select some specific point which in itself may appear a very modest one. It\u2019s nothing special. You cannot accuse Obama of communism, my god. Canada has [universal healthcare], most of Western Europe has it. But in American conditions, this means, obviously, something quite strong. And I think this is what we should be doing today. Not dream about big revolution, or whatever, but pick out the dramatic points of each system.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon exclusive q-and-a: \"When voters really do have a choice, it\u2019s usually perceived as a crisis of democracy\"", "author": "Michael Schulson", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon exclusive q-and-a: \"When voters really do have a choice, it\u2019s usually perceived as a crisis of democracy\"", "title": "Slavoj \u017di\u017eek on Obama, Bernie, sex and democracy: \u201cThat\u2019s the reality of global capitalism.
