The Rockies are an embarrassment to the city of Denver and the state of Colorado. Nothing changes. Every year it’s the same old same old: the pitching is deplorable, the vaunted offense fails to realize its potential, the losses mount and the team sinks to the bottom of the standings. Rocktober was an anomaly, an aberration, perhaps a gift to the incomprehensibly loyal Todd Helton from the baseball gods.

I’ve been an ardent fan since the Rockies’ inception. I am one of 10 people who divvy up season tickets each spring. I spend my money on eight games only to be heartbroken — sickened — watching each sad collapse on the field. I don’t know who to point a finger at. Ownership, management, the altitude, the fans who continue to pour into Coors Field regardless of the quality of product therein?

The Rockies recently suffered 11 consecutive losses. I just don’t know how long I’m expected to continue holding out hope for something different.

David Lampert, Denver
