It was a scare tactic thought up by an unknown source. This is very similar to death panels and other rumors that use the complex nature of the law to twist words.\n\nSnopes.com said:\n\nNothing in any of those unpassed bills mandated that anyone be implanted with any type of microchip or RFID-based device, for any reason. The passages quoted above reference a section of the legislation that simply called for the creation of a registry which would allow the Department of Health and Human Services to collect data about medical devices \"used in or on a patient\" (such as pacemakers or hip replacements) for purposes that included tracking the effectiveness of such devices and facilitating the distribution of manufacturer recall notices.\n\nThe original fake RFID chip story is from three months ago, but the new spate of stories derived from the fake site appear to come after two follow-up stories about an \u201cRFID mascot\u201d beginning a nationwide tour \u201cto help alleviate children\u2019s fears of implantation.\u201d It referred to the mascot as \u201cChippie the RFID.\u201d\n\nThe story quoted a fake person called Doug Walker:\n\n\u201c\u2019It felt like a pinch,\u2019 explained Walker who attended a recent Chippie seminar a Carbon County, Wyoming school.\n\nIn other news, Establishment Labs has started marketing breast implants with an (RFID) chip built in. While this may concern women about the privacy issues, the company claims the RFID chip will provide information about the \"Ergonomix breast implant\" to a patient and her doctor years later.\n\nLike what you\u2019ve read?
