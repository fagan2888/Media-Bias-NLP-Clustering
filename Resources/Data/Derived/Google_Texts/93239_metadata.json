Dannel P. Malloy\u2019s new biennial budget plan due in just eight days, the Connecticut Hospital Association proposed this week phasing out the provider tax over the next five years.\n\n\u201cThe hospital tax costs Connecticut hospitals $254 million every year,\u201d CHA spokeswoman Michele Sharp said Monday. \u201cIt means they must provide care with even fewer resources\u201d and make fewer investments in staff, medical equipment and other infrastructure.\n\nWhen Malloy first proposed the provider tax in 2011, it was pitched only as a means to secure more federal aid.\n\nConnecticut would collect $350 million per year from hospitals. In return, it would send $400 million back to the industry.\n\nWhy the back-and-forth exercise?\n\nConnecticut then could take advantage of federal Medicaid rules and secure 50 percent reimbursement on that $400 million expenditure.\n\nSo with $350 million in tax receipts and a $200 million payment from Washington, D.C., the state budget came out ahead, even after giving $400 million to hospitals.\n\nThe industry, which paid in $350 million, also came out slightly ahead \u2013 but just for one year.\n\nAfter the 2011-12 fiscal year, Malloy and the legislature whittled down payments to hospitals \u2013 a move that also cost Connecticut more funding from Washington.\n\nHospitals still pay in $350 million this year, but get just $96 million back.\n\nEven with improved federal reimbursement rates \u2013 which rose to 70 percent under Obamacare \u2013 Connecticut\u2019s take from Washington this year is about $67 million. It would be $280 million if hospitals still received the state assistance they got back in 2011-12.\n\nWith the legislature\u2019s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis projecting a hefty, $1,3 billion deficit built into the next fiscal year, and a $1.4 billion gap in 2016-17, legislators from both parties have expressed fears Malloy will propose canceling the final $96 million hospitals still receive.\n\nThe governor\u2019s budget office said Tuesday it would not release details of the spending plan Malloy will unveil on Feb. 18.\n\nBut legislators have noticed some disturbing trends since the state began converting the tax-in-name-only into an actual levy on hospitals.\n\nAccording to the most recent statistics, the industry had 55,130 full-time equivalent positions in 2013, down 60 from the prior year. And that\u2019s despite modest improvements in Connecticut\u2019s overall economy during that period.\n\nSharp said that the loss of $254 million to the provider tax each year represents about $123 for every patient with commercial insurance served in Connecticut hospitals.\n\nSharp added that hospital officials \u201cremain hopeful and ready to work with\u201d the governor and the legislature in hopes of crafting a solution to bolster the industry.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/02/10/hospitals-seek-to-phase-out-a-growing-provider-tax/", "news_keywords": "Budget/Economy, Health Care, CHA, Connecticut Hospital Association, Connecticut state budget, deficit, Gov.
