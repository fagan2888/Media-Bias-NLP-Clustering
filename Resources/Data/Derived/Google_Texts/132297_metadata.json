Saturday night at the Prudential Center, Erik Johnson was rewarded with a goal on a shot that would have seemed to have little chance of going in.\n\nWhile the Avs of the early season might have looked for a better scoring chance, Johnson just figured \u201cWhat the heck?\u201d and put a wrist shot at the pads of Devils goalie Cory Schneider that somehow sneaked through to tie the score. The Avs went on to win 3-2 over the Devils. Matt Duchene\u2019s second-chance rebound putback goal with 2:53 to play broke the tie, and the Avs killed off a late Devils power play to get one of their most satisfying wins of the season.\n\nA four-game road trip that started badly finished 2-2, and the Avs are now 6-8-5.\n\n\u201cI like to think the game is fair. If you play like the way we did, you\u2019re going to get a bounce, and that was one where you just shoot on net and hope for the best,\u201d said Johnson, who played a game-high 30 minutes, 25 seconds and had a plus-2 rating. \u201cIt trickled through. We\u2019ve been a little bit too fancy lately, a little too perimeter on the first part of the road trip. But we\u2019ve been emphasizing just shooting more pucks lately and see what happens.\u201d\n\nThings looked bad for the Avalanche after Eric Gelinas\u2019 seeing-eye shot from the half boards by the Colorado bench found its way past a screened Semyon Varla- mov, giving New Jersey a 2-1 lead at 8:21 of the third. But the Avs kept their composure, with Varlamov keeping it a one-goal game with two nice saves, then got the fortunate goal from Johnson.\n\nThen came the game-winner.\n\nPHOTOS: Avalanche defeat Devils, 3-2\n\nIt all started after the Devils made a bad line change, partly because of soft play on the puck by longtime NHL star Jaromir Jagr as he skated to the bench. That opened up a break-in featuring Duchene, Alex Tanguay and Ryan O\u2019Reilly. It was finished off when Duchene got the rebound of his own shot back to him and beat Schneider from the short side.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted that game very badly,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got four days off now, where we\u2019re not practicing for the next two days, so this was something we really wanted to get before going back home. (Tanguay) almost scored right before there, and (O\u2019Reilly) was doing what he was supposed to be doing, tying up a man behind the net. I was just fortunate to get that second chance on the shot.\u201d\n\nVarlamov was excellent in net for the Avs, making 23 saves.\n\n\u201cI thought we had a really good road trip, playing .500 hockey,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, obviously we would like to be a little better than this, but if you\u2019re looking at the teams we were playing, we\u2019re very happy with those last two wins.\u201d\n\nSaid Tanguay: \u201cWe\u2019re desperate. We know we\u2019re still in a hole, and we have to get back in the pile with the rest of the teams in the playoff hunt as soon as possible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Avs rally late in third to defeat New Jersey Devils", "title": "Colorado Avs rally late in third to defeat New Jersey Devils", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/15/colorado-avs-rally-late-in-third-to-defeat-new-jersey-devils/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141115__avs-goalp1.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141115__avs-goalp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-15T19:40:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T14:31:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI thought we had a really good road trip, playing .500 hockey,\u201d he said.\nA four-game road trip that started badly finished 2-2, and the Avs are now 6-8-5.\nWe\u2019ve been a little bit too fancy lately, a little too perimeter on the first part of the road trip.\nThe Avs went on to win 3-2 over the Devils.\nMatt Duchene\u2019s second-chance rebound putback goal with 2:53 to play broke the tie, and the Avs killed off a late Devils power play to get one of their most satisfying wins of the season."}
