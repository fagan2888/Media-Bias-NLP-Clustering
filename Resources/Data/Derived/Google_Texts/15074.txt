Workers at the Cargill Meat Solutions plant in Fort Morgan have rejected a new contract proposal they say offered “drastically slashed” health care benefits and “inadequate” wage increases.

The Teamsters Local Union 455, which represents more than 1,700 employees at the meatpacking plant, said 98 percent of the Cargill workers voted to reject the company’s proposal this week.

“Cargill needs to recognize that it can’t expect its workers to subsist on low wages and pay a premium for insufficient health care,” Local 455 secretary-treasurer Steve Vairma said in a statement. “It is time for Cargill to do the right thing and negotiate a contract that addresses the concerns of this workforce.”

The parties will reopen contract negotiations May 12 with the assistance of a federal mediator, according to the union.

A Cargill spokeswoman declined to comment Friday on the ongoing contract negotiations.

For the agribusiness giant, the contract vote is the latest in the series of conflicts with its Fort Morgan workforce.

In December, the company fired about 150 second-shift workers during a dispute over alleged changes to the plant’s workplace prayer policy.

Since then, lawyers representing about 130 Cargill workers have filed complaints with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission accusing the company of religious discrimination.

The majority of the fired workers were Somali Muslims.
