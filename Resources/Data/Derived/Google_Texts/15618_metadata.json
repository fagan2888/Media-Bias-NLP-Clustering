Reto Berra has been involved in an Avalanche \u201cgoaltending controversy\u201d before. This time, though, it\u2019s because the big Swiss goalie is playing well, not because \u2014 as happened last season \u2014 the Avs had so little confidence in him, they acted afraid to play him.\n\nBerra\u2019s shutout streak ended at 203 minutes, 2 seconds when Los Angeles\u2019 Marian Gaborik scored late in the first period, and the Avalanche\u2019s backup goalie finished with 38 saves and had a strong game again as Colorado fell 2-1 to the Kings on Sunday night at the Staples Center.\n\nBerra had shutouts in his two previous starts, against Winnipeg last April and at Anaheim on Friday, and they were sandwiched around a 22-minute scoreless stint in relief of the yanked Sem yon Varlamov against Boston on Wednesday.\n\nAn unattended Gaborik scored from the slot at 13:38 of the first period, ending a Kings siege.\n\nBut after Matt Duchene\u2019s first goal of the season tied it at 15:57 of the second, a bad Erik Johnson pass led to a Kings breakaway, and Tyler Toffoli beat Berra to make it 2-1 only 23 seconds after Duchene\u2019s power-play score.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the way it stayed.\n\nThe Kings extended their recent mastery of the Avalanche, improving to 8-0-1 in the last nine regular-season meetings with Colorado.\n\nThe difference-making play was when Johnson tried to pass across to his defensive partner, Francois Beauchemin, but Toffoli intercepted it and was off to the races.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, for sure,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a play I have to know better on. It cost us the game, bottom line. It wasn\u2019t the first time. It won\u2019t be the last. It\u2019s unfortunate, but you have to move on. When you try to make plays with the puck sometimes, that happens. Yeah, definitely my fault, and it was the reason we lost.\n\n\u201cReto\u2019s playing great. He deserved a better fate for sure. It\u2019s tough to put him in that position there in a tight game, but he\u2019s playing awesome.\u201d\n\nAvalanche coach Patrick Roy said of Johnson\u2019s miscue: \u201cCome on, it\u2019s a long year. Those things happen. We had our chances to get back in that game. We need to stick together here. (The Kings) played really well, and they had a lot of good chances.\u201d\n\nRoy said Berra \u201cwas very good. He made some key saves at key moments in the game. For some reason, he\u2019s really sound in front of his net and he seems really in control. It\u2019s pretty easy for him right now.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche also failed to take advantage of a 48-second 5-on-3 advantage in the third period, and Kings goalie Jonathan Quick finished with 22 saves. He made a big save on Gabe Landeskog during the stretch.\n\n\u201cThat was certainly a key moment in the game,\u201d Roy said.\n\nBoth teams were short a forward for much of the game after the Avalanche\u2019s Cody McLeod and the Kings\u2019 Andy Andreoff drew game misconducts at 2:44 of the second period. Their fight came moments after an altercation between Colorado\u2019s Jack Skille and Los Angeles\u2019 Jordan Nolan ended during the same stoppage.\n\nWith defenseman Tyson Barrie beginning his three-game NHL suspension, Roy went with veteran Brad Stuart \u2014 a healthy scratch in three of the first four games \u2014 as Barrie\u2019s replacement in the lineup. At even strength, Stuart was paired again with Nate Holden.\n\nColorado is carrying eight healthy defensemen on the roster, and Brandon Gormley, acquired from Arizona in the offseason, still hasn\u2019t played.\n\nBefore the game, Roy said going with Gormley as Barrie\u2019s replacement \u201cwas part of our conversation. But Brad is a veteran \u2026 and I wanted to give him a good chance (Sunday). This is a big team here.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche has the next two games at home, against Carolina on Wednesday and Columbus on Saturday.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche, with Reto Berra in net, falls to Kings in Los Angeles", "title": "Avalanche, with Reto Berra in net, falls to Kings in Los Angeles", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/18/avalanche-with-reto-berra-in-net-falls-to-kings-in-los-angeles/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151018__avs-reto-berrap1.jpg", "height": 422}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151018__avs-reto-berrap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-18T22:46:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T10:56:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ad1\"", "article_summary": "Before the game, Roy said going with Gormley as Barrie\u2019s replacement \u201cwas part of our conversation.\n\u201cThat was certainly a key moment in the game,\u201d Roy said.\n(The Kings) played really well, and they had a lot of good chances.\u201dRoy said Berra \u201cwas very good.\nThe Kings extended their recent mastery of the Avalanche, improving to 8-0-1 in the last nine regular-season meetings with Colorado.\nAn unattended Gaborik scored from the slot at 13:38 of the first period, ending a Kings siege."}
