When the conversation turned to IT best practices, I asked for a show of hands of how many systems were on a single electronic medical record across the enterprise \u2013 acute, post-acute and physician services.\n\nNo one raised their hand.\n\nI also asked how they were managing the health of their attributed beneficiaries. All said they were waiting for adjudicated claims data from CMS. Of the 12, three were also using billing data on a limited basis to get closer to real-time risk stratification for some initiatives. Only one was in the early stages of experimenting with near real-time data from providers.\n\nGiven the potential of real-time clinical data, that\u2019s unfortunate.\n\nClinical data (such as data from physician office and hospital-based EMRs) has the potential for helping those involved in population health take a large step forward. While adjudicated claims data (and to a lesser degree billing data) have a significant lag to them, clinical data is closer to real-time, allowing for interventions while the patient is in need. And while billing and claims data provide excellent information, they lack the detail of the medical record.\n\nAnd the benefits aren\u2019t just clinical. From an administrative viewpoint, clinical data provides the potential for a number of opportunities, such as:\n\nGreater alignment of physician and system incentives through more customized and less labor intensive performance metrics\n\nReduction of redundant diagnostics\n\nIdentification of gaps in HCC capture\n\nBetter risk stratification of populations (such as the identification of potential substance abuse that may not be reflected in the available claims data)\n\nOf course clinical data isn\u2019t perfect. It lacks the ability to see all sites of care the way adjudicated claims data can. Even within an integrated health system, disjointed systems may not communicate and there may be the need to reach into multiple systems. And there\u2019s little commonality or standardization of how the records are organized.\n\nPart of why clinical records are valuable is because of the notes and observations a physician may have made that aren\u2019t reflected in the diagnosis codes. Mining the record continues to be a daunting task. Billing data and adjudicated claims may not be as rich. But they\u2019re much more geared toward mining.\n\nRather than thinking of clinical data and claims data separately, there\u2019s more power in using them together. No single data source can identify all potential patients. So using multiple sources is a more accurate picture of the population\u2019s health.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of value to be gained from billing and adjudicated claims data. It just takes the right people and processes to deliver that value.\n\nThis post appeared first at Action for Better Healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/clinical-and-claims-data-key-population-health", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/secure%20patient%20data%20privacy.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Clinical data has the potential for helping those involved in population health take a large step forward.
