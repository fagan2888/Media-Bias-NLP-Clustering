Meanwhile, 55% of all workers comp cases are treated on the same day as the injury and 80% are seen within three days.\n\n\u201cSome of the difference between trauma cases and all cases may be due to the increased ambiguity in assigning date of injury for the nontrauma cases,\u201d said NCCI, noting that it can't measure the time from when care was initially sought to when it was first provided.\n\nGender is another factor included in the study, which states that injured male workers are treated sooner than injured female workers in trauma cases, as workers in more risky occupations are predominantly male.\n\nFor example, 30% of male injuries are for \u201crelatively quicker-to-treat open wounds\u201d compared with 19% of female injuries, according to the study. And 27% of male injuries are for \u201crelatively slower-to-treat strains and sprains\u201d compared with 35% of female injuries.\n\nThe type of health care provider also plays a role, as injured workers who see a network physical or occupational therapist on the first date of service start their therapy \u201csomewhat sooner \u2026 suggesting perhaps that in-network providers put a higher priority on a timely recovery of function,\u201d according to the study.\n\n\u201cGiven all the influences that interact and affect the time to treatment, it will be difficult \u2014 if even possible \u2014 to isolate the impact of the ACA,\u201d NCCI said, adding that educating injured employees about accessing the workers comp system is increasingly important in a changing health care environment.\n\nTo conduct the study, NCCI looked at medical-only and lost time claims occurring between July 1, 2010, and Dec. 31, 2012, that had at least one medical treatment within 360 days of the date of injury.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "Identifying the effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on workers compensation systems is a challenge, with many factors influencing the time between injury and treatment, according to a new study released Monday by the National Council on Compensation Insurance Inc.While...", "title": "Effects of health reform on workers comp sector masked by other factors - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20160111/NEWS08/160119975", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20160111/NEWS08/160119975/AR/0/health-care-reform-and-workers-comp.jpg", "type": "article"}, "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "description": "Identifying the effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on workers compensation systems is a challenge, with many factors influencing the time between injury and treatment, according to a new study released Monday by the National Council on Compensation Insurance Inc.While...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Effects of health reform on workers comp sector masked by other factors - Business Insurance"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, 55% of all workers comp cases are treated on the same day as the injury and 80% are seen within three days.\nGender is another factor included in the study, which states that injured male workers are treated sooner than injured female workers in trauma cases, as workers in more risky occupations are predominantly male.\nWhile \u201cthe ACA's near-term impact on how (workers comp) cases access medical care remains uncertain,\u201d provider availability appears to play a secondary role to claimant behavior in driving the time to treatment, the Boca Raton, Florida-based workers comp ratings and research organization said in the study.\nFor example, 30% of male injuries are for \u201crelatively quicker-to-treat open wounds\u201d compared with 19% of female injuries, according to the study.\nIdentifying the effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on workers compensation systems is a challenge, with many factors influencing the time between injury and treatment, according to a new study released Monday by the National Council on Compensation Insurance Inc."}
