To make it to the top, however, he'll have to do one thing: Make \u201cJeb Bush\u201d disappear.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nAs it stands, the former Florida governor is anathema to the rank and file of the Republican Party. This weekend, in the key presidential primary state of New Hampshire, conservative activists gathered to listen and judge a handful of presidential aspirants, from all but official candidates like Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz to people flirting with a run like Donald Trump and Mike Huckabee.\n\nEach speaker made his pitch. Paul focused on civil liberties and promised to expand the GOP tent with a hands-off approach to gay marriage and other issues. Cruz billed himself as an avatar of conservative orthodoxy\u2014an economic conservative, a social conservative, and a national security conservative. Huckabee indulged in right-wing hyperbole\u2014\u201cMy gosh, I\u2019m beginning to think that there\u2019s more freedom in North Korea sometimes than there is in the United States\u201d\u2014and Donald Trump said Donald Trump things.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut insofar that there was a rhetorical constant, it was open disdain for Jeb Bush, as candidates responded to his sympathy for undocumented immigrants and praise for federal education standards. \u201cGet rid of Common Core and replace it with common sense!\u201d said Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, taking a swipe at Bush\u2019s support for the reformed curriculum standards. \u201cI think what Jeb was trying to say was that many people come to the United States to look for opportunity,\u201d said Huckabee, commenting on Bush\u2019s support for comprehensive immigration reform. \u201cI don't personally support amnesty. I think we ought to have a secure border.\u201d\n\nTrump also riffed on Bush\u2019s immigration comments, mocking the notion that immigrants come to the United States out of \u201clove.\u201d \u201c[T]hat\u2019s one I've never heard of before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI've heard money, I've heard this, I've heard sex, I've heard everything! The one thing I never heard of was love. I understand what he's saying, but, you know, it's out there, I'll tell you.\u201d More importantly, the mere mention of Bush\u2019s name drew boos from the crowd, who oppose the former governor\u2019s immigration leniency.\n\nThe standard take is that Bush\u2019s weak support among grassroots conservatives is nearly fatal for his presidential chances, and there\u2019s no doubt that it puts him at a disadvantage. Bush has been out of the game for so long that he\u2019s out of step with the base of the party. They want a full-scale assault on the welfare state, not compassion or empathy.\n\nThen again, this is an old problem. The Republican Party has a long history of nominating candidates who anger and enrage the base. In 1996 there was Bob Dole, in 2008 there was John McCain, and in 2012\u2014after three years of anti-establishment, Tea Party rage\u2014Republicans nominated Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts who pioneered universal health insurance for his state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nYes, the actual energy of the party was with Romney\u2019s competitors, from Texas Gov. Rick Perry to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. But Romney was the establishment choice. In addition to the cash and organization this provides, it sends a powerful message to the party writ large: \u201cYou may not agree with Romney on every choice, but we believe he could win the presidency.\u201d The imprimatur of the GOP\u2019s donor class may not sway every activist and Republican primary voter, but it\u2019s a huge asset to whoever has it and almost guarantees the nomination.\n\nFor Jeb Bush to win, he may have to do more than bury his former political persona\u2014he may have to bury the Bush name.\n\nIf Jeb Bush has anything on his side right now, it\u2019s this\u2014the establishment stamp of approval. Just read this Washington Post story from late last month, where a parade of Republican donors and officials showed their enthusiasm for a Bush candidacy. Yes, there are still arguments and divisions among Republican elites, but one thing is clear: If Bush steps into the ring, he\u2019ll begin the race with key victories in the \u201cinvisible primary,\u201d where candidates fight to win influence and endorsements from the party\u2019s most moneyed supporters.\n\nEven still, this doesn\u2019t make the grassroots irrelevant as much as it changes the nature of the challenge. No, the Republican base isn\u2019t strong or influential enough to drive a candidate to the nomination or to kill the candidacy of someone with establishment support. What it can do, however, is extract concessions in the form of policy promises and rhetorical strategies. This is what happened to Mitt Romney. Strong elite backing made him the favorite for the nomination, but he still had to appeal to rank-and-file Republican voters. After all, you still need to win primaries. So, he disavowed his previous self, condemning the Affordable Care Act as an abomination of public policy and dashing to the right on immigration. He gave his full commitment to the priorities of the Republican base, which\u2014along with the help of the establishment\u2014won him the nomination. In other words, for Mitt Romney the Republican presidential candidate to become Mitt Romney the Republican presidential nominee, he had to go back in time and effectively destroy Mitt Romney, the moderate Massachusetts governor.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush, former Florida governor\u201d is much more conservative than Romney was at the same stage of his career, and he won\u2019t have to shift gears on health care reform or abortion. Still, if Bush has appeal to Republican elites, it\u2019s because of his moderate affect\u2014he\u2019s not a fire-breather\u2014and pragmatic approach to immigration and education, legacies of his tenure in Florida.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the \u201cJeb Bush\u201d that has to go. To win the invisible primary and prevail with voters, Bush will have to sacrifice the most moderate aspects of his persona and commit to the main concerns of the rank and file. Or, put another way, there\u2019s a good chance that any Jeb Bush who represents the entire Republican Party will be a Jeb Bush who opposes comprehensive immigration reform, shows strong skepticism for federal education programs, and adopts the usual bromides against President Obama and the Democratic Party.\n\nIt\u2019s a Jeb Bush who\u2014if he truly wants to win the nomination\u2014may have to disavow his brother and father, too. Few Republicans will defend the eldest Bush, who worked with Democrats to raise taxes and earned the animosity of a generation of conservatives. By contrast, GOP opinion on George W. Bush is divided. Among elites, he\u2019s a distinguished ex-president. To many activists, however, he\u2019s a big spender who jeopardized conservative principles. And that\u2019s to say nothing of the general public, which still blames the second President Bush for our sluggish economy.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Because it\u2019s Republican donors\u2014not the GOP base\u2014who matter.", "fb-share": "Why Jeb Bush May Win the Nomination", "sailthru.author": "Jamelle Bouie", "description": "Yes, he's out of touch with the Republican base, out of shape on the campaign trail, and burdened by the disastrous presidency of his older brother, bu ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Yes, he's out of touch with the Republican base, out of shape on the campaign trail, and burdened by the disastrous presidency of his older brother, bu ...", "title": "Why Jeb Bush May Win the Nomination", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/jeb_bush_may_win_the_nomination_gop_donors_matter_the_party_s_base_does.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/140414_POL_JebBush.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yes, he's out of touch with the Republican base, out of shape on the campaign trail, and burdened by the disastrous presidency of his older brother, bu ...", "title": "Why Jeb Bush May Win the Nomination", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/jeb_bush_may_win_the_nomination_gop_donors_matter_the_party_s_base_does.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/140414_POL_JebBush.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@jbouie", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-04-14T18:32:58Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Why Jeb Bush May Win the Nomination", "sailthru.headline": "Why Jeb Bush May Win the Nomination", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Why Jeb Bush May Win the Nomination\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/jeb_bush_may_win_the_nomination_gop_donors_matter_the_party_s_base_does.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/140414_POL_JebBush.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100140414014\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-14T18:32:58Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Jamelle Bouie\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"jeb bush\",\n    \"2016 campaign\",\n    \"politics\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Why Jeb Bush May Win the Nomination", "keywords": "Jeb Bush, Jeb Bush New Hampshire, Jeb Bush booed, Jeb Bush conservatives, Jeb Bush GOP primaries, Jeb Bush 2016, could Jeb Bush win, will GOP pick Jeb Bush, Jeb Bush moderate, Jeb Bush immigration, Jeb Bush Common core, Jeb Bush Florida, Jeb Bush Tea party, Jeb Bush mainstream, Jeb Bush legacy, Jeb Bush taxes, Jeb Bush spending, Jeb Bush baggage", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "Jeb Bush, Jeb Bush New Hampshire, Jeb Bush booed, Jeb Bush conservatives, Jeb Bush GOP primaries, Jeb Bush 2016, could Jeb Bush win, will GOP pick Jeb Bush, Jeb Bush moderate, Jeb Bush immigration, Jeb Bush Common core, Jeb Bush Florida, Jeb Bush Tea party, Jeb Bush mainstream, Jeb Bush legacy, Jeb Bush taxes, Jeb Bush spending, Jeb Bush baggage", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.description": "Yes, he's out of touch with the Republican base, out of shape on the campaign trail, and burdened by the disastrous presidency of his older brother, bu ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/140414_POL_JebBush.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7ff\"", "article_summary": "The Republican Party has a long history of nominating candidates who anger and enrage the base.\nAs it stands, the former Florida governor is anathema to the rank and file of the Republican Party.\nTo make it to the top, however, he'll have to do one thing: Make \u201cJeb Bush\u201d disappear.\nIn other words, for Mitt Romney the Republican presidential candidate to become Mitt Romney the Republican presidential nominee, he had to go back in time and effectively destroy Mitt Romney, the moderate Massachusetts governor.\nCruz billed himself as an avatar of conservative orthodoxy\u2014an economic conservative, a social conservative, and a national security conservative."}
