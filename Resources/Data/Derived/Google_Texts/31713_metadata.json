One, profanity-laced where he thought the press was making too much of scandals that he did not think were scandals. Another where he took us to task for not understanding the limits he has with foreign policy and the way he\u2019s dealing with the Middle East and Iraq, and Afghanistan. And I don\u2019t find him apologetic. But I find him willing to stand up to the press and look them in the eye, even though it was off the record and just give us hell.\n\nCompton also criticized the Obama administration on transparency, saying it was \u201cmore opaque\u201d than any other she had covered.\n\n\u201cBefore I walked out the door on September 10, I was a strong voice for complaining that this particular administration has been more opaque than any I have covered \u2026 I think most presidents have been far more forthcoming than the second Obama term, in terms of what the president is doing every day,\u201d she said.\n\nCompton said that she went through a period of \u201cthree or four months where I was never in the Oval Office once on my pool day.\u201d\n\nCompton said Obama \u201cis the first president with his own journalistic tools.\u201d The White House frequently releases its own videos and images, but the press is often barred from photo-ops.\n\n\u201cI think it is fine if the president of the United States wants to present his own version of what he did all week,\u201d said Compton. \u201cMost of it is behind the scenes shots of him with Supreme Court justices and leaders coming in from Wall Street. It is fine that he puts it on the internet and that everybody can see it. Those same elements should not be blocked from the White House press corps.\u201d\n\nNewsbusters recently reported on the interview (which aired in October) after a series of tweets by The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Mike Gonzalez.\n\nOther journalists have criticized the administration on transparency. USA Today Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page called the Obama administration \u201cmore restrictive\u201d and \u201cmore dangerous\u201d to the press than any other administration in history and the Associated Press Washington bureau chief Sally Buzbee listed eight ways the administration restricts access to information.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Compton also criticized the Obama administration on transparency, saying it was \u201cmore opaque\u201d than any other she had covered.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Compton also criticized the Obama administration on transparency, saying it was \u201cmore opaque\u201d than any other she had covered.", "title": "Retired Reporter Details Obama's Off-the-Record \u2018Profanity-Laced Tirade' About the Media", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/obamapress.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1yIBd5q"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Compton also criticized the Obama administration on transparency, saying it was \u201cmore opaque\u201d than any other she had covered.", "title": "Retired Reporter Details Obama's Off-the-Record \u2018Profanity-Laced Tirade' About the Media", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/obamapress.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2014-12-08T15:39:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obama, Barack Obama, president, Obama administration, the most transparent administration in history, Ann Compton, ABC news, white house, press, press pool"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba6b\"", "article_summary": "President Obama once delivered a \u201cprofanity-laced tirade\u201d in an off-the-record session with reporters when he wasn\u2019t happy about media coverage, according to retired ABC News correspondent Ann Compton.\nCompton also criticized the Obama administration on transparency, saying it was \u201cmore opaque\u201d than any other she had covered.\nOne, profanity-laced where he thought the press was making too much of scandals that he did not think were scandals.\nIn an interview with C-Span, Compton said that in the last year she had seen \u201cBarack Obama really angry twice:\u201dBoth were off-the-record times.\nOther journalists have criticized the administration on transparency."}
