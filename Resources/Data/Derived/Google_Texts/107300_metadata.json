He immediately went to the locker room, and Chiefs coach Andy Reid said after the game the preliminary diagnosis was a torn ACL.\n\nCharles will have an MRI on Monday to confirm the extent of the injury.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just see how that goes,\u201d Reid said.\n\nCharles tore the ACL in his left knee four years ago in a game in Detroit. Just like Sunday, that injury occurred while he stepped awkwardly without a defender making contact.\n\n\u201cI sat there and I took a knee and said a prayer, just praying for the best,\u201d Chiefs wide receiver Jeremy Maclin said. \u201cIt\u2019s all very unfortunate.\u201d\n\nThe injury to Charles seemed to deflate the Chiefs, who led 17-3 at that point.\n\nTheir drive stalled after he was helped to the sideline, and Kansas City had to try a 26-yard field goal that was blocked by Pernell McPhee. The Bears suddenly seized momentum, getting a field goal later in the third quarter to jumpstart their comeback.\n\nJay Cutler led two scoring drives late in the fourth quarter, hitting Matt Forte with a go-ahead touchdown pass with 18 seconds remaining for the victory.\n\n\u201cIt hurts. We felt like we played way better than what the loss shows,\u201d said Chiefs kicker Cairo Santos, whose 66-yard field-goal attempt as time expired was well short.\n\nReid said the Chiefs were fairly certain that Charles, who had carried 12 times for 58 yards, had torn ligaments in his knee when he was helped off the field.\n\n\u201cPeople saw what was going on. They had a pretty good idea,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI think it was more of a non-contact type of thing. But again, those types of things, you can\u2019t come back and have the blocked field goal and have the momentum swing.\u201d\n\nCharles had been off to a relatively slow start this season, getting just 11 carries each of the past two weeks. He also had two fumbles in a loss to Denver, including one returned by the Broncos in the final minute for the decisive touchdown in a 31-24 victory.\n\nBut the Chiefs also have no bigger playmaker than Charles, who\u2019s run for at least 1,000 yards each of the past three seasons. He had 12 touchdowns rushing a couple of years ago, nine last season, and had already reached the end zone four times this season.\n\nWithout him in the lineup, the Chiefs will be forced to lean on third-year player Knile Davis and Charcandrick West, a former undrafted free agent out of Abilene Christian.\n\n\u201cWhatever they call on me to do, I\u2019m going to be there,\u201d West said. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to see one of my friends go down, my brother go down. Whatever the team needs me to do, I\u2019m going to be ready to do that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jamaal Charles, Chiefs RB, has potentially season-ending knee injury", "title": "Jamaal Charles, Chiefs RB, has potentially season-ending knee injury", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/11/jamaal-charles-chiefs-rb-has-potentially-season-ending-knee-injury/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151011_075717_jamaal-charles.jpg", "height": 519}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151011_075717_jamaal-charles.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-11T16:53:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T06:17:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23a8\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Pro Bowl running back Jamaal Charles could miss the rest of the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 season after sustaining a serious knee injury in the third quarter of Sunday\u2019s 18-17 loss to the Bears.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very unfortunate.\u201dThe injury to Charles seemed to deflate the Chiefs, who led 17-3 at that point.\nCharles had taken a carry deep in Bears territory when he tried to cut left, his right knee buckling at a gruesome angle.\nHe immediately went to the locker room, and Chiefs coach Andy Reid said after the game the preliminary diagnosis was a torn ACL.\nCharles tore the ACL in his left knee four years ago in a game in Detroit."}
