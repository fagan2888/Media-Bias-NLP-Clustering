Donors are pouring tens of millions of dollars into races across the country, the Republican National Committee is doubling down on investments in campaign technology, and outside groups are investing heavily in an all-out bid to regain the majority for the first time since 2007.\n\nBut there\u2019s a dirty little secret: not every Republican is rooting for the party to succeed.\n\nBehind closed doors and in private conversations with reporters and donors, Republicans eyeing the White House in 2016 are privately signaling they wouldn\u2019t mind seeing the party fall short in this year\u2019s midterm elections. For all the benefits of a strong showing in 2014 after resounding defeat in 2012, senior political advisers to some of the top Republican presidential aspirants believe winning the Senate might be the worst thing that could happen.\n\n\n\nThe opinion is most strongly held by Republican governors, who are hoping to rise above the Washington political fray. Already the central theme adopted by governors like Chris Christie of New Jersey, Rick Perry of Texas, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Scott Walker of Wisconsin is their ability to cut through partisan gridlock to lead their states. A dysfunctional Washington hamstrung by ideological division accentuates their core argument.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to run against Washington,\u201d says Ray Scheppach, the former longtime executive director of the National Governors Association. \u201cTheir argument is, \u2018Nothing happens in Washington, people don\u2019t do anything there. But I\u2019ve created jobs, I\u2019ve balanced budgets for X number of years, I\u2019ve worked across the aisle bringing people together.\u2019 They\u2019re better off painting that picture with a divided Congress.\u201d\n\nBut even for Senators like Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida, winning the majority brings the expectation of performance in a climate where President Barack Obama\u2019s veto pen will certainly get a workout, not to mention the fact that they lack the seniority to guide legislation through committees.\n\nFor candidates from either category, a GOP-controlled Senate and House would mean having to answer for their party\u2019s legislative agenda in both a primary and a general election. Whether it be new fiscal deals struck with Obama or continued votes to repeal Obamacare, aides to potential candidates fear that congressional action may put a damper on their boss\u2019s future campaigns by forcing them to either embrace or break with specific legislative proposals as opposed to general policy ideals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to explain your principles to the American people than it is to explain your position on a piece of legislation that will always have some flaws,\u201d said one 2016 hopeful\u2019s top political aide. \u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget that Congress\u2019s approval rating is at 9%. I think all of those looking at 2016 would rather the two parties share the blame than Republicans alone.\u201d\n\nThe White House aspirants are careful to avoid sharing their views publicly, wary of insulting a party energized by a tantalizingly close chance at the majority thanks to the still sluggish economy and the initially botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act. But by and large, their priorities are apparent in how and for whom they fundraise. Republican governors uniformly talk up their colleagues but avoid mention of the Senate. Senators eyeing the White House have focused on building their own war chests and political organizations.\n\nSeveral Republican governors are up for re-election this year, and Christie and Jindal are the chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the Republican Governors Association. But Christie drew the ire of many Republicans last year when he called a special election to fill the seat of Senator Frank Lautenberg, who died in office, just two weeks before his own re-election. The move kept popular Democrat and now Senator Cory Booker off the ballot when Christie was seeking to run up the score at the polls, but it also made it virtually impossible for his own party to contest the seat. Even more Republicans blame Cruz\u2019s shutdown strategy with making their case more difficult this fall, even as it boosted his position among the Tea Party grassroots.\n\nThe GOP establishment, though, is worried about anyone in the party taking their eye off the ball. The 2016 map is as unfavorable to the GOP as it is favorable in 2014, with a presidential-year turnout raising the likelihood that even if Republicans manage to take the Senate this year, they will lose it two years later.\n\nFormer Mitt Romney adviser Kevin Madden said it would be misguided for potential candidates to ignore the opportunity in 2014 in order to boost their own fortunes, but he acknowledged there may well be some awkwardness.\n\n\u201cAfter the midterms, we could very well be at a point where the candidate that forces a moment of reckoning within our party eventually becomes its 2016 nominee,\u201d Madden tells TIME. \u201cThat may require a showdown between the nominee and their party in the Senate, but it could eventually help both the party and the country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some of the party's White House contenders are worried that a fully Republican-dominated Congress would dim their chances in 2016", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "While most Republicans see 2014 as a chance to win the Senate, some of the party's White House contenders-to-be are worried that a fully Republican-dominated Congress would dim their chances of winning the keys to the Oval Office in 2016", "title": "Republican Presidential Hopefuls See Possible Upside in 2014 Failure", "url": "http://time.com/53002/2016-presidential-race-2014-midterm-elections/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/481182821.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/481182821.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "While most Republicans see 2014 as a chance to win the Senate, some of the party's White House contenders-to-be are worried that a fully Republican-dominated Congress would dim their chances of winning the keys to the Oval Office in 2016", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Republican Presidential Hopefuls See Possible Upside in 2014 Failure"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "2016, 2014, midterm elections, chris christie, bobby jindal, rick perry, scott walker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time", "author": "https://facebook.com/zekejmiller"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2016, 2014, midterm elections, chris christie, bobby jindal, rick perry, scott walker"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb718\"", "article_summary": "Several Republican governors are up for re-election this year, and Christie and Jindal are the chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the Republican Governors Association.\nThe opinion is most strongly held by Republican governors, who are hoping to rise above the Washington political fray.\nRepublican governors uniformly talk up their colleagues but avoid mention of the Senate.\nBut there\u2019s a dirty little secret: not every Republican is rooting for the party to succeed.\nRepublicans are increasingly looking at 2014 as a golden opportunity for the party to retake the Senate."}
