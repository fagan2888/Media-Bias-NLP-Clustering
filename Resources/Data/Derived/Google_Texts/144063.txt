ROCKFORD (WIFR) -- Crusader Clinic breaks ground on its $7.1 million location on North Alpine Road, which they say will open the door for more struggling families to receive healthcare and other important amenities.

Since 2011, the number of patient visits has increased nearly 15 percent and with this new location a year away from opening, they are expecting even more to pack their waiting rooms.

Crusader staff broke ground today at the former SwedishAmerican Brookside site where they will have 24 new exam rooms.

The entire project costs just over $7 million with $4 million being paid for by state and federal grants and the group is still trying to raise the remaining $950,000 needed to build.

Crusader President and CEO Gordon Eggers says without their clinics throughout the Stateline, the area's poor and their health would take a tremendous hit.

"If Crusader was to be destabilized and not be here, I think you would see an implosion of ill health," said Eggers. "You would see Rockford with a low socioeconomic group that would have a difficult time accessing care and then dealing with all of their socioeconomic needs and being connected."

Eggers says with the Alpine facility and the expectation that more people will soon become eligible for the Affordable Care Act, Crusader should see its yearly patient load creep over 50,000.

Crusader says they will serve about 4,500 people in the first two years at the new site. Construction is expected to last until next year with an estimated opening of April 2017.
