For the past two years, the family has been living in agony while still hoping for a miracle.

Family members of Samantha Weaver, a missing Shawnee mother of two girls, said a suspect has been identified in their loved one's disappearance.

Sunday will mark the second anniversary of Weaver's disappearance. Family members who have been working with prosecutors said the man who last saw Weaver alive, Troy D. Loveland, could provide investigators many answers. Loveland is currently serving prison time in Oklahoma for multiple convictions relating to assault and battery.

In June of 2012, Shawnee Police confirmed to News 9 they suspected foul play in Weaver's disappearance. Without a body, the investigation has been slow-going. For the past two years, the family has been living in agony while still hoping for a miracle.

"The biggest loss, I believe, is those kids not having a mother," Weaver's brother Phil Busch said.

Family members told News 9 finding Weaver will help them move forward. They do not doubt the likelihood that Loveland killed Weaver in June of 2012. They also believe other people have information that will help prosecutors in their quest for justice.

"She was my baby sister, and that's something you can't get over until you know [what happened to her]," Weaver's sister Cristy Busch said.

Anyone with information on the case is urged to call investigators at 405-275-6878.
