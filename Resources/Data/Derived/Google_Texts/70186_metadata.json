I\u2019ll never forget telling our running back to make his block because this is going to be the play that\u2019s going to win it.\u201d\n\nBut the Crimson had to hang on when Yale moved into Harvard territory before Scott Peters picked off a pass at the 15 to seal it.\n\n\u201cThat will always be in the memory,\u201d Fischer said of his game-winning catch. \u201cThere was no doubt in our minds we could go out there and execute. It will be very memorable. I will always remember that.\u201d\n\nPaul Stanton Jr. also had a 1-yard TD run for the Crimson (10-0, 7-0 Ivy), who finished off their 17th undefeated season with their 14th consecutive victory.\n\n\u201cEach season, anytime you win a championship or anytime you beat Yale it\u2019s very special, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll get more exciting than this one,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWay too exciting.\u201d\n\nTyler Varga rushed for two TDs and caught another for Yale (8-2, 5-2), which was seeking a share of the Ivy crown. It would have been the 14th in school history.\n\n\u201cThe last time I sat here we were 2-8,\u201d Yale coach Tony Reno said of his team\u2019s season. \u201cThere was growth. Today we were playing for the league championship. These guys next to me did a good job of moving Yale football back to where it belongs \u2014 and that\u2019s playing for league championships.\u201d\n\nConnor Sheehan returned an interception 90 yards for a TD, Hempel threw a 40-yard scoring pass as Harvard opened a 24-7 lead late in the third. Yale came back with three fourth-quarter scores, tying it on Kyle Cazzetta\u2019s 33-yard field goal with just under 4 minutes to play.\n\nAfter Sheehan pulled the ball away from receiver Robert Clemens in front of Yale\u2019s sideline and raced down for the score with 6 seconds to play in the third, the Bulldogs answered with a quick scoring drive, capped by Varga\u2019s second scoring run of the game. The Bulldogs scored again on their next possession when Morgan Roberts hit Varga with a 7-yard TD pass, slicing it to 24-21 with 8:21 to play.\n\nYale won eight consecutive matchups with Harvard from 1880-89 (the schools didn\u2019t play every year back then).\n\nHempel had hit Fischer with the 40-yard toss late in the third quarter. Fischer, looking back into the sun near the 5-yard line, reached over a Yale defensive back to make the grab before stumbling into the end zone to make it 17-7.\n\nTrailing 7-3, Harvard took the second half kickoff and marched 58 yards, taking the lead on Stanton Jr.\u2019s 1-yard scoring run.\n\nOn a cold and windy day in the nation\u2019s oldest stadium \u2014 Harvard Stadium, which was built in 1903 \u2014 the Crimson went to the locker room behind after a half that was highlighted by a couple of their missed opportunities.\n\nThere was added pregame buzz to college football\u2019s oldest rivalry with ESPN\u2019s College GameDay visiting for the first time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conner Hempel threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Andrew Fischer with 55 seconds to play and Harvard beat Yale 31-24 to capture the Ivy League title outright after blowing a 17-point, fourth-quarter lead on Saturday.", "Author": "Ken Powtak", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Conner Hempel threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Andrew Fischer with 55 seconds to play and Harvard beat Yale 31-24 to capture the Ivy League title outright after blowing a 17-point, fourth-quarter lead on Saturday.", "title": "Harvard wins 8th straight over Yale with last-minute TD", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/22/harvard-wins-8th-straight-over-yale-last-minute-td/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/22/yale-harvard-football_lanc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/22/yale-harvard-football_lanc.jpg", "title": "Harvard wins 8th straight over Yale with last-minute TD", "description": "Conner Hempel threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to Andrew Fischer with 55 seconds to play and Harvard beat Yale 31-24 to capture the Ivy League title outright after blowing a 17-point, fourth-quarter lea", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Yale, Harvard, Conner Hempel, Andrew Fischer"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd956\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEach season, anytime you win a championship or anytime you beat Yale it\u2019s very special, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll get more exciting than this one,\u201d Murphy said.\nYale won eight consecutive matchups with Harvard from 1880-89 (the schools didn\u2019t play every year back then).\n\u201cI\u2019ve been involved in 21 of these and you think you\u2019ve seen it all and then you haven\u2019t,\u201d Harvard coach Tim Murphy said after his team beat Yale for the 13th time in 14 years.\nAfter seeing the big lead wiped out quickly, Harvard took over at its own 22 and marched into Yale territory before Hempel found Fischer for the game-winner.\nTrailing 7-3, Harvard took the second half kickoff and marched 58 yards, taking the lead on Stanton Jr.\u2019s 1-yard scoring run."}
