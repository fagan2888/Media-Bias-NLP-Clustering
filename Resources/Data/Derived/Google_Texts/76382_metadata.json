Axel Springer SE\n\nIn the not-too-distant future, companies that treat their customers\u2019 data with openness and sensitivity will find that they have a competitive advantage over companies that abuse customer data, the chief executive of Germany\u2019s largest publisher said.\n\nMathias D\u00f6pfner, CEO of Axel Springer, told a telecommunications, media and technology conference in Barcelona on Wednesday that companies should use and monetize data properly but must be sensitive to privacy.\n\n\u201cIn the digital world, data is a kind of currency and is of tremendous value,\u201d D\u00f6pfner said. \u201cFairness toward data usage is crucial because in the long run\u2014perhaps not that much today\u2014customers will really care about what you do with their data: whether you\u2019re giving it directly to the secret service or whether you\u2019re using it to sell to other companies, or whether you\u2019re really doing something that\u2019s to their benefit.\u201d\n\nD\u00f6pfner, who over the past year has been spearheading a sort of counterrevolution in Europe against U.S. tech giants such as Google, said that while it was important for publishers to create incentives to boost customer lock-in, gaining access to as much customer data as possible, the use of that data needs to be in the interest and for the benefit of the customer.\n\n\u201cTo be transparent and fair will be a competitive advantage,\u201d D\u00f6pfner said.\n\nD\u00f6pfner said Google was a \u201cfrenemy\u201d\u2014friend and enemy. \u201cWe work with them closely, we benefit from traffic, we benefit from advertising revenues that we get via Google,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in certain areas we have very, very different interests and agendas. It\u2019s not just a Google thing\u2014the same is true for Facebook, Amazon and other big tech monopolies.\u201d\n\nD\u00f6pfner said that if publishers, car companies, banks or insurance companies provide their customers\u2019 data\u2014what he called their most valuable treasure\u2014to Amazon, Google or Facebook, then the latter can provide the customers with services directly. \u201cIn the long run, it\u2019s slightly stupid for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have the data of our customers and that\u2019s the only way we can compete.\u201d\n\nIn early November, Axel Springer backed off its demands that Google pay for access to some of its content, bowing instead to the U.S. Internet giant after restricted access caused traffic to plunge.\n\nSpringer, one of Google\u2019s most outspoken critics in Europe, said continuing to limit Google\u2019s access to four of its websites would have cost each of them tens of thousands of euros in revenue every year.\n\n\u201cIt was necessary to have a broader debate about competition in the digital ecosystem,\u201d D\u00f6pfner told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. \u201cThe question of Google\u2019s over-90% market share of Europe and self-preferential search results is a far bigger question than media-industry interests.\u201d\n\nAt the time of Axel Springer\u2019s capitulation, Google said, \u201cWe send over 500 million clicks to German publishers each month and our advertising partnerships have generated more than \u20ac1 billion [$1.25 billion] in revenue for them in the last three years.\u201d",
