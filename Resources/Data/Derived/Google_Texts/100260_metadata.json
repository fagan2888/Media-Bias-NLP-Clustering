And they are losing.\n\nOver the last few years, the nation's orange industry has taken a more than $4 billion hit as dead trees and useless crops recently sent orange harvests to their lowest in two decades.\n\n\"It's like a patient that keeps getting sicker and sicker and sicker, until it dies,\" says Michael Rogers, interim director of the Citrus Research and Education Center at the University of Florida.\n\nThe disease is called huanglongbing, also known as citrus greening. Producing oranges too bitter for juice and too misshapen and discolored for fresh fruit, the bacteria leaves farmers little choice but to destroy every one of their sick trees.\n\nThe crawling culprit facilitating its spread is the Asian citrus psyllid, a plant juice-sucking bug that with a gust of wind can easily become airborne and carry the fatal bacteria that destroys oranges, limes, lemons and grapefruits.\n\n\"If we don't protect our citrus,\" warns the USDA's Save Our Citrus campaign, \"that cup of juice you drink with your breakfast, the beautiful lemon tree in your yard and the curry you use to add zest to your cooking might not be there in the future.\"\n\nIn Florida, disease-carrying bugs have ravaged citrus crops, triggering dire predictions about the coming extinction of orange juice. Indeed, \"the majority of the citrus trees [in Florida] have the disease,\" according to Rogers.\n\nThe state's orange production has been steadily declining since the bacteria was first identified there in 2004, according to USDA data, along with the number of acres bearing the fruit.\n\nRather than invest time and money in grove regrowth, some citrus farmers are deciding to sell out to real estate developers, Rogers explains. Yet for those who try and stand their ground against the expanding threat, they are arming themselves with a variety of tools to try and control the psyllid population, including spraying, tenting and steam treatments, the USDA says.\n\nAnother possible solution being explored, but one that has been met with some controversy: genetically modifying oranges to make them more resilient to pests and diseases. While GMOs could be more of a long-term solution, says Rogers, a more short-term one is naturally cross-breeding oranges to create \"new varieties\" that can \"better tolerate the disease.\"\n\nHowever, it would be at least four years before their effectiveness could be measured, when the new citrus trees finally yield, he acknowledged.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Behind the blossoming flowers and fields of fruit in the U.S. lurk a hungry threat that has crawled and eaten its way through much of the country.", "author": "David Montalvo", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Behind blossoming flowers and fields of fruit lurk a hungry threat that has crawled and eaten its way through much of the U.S.", "title": "When insects attack\u2014and inflict billions in damage", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/08/insects-feast-on-plants-endangering-crops-and-costing-billions.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/05/07/102658255-AsianLonghornedBeetle.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Behind blossoming flowers and fields of fruit lurk a hungry threat that has crawled and eaten its way through much of the U.S.", "title": "Insects feast on plants, endangering crops and costing billions", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/05/08/insects-feast-on-plants-endangering-crops-and-costing-billions.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/05/07/102658255-AsianLonghornedBeetle.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@montalvo_d", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Science, Science, Life, Environment, Food Products, Food Economics, World Economy, Agriculture, US Economy, US: News, Australia, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-05-09T09:00:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Science", "modified_time": "2015-05-09T09:04:22-0400", "tag": "Australia"}, "pageNodeId": 102659329, "news_keywords": "insects, invasive species, crops, orange, USDA, agriculture, psyllids"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd173b\"", "article_summary": "However, it would be at least four years before their effectiveness could be measured, when the new citrus trees finally yield, he acknowledged.\nIn Florida, disease-carrying bugs have ravaged citrus crops, triggering dire predictions about the coming extinction of orange juice.\nIndeed, \"the majority of the citrus trees [in Florida] have the disease,\" according to Rogers.\nOne of America's most popular food staples is at war against an insect smaller than an apple seed that is spreading an incurable disease.\n\"It's like a patient that keeps getting sicker and sicker and sicker, until it dies,\" says Michael Rogers, interim director of the Citrus Research and Education Center at the University of Florida."}
