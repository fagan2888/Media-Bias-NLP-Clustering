During the news conference, Gov. Bill Walker, right, announced he intended to accept federal money to expand Medicaid coverage. (Mark Thiessen/AP)\n\nAlaska\u2019s governor won a legal victory Friday that, at least for now, will allow the state to begin next week to sign up more low-income residents for Medicaid \u2014 despite objections from state lawmakers.\n\nThe dispute in Alaska has emerged as the latest political and legal skirmish over the Affordable Care Act, lingering even after the Supreme Court two months ago upheld the constitutionality of a core aspect of the law that requires most Americans to have health insurance.\n\nThis most recent skirmish involves a decision that each state has faced in the past three years: whether to expand its Medicaid program, as originally intended by the 2010 law that has been reshaping the health-care system.\n\nWhen Congress adopted the law, it envisioned that opening Medicaid to people with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level would be a major way to extend health coverage to people who were uninsured. But two years later, the Supreme Court ruled that each state was free to choose whether to broaden access to Medicaid.\n\nIn Alaska, Gov. Bill Walker, an independent, asked the Republican state legislature to approve a plan that he said would enable 41,000 more residents to join the program. Lawmakers resisted, and a month ago, Walker announced that he would bypass the legislature and accept federal money to expand the program, starting Sept. 1.\n\n\n\n[Battle in Florida over Medicaid expansion]\n\nOn Monday, Alaska\u2019s legislative council sued the governor to try to block the expansion, arguing that only the legislature had the power to decide who was eligible for the program. Lawmakers asked a judge to issue a temporary order to block the start of sign-ups for Alaskans who qualify for the first time.\n\nOn Friday, Superior Court Judge Frank A. Pfiffner turned down that request. The judge said the legislators who objected had not proved so far that starting to expand the program would cause the state \u201cirreparable harm\u201d or that the governor had clearly overstepped his authority. \u00adPfiffner said that he expected his decision to be appealed to Alaska\u2019s Supreme Court.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Alaska governor and lawmakers embroiled in latest skirmish over Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Judge allows Alaska governor to move ahead with Medicaid expansion", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/judge-allows-alaska-governor-to-move-ahead-with-medicaid-expansion/2015/08/28/db2266ba-4db1-11e5-bfb9-9736d04fc8e4_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/07/17/National-Politics/Images/Alaska_Medicaid-0f8a1-4850.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@goldsteinamy"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/judge-allows-alaska-governor-to-move-ahead-with-medicaid-expansion/2015/08/28/db2266ba-4db1-11e5-bfb9-9736d04fc8e4_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "db2266ba-4db1-11e5-bfb9-9736d04fc8e4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Alaska governor and lawmakers embroiled in latest skirmish over Affordable Care Act."}, "article_summary": "On Friday, Superior Court Judge Frank A.
