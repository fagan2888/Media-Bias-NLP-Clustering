As the outstanding model for quality early learning, Head Start\u2019s comprehensive, two-generation approach, including services such as home visits, health screenings, and improved nutrition, gets children ready for kindergarten and sets families on a path toward self-sufficiency.\n\nNAACP President and Head Start alumnus Cornell Brooks revealed the Memorandum of Understanding, which focuses on three core directives:\n\n\u2022 Voter registration: Organize voter registration drives at Head Start centers to provide Head Start parents with crucial tools and information to bridge gaps in the voting process, including helpful resources such as voter guides with state-specific information on how to register and vote.\n\n\u2022 Healthcare / Affordable Care Act: Educate families and provide resources to the Head Start community to help families enroll for health care coverage and access critical medical care.\n\n\u2022 Housing Advocacy: Provide Head Start families with fair housing advocacy tools to help build a foundation for stabilizing the family and home, and ensuring the entire family is prepared and invested in their own lifelong success.\n\n\u201cHead Start has long been the center of community and learning in neighborhoods across the country, providing the required resources to strengthen families, communities and the well-being of our children,\u201d said NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks. \u201cThis new partnership with Head Start is a natural extension of their commitment to educating and empowering families and the communities they serve.\u201d\n\nHead Start\u2019s benefits to building community - The existence of central center locations in the poorest neighborhoods where young parents can meet, socialize, and see one another helps create neighbors and neighborhoods.\n\n\u2022 Providing children early knowledge, nurturing and stability that readies them for kindergarten, instills love of reading, and phenomenal socialization skill development that hopefully expands beyond the walls of the center.\n\n\u2022 Creating opportunity/access to community services for parents and children. Parents are able to gain training, set family and community goals, participate in councils at centers, and grow into positions of empowerment.\n\n\u2022 Social Justice Imperative - In modern society, child care and Pre-K are considered basic needs for children, and often out of reach for struggling parents. Head Start and other programs help create a more stable and peaceful world that values education, self-direction and community that we must continue to cultivate.\n\n\u201cWe are proud to partner with the NAACP to open up the democratic process for Head Start families, and ensure access to critical health and housing opportunities,\u201d said NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci. \u201cHead Start has always emphasized that parents are their children\u2019s first teachers and a program\u2019s most important partner. Expanding access to these resources is a crucial part of breaking the cycle of poverty and empowering families to achieve their own goals for education, employment, stability, and success.\u201d\n\n# # #\n\nFounded in 1909, the NAACP is the nation's oldest and largest nonpartisan civil rights organization.
