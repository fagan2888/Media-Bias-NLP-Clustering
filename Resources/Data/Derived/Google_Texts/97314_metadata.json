Not everyone is convinced the devices are improving care.What healthcare needs, agreed panelist Tom Rodgers, managing director at McKesson Ventures, is a new position\u2014call it a data-ist, or a data specialist\u2014with the responsibility of filtering through patient-generated data.It's the sort of idea that McKesson Ventures is looking to invest in but doesn't seem to exist.\u201cMy ideal company is a mix of Silicon Valley ambition and understanding of technology with a Nashville or Atlanta or Minnesota understanding of why healthcare is hard,\u201d he said.A number of health systems have set up their own venture arms to invest in new technologies and help them demonstrate proof of concept. San Francisco-based Dignity Health, about 35-miles north of Silicon Valley, has piloted a number of these new technologies.\u201cI think workflow is the biggest misunderstood item coming into a relationship with a provider,\u201d said Sanjay Shah, Dignity's director of strategic innovation. Shah was another panelist at the event, which was sponsored by law firm DLA Piper and held in conjunction with the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.Venture funding in healthcare reached $4.5 billion in 2015, according to venture fund Rock Health, swelling from just $1.1 billion in 2011. The Affordable Care Act has acted as a major catalyst, particularly as it ushered in an era of consumerism.At JP Morgan, presenting companies were eager to showcase new technology partnerships and investments. Independence Blue Cross, the Philadelphia-based insurer, announced that it will begin covering NantHealth's GPS Cancera , a whole genome sequencing diagnostic, for certain members with cancer.\u201cWe are confident \u2026 that it will be so successful that it will evolve across the country,\u201d said Independence CEO Dan Hilferty. \u201cWe don't see ourselves as a healthcare company; we see ourselves as an innovation company.\u201dBut healthcare still moves at a glacial pace. \u201cMoney is expected to flow into healthcare IT faster than the pace of change,\u201d said Rodgers of McKesson Ventures.When consulting firm EY did a study on telemedicine in healthcare, it found that while most providers have adopted telemedicine tools, only 24% said their telemedicine programs were centrally managed across the organizations with standardized policies and protocols.\u201cPeople aren't thinking of this in transformational terms,\u201d said Bill Fera, principal at EY. \u201cThey're being reactive. There are more people doing complicated digital health than actually have a strategic plan around digital health.\u201dPart of the issue, he added, is spending fatigue on technology as many providers come off huge electronic health record implementations and the transition to the ICD-10 billing system.\u201cI don't think there's an appetite to spend on transformational innovation,\u201d Fera said. \u201cThere's not necessarily the value that they had hoped to see, especially around analytics.\u201dHealth systems have been willing to pilot new technologies, but the challenge is finding the ones that actually have staying power.\u201cI do think there's a real role for discipline for looking at where new entrants affect healthcare in a positive way, and which are just the bright, shiny objects,\u201d said Dr. Nick Turkal, CEO of Milwaukee-based Aurora Health Care.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Money is flowing into the digital health space faster than ever before, but innovators and healthcare providers are moving at different speeds when it comes to adoption of new technologies.", "title": "Is digital health's investment hype growing faster than adoption?", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Money is flowing into the digital health space faster than ever before, but innovators and healthcare providers are moving at different speeds when it comes to adoption of new technologies.", "title": "Is digital health's investment hype growing faster than adoption?", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160112/NEWS/160119948", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Money is flowing into the digital health space faster than ever before, but innovators and healthcare providers are moving at different speeds when it comes to adoption of new technologies.", "title": "Is digital health's investment hype growing faster than adoption?", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20160112/NEWS/160119948", "published_at": "2016-01-12", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe don't see ourselves as a healthcare company; we see ourselves as an innovation company.\u201dBut healthcare still moves at a glacial pace.\n\"Many of the latest technologies depend on giving people real-time access to their doctors, or sending endless flows of data from wearable monitoring devices.\nThe Affordable Care Act has acted as a major catalyst, particularly as it ushered in an era of consumerism.At JP Morgan, presenting companies were eager to showcase new technology partnerships and investments.\n\u201cThey're being reactive.\nSan Francisco-based Dignity Health, about 35-miles north of Silicon Valley, has piloted a number of these new technologies.\u201cI think workflow is the biggest misunderstood item coming into a relationship with a provider,\u201d said Sanjay Shah, Dignity's director of strategic innovation."}
