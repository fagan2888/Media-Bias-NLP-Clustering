I need just single flashlight to make this mom pass the delivery safely for her and her baby.\u201d\n\nAl Ani says she and her colleagues worked under intense pressure during the early years of the Iraq War. Medicine and supplies were limited. The streets surrounding the hospital were so dangerous her chief resident was killed on the way to work.\n\nNow in the U.S., she\u2019s confronting those experiences once more, translating them for cover letters and in mock interviews.\n\n\u201cIn war circumstances, you face a lot of injuries, a lot of emergencies,\u201d Al Ani said. \u201cThis increases your skills, your confidence and you ability to work as a team.\u201d\n\nSophie Cheetham is helping Al Ani navigate the U.S. job market.\n\n\u201cThe path is long, it\u2019s arduous, it\u2019s incredibly costly,\u201d Cheetham said.\n\nCheetham runs the Bridge to Employment program through the International Rescue Committee. Each year it offers grants, job-readiness training and guidance to 75 foreign-licensed medical professionals who want to get back into the health care industry.\n\nIt\u2019s common for many refugee medical professionals to take jobs as taxi drivers and cashiers when they first arrive in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThey want nothing more than to find employment to support their families, to lead self-sufficient lives,\u201d Cheetham said. \u201cSo recertification isn\u2019t initially a priority for them.\u201d\n\nWith financial support from her family, Al Ani has been able to volunteer as a health literacy coach and complete an observership at Johns Hopkins Hospital. But Cheethum said even entry-level jobs in San Diego\u2019s service industry help her clients gain insight into the U.S. work culture.\n\nBut the benefit of having doctors drive people to the airport or run a checkout stand is less clear for a nation already lacking about 16,000 primary care physicians.\n\nStephen Hayden runs the residency program at UC San Diego. He says a pinch on the number of specialty residency slots could lure more U.S. medical graduates into primary care.\n\n\u201cWhat can I say? We need primary care physicians,\u201d said Stephen Hayden, who runs UC San Diego\u2019s medical residency program. \u201cEverybody knows that and everybody says that.\u201d\n\nHayden said many of the nation\u2019s primary care residency positions go unfilled each year because the line of work isn\u2019t considered lucrative enough to pay down student debt, which can near $200,000.\n\nHe said it might make sense to fast-track doctors like Al Ani, who\u2019s already expressed an interest in practicing family medicine and whose schooling was paid for by the Iraqi government.\n\n\u201cThey will still have to complete, at least with the current structure and rules, a primary care residency of some sort, but especially given that some of these slots are more difficult to fill, I think that it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable to consider a program where those individuals would fill some of those slots,\u201d Hayden said.\n\nBut streamlining the process for refugee doctors could be tricky. Despite the trouble filling primary care residencies, Hayden said competition among U.S. med students is high; the number of U.S. medical school graduates is projected to exceed the number of residency slots available by 2015.\n\nThere were 34,355 graduates vying for residencies this year \u2013 up 3,000 from 2012 \u2013 according to the National Resident Matching Program, which oversees the placement of all residency applicants in the U.S.\n\nAt 7,568, the number of international medical graduates without U.S. citizenship applying for a spot has increased three-fold since 1991. Less than half obtained positions this year, according to the NRMP.\n\nAl Ani keeps a map of Iraq and a key on her wall to remind her of home. The war in Iraq spread her family out across the world, with her parents in Jordan, a brother in the United Arab Emirates and another in Canada.\n\nBut, as Al Ani clicks through an online residency application system in her El Cajon living room, she projects an unfaltering calmness. She said she doesn\u2019t mind being thrown into an overflowing applicant pool with graduates 10 years her junior. And she doesn\u2019t mind the three years she spent relearning diseases, treatments and procedures.\n\n\u201cIn the medical field, you always feel like you are learning. It\u2019s a continuous learning for anybody,\u201d said Al Ani, who will learn whether she\u2019s accepted into a residency program in March. \u201cTo work with people who are fresh graduated, I can be helpful with my experience. They could be helpful with their fresh knowledge. I think we will be a good team together. After all, it will be good for the hospital and the patients.\u201d\n\nVideo by Brian Myers, Media Arts Center San Diego\n\nThis article relates to: City Heights, Community, Health Care, News, Share\n\nWritten by Megan Burks Megan Burks is a reporter for Speak City Heights, a media project of Voice of San Diego, KPBS, Media Arts Center and The AjA Project.
