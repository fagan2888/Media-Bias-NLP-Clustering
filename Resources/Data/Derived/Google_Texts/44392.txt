NEW YORK (MainStreet) — While Mondays have proven historically to be the worst day for stock prices and Wednesdays have produced the largest returns, investors should avoid timing the market.

This long-term pattern has persisted for most time periods and in most major international markets, said Robert Johnson, president and CEO of The American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa.

“There is a persistent pattern in terms of stock returns by the day of the week,” he said. “For most major international markets, the average return on Monday is negative.”

Calendar-related dips and surges are logical. For example, the market tends to dip on Mondays, because some companies have a tendency to release negative news such as disappointing earnings results on Friday after the market has closed.

“It is thought that if bad news is released when the market is closed and investors have time to digest the information over the weekend that they will respond rationally and not emotionally,” Johnson said. “This leads to lower stock prices when the market is open for trading on Monday.”

Since institutional buyers and sellers control the market, the short sellers seek to close their positions before the weekend. Buying back stock or the closing of the short positions tends to drive up prices on Fridays, Johnson said. When they short sell the stock to re-establish the position on the following Monday, this leads to lower Monday stock prices, he said.

The Monday “selling pressure could be from traders setting up for the week, since it can be difficult to sit on a short position over a weekend,” said Patrick Morris, CEO of HAGIN Investment Management in New York City.
