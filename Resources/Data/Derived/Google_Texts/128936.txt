Sioux Falls, SD

This will be a day of cleanup and repairs for homeowners and businesses in Sioux Falls following the overnight storm that brought heavy rain, strong winds, large hail and lightning.

The storm peeled-back a section of the roof at the Target store on South Louise. Two gas lines located near the roof were also damaged. Firefighters evacuated workers who were sheltered inside the store.

Hail smashed windows of cars in the Target parking lot. The wind also blew shopping carts into the path of vehicles as drivers tried to leave the lot.

The storm also knocked down part of a loading dock retaining wall at the JC Penney at The Empire Mall.

The Outdoor Campus at Sertoma Park is closed Sunday because of storm damage that includes broken windows. The Outdoor Campus hopes to re-open Tuesday.
