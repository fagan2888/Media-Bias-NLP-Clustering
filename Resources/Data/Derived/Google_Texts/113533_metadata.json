That example of a flagrant foul committed against truth-telling resulted from Obama\u2019s claim in mid-2014 that Republicans had \u201cfilibustered about 500 pieces of legislation.\u201d\n\nNow we find the Post\u2019s fact checker putting what he calls \u201cObama\u2019s odd series of exaggerated gun claims\u201d to the test. The result? Another major fail for the man who continues to chip away at the faith and trust the people need to have in the occupant of the Oval Office.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThis time, Kessler awards Obama three Pinocchios for his \u201cexaggerated claims and faux statistics\u201d on gun violence and the availability of firearms in the United States.\n\nWhile many conservatives would, no doubt, say the president was simply making stuff up and lying with abandon to students gathered for a town hall at Benedict College in South Carolina earlier this month \u2014 not softening the critical blow by writing of exaggerations \u2014 the Post fact checker did nonetheless sharply criticize Obama for his careless comments.\n\nAmong the president\u2019s off-the-mark statements, according to Kessler\u2019s research:\n\n\u201c\u2026our homicide rates are so much higher than other industrialized countries. I mean by like a mile\u2026\u201d Not true.\n\n\u201c\u2026there are neighborhoods where it\u2019s easier for you to buy a handgun and clips than it is for you to buy a fresh vegetable\u2026\u201d Exaggerated claim.\n\n\u201cPeople just say well, we should have firearms in kindergarten and we should have machine guns in bars\u2026\u201d Wildly over the top.\n\nAs Kessler points out in his analysis that once again shows how Obama\u2019s rambling rhetoric is often not tethered to the truth, \u201cthe gun debate is serious enough that it should not be poisoned\u201d by the man holding the highest elected office in the land.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president has a big Pinnochio problem...", "author": "Norvell Rose", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "The president has a big Pinnochio problem...", "title": "Mainstream Media Just Caught Obama In The Act And Snared Him In His Web Of Lies", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/obama-sad_2451605b3.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-17T11:57:06-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/mainstream-fact-checker-just-slapped-obama-grill-whoppers-guns/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president has a big Pinnochio problem...", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/obama-sad_2451605b3.jpg", "title": "Mainstream Media Just Caught Obama In The Act And Snared Him In His Web Of Lies", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-17T11:47:06-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "Second Amendment", "published_time": "2015-03-17T11:47:06-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-17T11:57:06-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "four pinocchios, three pinocchios, obama gets pinocchios, pinocchios for obama, obama is a liar, obama exaggerates, obama on gun control, glenn kessler, glenn kessler obama exaggerations, barack obama, gun control, guns, second amendment, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "That media watchdog is Glenn Kessler, the fact checker for The Washington Post who has lately been willing to pile Pinocchios on the president.\nAn earlier instance of Obama\u2019s playing fast and loose with the facts resulted in another four-Pinocchios penalty against the president.\n\u201cPeople just say well, we should have firearms in kindergarten and we should have machine guns in bars\u2026\u201d Wildly over the top.\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowThis time, Kessler awards Obama three Pinocchios for his \u201cexaggerated claims and faux statistics\u201d on gun violence and the availability of firearms in the United States.\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues belowOn March 2nd of this year, Kessler gave Obama four Pinocchios \u2014 indicating the highest possible long-nosed offense against truth \u2014 because of the explanation Obama gave for his veto of the Keystone Pipeline bill."}
