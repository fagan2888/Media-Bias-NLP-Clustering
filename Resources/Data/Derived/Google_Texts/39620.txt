“Rep. Steve Smith” is still at it. The fake congressman from Georgia’s fictional 15th district continues to pester members of the media on Twitter, trying to ensnare someone into believing he really is the most offensive tea party representative in the House. “Smith’s” first successful target was CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, who replied with “Seriously?” late last month. Now, it appears he may have fooled MSNBC’s Touré.

Responding to MSNBC tweet that quoted Touré as saying “Obamacare is not Obama’s Katrina,” “Smith” called for the president’s impeachment. When an MSNBC supporter told him to “shut up,” he took things many steps further by using the racially-charged term “boy” in his response

Touré responded in what appeared to be genuine outrage to both comments, calling him “Congressman” and questioning his use of the word “boy”:

Within minutes, after many of his followers pointed out that “Smith” was parody account, Touré acknowledged that he realized it was fake:

But that wasn’t before frequent MSNBC contributor Ezra Klein retweeted Touré’s message to his nearly 400,000 followers. He subsequently acknowledged that it was fake as well:

Two other MSNBC’ers got roped into the fray as well, with Jonathan Capehart and Sam Stein both calming down their followers who were outraged by “Smith’s” comments:

The latest uproar has done little to slow down “Rep. Steve Smith,” who has kept things going strong on his Twitter account, which is approaching 4,500 followers, into Tuesday afternoon.
