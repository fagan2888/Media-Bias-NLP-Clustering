In between making two layups that started and finished Sunday\u2019s 66-55 victory over Hiram College and brought a crowd of 10,250 to its feet, she spent much of her inspiring game sitting on the bench wearing sunglasses and headphones.\n\nHill\u2019s condition has made her extremely sensitive to sensations her teammates and opposing players take for granted, but she still enjoyed the bright gym and the cheering crowd. And she certainly savored her two baskets on a day she will never forget.\n\n\u201cThis game was amazing,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIt was awesome in every way. It\u2019s a dream come true. To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd \u2014 I just love it so much. I love basketball.\n\n\u201cEverything that happened today was amazing. I\u2019m truly happy, it\u2019s a really good day.\u201d\n\nHill made an uncontested left-handed layup for the opening basket off a bounce pass from redshirt sophomore Taylor Brown, who missed last season with a knee injury. The tumor affects Hill\u2019s coordination, forcing the right-hander to shoot with her left hand.\n\nShe also made the last shot of the game, returning with 26.5 seconds remaining for a right-handed layup.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one I\u2019ve been having trouble with,\u201d Hill said.\n\nPHOTOS: Terminally ill Lauren Hill plays her last game\n\nBoth shots were greeted with standing ovations from the sellout crowd at Xavier University\u2019s 10,000-seat arena, part of an emotional afternoon for Hill that included love and support from stars in several sports. Tennessee women\u2019s coach Pat Summitt was in attendance, along with an impressive list of WNBA players that included Elena Delle Donne, Delisha Milton-Jones, Tamika Catchings and Skylar Diggins.\n\n\u201cShe lets you know what\u2019s important,\u201d Milton-Jones said of Hill.\n\nMoved by the response \u2014 especially after receiving two awards, including the U.S. Basketball Writers Association\u2019s Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award normally awarded at the Final Four \u2014 Hill said of her disease: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna fight this.\u201d\n\nHill\u2019s determination to play while raising awareness about pediatric cancer has created a fan base that goes far beyond the school located on the outskirts of Cincinnati.\n\nThe 19-year-old native of Lawrenceburg, Indiana, has received support from across the country. Teams and players have signed and sent No. 22 jerseys to Hill, including 15 from high schools that lined the Lions\u2019 bench.\n\nThere were plenty of posters and supportive signs, and several fans held up large yellow cutouts that said \u201cLauren 22.\u201d\n\nHill started an online layup challenge that involves spinning around five times and shooting a layup with the non-dominant hand. Similar to this summer\u2019s ALS Ice Bucket Challenge that became a social media phenomenon, the fundraising campaign (#Layup4Lauren) has captured the attention of Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton and other athletes.\n\nThe Bengals showed a video of her layup during a timeout in Sunday\u2019s 33-23 home win against Jacksonville. Defensive tackle Devon Still \u2014whose daughter, Leah, 4, is also being treated for cancer \u2014 wore Hill\u2019s name on his eye black; left tackle Andrew Whitworth had the No. 22 on his gloves.\n\nVideos were shown with teams meeting the challenge \u2014 with missed layups \u2014 and challenging others.\n\nFundraising by The Cure Starts Now Foundation totaled more than $40,000. The NCAA allowed the game to be moved up two weeks because of the urgency of Hill\u2019s condition.\n\nLauren Hildebrand and daughter Allie, a Lawrenceburg High School sophomore, were among 3,000 fans from Hill\u2019s hometown in attendance, including the school\u2019s pep band. Allie Hildebrand was Hill\u2019s \u201clittle sister\u201d during the player\u2019s senior year and said handling her friend\u2019s illness was difficult.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t cry in front of her,\u201d Hildebrand said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get upset in front of her. That makes her upset.\u201d\n\nTears were conspicuously absent in the arena on an upbeat day that celebrated Hill\u2019s perseverance. Mount St. Joseph\u2019s coach Dan Benjamin said things got emotional afterward, but Hill wasn\u2019t having it in a game she has waited for.\n\n\u201cShe looked tired on the bus,\u201d Benjamin said, \u201cbut once she saw that floor, there was a ton of energy.\u201d\n\nThat was obvious when a smiling Hill entered the floor for warmups. Her mood lifted the spirits of several children enduring various forms of cancer. That included Cynthia Towne, 11, who undergoes periodic chemotherapy for an inoperable though less-aggressive form of cancer first diagnosed at 4.\n\nThe little girl from Cincinnati grinned widely as she gave Hill a specially made headband sporting the word \u201cBelieve\u201d with a yellow ribbon in the middle. Encouraged by recent diagnoses for her daughter, Katie Towne said Sunday was nonetheless bittersweet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for the joy of her getting her wish coming true, not only for raising awareness but also for being able to play in this game,\u201d Towne said of Hill. \u201cBut there\u2019s also sadness knowing that how much awareness she brings right now, she won\u2019t get to reap the benefits personally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s amazing; she did this, knowing that,\u201d Towne said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Player with brain tumor fulfills basketball dream", "title": "Player with brain tumor fulfills basketball dream", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/02/player-with-brain-tumor-fulfills-basketball-dream/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141102__lauren-hillp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141102__lauren-hillp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-02T21:12:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:50:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "CINCINNATI \u2014 Lauren Hill felt so good after fulfilling her dream that she felt inspired to play another game.\nMuch depends on Hill\u2019s health and energy as she deals with an inoperable brain tumor that has left her with just months to live.\nThat included Cynthia Towne, 11, who undergoes periodic chemotherapy for an inoperable though less-aggressive form of cancer first diagnosed at 4.\nMakes sense, since the freshman forward for Division III Mount St. Joseph\u2019s stirred a capacity crowd just by taking the court.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for the joy of her getting her wish coming true, not only for raising awareness but also for being able to play in this game,\u201d Towne said of Hill."}
