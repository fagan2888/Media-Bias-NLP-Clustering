We\u2019ll be sending this out on Fridays, always with at least one brand-new piece, like Nate Cohn\u2019s above. We\u2019ll also be giving you a chance to catch up on some of our best material from earlier in the week, and we'll give you a sense of what you can expect in coming days. Let us know what you think, via Twitter, Facebook or in the comments on this page. A couple of notes on subjects that have attracted high reader interest in recent days:\n\nLeo\u2019s Week\n\nAfter a recent surge of strong polling for Democrats, the Republicans have done better in the last few days. Thanks to encouraging polls for them in Iowa and (to a lesser extent) Colorado, our Senate forecasting model, named Leo, now gives the Republicans a 58 percent chance of winning Senate control. That\u2019s up from 50 percent two days ago.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Upshot In a weekly e-mail newsletter, get the best of The Upshot's analysis about politics, policy and everyday life.\n\nMaking College Fairer\n\nI\u2019ve written several times about the problem of high-achieving, low-income teenagers who then fail to graduate from college. Rather than attending a university with a lot of resources \u2014 like a flagship state university or a private college \u2014 many stay closer to home and enroll in a college with a high dropout rate. This week, I wrote about one program \u2014 QuestBridge \u2014 that has found ways to persuade more such teenagers to attend a top college; on some campuses, like Amherst\u2019s, 1 in 10 students now comes via QuestBridge. You can also check out our recent ranking of colleges based on their commitment to economic diversity. And you can read a study published by the Brookings Institution, which gives a good overview of the problem.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140919103108, "twitter": {"description": "The Upshot newsletter will be sent on Fridays, always with at least one new article and a collection of our best material from that week.", "title": "Introducing Our Newsletter", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/upshot/introducing-our-newsletter.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003123282"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "DLeonhardt", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/16/upshot/20up-emailpix2/20up-emailpix2-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/upshot/introducing-our-newsletter.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003123282", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/upshot/introducing-our-newsletter.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 19, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Newsletters,Polls and Public Opinion,Colleges and Universities", "news_keywords": "Newsletter", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "David Leonhardt", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/16/upshot/20up-emailpix2/20up-emailpix2-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By DAVID LEONHARDT", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Upshot newsletter will be sent on Fridays, always with at least one new article and a collection of our best material from that week.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/16/upshot/20up-emailpix2/20up-emailpix2-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "The Upshot newsletter will be sent on Fridays, always with at least one new article and a collection of our best material from that week.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 19, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/david_leonhardt/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2014-09-19", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Colleges and Universities", "published": "2014-09-19", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "20up-intro", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140919235704, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/upshot/introducing-our-newsletter.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/16/upshot/20up-emailpix2/20up-emailpix2-videoSixteenByNine1050-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Upshot newsletter will be sent on Fridays, always with at least one new article and a collection of our best material from that week.", "title": "Introducing Our Newsletter"}, "pdate": 20140919, "des": "Colleges and Universities", "articleid": 100000003123282, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Introducing Our Newsletter", "col": "Greetings", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Welcome to The Upshot\u2019s weekly newsletter.\nPhotoThe Upshot In a weekly e-mail newsletter, get the best of The Upshot's analysis about politics, policy and everyday life.\nMaking College FairerI\u2019ve written several times about the problem of high-achieving, low-income teenagers who then fail to graduate from college.\nWe\u2019ll be sending this out on Fridays, always with at least one brand-new piece, like Nate Cohn\u2019s above.\nAnd you can read a study published by the Brookings Institution, which gives a good overview of the problem."}
