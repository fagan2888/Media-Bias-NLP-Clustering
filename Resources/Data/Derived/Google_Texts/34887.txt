Nevadans for State Gun Rights (NSGR) is asking secretary of state Ross Miller to throw out signatures collected by gun control proponents–including a Bloomberg-sponsored group–because the signatures were allegedly turned in after the deadline for submission and were missing a proper affidavit.

The goal of the signature gatherers is to put universal background checks on the ballot in 2016.

The Associated Press reports that NSGR’s Don Turner says the signatures were turned in to the Storey County clerk on November 2013, which was a day after “the November 12 deadline.” Moreover, being late in Storey County caused signature gatherers to miss the requirement “to submit documents to each of Nevada’s 17 county clerks on the same day.”

Turner also said signatures had been added after the a notary public had signed and dated the document and a “required affidavit” was missing.

County clerks have until December 4 to “sample petitions and report any irregularities.” The Nevada secretary of state’s office will wait until then to approve or reject the signature submissions.
