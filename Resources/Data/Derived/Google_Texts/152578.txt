Sunday was the last full day for people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act in the current open-enrollment season.

Administration officials said last week that more than 10 million people had signed up so far, and the last few days before the deadline are typically among the busiest.

The sign-up deadline in 37 states served by HealthCare.gov was 2:59 a.m. Eastern time Monday. Some states running their own exchanges have different deadlines.

The health-care law offers subsidized private insurance to people who can’t get coverage through their jobs, Medicaid or Medicare.

Consumers who missed the deadline may still be able to sign up for health insurance for 2015 under some circumstances. Certain life events — such as getting married, getting divorced, having a baby, losing job-based coverage — can make someone eligible for a special enrollment period. If they qualify, consumers generally have 60 days from the date of the event to sign up for coverage through the health insurance exchanges.

If consumers do not have health coverage in 2015, they will have to pay a penalty when filing their 2015 federal income tax returns in 2016. The penalty for 2015 is 2 percent of the annual household income, or $325 per person for the year, whichever is higher.
