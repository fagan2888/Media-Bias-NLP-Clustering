The horses, including Percherons, Clydesdales and Belgians, pull replica freight wagons painted various colors to represent farms, corporations and family heritage, as stated in the program for the show.\n\nEach race is judged for first- to sixth-place based on the harness and wagon, the conformation of the horses and how well the horses perform and work together as they pull equally to achieve tight traces. The drivers follow the announcer's commands to walk, drive on or trot, back up and line up their horse or horses in the show ring.\n\n\"We're judging on action and performance,\" said Wayne Wareing of Firth, Idaho, the judge for the show. \"We want to see them working together as a team. We also like a horse liking what he's doing out there.\"\n\nThe judges are looking for precision in the horses' movements as they work side by side, said Brian Coleman of Eaglesfield Percherons in Didsbury, Alberta.\n\n\"It's just the challenge of getting the animals to work to their abilities, the challenge of getting them to work together as a unit,\" Coleman said.\n\nThe drivers want their horses to showcase themselves at their maximum potential, said Kyle Forsyth of Country Lane Belgians in Sunderland, Ontario.\n\n\"You want them to have pretty head carriage, enjoying what they're doing, and a fluid way of moving,\" Forsyth said.\n\nThe draft horse show is not a contest for pulling or speed, said Matt Deering of Donnell Belgians in Middlebury, Vt.\n\n\"We're out for their action,\" Deering said.\n\nShelley Widhalm can be reached at 669-5050, ext. 531, or swidhalm@reporter-herald.com.
