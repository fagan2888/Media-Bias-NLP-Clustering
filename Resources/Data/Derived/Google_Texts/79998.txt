Gutfeld honed in specifically on the missing email aspect of the situation and warned there could consequences if the Obama White House fails to admit a cover-up.

“It’s all a coincidence. Seven IRS staffers all understand investigation have computer crashes and there’s no way to get the missing data back, a coincidence,” he said. “Right. According to Rhonda Knehans Drake, assistant professor at New York University the odds of these seven drives crashing is 1 in 3.1 million. Add to the probability the probability of not being able to retrieve the data from each one and the odds are approaching that of you alone being hit by a meteor.”

“A coincidence, Mr. Obama?” Gutfeld continued. “Don’t paint a turd orange and tell me it’s sherbet. Coincidences are nothing more than order masked as chaos. Truly this administration is a mess but it’s a mess choreographed like a Broadway musical. They knew what they were doing and they knew the media wouldn’t mind. Calling it random is a slap in the face of the American public. Add that smirking commissioner and you have a gateway to war because once you lowered the bar this far for corruption, you invite blowback that will be far worse.”

“Imagine dear liberals if the next president is the kind you hate and imagine him coupling with coercion,” he added. “Movements begin not from anger but from desperation when a cover-up is so blatant and the press shelves their spines in service to their kings. You make the unlikely likely, the average citizen doing your job in the street. So the first step admit to cover-up one that makes a burka look like a bikini. And do it soon or the next response will make the Tea Party look like a tea party.”
