He says his chest hurts; he\u2019s having a hard time breathing and he\u2019s dizzy. Within four minutes, paramedics from nearby Los Angeles Fire Department Station 65 are there.\n\nParamedics examine him and determine that he\u2019s having an anxiety attack\u2014no reason for an ambulance ride. They talk to him, calm him down and educate him about what was happening. After a few minutes the attack ends. The man feels better, understands what was happening to him and thanks the paramedics. He is no longer in any danger, but still wants an ambulance ride.\n\nMinutes later, he\u2019s waiting at St. Francis Medical Center even though he does not need to be there. Once there, he ties up both E.R. resources and the ambulance and paramedics who took him\u2014waiting for up to three hours until a bed opens up.\n\n\u201cThis happens all the time,\u201d said Chi Kredell, a firefighter-paramedic who works at Station 65. \u201cA lot of the calls we get here are for people who don\u2019t need to go to the hospital, but we transport them anyway.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Watts Community Responds To Jordan Downs Redevelopment\n\nIt\u2019s department policy to offer transportation to anyone who has a medical issue, excluding a \u201cminor extraneous injury,\u201d such as a broken finger or a small cut. This means that if someone has a fever, a headache or an upset stomach, paramedics will deliver the person to an emergency room even when they believe the issue is not truly a medical emergency.\n\nIn many cases people who live in low-to-middle-income neighborhoods like those served by Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital choose to take ambulance rides even when deemed unnecessary, all with the public picking up the tab.\n\nThis is the reality of healthcare in Los Angeles\u2019 most impoverished neighborhoods: emergency rooms are filled with people who would be better served at health clinics or doctors' offices, but are either unaware of this fact or unable to pay for these services. Each call uses resources that take away from those who most need it\u2014precious resources including everything from ambulances and paramedics, to emergency room beds and doctors.\n\nREAD MORE: For The Morning Crowd Outside This Compton Health Clinic: A Double Dose of Waiting\n\nGary Izquierdo, another Firefighter-Paramedic, has been working out of Station 65 since 2001. He and Kredell work in what could be called the most challenging environment for paramedics, providing emergency medical service to Los Angeles\u2019 poorest neighborhood.\n\nEven for professionals, it can be overwhelming.\n\n\u201cThis battalion alone runs one sixth of the department\u2019s calls.\u201d Izquierdo said. \u201cThe six stations in Battalion 13, of the city\u2019s 114 total stations, cover about one sixth of the calls that the fire department receives as a whole.\u201d\n\nBattalion 13 covers most of South Los Angeles. (LAFD)\n\nBattalion 13 oversees six of the department\u2019s busiest stations, serving residents throughout South L.A., Watts and the Harbor Gateway. In 2013 alone paramedics from the battalion responded to 54,203 medical calls. Of these calls, more than 28,000 ended in a trip to the emergency room.\n\nREAD MORE: Health Food Trend Increasing In South Los Angeles\n\nIzquierdo believes that people in poorer neighborhoods are often less aware of what constitutes a life-threatening emergency; they end up calling 911 because they don\u2019t know the difference between heartburn and a heart attack.\n\n\u201cYou go to a place like Malibu, they have fewer calls, because people don\u2019t call if they have the flu, or a fever, a cough, are vomiting, or have diarrhea. Those are things that we get called for all day long. I\u2019d say that 85 percent of the patients out there, don\u2019t need a paramedic,\u201d said Izquierdo. \u201cThat\u2019s a rough guess, but for most of these people, we act as primary care.\u201d\n\nHe then described a typical call:\n\n\u201cI show up because he\u2019s been throwing up. I ask \u2018How long have you been throwing up for?\u2019\n\nThe guy responds, \u2018About a day.\u2019\n\n\u2018Have you taken anything or tried calling a doctor?'\n\n\u2018No.\u2019\n\n\u2018Have you ever had this before?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah, I got sick a couple of weeks ago.\u2019\n\n\u2018Would you like me to take you to the hospital?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018Okay, let\u2019s go.'\u201d\n\nWhen each call goes like this, it overwhelms emergency services, and consequently challenges their abillity to support the volume of calls.\n\nREAD MORE: South LA Could See City's Largest Number Of Obamacare Enrollees\n\nAny mention with \u201cWatts\u201d and \u201cParamedics\u201d in the same sentence likely conjures up images of gunshots, stabbings and overdoses. Although those sorts of emergencies do occur, it\u2019s critical to remember that the neighborhood is not the warzone outsiders often portray it as.\n\nThe reality is that Watts is a poor neighborhood, and its residents, by and large, lack access to health insurance, education and the medical resources that people in more affluent communities often take for granted. Steps are, however, being taken to increase access to healthcare throughout Southeast Los Angeles County. A new hospital, The Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital in Willowbrook will be opening in the 2015, providing care to residents of Compton, Watts, Lynwood, Willowbrook and Inglewood.\n\nThis hospital, while smaller than other local facilities like St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, will help relieve pressure on other nearby facilities, by adding 131 acute-care beds along with a 21-bed emergency department. (For context, St. Francis Medical Center has a 46-bed emergency department.) But for people who work in the area, the issue is far more complex than just physical resources.\n\n\u201cIn this area, you could throw as many hospitals as you like, and it\u2019s not going to make a difference,\" said Izquierdo. \"Unless you had an ER that had 200 or 300 beds, it\u2019s not going to matter.\u201d\n\nIzquierdo understands that this problem is one of basic health education, a problem he tries to address when on calls. He cited an example of a mother who called 911 because her toddler had a fever. Rather than immediately taking them to the hospital, he first asked whether she had given the child any Tylenol, Ibuprofen or even a cool towel under the arms. Then he explained to her what the steps she should take to help her child feel better.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day I asked her if she wants to go to the hospital, and she said yes.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Will A New South L.A. Hospital Open Old Wounds?\n\nAn Ambulance waits at PIH health in Downey. (Matthew Tinoco/Neon Tommy)\n\nAccording to Kredell, a majority of the people his station serves in Watts just don't know the basics of what to do with an upset stomach or bad cold.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of young families who weren\u2019t taught by their parents what to do, and think that going to the hospital is going to fix someone who has a cold,\" Kredell said.\n\nKredell added that there are other factors too, like mere transportation issues. When he arrives, he\u2019ll sometimes ask the callers if they have a car; often they\u2019ll answer no.\n\n\u201cI know right way that they have stomach pains and want to go to the hospital and can\u2019t get anywhere,\u201d Kredell said. \u201cAt that point I\u2019ve just got to shut my mouth, no more education, and just get this person to the hospital so we can help the next person. Sometimes I just have to write off teaching. And it sucks.\u201d\n\nOverall, Station 65\u2019s paramedics believe that people are not necessarily abusing the system, but rather the people calling 911 genuinely believe that there is an emergency occurring and that an EMS response is the only way to mitigate it.\n\nREAD MORE: Memories Of King/Drew Hospital: Life And Blood Of South L.A.\n\nElizabeth Burner, Associate Professor of Clinical Emergency Medicine at L.A. County/USC Medical Center, agrees.\n\n\u201cEveryone who comes to the emergency department is having some kind of crisis. I may judge their crisis to be not so severe, but there was a reason they came to the emergency department,\u201d Burner said.\n\nWhen ambulances are transporting patients with fevers instead of strokes, however, these varying states of crisis weaken the entire system. These issues are further compounded by the socioeconomic makeup and healthcare history of south Los Angeles. According to the 2013 Los Angeles Health Atlas, 39 percent of the residents in Southeast Los Angeles, including Watts, are reported as having \u201cfair or poor health,\u201d contrast just 7 percent in West Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cMost of these people are husband and wife working two or three jobs and barely making it,\" said Dr. Lee Weiss, Medical Director of Emergency Services at Emergent Medical Services. \"They leave for work at 4 AM and when they come home at 7 PM or 8 PM, they\u2019re not going to a clinic and pay; they\u2019re going to go wherever they can go the fastest, and they use ambulances to get there.\"\n\nWeiss's company staffs emergency rooms at 23 facilities across Southern California, including Inglewood Centinela Hospital, Hubert Humphrey Comprehensive Health Center and the Martin Luther King Jr. Multi-Service Ambulatory Center\n\nFor L.A.\u2019s poorest, getting healthcare becomes less about how to receive proper care, and more about where care can be received the most quickly and cheaply.\n\nBecuase it\u2019s federal law for emergency departments to not require upfront payment, \"people chose to go to them instead of urgent care clinics, because most of the urgent care clinics are private entities,\u201d said Weiss. \u201cThere\u2019s not a test there that isn\u2019t going to cost anything. It\u2019s a private entity; customer beware.\u201d\n\nViewed in context of a deficit of time, transportation and money, it becomes clearly easier for a person to hitch a MediCal-sponsored ambulance ride to the mergency room than go to a health clinic where they have to pay and visit during certain business hours.\n\n\"The number of people using EMS as a taxi is, not only way to high, it\u2019s alarming,\" said Weiss who sees the effects of this first hand as he works in Emergency Departments at various facilities around Los Angeles each day. \"We\u2019re using precious resources for a process that isn\u2019t valid.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Two Los Angeles Hospitals Offer A Glimpse Into Health Care\n\n\u201cThe problem is, for the county and the city, how do you say you should go to the ER and you shouldn\u2019t go to the ER,\" Weiss said. \"Especially in this litigious environment that we exist in.\"\n\nA Private Ambulance waits at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood. (Matthew Tinoco/Neon Tommy)\n\nThere is no easy answer for those in charge, especially when they have to worry about being sued if they make the wrong call.\n\nLitigation is a legitimate fear for public agencies. Already they are running at the constraints of their budget, and litigation is a tremendously easy way to hemorrhage money, especially in the field of medicine. The worry, paired with a lack of healthcare education and endemic poverty combine into the situation we see occurring now; ambulances and emergency rooms filled with people who would be better treated in a health clinic, but with nobody able to differentiate how or where these people shoudl be treated on the fly.\n\n\u201cAll patients shall be offered transport by Department ambulance, with the exclusion of minor extremity trauma where no circulatory, motor, or neurological compromise exists,\" reads the LAFD policy.\n\nA similar story plays out for L.A. County, where patients are not offered transportation, but the answer is never no if asked.\n\n\u201cThe real issue is how do we match the right patient, to the right provider, at the right time,\u201d said Weiss. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the things we don\u2019t do very well.\u201d\n\nConsidering the tremendous challenges associated with matching all three parameters for normal care, it\u2019s no wonder our emergency care providers choose to to transport everyone instead. They eliminate the risk of a big mistake, but it's still woefully wasteful, and fails to teach people the differences between a heart-attack and heartburn.\n\nContact Staff Reporter Matthew Tinoco here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is the reality of healthcare in Los Angeles\u2019 most impoverished neighborhoods.", "author": "Matthew Tinoco", "og": {"url": "http://www.neontommy.com/news/2014/03/parked-paramedics-what-really-happens-when-south-la-calls-911", "image": "http://www.neontommy.com/sites/default/files/Gary.jpg?1400342093", "type": "article", "description": "This is the reality of healthcare in Los Angeles\u2019 most impoverished neighborhoods.", "title": "Non-Emergency Medical Service: What Happens When South L.A.
