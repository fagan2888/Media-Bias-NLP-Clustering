John Fox will coach his Broncos by day and become a fan in the stands of Canton, Ohio by night.

After leading his Broncos through their Summer Scrimmage today at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, Fox will fly to Canton, Ohio and attend the Pro Football Hall of Fame induction ceremony as guest of former New York Giants’ defensive end Michael Strahan.

Fox was the New York Giants’ defensive coordinator from 1997-2001. Strahan had single-season sack totals of 14.0, 15.0 and an NFL-record 22.5 during Fox’s coordinator term.

Broncos assistant secondary coach Sam Garnes will accompany Fox on the trip. Garnes played for Fox and was Strahan’s teammate during that 1997-2001 period. Fox and Garnes will arrive in Canton about the time Hall of Fame ceremonies are to start at 5 p.m. MDT. But Strahan figures to be the headliner of the seven-member Hall of Fame class, so his speech should go last.

Fox and Garnes will return Sunday morning to Denver and be back in the office by afternoon. players are off Sunday.
