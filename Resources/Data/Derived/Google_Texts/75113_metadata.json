There\u2019s bipartisan support for the measure with Democrats (75/18), independents (70/22), and Republicans (53/40) all expressing their favor for it.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that Quinnipiac was publishing surveys in 2014 showing that the measure before the voters that year was receiving over 80 percent support at one point. The measure ultimately received over 57 percent support, but not enough to get over the 60 percent margin needed for passage.\n\nMeanwhile, 76 percent of voters in the state support increasing the minimum wage to at least $10 an hour, compared with only 11 percent who think the status quo is fine and another 11 percent who would like to eliminate it altogether. That includes 92 percent support from Democrats, 74 percent from independents, and 62 percent of Republicans for going to at least $10 an hour. There\u2019s also 69 percent support in the state for the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan, with only 25 percent of voters opposing that. It has 86 percent Democratic, 72 percent independent, and 51 percent Republican support. And there continues to be a broad mandate for background checks on all gun purchases. There\u2019s 86/8 support for that overall, including from 89 percent of Democrats, and 84 percent of both independents and Republicans.\n\nPublic Policy Polling surveyed 1,012 registered voters, including 464 likely Republican primary voters and 388 likely Democratic primary voters, this past Wednesday and Thursday. The margin of error is +/-3.1 percent for the overall sample, +/-4.6 percent for the Republicans and +/-5.0 percent for the Democrats. Eighty percent of participants, selected from a list-based sample, responded via telephone while 20 percent of respondents without landlines conducted the survey over the Internet through an opt-in Internet panel.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Rick Scott\u2018s favorable ratings have tanked to just 38 percent, according to a new\u00a0Public Policy Polling\u00a0survey\u00a0released on Tuesday.
