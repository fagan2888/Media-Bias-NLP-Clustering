The Board of Directors for the co-op, which received $65.9 million worth of solvency loans from the federal government, voted to cease operations effective Jan. 1.\n\nThe co-op is one of five insurance carriers offered through the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, which was established by the Affordable Care Act. Participants in the Nevada Health Co-Op were asked to choose other insurance providers when an open enrollment period beings in November.\n\n\u201cIt is with deep sadness that based on challenging market conditions, the Board made a painful decision to wind down operations of the Nevada co-op at the end of the year,\u201d co-op member and Board Director Stacey Hatfield said in a statement. \u201cRather than spending resources on next year\u2019s uncertain market, we would rather make sure we protect our current members. This is all about providing the most affordable, effective health insurance and service possible.\u201d\n\nThe co-op sent a letter late Tuesday to members alerting them of the impending closure, Davis said.\n\n\u201cWith a second year of high claim costs and limited opportunities for new investment, it has become clear that the amount of growth required to provide quality care at reasonable rates will be unlikely in the next plan year,\u201d Pam Egan, CEO of the co-op, said in a statement.\n\nThe nonprofit health co-op enrolled 14,000 members in 2014 and had \u201csignificant growth\u201d this year, co-op officials said, but exact numbers were not released. Instead, the co-op noted that future growth projections weren\u2019t large enough to continue operations.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the work done by NHC over the past three years to develop and offer both individual and group health insurance plans on and off the Exchange. Unfortunately, market conditions ultimately proved more challenging for them than expected,\u201d said Acting Insurance Commissioner Amy Parks in a statement. \u201cThe decision to voluntarily wind down its operations at this time is a reflection of NHC\u2019s continued focus on doing what is in the best interests of its members. The Division of Insurance will work with NHC to continue that focus and to ensure a smooth wrap-up of its operations.\u201d\n\nWhen the next open enrollment period begins Nov. 1, members can choose coverage with other insurance carriers. Employer groups can change coverage outside of open enrollment, so the co-op will work with those groups that wish to do so before the end of the year, officials said.\n\nFor coverage to remain in effect through the end of the year, members need to continue paying premiums in accordance with their plan rules, officials said. Members can continue seeing the health plan's medical providers, and claims will be paid under the same terms of the plan.\n\nHatfield, whose family became co-op members when it first started, said she was proud to be involved with the co-op's vision of removing barriers to quality health care, allowing people to access care faster, driving down costs and improving health outcomes.\n\n\"A big part of that vision is to responsibly protect our members, providers, dedicated staff and community stakeholders,\" Hatfield said in a statement. \"We made a hard decision, but a responsible one.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Nevada Health Co-Op, a consumer-owned and operated health plan created under the Affordable Care Act, is going out of business, state officials announced ...", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "The Nevada Health Co-Op, a consumer-owned and operated health plan created under the Affordable Care Act, is going out of business, state officials announced ...", "title": "Nevada Health Co-Op to close, leaving thousands to find new insurance", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2015/aug/26/nevada-health-co-op-close-leave-thousands-without-/", "image": "http://photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2014/02/21/NevadaHealthCO-OP_t378.jpg?42670983c634e7c20626cc4856c543752c0d8b2f", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "//photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2014/02/21/NevadaHealthCO-OP_r100x100.jpg?b3c07ccb2170322b6086abdb714037205a461b06", "creator": "@JackieValley", "account_id": 12055942, "card": "summary", "site": "@LasVegasSun"}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-26T11:25", "modified_time": "2015-08-26T11:35", "author": "//lasvegassun.com/staff/jacquelyn-valley/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2805\"", "article_summary": "Nevada Health Co-Op to close, leaving thousands to find new insuranceCourtesy ImageThe Nevada Health Co-Op, a consumer-owned and operated health plan created under the Affordable Care Act, is going out of business because of high costs, state officials announced Wednesday.\nParticipants in the Nevada Health Co-Op were asked to choose other insurance providers when an open enrollment period beings in November.\nThe co-op is one of five insurance carriers offered through the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, which was established by the Affordable Care Act.\nThe nonprofit health co-op enrolled 14,000 members in 2014 and had \u201csignificant growth\u201d this year, co-op officials said, but exact numbers were not released.\nConsumers insured by the co-op will be covered through Dec. 31, said Janel Davis, spokeswoman for the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange."}
