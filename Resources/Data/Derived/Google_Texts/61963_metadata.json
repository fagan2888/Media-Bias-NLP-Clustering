Miley Cyrus, Bill Clinton and Charlie Sheen, among others. Oh, and:\n\n\u201cTrailer parks, country music, golf carts, duck hunting, watching hockey, NASCAR, ask any white person they know\u2026 and they admit they know they crazy for sure.\u201d\n\nRawcus\u2019 manager, Swerve, told The Daily Caller the song was meant to be amusing, but he said he \u201ccould see how people may be offended.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can empathize with the feeling of not thinking something is funny. Not everything is funny to everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this case, every person has the choice to watch or not. The fact is we are all a little crazy. It\u2019s a human condition, and this video makes light of culture and believe it or not, is coming from a place of love and laughter.\u201d\n\nJamilah Lemieux, the news and lifestyle editor for EBONY.com, predicted conservatives will respond with outrage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a heck of a day at Fox News when they catch wind of this (it will be amazing to see them blame the other half of Obama),\u201d she wrote in an opinion piece on her publication\u2019s website. \u201cAnd I know the cries of, \u2018If a WHITE person made \u2018Black People Crazy,\u2019 you\u2019d be offended\u2019 are coming. \u2018White people crazy\u2019 is something that your average Black person says at least once a day. We talk about it at our monthly Black people meetings.\u201d\n\nSlavery, segregation and other forms of racism are crazy, she said, adding that black people are crazy, too. But it\u2019s usually because society has wronged them.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the rapper\u2019s racial identity or intention behind the song, it is a hoot and a holler,\u201d Lemieux wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s not mean-spirited or hateful and it\u2019s a good \u2018laugh to keep from crying\u2019 anthem for those of us who have been subject to the ways of crazy White people for a very long time.\u201d\n\nA note at the end of Lemiuex\u2019s column says, \u201cOne fourth of her, she crazy.\u201d\n\nWatch the \u201cWhite People Crazy\u201d video here.
