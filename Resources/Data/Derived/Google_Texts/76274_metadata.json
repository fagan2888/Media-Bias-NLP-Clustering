All three men are in U.S. custody. Houston-based Smart Power Systems Inc (SPS) was part of the same network, the indictment said.\n\nAlso charged are Arthur Shyu, and Hosoda Taiwan Limited Corporation, the Taiwanese trading company where he is a senior manager. Matin Sadeghi, 54, and Golsad Istanbul Trading Ltd, a shipping company in Turkey that employs him were also indicted, as was the Iran-based Faratel Corp, co-owned by Mechanic and Afghahi.\n\nBoth Shyu and Sadeghi are believed to be outside the United States and remain at large.\n\nThe U.S. has cracked down in recent years on companies, banks and individuals that have flouted U.S. sanctions.\n\nIn March, Commerzbank AG agreed to pay $1.45 billion to U.S. authorities to resolve an investigation of its financial dealings with Iran and oilfield services company Schlumberger agreed to pay a $232.7 million fine for facilitating the export of drilling equipment to Iran.\n\nFaratel and its Houston-based sister company SPS both design and build uninterruptible power supplies for clients including the Iranian Ministry of Defense, the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the Iranian Centrifuge Technology Company.\n\nFaratel is alleged to have received at least 250 shipments to Iran.\n\nIf convicted, the corporations face fines of up to $1 million for each U.S. sanctions violation, and the defendants face up to 20 years in prison.\n\n(Additional reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Susan Heavey, Ted Botha and Christian Plumb)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four companies and five people have been charged with illegally", "title": "U.S. charges four companies, five people over alleged tech exports to Iran", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/04/17/US-indicts-four-companies-five-people-over-alleged-tech-exports-Iran", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-italy_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/04/17/US-indicts-four-companies-five-people-over-alleged-tech-exports-Iran", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-italy_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four companies and five people have been charged with illegally", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde0c5\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four companies and five people have been charged with illegally exporting high-tech microelectronics, uninterruptible power supplies and other products to Iran through Taiwan and Turkey, the U.S. Justice Department said on Friday.\nThe U.S. has cracked down in recent years on companies, banks and individuals that have flouted U.S. sanctions.\nFaratel is alleged to have received at least 250 shipments to Iran.\nAlso charged are Arthur Shyu, and Hosoda Taiwan Limited Corporation, the Taiwanese trading company where he is a senior manager.\nThey evaded U.S. controls banning the export of the technologies to Iran under a broad array of U.S. sanctions, by shipping the parts via Taiwan and Turkey, the indictment said."}
