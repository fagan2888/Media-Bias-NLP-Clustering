KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — Two planes from an Indonesian acrobatic air team clipped wings and crashed Sunday during a practice session ahead of an air show in Malaysia, officials said. All four pilots ejected and are safe.

The pilots from both planes ejected from their aircraft after the jets went out of control and landed safely with their parachutes, said a Malaysian defense official who declined to be named because he wasn’t authorized to speak to the media.

A house and a car caught fire due to falling debris from the plane, the organizers of the air show, held on northern Langkawi island, said in a statement.
