Chris Christie criticized President Obama during a speech today, calling him a \u201cweak president who has weakened our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can no longer afford to have weakness in the Oval Office,\u201d said Christie. \u201cWe need to have strength and clarity and hard truths.\u201d\n\nChristie said that one of the hard truths that needs to be discussed are entitlement programs.\n\n\u201cLet me ask you this: Why would I talk about those things if they weren\u2019t true? There is no political advantage to talking about those issues. The reason you talk about them is because you really want to make suggestions that will help to solve the problems that our country confronts.\u201d\n\nChristie suggested lowering taxes on \u201ccorporations and individuals\u201d to spur economic growth.\n\nChristie said he feels Americans are worried for their country because of the \u201cabsolutely feckless leadership by this president.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll he cares [about] now, he\u2019s got his legacy and his library, the two L\u2019s,\u201d said Christie. \u201cThe two L\u2019s for Barack Obama, that\u2019s all that\u2019s left: legacy and library.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Republican in New Jersey,\u201d says @GovChristie. \u201cCome try that for a few days.\u201d\n\nChristie said that Obama\u2019s latest mistake was his decision to remove Cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list, calling it a \u201cnational disgrace.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Cuba wants normalized relations with the United States, they should act like a civilized country,\u201d said Christie.\n\n\u201cYou know, some people say I\u2019m too blunt, I\u2019m too direct, too straightforward. I think we could use a little bit of that in Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Christie. \u201cYou might not always agree with every word that comes out of my mouth, but I will guarantee you one thing: you will never have to wonder what I\u2019m thinking.\u201d\n\nAsked by an audience member about his brash attitude, Christie laughed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Republican in New Jersey,\u201d said Christie. \u201cCome try that for a few days.\u201d\n\nChristie hinted at a potential presidential run by joking that he\u2019d be back in New Hampshire soon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Jersey Gov.
