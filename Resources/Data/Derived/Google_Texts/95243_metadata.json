He also complained of a headache and started to vomit and doctors discovered that he had a blood clot on his brain. He had surgery to remove the clot and doctors put him in a medically-induced coma to keep down the swelling. He suffered a stroke shortly after.\n\nThe incident raised questions about whether the match should have been stopped. As Gordon Marino wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Nov. 8:\n\nLaz Benitez, a spokesman for the New York State Athletic Commission, emailed, \u201cAs we do in all such cases, NYSAC is reviewing the circumstances surrounding Mr. Abdusalamov\u2019s injuries.\u201d The referee, who in this case was Benjy Esteves, will seldom halt a contest when a fighter is still firing punches. Despite his condition, Abdusalamov was never knocked down and he continued his relentless attack to the end. Indeed, even in the final frame he was able to throw 32 punches. But some boxing experts say that this event shows that dangerous bouts should not be allowed to go on just because a fighter on the losing end is still active and punching.\n\nMr. Lewkowicz said Mr. Abdusalamov\u2019s wife, brother and cousin were at his bedside when he woke, and were overjoyed at his responsiveness. Mr. Lewkowicz said he remains in critical but stable condition in the intensive care unit, and doctors haven\u2019t determined yet the long-term effects from the injuries.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not up and walking around,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Lewkowicz said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to let him loose from the hospital just because he\u2019s out of the coma. He\u2019s got a long way to go.\u2019\u2019\n\nAbdusalamov is from Makhachkala, Russia, but moved to Florida when he turned pro in 2008. He went toe-to-toe with Mr. Perez for 10 grueling rounds on Nov. 2.\n\nThe New York State Inspector General\u2019s office said they stepped in for the New York State Athletic Association and launched an investigation into the fight. William Reynolds, a spokesman for the Inspector General\u2019s office, said the investigation is still in the preliminary stages.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Heavyweight boxer Magomed Abdusalamov was brought out of his medically-induced coma and removed from a respirator on Friday morning.", "title": "Injured Boxer Magomed Abdusalamov Wakes From Coma", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/11/22/injured-boxer-magomed-abdusalamov-wakes-from-coma/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AN321_nyboxi_G_20131122181655.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Injured Boxer Magomed Abdusalamov Wakes From Coma", "description": "Heavyweight boxer Magomed Abdusalamov was brought out of his medically-induced coma and removed from a respirator on Friday morning.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Tom Namako", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "Heavyweight boxer Magomed Abdusalamov was brought out of his medically-induced coma and removed from a respirator on Friday morning.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-11-22T23:30:17-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/11/22/injured-boxer-magomed-abdusalamov-wakes-from-coma/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-19165", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Heavyweight boxer Magomed Abdusalamov was brought out of his medically-induced coma and removed from a respirator on Friday morning.", "title": "Injured Boxer Magomed Abdusalamov Wakes From Coma", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/11/22/injured-boxer-magomed-abdusalamov-wakes-from-coma/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AN321_nyboxi_G_20131122181655.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-19165", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-11-22T23:32:51-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f81\"", "article_summary": "The New York State Inspector General\u2019s office said they stepped in for the New York State Athletic Association and launched an investigation into the fight.\nMr. Lewkowicz said Mr. Abdusalamov\u2019s wife, brother and cousin were at his bedside when he woke, and were overjoyed at his responsiveness.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not up and walking around,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Lewkowicz said.\nAfter the match, he went to the hospital to get treatment for a broken nose and an injured hand.\nHe went toe-to-toe with Mr. Perez for 10 grueling rounds on Nov. 2."}
