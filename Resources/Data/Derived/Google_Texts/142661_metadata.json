We're paying over one hundred thousand dollars.\"\n\nGraham, while emphasizing he was not in any way disparaging Balzano's accomplishments, noted that two other longtime division heads -- Senior Services Director Lorraine Hentz and Social Services/Transit Director Carol Novrit -- both hold master's degrees along with many years of experience. Hentz and Novrit respectively earned $83,620 and $118,196 last year, according to public records.\n\nStill, Graham said, \"there are other people who should also be afforded the opportunity to move up. To not offer them that opportunity demeans the dedication, education, and the investment in their careers that these two women and others have made.\"\n\nCrabb, in his email, touted the fact that Balzano, of Andover Township, is also a resident of Sussex County, which he said \"facilitates further her ability to grasp the substantive requirements of her office, arguably the most complicated in county government.\"\n\nGruchacz, the county's previous human services director, is a resident of Bedminster in Somerset County. Upon naming him county administrator last month, the freeholder board voted to waive the county's residency requirement for his position.\n\nInitially, on July 8, Crabb had indicated a resolution to create a new position of \"confidential assistant\" with a salary range between $92,976 and $142,279 was intended so Balzano could easily succeed to the position of acting human services director. However, in keeping with Gruchacz' authority as administrator, Balzano had already been appointed acting director of human services as of July 1.\n\nCrabb later said he misspoke when explaining the reason for the resolution.\n\nGruchacz, for his part, had nonetheless said the resolution would afford him the flexibility to assign an individual to perform whatever work was necessary within the county without regard to Civil Service job specifications.\n\nBalzano declined to comment for this story.\n\nEric Obernauer can also be contacted on Twitter: @EricObernNJH or by phone at 973-383-1213.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEWTON -- After floating and then distancing themselves two weeks ago from a proposal to have the county's transitional care coordinator succeed former Human Services Administrator Stephen Gruchacz on an acting basis, county officials now appear set to make the appointment a permanent one instead.", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey Herald", "description": "NEWTON -- After floating and then distancing themselves two weeks ago from a proposal to have the county's transitional care coordinator succeed former Human Services Administrator Stephen Gruchacz on an acting basis, county officials now appear set to make the appointment a permanent one instead.", "title": "Freeholders set to make Balzano head of county's human services", "url": "http://www.njherald.com/story/29602109/freeholders-set-to-make-balzano-head-of-countys-human-services", "image": "http://www.njherald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150721/ARTICLE/307219988/AR/0/AR-307219988.jpg&MaxW=400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.njherald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150721/ARTICLE/307219988/AR/0/AR-307219988.jpg&MaxW=400", "description": "NEWTON -- After floating and then distancing themselves two weeks ago from a proposal to have the county's transitional care coordinator succeed former Human Services Administrator Stephen Gruchacz on an acting basis, county officials now appear set to make the appointment a permanent one instead.", "card": "summary", "title": "Freeholders set to make Balzano head of county's human services"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1505744343029908}, "__sync_contentCategory": "Metered", "keywords": "Freeholders set to make Balzano head of county's human services, News,, News,", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": 20150721225614, "modified_time": 201507242314}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5f71\"", "article_summary": "Gruchacz, the county's previous human services director, is a resident of Bedminster in Somerset County.\nHowever, in keeping with Gruchacz' authority as administrator, Balzano had already been appointed acting director of human services as of July 1.\nA resolution on tonight's agenda, if approved, will make Sarah Balzano -- who began working as a nurse at The Homestead nursing home in 2010 and later assumed leadership of the county's transitional care program -- the head of the county's Department of Human Services at a starting salary of $102,506.\nBoard of Freeholders Director Phil Crabb, in an email Tuesday, touted Balzano's stewardship of the transitional care program, which was established under the Department of Human Services in 2012 with seed money from Newton Medical Center.\nUpon naming him county administrator last month, the freeholder board voted to waive the county's residency requirement for his position."}
