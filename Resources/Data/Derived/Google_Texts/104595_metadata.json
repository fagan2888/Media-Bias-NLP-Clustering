United is ready to make a comeback after last year\u2019s last place finish in the results standings.\n\nUnited coach Ben Olsen has recruited a group of league veterans and remade his team, which could like field seven new starters when it opens the season against the Columbus Crew at RFK Stadium on Saturday at 7 p.m.\n\nOlsen, now in his fifth season at the helm of the team, is excited about his new squad but urges caution.\n\n\u201cWe have guys in their prime and guys in their youth and all that looks good on paper,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cBut you throw eight new starters into a team it doesn\u2019t happen overnight. That can take hopefully six weeks or two months to get clicking. The trick is to get results early in the season. Columbus is not going to be perfect and we are not going to be perfect.\u201d\n\nOlsen then added: \u201cDo we have enough character to get points?\u201d\n\nUnited appears to have made the changes in order to answer that question.\n\nThe roster for the season opener against the Crew reportedly could look something like this: Bill Hamid in goal; Sean Franklin, Bobby Boswell, Jeff Parke and Spanish defender Christian Fernandez on the backline; Davy Arnaud on the right wing, Nick DeLeon covering the right flank and Luis Silva just in front of holding midfielder Perry Kitchen, along with Eddie Johnson and Fabian Espindola as an attacking partnership up front.\n\nUnited will be expecting a lot from U.S. team star Johnson, 29, who signed a contract with the club this week making him a Designated Player, meaning he will be the team\u2019s highest-paid player, reportedly earning around $600,000.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played with Ben Olsen on the national team,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI understand what type of player he was and what type of coach he is. To acquire me, at a challenging time in his young coaching career, says a lot about how much he values me and how much he thinks I\u2019m important to this team. So as a player coming into a situation like this you want to bust your butt for him and reward him at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nJohnson will play alongside striker Espindola, who Olsen calls an \u201cimprove\u201d player, and will be likely have a free reign on the field.\n\nOlsen feels he has the veterans that can stabilize the team that often many too many silly errors last year, especially on the backline.\n\n\u201cThe big difference,\u201d Olsen said, \u201cis we have a lot of problem-solving players and communication through the players. They are confident in what they know and they are comfortable enough to speak up and that helps me a lot.\u201d\n\nUnited need early results this season, starting with a win against Columbus to restore confidence in the club that managed just three wins last year. And Olsen believes he has the team to do that.\n\n\u201cA realistic goal for this team is the playoffs,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cComing off being last placed in the league we can\u2019t think about anything but making the playoffs. We\u2019ve a whole new squad. We have such a long way to go to really understand who we are because of how new this group is. But I like the character, I like the group, I like the experience, I like the balance and positives about this group, so if things go right, and we get a couple of bounces, and we start to create relationships and partnerships out there, we can make the playoffs for sure.\u201d\n\nSome odds makers list United coming in 17th in the 19-team league, with the Los Angeles Galaxy, Sporting Kansas City, New York Red Bulls, Portland Timbers and Seattle Sounders as the favorites to win the MLS Cup.\n\nThere are some worrying factors for United. Veteran attacking midfielder Chris Pontius is still a few weeks away from regular duty after recovering from hamstring surgery in the off-season and defender Chris Korb will be out for weeks after knee surgery.\n\n\u201cPontius is moving forward,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s never as fast as we want it to be.\u201d\n\nTeam notes: United also acquired midfielder Alex Caskey from the Seattle Sounders this week, and it will be interesting to see where he fits in.\n\n\u201cI could add some depth to the midfielder,\u201d Caskey said. \u201cI know with CONCACAF games coming up I could get in the team.\u201d\n\nJohn Haydon wrote a weekly soccer column for The Washington Times for 20 years.
