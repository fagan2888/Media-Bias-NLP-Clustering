In their conversation on race and American life, the president made the following observation as reported by the Huffington Post:\n\n\u201cWe are not cured of it,\u201d Obama told Maron on the podcast, which was recorded last week in Los Angeles but released Monday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just a matter of it not being polite to say \u2018nigger\u2019 in public. That\u2019s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not. It\u2019s not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don\u2019t, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior\u2026 \u201cThe legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives, you know, that casts a long shadow, and that\u2019s still part of our DNA that\u2019s passed on,\u201d Obama said.\n\nThese are basic and reasonable facts that accurately describe a society where there is obvious progress along the colorline (a black man named Barack Obama was twice elected President of the United States) but much work still remains to be done (e.g. addressing police brutality against black and brown Americans; a racist criminal justice system; the racial wealth and income gap; extreme racial segregation in America\u2019s schools and neighborhoods, etc.).\n\nEven so, the right-wing media have found in Obama\u2019s statement their new outrage of the day. As is their wont and compulsion, the conservative propaganda machine will never let the facts interfere with a good (and manufactured) controversy. Hence: Fox News and the rest of the right wing media are simply aghast at Obama\u2019s use of such racially powerful language.\n\nThe faux-controversy over Obama\u2019s use of \u201cthe n-word\u201d in a discussion about white supremacy and racial animus in the United States is one more example of how conservatives have hijacked anti-racist language and concepts such as \u201ccolorblindness,\u201d \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and \u201cracism\u201d in the post-civil rights era. Instead of abiding by the original intent of such language, as offered and used by progressives and liberals, the White Right has twisted those concepts to serve white privilege and protect entrenched systems of white supremacy.\n\nNow, racism (what is, \u201cpower\u201d plus \u201cprivilege\u201d) is distorted as \u201creverse racism\u201d (an oxymoron, a type of newspeak, as to reverse racism actually means that there is in fact no racism). The concept is rooted in the bizarre notion that it is white people who are the actual racists; rather, it is black Americans and those others who dare to talk about white privilege and white supremacy that are guilty of that sin. Similarly, when White America is asked to no longer use a racial slur, it is the former who are now somehow victims of \u201canti-white discrimination\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d racial \u201cdouble-standards.\u201d The ultimate effect of the right wing\u2019s deft rewriting and reworking of the language of race in America is to fuel a white victimology and grievance industry, of which Fox News and the Republican Party are the main purveyors and beneficiaries.\n\nThe ugly irony of this latest fake outrage is that Fox News, the Republican Party, and the white right more broadly have been calling America\u2019s first black President a \u201cnigger\u201d \u2014 normally in all but name, but sometimes even in plain speech itself \u2014 since his candidacy for president began, close to a decade ago.\n\nWhile some conservatives and their defenders will immediately object to such a claim, the reality is that there are in fact many ways \u2014 deployed throughout modern history \u2014 to call a black person that word without ever saying it outright. The word itself came into common usage in the 19th century, as an \u201cevolution\u201d of earlier words used by white people in the context of white-on-black slavery, rape, violence, and the Maafa. Language has symbolic power. Words can be inherently provocative and violent acts against the minds and emotions of those individuals they are directed at. (The law even acknowledges such langauge as \u201cfighting words.\u201d)\n\nBoth historically and in the present, as used by white people, the word does said work by demeaning black people, marking them as less than fully human relative to others \u2014 and therefore also uniquely subject to specific types of violence (spectacular lynchings in the 19th and 20th centuries; being much more likely to be unarmed, not a threat, and still killed by police in the Age of Obama) and marginalization in the West. In the United States, the word also marks black people as outside of the polity, a type of pollutant in the White body politic, and not worthy of full citizenship \u2014 signalling that black people should be extremely deferent, respectful and polite to white people.\n\nThe use of the word in American popular discourse is dynamic and changing. It was originally created by white people to dehumanize, debase, and defame black people\u2019s humanity. Some African Americans have tried to reclaim the word, and thus rob it of its power However, as legendary comedian Richard Pryor famously explained \u2014 and I am in agreement with him \u2014 the word represents \u201cour own wretchedness\u201d as human beings and should be removed from black folks\u2019 vocabulary.\n\nOf course, black folks have a range of diverse opinions about the use and meaning of the word. What is undeniable, however, is that Black America has paid for the word in blood, death, suffering, and pain. Thus, we own it. The word is not one that white folks can make a legitimate claim on, regarding its usage. To do so is to wallow in white privilege and white supremacy, as the debate is not about language, but about the basic notion that there ought to be no limits on white folk\u2019s behavior \u2014 even under rules of good taste and common courtesy \u2014 as requested by African Americans or other people of color (the debate about First Nations peoples as sports mascots is a close analogue to this conversation).\n\nIn post-civil rights era America, this complicated age of \u201cracism without racists\u201d and \u201ccolorblind\u201d racism, the use of the word has \u201cevolved\u201d. For example, the Republican Party has mastered how to capture its noxious energy and animus as one of its primary weapons to gin up white racial resentment without necessarily needing to state it outright.\n\nIndeed, conservatism and racism are mated in the Age of Obama. They are the Anubis or the beast with two backs. The GOP\u2019s core electoral strategy, as the country\u2019s largest White identity organization, was outlined by Lee Atwater 1981 when he decreed that:\n\nYou start out in 1954 by saying, \u201cNigger, nigger, nigger.\u201d By 1968 you can\u2019t say \u201cnigger\u201d\u2014that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states\u2019 rights, and all that stuff, and you\u2019re getting so abstract. Now, you\u2019re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you\u2019re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.\u2026 \u201cWe want to cut this,\u201d is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than \u201cNigger, nigger.\u201d\n\nThe so-called \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d is prefaced on the use of what social scientists such as Ian Haney Lopez, Donald Kinder and Lynn Sanders, David Sears, Larry Bobo, Joe Feagin, and others have described as \u201cracial code words,\u201d \u201cdog whistles,\u201d or \u201csubtle racial appeals.\u201d\n\nExamples of such \u201cdog whistles\u201d include words and phrases such as \u201cwelfare queen,\u201d \u201cblack crime,\u201d \u201cblack pathology\u201d; and references to black people\u2019s bad culture,\u201d \u201cbroken homes,\u201d \u201cdependency,\u201d \u201claziness\u201d and lack of \u201cwork ethic.\u201d This language has even expanded in recent years to include such phrases as \u201cmakers versus takers,\u201d fatuous distinctions about \u201creal Americas,\u201d as well as Mitt Romney\u2019s infamous claims about \u201cthe 47 percent.\u201d In the Age of Obama, the Republican Party, Fox News, the right-wing echo chamber, and movement conservatives have provided a litany of examples in which they have invoked racist attitudes toward Obama without actually having to directly utter that six-letter word.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the Age of Obama, conservatives continue their tradition of racial slurring \u2014\u00a0without actually saying the word", "author": "Chauncey DeVega", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In the Age of Obama, conservatives continue their tradition of racial slurring \u2014\u00a0without actually saying the word", "title": "The GOP\u2019s secret \u201cn-word\u201d politics: What their latest Obama outrage is really about", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/24/the_gop_is_still_the_party_of_the_n_word/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/barack_obama21.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the Age of Obama, conservatives continue their tradition of racial slurring \u2014\u00a0without actually saying the word", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/barack_obama21.jpg", "title": "The GOP\u2019s secret \u201cn-word\u201d politics: What their latest Obama outrage is really about", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The GOP\u2019s secret \u201cn-word\u201d politics: What their latest Obama outrage is really about", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, marc maron, Racism, the n word, The Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The GOP\u2019s core electoral strategy, as the country\u2019s largest White identity organization, was outlined by Lee Atwater 1981 when he decreed that:You start out in 1954 by saying, \u201cNigger, nigger, nigger.\u201d By 1968 you can\u2019t say \u201cnigger\u201d\u2014that hurts you, backfires.\nTopics: Barack Obama, marc maron, Racism, the n word, The Republican Party, News, Politics NewsPresident Barack Obama was a recent guest on comedian Marc Maron\u2019s \u201cWTF\u201d podcast.\nIn post-civil rights era America, this complicated age of \u201cracism without racists\u201d and \u201ccolorblind\u201d racism, the use of the word has \u201cevolved\u201d.\nFor example, the Republican Party has mastered how to capture its noxious energy and animus as one of its primary weapons to gin up white racial resentment without necessarily needing to state it outright.\nEven so, the right-wing media have found in Obama\u2019s statement their new outrage of the day."}
