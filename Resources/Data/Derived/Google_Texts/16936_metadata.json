And now it\u2019s taking it on the road.\n\nHouston is just the beginning.\n\nHaving won a rare victory against the LGBT Equality movement in overturning the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, the religious right is bringing their toxic campaign of lies to other cities around the country. In other words, we ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\n\nFirst, a little background. The reason laws like the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance exist(ed) is that cities like Houston, Atlanta, and Salt Lake City\u2014and smaller ones like Fayetteville, Arkansas\u2014are blue islands in red oceans. In Texas, I can be fired for being gay, denied medical care for being gay (yes, this has actually happened), and harassed for being gay\u2014because, religious freedom.\n\nDespite coastal misconceptions, however, not all of Texas (or Georgia, or Florida) is backward. Urban areas attract diverse populations, and living among diverse populations, it has been shown in numerous studies, dispels ignorance about them. So cities have often gone where conservative state legislatures fear to tread, protecting vulnerable populations like LGBTs.\n\nIn fact, this trend was behind one of the landmark LGBT Supreme Court cases, Romer v. Evans, decided in 1996. In that case, the City of Denver had passed an anti-discrimination ordinance just like the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), and the good people of Colorado passed Amendment 2 to expressly overturn it. The Supreme Court found Amendment 2 unconstitutional, because it singled out gay people to deny them equal rights.\n\nSo conservatives have gotten smarter. Earlier this year, for example, the state of Arkansas passed a law just like Amendment 2, except it didn\u2019t mention gays specifically; it just says that no municipality can protect a group that the state, itself, doesn\u2019t protect.\n\nThere\u2019s only one such group: LGBTs, who had been protected from discrimination in Fayetteville. But since they\u2019re not named directly, the law will likely survive judicial review.\n\nWhich brings us to Houston, the first major U.S. city to expressly repeal an anti-discrimination ordinance. Technically, HERO banned kinds of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation, veteran status, disability, national origin, and gender identity. However, since state and federal already ban many of these forms of discrimination, it\u2019s mainly the LGBT community that is now without protection.\n\nTo their great credit, the NAACP and other civil rights organizations still lined up to defend HERO, even though their core constituency didn\u2019t stand to lose.\n\nBut HERO went down in a landslide, 62 percent to 38 percent. Why? Because of the same right-wing echo chamber that denies climate change and says Obamacare is a form of Nazism, and that has enough money to blanket the airwaves until the lies become consensus.\n\nIndeed, the same \u201cusual suspects\u201d that gathered last week at the World Congress of Families in Utah were behind the Houston anti-gay initiative: Alliance Defending Freedom, Family Research Council, American Family Association, and National Organization for Marriage. They have been honing this messaging, and now they\u2019ve got a winner.\n\nWhere is this fight headed next?\n\nAccording to The Daily Beast\u2019s review of data collected by the LGBT Movement Advancement Project, there are 227 local ordinances more protective than state ordinances, including cities like Alexandria, Anchorage, Atlanta, Austin, Boise, Cincinnati, Flagstaff, Gainesville, Indianapolis, Key West, Laramie, Milwaukee, Myrtle Beach, Orlando, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh Sarasota, Sedona, Tampa, Tempe, Toledo, Tucson, and West Palm Beach.\n\nIf you\u2019ll notice, they all fit the pattern of relatively blue areas in relatively red states. Expect all of them to be targeted by the big anti-gay outfits and their major funders like the Green Foundation (of Hobby Lobby fame), the National Christian Foundation, Coors, Heartland Foundation (also the leading bankrollers of climate denial), Bradley Foundation, and others..\n\nAnd expect the same pattern of outright lies. Consider this post from conservative activist Erick Erickson, the founder of the hard-right website Red State: Tonight, the people of Houston fought back and rejected the attempt to allow perverts, the mentally ill, liars, and others who want to get in to opposite sex bathrooms.\n\n\n\nChristians and common sense won. Perverts, the mentally ill, and the gay rights mob lost.\n\n\n\nIt remains unscientific that men can be women and women can be men. But it has become an article of faith to the supposedly pro-science left\u2014an article of faith rejected by the people of Texas.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

It was a comprehensive equal-rights ordinance prohibiting discrimination in employment, medical care, public accommodations, and education. The phrase \u201cBathroom Bill\u201d is, like \u201cDeath Tax\u201d and Obamacare\u2019s \u201cDeath Panels\u201d (say, where are those, anyway?) a piece of market-researched right-wing propaganda.\n\nTrue, conceivably, one one-thousandth of its impact might be to allow transgender people to use gender-appropriate bathrooms. But consider the alternative: bearded, muscular men like this guy (transmale hunk Buck Angel) using the Ladies Room. Is that going to keep the chaste young ladies of Houston safe? Where, exactly, is Buck Angel supposed to pee\u2014nowhere?\n\nSecond, even if we buy into the \u201cBathroom Bill\u201d lie, there is not a single case, ever, anywhere, at all, of a \u201cmentally ill\u201d man trying to pass as a transgender woman to commit an act of sexual assault in a bathroom. Newsflash: \u201cPerverts and liars\u201d do not need to do so in order to rape women.\n\nThird, the science of gender is, in fact, well-understood by all people who don\u2019t have their heads up their asses. Tens of thousands of gender dysphoric people have received gender-confirmation treatments, and now lead happy, healthy lives according to their felt gender. This doesn\u2019t require faith\u2014only that know-nothings like Erickson open their eyes and ears and get to know some trans people. It\u2019s not rocket science, but it is the kind of empiricism that the GOP\u2019s flat-earthers (in Michael Tomasky\u2019s felicitous phrase) can\u2019t seem to manage.\n\nAnd yet, this scare talk works very, very well. Reframing an anti-discrimination bill to make it about bathrooms evokes disgust, prudery, and shame. Raising the specter of sexual violence evokes fear, horror, and paternal instincts.\n\nAnd that makes it very hard to say, wait a minute, we\u2019re talking about a handful of trans people, most of whom you probably wouldn\u2019t even know are trans, in the context of thousands of LGBT people who face very real discrimination every single day.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether the likes of Erickson eat their own proverbial dog food or not. Maybe they do, or maybe it\u2019s all just be a cynical ploy to make the world safe for their rightist agenda of returning America to the good ol\u2019 days of segregation, women\u2019s subordination, and Saudi-style morality police.\n\nEither way, the messaging was so powerful that many Houstonians had no idea that HERO was an anti-discrimination law at all. They sincerely believed it was some kind of social experiment, to let men use women\u2019s restrooms. \u201cIf I understand, part is about picking the restroom you want,\u201d one police officer told BuzzFeed before the vote.\n\nAnd now, this blizzard of lies is the template moving forward.\n\nThe biggest loser in the battle, other than Houston\u2019s trans population, is the often-deservedly-maligned pro-gay group, the Human Rights Campaign. It made the campaign a signature effort. HRC president Chad Griffin swooped into town to raise money, which is what his outfit does best, while 34 staff members were dispatched, reportedly, to do\u2026 something.\n\nAnd yet they lost, badly\u2014perhaps due to the out-of-state robo-callers, and the lack of outreach to communities of color and Hispanic communities, which after all, aren\u2019t in HRC\u2019s donor base.\n\nPart of HRC\u2019s strategy was not to take on the bathroom messaging. Instead of showcasing the LGBT community\u2019s best stories\u2014trans teenagers who are and look like cheerleaders being forced to pee in a boys\u2019 room full of bullies\u2014they sent in Sally Field to say namby-pamby things about love.\n\nFuck love. Activists should\u2019ve told the truth: the truth about trans lives, the truth about what the bill does and doesn\u2019t say, and the truth about the Religious Right and its network of funders. The truth about over 20 transgender women murdered this year.\n\nNow the corporations which are happy to receive awards from HRC in exchange for large donations (looking at you, Goldman Sachs, Accenture, Qualcomm, AT&T, CA Technologies, Coca-Cola, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, and Symantec) need to demand the NCAA move the 2016 Final Four to an arena that can\u2019t bar gays from entering it, and demand that the NFL relocate Super Bowl 51. If HRC can\u2019t win a propaganda war, it should at least be able to mobilize its stalwart corporate supporters. Right?\n\nWe\u2019ll see.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to dismiss the Republican retrograde caucus. Young-earth creationism, trickle-down economics, long-form birth certificates, liberal media bias\u2014all just a huge cascade of bullshit.\n\nBut sometimes the mountain of lies covers the truth and smothers innocent people beneath them. The Bathroom Menace is fake. But the 21 murders of transgender women of color this year are all too real. And now a vulnerable community has just been made more vulnerable.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "jaymichaelson"}, "keywords": "LGBT Issues, Google, Politics-LGBT, u.s. poli, Salt Lake City,Utah,United States, Houston,Texas,United States, U.S. News,, LGBT", "publicationDate": 201511050045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The Religious Right has found its mojo in the fight against LGBT equality: the Bathroom Menace.
