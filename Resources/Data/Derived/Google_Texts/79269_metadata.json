Instead, their time is now mostly occupied by iPads and other digital media devices. While it\u2019s not necessarily bad for them, it\u2019s not exactly good either. That\u2019s because scientists are still trying to figure out how the extra screen time is affecting their developing brains.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that it\u2019s so new we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good, bad, or otherwise,\u201d Tovah Klein, director of the Barnard College Center for Toddler Development, told the NY Daily News. \u201cBut there is a lot of other research that shows the main learning and sustenance for young children \u2014 particularly under 2 \u2014 comes from their relationships, particularly with their parents and whomever takes care of them.\u201d\n\nA lot happens during a child\u2019s first couple of years. Besides learning to walk and talk, they also learn about social interactions and begin to build the foundation for once they\u2019re in school \u2014 math and reading. These developments are only made possible, however, when the child is actively engaging with their caregiver, and even if the child isn\u2019t using digital media, a parent who is may be passing up an opportunity.\n\nMeanwhile, among children slightly older than 2, research has shown that only one extra hour of TV can lower a child\u2019s motor skills and psychosocial abilities. This is due, in part, to most children \u2014 or parents, rather \u2014 not using their screen time wisely. Out of a little more than two hours of screen time each day, most kids spend about 56 minutes on educational programming. Yet, even video series that claim to be beneficial to their development, like \u201cBaby Einstein\u201d and \u201cBrainy Baby,\u201d have been proven to be ineffective. If that\u2019s the case, why are more kids spending time on tablets and smartphones?\n\nA recent survey from Common Sense Media, a San Francisco-based media and technology research company that focuses on educating families, found that 38 percent of toddlers under 2 use tablets or smartphones \u2014 a big jump from 10 percent in 2011, the Daily News reported. Many parents allow it because they need to distract their child, and it\u2019s a valid reason, but it must be done in moderation. Using a tablet or smartphone is still a sedentary activity.\n\nIf parents have a difficult time keeping their child quiet at a restaurant or other public area, leaving them with a babysitter rather than putting an iPad in front of them could be a better option, Klein told the Daily News. Also, when the child has the opportunity to get up and explore, he or she should do so rather than being on a device. Interaction is also key, she said. Put the phone away, and show the child that you too can go without a phone. If the child gets upset about something, instead of giving them a device to play with, talk to them about what\u2019s bothering them, Klein said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "toddlers and technology, toddlers using technology, technology and child development,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Infants under 2 are using tablets and smartphones at increasing rates, and it could be impairing their developmental ability.", "title": "Toddlers May Fall Behind Due To Technology Obsessions", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/toddlers-obsessed-technology-may-impair-their-developmental-ability-275026", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/07/ipad.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Infants under 2 are using tablets and smartphones at increasing rates, and it could be impairing their developmental ability.", "title": "Toddlers May Fall Behind Due To Technology Obsessions", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/toddlers-obsessed-technology-may-impair-their-developmental-ability-275026", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/07/ipad.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/07/ipad.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-04-07T15:12:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-07T15:12:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Infants under 2 are using tablets and smartphones at increasing rates, and it could be impairing their developmental ability."}, "article_summary": "This is due, in part, to most children \u2014 or parents, rather \u2014 not using their screen time wisely.\nGone are the days when a simple game of \u201cpeek-a-boo\u201d or playing with Thomas the Tank Engine were normal for toddlers under 2.\nThat\u2019s because scientists are still trying to figure out how the extra screen time is affecting their developing brains.\nPut the phone away, and show the child that you too can go without a phone.\nMany parents allow it because they need to distract their child, and it\u2019s a valid reason, but it must be done in moderation."}
