Thanks to the Affordable Care Act in Minnesota, it\u2019s happening.\n\nRecent news reports found that after signing up for health insurance through MNsure, a number of Minnesota residents had liens placed on their property. A bill I\u2019ve co-authored would correct that.\n\nThrough no fault of their own, people are losing portions of their estate to the government. Most aren\u2019t even aware it\u2019s happening. That\u2019s not affordable health care.\n\nImpacted residents had sought health insurance in order to comply with the Affordable Care Act law. MNsure gave them only one option \u2014 Medical Assistance \u2014 and the residents signed up. Later, they discovered that their insurance would be paid for through liens on their estate after they had died.\n\nThe proposal I\u2019m co-authoring would require the reimbursement to the estate of any Medical Assistance recipient aged 55 to 64 who received services, other than institutionalization, retroactive to January 1, 2014. I\u2019m also supporting legislation that requires estate lien notice and consent to be given to residents before they sign up for Medical Assistance services.\n\n\u201cWe apparently expect consumers to read the fine print when the lawmakers who crafted and passed this legislation did not. Make no mistake, this is the fault of lawmakers, not consumers, and we need to address it.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "opinion,letters,opinion,letters,minnesota,legislature,schomacker,MNsure", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Globe", "description": "Sign up for health insurance and lose your property?
