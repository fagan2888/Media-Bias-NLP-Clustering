He delighted in telling a bald-faced untruth about Mitt Romney, namely that he did not pay taxes for 10 years. He now says the Koch brothers didn\u2019t pay corporate taxes. He calls the brothers, who provide jobs and legally participate in the American political system, \u201cun-American.\u201d His self-enrichment in Nevada is legendary, and he reportedly has been under investigation in a corruption probe.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) speaks with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington on April 1 after a Senate policy luncheon. (Cliff Owen/Associated Press)\n\nIn the Senate, he changed 200-plus years of tradition to supposedly break gridlock in the confirmation process (now even Dems won\u2019t approve the president\u2019s embarrassing nominees). But he uses the procedure known as \u201cfilling the tree\u201d to prevent amendments. He refuses to bring to a vote the overwhelmingly popular Iran sanctions bill. His only bipartisan instincts seem to be in hurling racial remarks, whether about President Obama or questioning Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s intellect.\n\nReid forever earned the left\u2019s admiration by jamming through Obamacare on strict party lines using a questionable procedure. Now those who dispute the law\u2019s ill effects are \u201clying.\u201d Reid survives because for Democrats he is, in FDR\u2019s words, a bastard, but their bastard. Moreover, if the MSM and liberal spinners acknowledged his misdeeds, the entire meme that the Republicans are solely responsible for political dysfunction would crumble. Reid\u2019s venom and procedural machinations, if fully explored and condemned, would certainly correct that misnomer.\n\nFar-right Republicans who are in the business of grievance-mongering and fundraising choose to make Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) \u2014 the pro-life, pro-First Amendment fiscal tightwad \u2014 the subject of their ire rather than Reid. It\u2019s a measure of how destructive that segment of the GOP is that they\u2019d rather vilify a Republican with them 80 percent (or more) of the time than go after Reid hammer and tongs for his serial misrepresentations, hyper-partisanship and far-left agenda.\n\nIn a sense, Reid is the worst possible Senate majority leader at the worst time possible. This president is famously averse to working with Republicans and all too ready to name-call and cast aspersions on their motives. With Reid there, there is zero chance for any bipartisan action or for a pause on nonstop political screeching. Reid and Obama reinforce each other\u2019s worst qualities.\n\nThe Republicans are probably heading for a big win in the 2014 elections, with Obamacare front and center. But Senate Republicans should also make sure every voter understands that the self-described \u201cmoderate\u201d red-state Democrats put and keep Reid there, allowing him to wreak havoc on the truth, on the Senate and on political debate in this country. Unlike the Kochs, he really is responsible for the dismal tone and hyper-partisanship of national politics; a demotion to minority leader would certainly be an improvement in the body politic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's never been a worse Senate leader than Harry Reid.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "There's never been a worse Senate leader than Harry Reid.", "title": "Harry Reid\u2019s toxic influence on politics", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/04/07/harrys-reids-toxic-influence-on-politics/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/04/03/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Senate_Policy_Luncheons-06ac8-2194.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/04/07/harrys-reids-toxic-influence-on-politics/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "harry reid and Koch brothers, harry reid and fill the tree, harry reid and mitt romney,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "harry reid and Koch brothers, harry reid and fill the tree, harry reid and mitt romney,"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe61b2\"", "article_summary": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) speaks with reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington on April 1 after a Senate policy luncheon.\nThere are few politicians more cavalier with the truth and more loathsome than Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.\nIn a sense, Reid is the worst possible Senate majority leader at the worst time possible.\nHe delighted in telling a bald-faced untruth about Mitt Romney, namely that he did not pay taxes for 10 years.\nMoreover, if the MSM and liberal spinners acknowledged his misdeeds, the entire meme that the Republicans are solely responsible for political dysfunction would crumble."}
