AUSTIN (KXAN) — Monday begins another opportunity to learn about insurance that can purchased through the Affordable Care Act. Insure Central Texas will hold a week-long pre-enrollment opportunity leading up to Saturday’s new enrollment date. Insure Central Texas will have staff available Monday through Friday this week at their Highland Mall location from 10 a.m. to 7p.m. to help anyone figure out what type of plan they could receive. Starting Nov. 15, all four locations will be open seven days a week. No appointment is needed for either time, and all services are free.

“We wanted to do a pre-enrollment because the window to enroll this year is shorter; you only have three months instead of six,” said Elizabeth Colvin, Insure Central Texas program director.

This year United Healthcare may join the list of health insurance options, and consumers could see cheaper plans.

“If you are already enrolled, you will automatically be re-enrolled in your plan, but you may want to come in to update your information and see if you can get an even more affordable healthcare plan,” said Colvin.

Those who need help enrolling are asked to bring information concerning income since volunteers will be tasked with estimating a person’s income for 2015.
