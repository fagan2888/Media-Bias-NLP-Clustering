Reductions in federal funding for Medicaid are adding to the financial strain in Bay County in Floridaâ€™s panhandle, according to the Panama City News Herald.

As part of the ongoing transition caused by the Affordable Care Act, Florida received about $400 million less in Medicaid money this year. It led the Bay County Health Department to ask two local hospitals to chip in $150 million for a clinic that diverts uninsured patients from emergency rooms, the News Herald reports.

One hospital which has faced $9 million in cut in the past two years declined, and the health department clinic closed in January, according to the News Herald.
