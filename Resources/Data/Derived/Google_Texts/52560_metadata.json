Florida Medical Center is owned by the for-profit Tenet Healthcare Corp. Hospital Corporation of America owns Westside Regional.\n\nExecutives who run the ERs say the stand-alone facilities offer similar services but faster emergency care than a traditional hospital emergency department.\n\nThere are now more than 400 such centers in the United States and the numbers continue to grow. In response to hospital closings in rural Georgia, state lawmakers approved legislation in 2014 to allow freestanding ERs so that residents can receive emergency care.\n\nIn Texas, Neighbors Emergency Center plans to open 24 free-standing ERs across the state within the next two years, The (Texas) Monitor reports. And the University of Colorado Health (UC Health) just announced a joint venture to operate the 12 existing and two planned First Choice Emergency Room facilities in the state, according to the Denver Business Journal.\n\n\"Patients absolutely want care closer to home, so they go to free-standing emergency departments,\" UC Health President and CEO Elizabeth Concordia told the Denver Business Journal. \"Through this partnership, our goal is to get many of these centers in-network with commercial providers.\"\n\nSetuil Patel, M.D., chief executive of Neighbors Emergency Center and a practicing emergency physician, told The Monitor that he saw a similar need in Texas. \"Your existing emergency room wait times were long and we feel like we'll be able to serve the community really well,\" he said.\n\nDespite the demand, the care offered is just as expensive as a hospital ER. The Sun Sentinel reports that an average charge for an ER visit in Broward County, Florida, was $3,737 and in Palm Beach County, the average cost was $4,675. Indeed, patients who go to free-standing ERs often complain that the facilities provide misleading pricing information. And critics say that many patients could receive less expensive care from a physician practice or urgent care facility, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Sun Sentinel article\n\n- here's The Monitor story\n\n- check out the Denver Business Journal piece\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nGA to use standalone ERs\n\nStandalone emergency rooms grow, but face backlash\n\nAetna sues freestanding ERs over facility fees\n\nHealthcare leaders dig into business opportunities in changing landscape", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u200bFlorida and Texas are the latest states to see an\u00a0increase in the number of standalone emergency rooms\u00a0popping up in high-traffic, commercial areas.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "\u200bFlorida and Texas are the latest states to see an\u00a0increase in the number of standalone emergency rooms\u00a0popping up in high-traffic, commercial areas.", "title": "Standalone ERs:  Florida, Texas, among the latest to embrace free-standing centers", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/standalone-ers-florida-texas-among-latest-embrace-free-standing-centers/2015-08-12", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,free-standing ERs,Operations & Business Management,standalone emergency rooms,urgent care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8309\"", "article_summary": "Unlike urgent care centers, the free-standing centers offer emergency care in addition to CT scans, X-rays, ultrasounds, clinical laboratory services and pharmaceuticals.\nIn Florida, Florida Medical Center and Westside Regional Medical Center opened new centers in West Boca and Davie, respectively, according to the Sun Sentinel.\nIn Texas, Neighbors Emergency Center plans to open 24 free-standing ERs across the state within the next two years, The (Texas) Monitor reports.\nExecutives who run the ERs say the stand-alone facilities offer similar services but faster emergency care than a traditional hospital emergency department.\nIndeed, patients who go to free-standing ERs often complain that the facilities provide misleading pricing information."}
