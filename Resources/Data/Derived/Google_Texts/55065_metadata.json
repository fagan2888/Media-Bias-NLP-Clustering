Chris Christie, who also is eyeing a presidential bid, at least it was no surprise. He\u2019d said three months ago he had narrowed his picks to Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul, and has blistered his fellow New Jerseyian\u2019s stewardship.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day `it\u2019s the economy, stupid\u2019 and New Jersey\u2019s economy sucks,\u201d Lonegan said in April.\n\nChristie beat Lonegan for the GOP nomination for governor in 2009, though he backed Lonegan\u2019s 2013 Senate bid and later helped him retire campaign debt.\n\nLonegan was twice elected mayor of Bogota, population about 8,000, where among other things he sought unsuccessfully to declare English the official language. He ran for a U.S. House seat last year.\n\nIn October 2013, he lost a special election to replace the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg by 11 points to Democrat Cory Booker, the mayor or Newark. That was days after the 16-day federal government shutdown ended. Cruz played a key role in the confrontation, by rallying conservatives to resist any budget deal that failed to defund Obamacare. Lonegan lauded conservatives for their role in the shutdown, blasting other Republicans for fumbling the budget showdown.\n\nStill, he blamed the episode for stalling his own momentum against Booker.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt in my mind or in the minds of any of my campaign staff that the shutdown cost me the election,\u201d Lonegan told the Star-Ledger after the loss. \u201cIf I had known it was going to happen and that it was going to be handled so badly in Washington, I wouldn\u2019t have run for the Senate.\u201d\n\nCritics in New Jersey viewed his admiration for Cruz with disdain.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about working together and all that nonsense,\u201d he said at one point during the Senate campaign in which he declared Cruz his role model.\n\nSince last August, Lonegan has served as director of monetary policy for the American Principles Project, a conservative group founded by Princeton University professor Robert George, a Cruz mentor at Princeton.\n\nCruz cited Lonegan\u2019s statewide advocacy against hikes against gasoline taxes, sales taxes and highway tools, and called him \u201ca tireless advocate for taxpayers\u201d and \u201cone of America\u2019s most fiscally responsible mayors\u2026.He brings a wealth of knowledge in both New Jersey politics and conservative governance to our campaign, and I deeply appreciate his support.\u201d\n\nLonegan lauded Cruz\u2019s \u201ccourage to lead our nation back to greatness in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need a President who will support our Constitution fearlessly and cut the size of government, not just slow down its growth,\u201d he said in a statement issued by Cruz headquarters in Houston.\n\nThe New Jersey primary is currently on June 7, the same day as California. By then, the race could well be over, so a New Jersey operation is no huge breakthrough at this point.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNi9jcnV6cy1uai1jYW1wYWlnbi1jaGFpcm1hbi1zdGV2ZS1sb25lZ2FuLWJsYW1lZC1nb3Zlcm5tZW50LXNodXRkb3duLWZvci1sb3NzLWluLTIwMTMtc2VuYXRlLXJhY2UuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
