She started to notice others staring at her, and quickly grew self-conscious but she kept on walking. That is until a staff member stopped her.\u201d\n\nAustin says that staff member then told her: \u201cExcuse me. We\u2019ve had some complaints you\u2019re intimidating people with your toned body. So can you put on a shirt?\u201d\n\nAustin was clad in a pink tank-top that revealed her stomach along with a pair of capri pants.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s anything crazy, but I mean, you can tell me if it\u2019s burning your eyes,\u201d she told the station.\n\nSee the original report by KTVU-TV below:\n\nShe says she had only been instructed not to wear a string tank-top due to the dress code at the facility.\n\nAustin agreed to put on the extra shirt, but while the first staff member went to get it, she says she was approached by another staffer who also took issue with her body. At that point, she had enough, asked for a manager to refund her money and then left the gym.\n\nPlanet Fitness, which boasts 5 million members, actively advertises that it bans \u201cgymtimidation.\u201d\n\nIts website says the club is perhaps best known \u201cfor our Judgment Free Zone philosophy, which means members can relax, get in shape, and have fun without being subjected to the hard-core, look-at-me attitude that exists in too many gyms.\u201d\n\nWatch a popular TV commercial for Planet Fitness about its \u201cno intimidation\u201d policy:\n\nAustin said: \u201cReally I felt like intimidated and harassed by the place that says \u2018No intimidation.'\u201d\n\nDerek Van Reheenen, director of the Athletic Studies Center at the University of California in Berkeley, told KTVU: \u201cIn a lot of ways I think what Planet Fitness is doing is a positive thing. They obviously need to iron out some of these issues but sport in the U.S. is by nature is discriminatory too, it is selective and it is elite.\u201d\n\nThe Planet Fitness management in Richmond, Calif., referred all comment to the corporate office, where a spokesperson said the company, \u201cstrives to make everyone feel comfortable\u201d and says the dress code is at the discretion of the staff and manager.\n\nBut Planet Fitness spokesperson Mcall Gosselin also said if Austin was criticized for being toned or fit, then that \u201cis not in line with the Planet Fitness policy whatsoever.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Gyms are supposed to be places to get fit, but a Planet Fitness in Northern California is gaining national attention after telling a woman her body was apparently too toned and intimidating other patrons.
