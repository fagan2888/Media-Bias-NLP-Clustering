NEW YORK (MainStreet) — The number of Americans who have health insurance coverage has steadily increased since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and the majority are satisfied with the health care they are receiving.

Fewer Americans lack health insurance coverage now and the rate of people uninsured declined to 12.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to a January Gallup report. In 2014, 17.1% of consumers did not have insurance and the rate declined by 4.2 percentage points since the ACA's requirement for Americans to have health insurance went into effect one year ago.

The Department of Health and Human Services reported that 6.5 million Americans either selected new plans or were automatically re-enrolled into a plan via HealthCare.gov as of Dec. 26, 2014. Before open enrollment began last November, Gallup found in its survey that more than half of those who were uninsured were planning to purchase a plan. Most people who were newly insured also planned either to renew their current policy or purchase another one.

The ACA requires that no one can be declined health care coverage because of his past medical history.

“On the positive side, it’s a lot easier for people to get coverage now,” said Carrie McLean, director of customer care at eHealth.com, an online health insurance exchange based in Mountain View, Calif. “The quality of coverage is also better with many preventive services available at no out-of-pocket costs. Just make sure to sign up before open enrollment ends on February 15.”
