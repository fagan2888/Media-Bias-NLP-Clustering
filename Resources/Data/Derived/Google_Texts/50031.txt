A nationally known political talk show host came back to his hometown to talk shop. Ed Schultz, visited with fellow hunters and anglers about his lodge in Canada at the Red River Valley Sportsmen's Show Saturday.

The "Big Eddie's North Country Lodge" has been open for 6 years. Schultz says hunting and fishing are his hobbies but he is known for his political views.

"Well I think Obamacare has been widely successful, we've got 10 million more covered, better outcomes, and the private sector isn't complaining, because the insurance companies are making money," says Schultz.

He says the Supreme Court ruling involving giving subsidies to low income families is very important. He says if it doesn't pass it would "gut the law" and he doesn't want to see that happen.
