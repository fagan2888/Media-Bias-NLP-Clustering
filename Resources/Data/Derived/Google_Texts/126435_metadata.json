Bush left office, his party has turned its back on him. Bush spoke at neither the 2008 nor the 2012 Republican National Convention. When aspiring successors to his former office mentioned him at all during the primary debates, they cited his legacy as something to avoid repeating. Yet Bush may prove much harder to ignore at the party\u2019s next convention: one of the most mentioned possibilities for the 2016 Republican presidential nominee is the ex-president\u2019s brother, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.\n\nAnother Bush?
