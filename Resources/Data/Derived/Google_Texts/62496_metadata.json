Quiet chatter, in both French and English, could be heard. One man, wearing a French colored scarf, shouted out to the crowd: \u201cSi on chantait La Marseillaise?\u201d (\u201cHow about we sing La Marseillaise, the French national anthem?\u201d)\n\nThe crowd sang earnestly, honoring the victims and waving French flags in the wind. At the end of the song, it was quiet, as if the crowd was waiting for something. But there were no organized speakers.\n\nThe chatter started up again, until the French Consulate General Pauline Carmona came through to the middle of the gathering and the crowd applauded. She said a few words, switching between French and English, thanking all of those present. \u201cIl faut se rappeler nos valeurs,\u201d she said. (\u201cWe must remember our values.\u201d)\n\nA minute of silence was observed in memory of the 129 victims. Carmona asked to sing \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d again. And the crowd sang again, louder this time.While hundreds gathered at San Francisco City Hall, the crowd was smaller than the Charlie Hebdo gathering on Jan. 7 at the French Consulate in San Francisco. But this crowd was no less mournful. Those who felt compelled to speak, raised their voice from their pocket of the gathering. One woman said: \u201cParis and San Francisco are sister cities. San Francisco has been called the Paris of the West.\u201d She asked for San Francisco not only to grieve, but to show its solidarity.From another corner of the crowd, a young man shouted: \u201cLibert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Following the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, Bay Area residents joined together on the steps of San Francisco City Hall over the weekend to honor the victims.", "title": "San Francisco rally honors victims of Paris terror attacks - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_2517.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-23T07:16:11+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/11/16/san-francisco-memorial-paris-terrorist-attacks/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "News", "tag": "victims", "published_time": "2015-11-16T11:58:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-23T07:16:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Following the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, Bay Area residents joined together on the steps of San Francisco City Hall over the weekend to honor the victims.", "creator": "@naomicornman", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/IMG_2517.jpg", "title": "San Francisco rally honors victims of Paris terror attacks - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Following Friday\u2019s horrific terrorist attacks in Paris, Bay Area residents joined together on the steps of San Francisco City Hall on Sunday to honor the victims.\nSan Francisco has been called the Paris of the West.\u201d She asked for San Francisco not only to grieve, but to show its solidarity.From another corner of the crowd, a young man shouted: \u201cLibert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9.\u201d\nOne woman said: \u201cParis and San Francisco are sister cities.\nAnd the crowd sang again, louder this time.While hundreds gathered at San Francisco City Hall, the crowd was smaller than the Charlie Hebdo gathering on Jan. 7 at the French Consulate in San Francisco.\nCarmona asked to sing \u201cLa Marseillaise\u201d again."}
