Published: May 21st, 2016 10:10 EST Thief Feels She's Entitled to Steal! Black Privilege? By Robert Paul Reyes "After being arrested Friday for stealing items from a jeweler in a Florida mall, Prolancia Aquila Turner, 26, was pissed.

Not at herself, of course, for hiding earrings valued at $12.50 in the waistband of her pants.

Instead, the crying and angry Turner, 26, was miffed because, as she told police, `Everyone steals from this store. Why are you picking on me?`"

When Prolancia Aquilla Turner was arrested for shoplifting earrings valued at $12.50 she burst out crying.



Why did she start bawling, you may be thinking:



It suddenly dawned on her that her parents christened her with a ghetto name that sounds like the brand name of a laxative?



She was embarrassed to be caught stealing cheap costume jewelry?



She felt contrition for stealing from a hardworking small business owner?



She had her natural hair tied up in a bun, not a good look for her mug shot?



She had an epiphany and she realized she`s destined to be a burden on society for the rest of her life?



Hell No! Everybody shoplifts she reasoned, why pick on me? Homegirl was crying in anger and frustration because the police had the temerity to arrest her for stealing.



I`m sure her next words to the police officers were: Y`all picking on me cause I is black!



We hear a lot about white privilege, but what about black privilege? Too many many blacks think they are entitled to a free Obamaphone, free Obamacare, foodstamps, and subsidized housing. This miserable excuse for a human being even thinks she is entitled to shoplift.



Turner has a long rap sheet, it`s time to throw this lowlife in prison and throw away the key.
