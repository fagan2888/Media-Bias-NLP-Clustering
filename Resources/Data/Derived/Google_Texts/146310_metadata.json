The fight has seen a faction of conservative lawmakers \u2013 backed by the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce (they themselves armed with a horrendously flawed study by tax-prep firm Jackson-Hewitt) \u2013 struggle to gain the three-fourths majority needed to fund the program they enacted just last year. On the other side of the battle are a band of conservative lawmakers who voted against enacting Medicaid Expansion last year \u2013 and their numbers are growing. To put it bluntly, the fight over the Arkansas Private Option is an intra-conservative-family fight.\n\nThe 2012 elections saw Republicans sweep into power in both of state legislative houses in Arkansas. While the new Republican majority in the state senate was significant, House Republicans managed to take the majority by only one vote. This slim majority helped create the environment for a showdown with Democrat Governor Mike Beebe over whether the state would expand Medicaid under Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act). Fearing executive action to expand Medicaid, Republican lawmakers cobbled together what they deemed a conservative alternative to outright Medicaid Expansion. The Private Option was born.\n\nFast forward to today. The coalition of establishment Republicans, conservatives, and Democrats who enacted the Private Option has fractured. Between the disastrous Obamacare rollout and the projected sky-rocketing costs of the Private Option, some lawmakers in Little Rock are fleeing for the exits. The State House failed by two votes to meet the threshold to fund the Private Option on Tuesday. In the State Senate, Sen. Missy Thomas Irvin, once a Private Option proponent, has abandoned the program \u2013 opting instead to side with the coalition of conservatives now pushing to defund the program.\n\nBut what just are the arguments against the so-called \u201cconservative alternative\u201d to Medicaid Expansion?\n\nThe largest objection to the program is cost. Under Obamacare, the Federal government offers a Medicaid match with the Feds paying 100 percent of the new costs at first. Then after 2017, the state would slowly take on more of the cost until 2020 \u2013 when the Feds would assume 90 percent of the cost and the state only 10 percent. Having the Federal government pick up most of the tab sounds nice; especially when the Arkansas Department of Human Services estimates that with the Private Option, Medicaid in Arkansas will cost nearly $400 million by 2023. But there-in-lies the problem, the odds of the 90-10 match remaining in place as the Feds tighten their own belts are slim to none.\n\nCongressman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has pointed out, \u201cThe fastest thing that\u2019s going to go when we\u2019re cutting spending in Washington is a 100 or 90 percent match rate for Medicaid. There\u2019s no way. It doesn\u2019t matter if Republicans are running Congress or Democrats are running Congress. There\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to keep those match rates like that.\u201d The Associated Press noted that even Jerry Brown \u2013 the Democrat Governor of California \u2013 when faced with his own fight over Medicaid Expansion had concerns over the Federal match, \u201cThe Brown administration wants to be able to get out of covering this expanded population if the federal government ever lowers its 90% Medicaid match.\u201d\n\nIn defense of the Private Option, the Arkansas Chamber of Commerce released a study by the tax-prep firm Jackson-Hewitt claiming that without Medicaid Expansion, Arkansas businesses would see a tax increase between $27 and $40 million. Already, the study has been exposed as little more than fear mongering.\n\nFirst, the base assumption of the study is that no employer in the state would provide insurance coverage to an employee who would qualify for Medicaid if expansion were to occur \u2013 yes, it assumes zero, zilch, none. That is a wildly irresponsible assumption. Why not assume that businesses would cover 100 percent of qualifying employees?\n\nSecondly, Jackson-Hewitt has skin in the game. The major tax preparation firms across the United States are acting as Obamacare navigators and in some cases offering monetary bounties for each person a tax-prep specialist enrolls in Obamacare. One tax preparation specialist told me that his firm offered $50.00 a scalp.\n\nThe Arkansas Chamber/Jackson-Hewitt study should be ignored two-fold. It is both flawed and biased.\n\nWhere does that leave, then, the Arkansas Private Option? Lawmakers could choose to leave the program in place and risk busting the state budget as the Federal match inevitably disappears \u2013 leading to massive tax increases on individual taxpayers and employers across the state. Arkansas lawmakers could do the fiscally responsible thing and vote down any further attempts to fund the Private Option.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 06:29:06 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The divisive battle in Arkansas over the alternative to Medicaid Expansion \u2013 popularly known as the Private Option \u2013 should make any Red state legislature weary.", "title": "The Private Option: A Bad Bet for Arkansas", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Arkansas-State-CApitol.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/02/19/the-private-option-a-bad-bet-for-arkansas/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "The divisive battle in Arkansas over the alternative to Medicaid Expansion \u2013 popularly known as the Private Option \u2013 should make any Red state legislature weary.", "title": "The Private Option: A Bad Bet for Arkansas", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Arkansas-State-CApitol.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "Arkansas,Arkansas Department of Human Services,Jackson-Hewitt,Little Rock,Medicaid Expansion,Private Option", "published_time": "2014-02-19T06:29:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The divisive battle in Arkansas over the alternative to Medicaid Expansion \u2013 popularly known as the Private Option \u2013 should make any Red state legislature weary."}, "article_summary": "To put it bluntly, the fight over the Arkansas Private Option is an intra-conservative-family fight.\nArkansas lawmakers could do the fiscally responsible thing and vote down any further attempts to fund the Private Option.\nWhere does that leave, then, the Arkansas Private Option?\nHaving the Federal government pick up most of the tab sounds nice; especially when the Arkansas Department of Human Services estimates that with the Private Option, Medicaid in Arkansas will cost nearly $400 million by 2023.\nFearing executive action to expand Medicaid, Republican lawmakers cobbled together what they deemed a conservative alternative to outright Medicaid Expansion."}
