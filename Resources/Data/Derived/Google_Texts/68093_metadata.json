And like most bubbles, it has more to do with wish fulfillment than reality.\n\nAs Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff observed in their classic This Time Is Different, \u201cthere are usually remarkable similarities of past experience\u201d linking manias that, in retrospect, seem so obviously unhinged. Believing that tulips are the most valuable commodities in international commerce or betting that house prices can only go up requires a suspension of critical thinking that never ends well.\n\nNow we have the absurd notion that the failure of an obscure Mississippi state senator to win a Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate is a blow to the conservative cause. It\u2019s a downright silly idea that, like all wrong-headed thoughts, doesn\u2019t improve when it\u2019s shouted. Chanting nonsense might induce a state of euphoria in Hare Krishna devotees, but it doesn\u2019t help win many arguments.\n\nThere was a conservative NRA- and Right To Life-endorsed candidate in the Mississippi race, one who opposed Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1986 amnesty for illegal immigrants, as well as any similar efforts by President Bush and Obama. Unlike his opponent, he was a veteran who fought the Obama administration\u2019s cuts to the military, including plans to reduce the Navy to a dangerously low level of ships.\n\nHe had a history of reducing spending when he was chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He had co-sponsored anti-Obamacare legislation with Senator Ted Cruz. When his home state last had a liberal Democrat as governor, he worked hard to defeat that governor while his opponent voted in the Democratic primary.\n\nThat conservative would be Thad Cochran, whom I walked neighborhoods for years ago, and had the privilege to advise closely in this last election.\n\nHis opponent, Chris McDaniel, campaigned with Ron Paul, who wants to tear down the border fence because it \u201ckeeps us in.\u201d McDaniel was one of four members of the state legislature who opposed anti-drug laws. He claims he\u2019s not a trial lawyer but gives Continuing Legal Education lectures on class action lawsuits.\n\nHe knew so little about public policy that he told a New York Times reporter that the military budget was a \u201csmall\u201d portion of the federal budget. Generally it doesn\u2019t help your conservative credentials in Mississippi when a Times reporter is correcting you on basic facts about the military.\n\nNone of these facts are disqualifying, but they also don\u2019t indicate McDaniel is the conservative hero he makes himself out to be. Neither does losing an election in Mississippi, which McDaniel did on June 24.\n\nWhile I appreciate that early death can do wonders for a rock star\u2019s reputation, there\u2019s little reason that losing a race should elevate an inexperienced state senator to some cult status. Conservative Republicans stand for personal responsibility. They usually find whining to be an unattractive quality best left to toddlers and MSNBC hosts.\n\nMississippi doesn\u2019t have an automatic recount, but no state that does requires it for races with a margin of victory greater than 1 percent. Most don\u2019t go to a recount unless the margin is 0.5 percent or less. Chris McDaniel lost by 2 percent but is insisting he \u201cwon\u2019t surrender.\u201d It\u2019s reminiscent of when Hillary Clinton had clearly lost to Barack Obama in 2008 but said she was taking time to \u201cconsider her options\u201d rather than immediately conceding. Options? You lost.\n\nThis time next year, odds are that Thad Cochran will still be a U.S. senator and Chris McDaniel will be back where he started, on the talk radio circuit. To be sure, there\u2019s no problem with any citizen exhausting all legal options in any situation, but what\u2019s troubling about the McDaniel hoopla is what it might say about the future of conservatism.\n\nMaybe I\u2019m old school, but I still believe conservatism\u2019s goal should be to serve as a serious, grounded governing philosophy. It certainly was that during Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency, a man Chris McDaniel holds out to be his hero.\n\nBut if that conservative ideal of governance is nudged aside and replaced by something that\u2019s just a rallying cry for angry lost causes, it\u2019s hard to imagine how the left won\u2019t win. And when you look around and see how many oddball groups are using the McDaniel loss as a fundraising gimmick, it\u2019s even more depressing.\n\nIf that vision of a \u201cshining city on a hill\u201d is replaced by a cul de sac where opportunists gather to raise money from the bitter, conservatism will start to resemble everything Ronald Reagan opposed.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

I get that supporting a longtime incumbent like Senator Thad Cochran rubs some people the wrong way. Fine. That\u2019s why we have elections. But let\u2019s not allow disappointment after a close election push us into embracing a mean, unserious, self-defeating version of conservatism.\n\nChris McDaniel is now saying the \u201celection was stolen\u201d without providing a shred of evidence. It\u2019s an extraordinarily irresponsible statement by an elected official. On Monday, his lawyer, who was last seen losing to Haley Barbour in a run for governor by almost 60 points, made allegations of voter fraud, again without evidence. This is exactly the sort of \u201cthrow it up against the wall and see what sticks\u201d legal approach we Republicans ridiculed Al Gore for in the Florida recount.\n\nThe Supreme Court ended that sad chapter. Ultimately, we are a country of laws and despite what Chris McDaniel seems to believe, losing an election is not proof that a system was rigged.
