The store\u2019s lawyers successfully argued that the company is a religious \u201cperson,\u201d and can\u2019t be compelled to violate certain religious beliefs.\n\nYes. That\u2019s right. Arts and craft stores are people now. This is the world we live in.\n\nAnd you can probably see where this is going. If any company can circumvent any law by claiming religious belief, then anti-discrimination laws don\u2019t mean a whole heck of a lot. This could mean the beginning of a lot of Supreme-Court-approved antigay animus from businesses who can now claim that Jesus told them to stone their gay customers.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that a craft store could be antigay, for heaven\u2019s sake. But Hobby Lobby works hand-in-hand with the Alliance Defending Freedom, the same group pushing lawsuits around the country. So when you buy pipe cleaners and thumbtacks at the store, you\u2019re part of the vast antigay conspiracy.\n\nIn other words, you might want to think carefully about where to shop when you need new scrapbooking supplies. We hear nice things about Michael\u2019s, and we know all you artistic gays buy lots and lots of craft supplies.\n\nHobby Lobby\u2019s no stranger to charges of discrimination. Back in 1999, there were a flurry of reports of anti-gay Hobby Lobby employees at Colorado stores, although nothing ever seems to have been corroborated. And there were accusations of anti-Semetism at a New Jersey store in 2013. (The chain carried Christmas decorations, but nothing for Jewish holidays.) They have 550 stores all over the country, so you probably have one close to you.\n\nSo here we are: this week the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether to take the case. And soon, they could rule that a strongly-held belief is more important than the rule of law. Better stock up on yarn now before things get any more testy.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado, Hobby Lobby, Supreme Court", "og": {"site_name": "Queerty", "description": "We might not have any major marriage equality questions before the U.S. Supreme Court this session, but at least one case could significantly affect life for LGBTs.
