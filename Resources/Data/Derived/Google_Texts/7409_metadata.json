Essentially, the new treatment makes the brain more receptive to the type of \u201cmemory cleansing\u201d that psychotherapy is designed to induce. It works by suppressing a gene called HDAC2.\n\n\"By inhibiting HDAC2 activity, we can drive dramatic structural changes in the brain,\u201d Tsai explained. \u201cWhat happens is the brain becomes more plastic, more capable of forming very strong new memories that will override the old fearful memories.\"\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t do graduate work in neuroscience or psychology: A more \u201cplastic\u201d brain doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with texture or material but rather its ability to grow and form new neuronal connections. Scientists refer to this quality as \u201cneuroplasticity.\u201d In psychotherapy, where a therapist tries to help the PTSD victim by triggering the traumatic memory in a safe environment, the degree of plasticity is closely related to efficacy of the treatment, as it more or less determines the brain\u2019s malleability.\n\nSometimes, a patient\u2019s mental malleability is on point, and the traumatic memory can be subdued with the help of a therapist. But with combat veterans, abused children, and other patients for whom the traumatic memory is older and more remote, it is not always that simple, as the fear may have become a fundamental part of the psyche itself. What the current findings show is that these deeply rooted fears can be \u201cloosened\u201d with the help of HDAC2 inhibitors.\n\nLearning and Unlearning\n\nFor the study, Tsai and her colleagues conditioned a group of lab mice to fear a certain chamber by administering a mild foot shock whenever they entered it. Soon enough, none of the mice wanted anything to do with the chamber. The team then tried to remove this fear through exposure-based psychotherapy \u2014 which, in this case, meant placing the mice in the chamber without administering the shock.\n\nThis low-brow simulation of PTSD therapy worked fine when the mice\u2019s memories had been formed within 24 hours of the intervention. After a while, the traumatic memory was \u201cdeleted,\u201d and the mice were able to go about their business as usual. But when the team attempted to do the same with mice who had formed the memory 30 days earlier, the trauma appeared to persist in each subject\u2019s brain.\n\nHere\u2019s where the new HDAC2 inhibitors come in. By administering these drugs throughout the therapy session, the team was able to extinguish month-old memories as easy as day-old trauma. \"If you do something within this window of time, then you have the possibility of modifying the memory or forming a new trace of memory that actually instructs the animal that this is not such a dangerous place,\" Tsai explained. \"However, the older the memory is, the harder it is to really change that memory.\"\n\nDeleting Memories\n\nFor people living PTSD, this is great news. But does it mean that we\u2019re entering an era in which physicians, psychologists, and researchers will be able to cherry-pick our minds and erase all unwanted memories? Will it be like that movie where Jim Carrey swears off women and scraps the memory of Kate Winslet, only to run into her on a train and start the whole thing all over again?\n\nIn an email to Medical Daily, Tsai explained that the new therapy is not really a way to delete past experiences altogether. Memories, it seems, are often far too complex to be pulled out by the root. Instead, it\u2019s more accurate to imagine the therapy as something that strips the memory of its phobic \u201cedge.\u201d Essentially, \u201ca condition initially associates with fear, is no longer associated with fear following the treatment,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn the end, the memory stays with you but in a form that doesn\u2019t evoke fear or anxiety. Perhaps it is better that way.\n\nSource: Graff J, Joseph NF, Horn ME, Tsai L. \u201cEpigenetic Priming of Memory Updating during Reconsolidation to Attenuate Remote Fear Memories.\u201d Cell. 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "deleting memories, ptsd traumatic memories, ptsd psychotherapy, gene therapy, exposure-based therapy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new type of gene therapy makes it much easier to \"delete\" traumatic memories with exposure-based psychotherapy.", "title": "Drug That 'Deletes' Memories Could Transform PTSD Treatment", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/genetic-therapy-deletes-traumatic-memories-could-aid-ptsd-treatment-267279", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/16/ptsd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new type of gene therapy makes it much easier to \"delete\" traumatic memories with exposure-based psychotherapy.", "title": "Drug That 'Deletes' Memories Could Transform PTSD Treatment", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/genetic-therapy-deletes-traumatic-memories-could-aid-ptsd-treatment-267279", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/16/ptsd.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/16/ptsd.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-01-16T16:13:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-16T16:13:01-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new type of gene therapy makes it much easier to \"delete\" traumatic memories with exposure-based psychotherapy."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc997e\"", "article_summary": "Sometimes, a patient\u2019s mental malleability is on point, and the traumatic memory can be subdued with the help of a therapist.\nThis low-brow simulation of PTSD therapy worked fine when the mice\u2019s memories had been formed within 24 hours of the intervention.\n\"By inhibiting HDAC2 activity, we can drive dramatic structural changes in the brain,\u201d Tsai explained.\nAfter a while, the traumatic memory was \u201cdeleted,\u201d and the mice were able to go about their business as usual.\nSource: Graff J, Joseph NF, Horn ME, Tsai L. \u201cEpigenetic Priming of Memory Updating during Reconsolidation to Attenuate Remote Fear Memories.\u201d Cell."}
