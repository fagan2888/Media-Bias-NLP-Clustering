REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTR3T414\n\n4248548\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid is so angry over the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 decision in the Hobby Lobby contraception case last week that he apparently forgot Justice Clarence Thomas is black.\n\nThe Nevada Democrat lamented the court\u2019s ruling which allows Hobby Lobby and other for-profit companies with religious objections to certain forms of contraception to avoid providing them to employees in health insurance plans mandated under Obamacare.\n\nHobby Lobby approves of 16 out of 20 forms of contraception that have been approved by the FDA.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to have to walk down here and vote, and if they vote with the five men on the Supreme Court, I think it\u2019s \u2014 they\u2019re going to have \u2014 be treated unfavorably come November with the elections,\u201d Reid told reporters on Tuesday, according to ABC.\n\nThe Senate will act soon to \u201censure that women\u2019s lives are not determined by virtue of five white men,\u201d Reid added.\n\nBut his reference to \u201cfive white men\u201d was off by 20 percent.\n\nOnly four of the male justices who sided with Hobby Lobby \u2014 John Roberts, Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy \u2014 are white. The other \u2014 Clarence Thomas \u2014 is black.\n\nIn his comments Tuesday, Reid challenged Republican senators to cast a vote in favor of a legislative fix that he and other Democrats will soon be pushing. A vote against the proposal, claims Reid, will hurt the GOP at the polls in November.\n\nThe effort, which will be led by Democratic U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, will seek to fill the \u201ccontraceptive coverage gap\u201d for women whose companies, citing religious principles, choose not to provide coverage for contraceptives.\n\nReid has said that the Senate will act \u201cin coming weeks.\u201d\n\nReid has made insensitive remarks about race in the past. He apologized for comments he made during the 2008 presidential campaign when he said that then-Senator Obama being \u201clight-skinned\u201d in appearance and \u201cwith no Negro dialect\u201d would benefit him in the election.\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "'Five white men'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is so angry over the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in the Hobby Lobby contraception case last week that he apparently forgot Justice Clarence Thomas is black.
