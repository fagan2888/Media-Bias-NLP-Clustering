Figuring out where these places were turned out to be tricky, however. After some inquiries, the New York Department of Health sent me a spreadsheet with every restaurant in New York sorted by the number of health code violations it received during its last inspection. The places with few or no violations get an A grade, those with more violations get B\u2019s or C\u2019s, and the really bad spots get shut down. On the surface, this appears to be a pretty straightforward way of mapping out the worst restaurants. But of course it\u2019s actually more complicated than that.\n\nInspectors subtract points (out of 1,000) for various violations, and some of these have nothing to do with cleanliness\u2014restaurants can get dinged for not having a choking sign or for not having proper ventilation over a panini press. It doesn\u2019t take much to knock an A down to a B, and as one chef complained on CNN\u2019s Eatocracy blog, \u201cThe violations game is completely open to the whims of the given inspector on the given day. That\u2019s how one of Restaurant magazine\u2019s top 50 establishments of 2014, Per Se, got slapped with a C rating this year, while the deli near my house can get an A even though the sandwich guy always has a snotty nose.\n\nWhat this means for my project, though, is that I couldn\u2019t go by grade alone\u2014so for my purposes I picked a cross-section of restaurants, some with poor health ratings, some with really disgusting Yelp reviews, and one Chinese spot that my roommate swears gave him the worst food poisoning of his life.\n\nPhotos by Meredith Jenks\n\nI grabbed my trusty photographer Meredith, who, bless her heart, consistently agrees to watch me do a variety of bad things to my body. Our first stop was Chinatown, specifically a restaurant called Pho Bang, which bagged 47 violation points during an inspection last summer.\n\nI am not exactly a food critic. I would describe my eating habits as \u201cgarbage disposal-esque.\u201d Food-cart burritos, beef patties, bits of chicken that\u2019s been sitting under heat lamps for hours\u2014I eat it all, I enjoy it, and I tend to shrug off what others might regard as culinary red flags. In high school, I lived on prepackaged supermarket sushi for longer than was probably appropriate. All that\u2019s to say I wasn\u2019t too concerned about any of the places on my itinerary, especially not Pho Bang, which is an old haunt of mine. It seemed clean and delicious every time I\u2019ve been there. At least clean enough for me.\n\nMeredith and I grabbed a big table and soon the waiter seated another pair of Pho Bang customers with us\u2014one of them was a hairstylist for Project Runway and the second was a makeup artist. When I told them what I was doing, they sang Pho Bang\u2019s praises and immediately ordered the entire menu to prove that everything was good. The hairstylist even fed me a bite of some strange egg-based loaf with glass noodles inside.\n\nThe meat in my pho was raw, but that\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to be. It cooked quickly in the broth, and I piled in fistfuls of bean sprouts and mint, inhaling the aroma. A distant voice in my head dutifully reminded me of the Salmonella-infected bean sprout epidemicthat\u2019s been ravaging New York City recently, but I shrugged that that as not being in the spirit of things.\n\nBellies full of pho and whatever else the hairstylist fed me, Meredith and I then went up to Midtown to grab the second of our many meals, at the Warwick Hotel\u2019s Murals on 54. It\u2019s the sort of place that sells a fruit salad for roughly the price of an orchard, but it lost a whopping 121 points in an inspection last March\u2014more than any other restaurant I could find.\n\nWe arrived at quarter to three, but Mural\u2019s revolving doors wouldn\u2019t budge\u2014it closed 15 minutes before we got there, according to a sign outside. Where was I supposed to eat a potentially hazardous lunch?\n\nLuckily, there was a Halal cart only a few blocks away that blew up the internet a few weeks ago after someone snapped a picture of a bunch of pigeons picking meat directly off the grill. I ran over and bought a heaping pile of chicken and yellow rice doused in something that tasted like bleu cheese dressing. When I sat down to feast a swarm of pigeons descended on me, all vying for a bite. The cart must have the pigeon equivalent of three Michelin stars.\n\nOnly a small section of the aforementioned pigeon swarm\n\nI figured if it was good enough for flying rats that eat literal garbage it was good enough for me, so I gobbled it down and Meredith and I hopped on the subway to see what sort of delicious, bacteria-ridden cuisines the outer boroughs have to offer.\n\nWe ended up at Clinton Hill\u2019s Golden Hing, one of the city\u2019s countless hole-in-the-wall Chinese joints. What distinguished it from all the other slightly shady spots in Brooklyn is that it gave my roommate the worst case of food poisoning he\u2019s ever had. I went straight for the beef with oyster sauce, since that was what he warned me against.\n\nThe beef melted in my mouth, which is not really something that cooked cow is supposed to do, and the \u201coyster\u201d sauce had the consistency of molasses. I wouldn\u2019t have been particularly surprised to find that the meat was made of crickets, like the Jell-O nutrient slabs the poor folks eat in Snowpiercer. (That\u2019s not to say I\u2019ve got anything against eating crickets. When I was seven years old, someone gave me a lollipop with a huge cricket suspended inside, and I was so impressed with the thing that I refused to eat it. Instead, I kept it in the glove compartment of my dad\u2019s Toyota until a particularly hot day when it melted and turned the auto insurance and registration papers into a goopy, cricket-y mess. I wish Golden Hing sold insect pops. But anyway.)\n\nTo cap off the evening we ventured slightly deeper into Bed-Stuy to visit Sushi Tatsu, a restaurant that scored 55 violation points last fall. Not only that, they took hits for things like \u201ccold food items stored at warm temperatures.\u201d It was well below freezing outside, so I could use a hot meal. Ideally, that hot meal wouldn\u2019t be sushi, but I wasn\u2019t picky.\n\nAfter Golden Hing, Sushi Tatsu was a pleasant surprise. The restaurant was nicely decorated and the waitstaff were friendly. They even brought me a massive Sapporo and even poured it in a glass for me. I was sure the food was going to be fine. But I was sorely mistaken.\n\nThe sushi looked good, but so does the plastic toy sushi decorating plates in those fake dining rooms at IKEA\u2014and those probably taste better. The salmon was manageable, but the tuna had a waxy residue all over it, like the chef had slathered it in Chapstick to soothe my weather-damaged lips. I downed my Sapporo, but the sushi stayed where it was. For once, the Health Department may have been right when it slapped a giant \u201cC\u201d on this window.\n\nIt was a gelatinous bile, looking vaguely like the melted remains of that cricket lollipop.\n\nThat was the official end of my experiment, and I didn\u2019t feel any worse for wear after my risky feasting. I even went to a show that night. But things took a turn around 1 AM, when I was standing outside the venue. Without warning, I threw up right there on the sidewalk, an outpouring of gelatinous bile that looked vaguely like the melted remains of that cricket lollipop. I can\u2019t say it was food poisoning\u2014eating five different ethnic cuisines one after the other would make anybody queasy. Plus, I\u2019d just bounced around in a crowd for an hour and drank an entire row of sweating, firetruck-red Tecates. I probably can\u2019t blame my yakking on the food.\n\nI finally ended up at home around two, purged and empty. I was hungry, in fact. So I made my way to the bodega next to my house and bought a cheesesteak with extra jalapenos. I\u2019m not sure if the guy wore gloves or what condition the grill was in or whether he dropped the hero on the floor\u2014all I know is I inhaled its 12 greasy inches on my walk back to my apartment.
