The popular Ice Bucket Challenge took a very sick turn in the case of an autistic teenager. A video found on the boy’s cell phone shows the 15-year-old wearing only underwear while kids pour, not ice water on his head, but allegedly a bucket containing spit, feces, urine, and cigarette butts, Fox News reported.

In the video, the teen is standing half naked in a driveway outside a house not far from his high school as bodily fluids are poured over his head. The boy’s mother said her son didn’t realize what the kids dumped on him until after the fact. Utterly humiliated, the boy did not want to tell his parents what happened, said his mother Diane, who asked the family's last name be witheld.

When his family discovered the disturbing video on his phone, they were outraged. They couldn’t imagine how kids could be so cruel. “Once we found out about it, we were just horrified,” the mother of the Bay High School student said. Not only did the kids film the horrific incident, but they posted it on Instagram. “This is just too far. It’s really bad,” his brother Jacob said.

Bay High School is now working with police to further investigate the incident. Police say they are pretty sure who was involved and are working on the case for a few weeks before pressing charges. The family said they refuse to let the kids get away with bullying their son and have posted the video for everyone to see. “I want these kids held accountable for what they did to him and they targeted somebody who just didn’t really understand what was going on,” Diane said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that autism spectrum disorders are five times more common in boys and affect one in 68 children.
