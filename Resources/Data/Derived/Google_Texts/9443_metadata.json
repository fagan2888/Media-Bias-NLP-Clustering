The junior senator from Texas and 2016 candidate has been known to worry out loud about \u201ctens of millions Americans dying\u201d at the hands of Iranian sci-fi weaponry. He has a habit of calling the sitting president as a sponsor of terrorism. And when he was asked for his reaction to the first 2016 Democratic primary debate earlier this week, Cruz let rip with a characteristic mix of hair-on-fire nonsense.\n\n\u201cIt was more socialism, more pacifism, more weakness and less Constitution,\u201d Cruz said to a crowd of Iowa supporters. \u201cIt was a recipe to destroy a country.\u201d Cruz hadn\u2019t actually seen the debate, as the Dallas Morning News noted, so to cover all the bases he shifted from describing the Democrats as feckless weaklings to authoritarian dictators-in-waiting. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing our freedoms taken away every day and last night was an audition for who would wear the jackboot most vigorously,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cLast night was an audition for who would embrace government power for who would strip your and my individual liberties.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric for a semi-credible major party presidential candidate to be tossing around. And while it\u2019s easy to dismiss this stuff as posturing and pandering for the hardcore conservative voters that form Cruz\u2019s base, there\u2019s a deeper significance to it, as Ed Kilgore rightly points out:\n\nCruz is one of those presidential candidates (along with Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee for sure; the exact position of several others is unclear) who claim the Second Amendment gives Americans the right to revolutionary violence against their own government if it engages in \u201ctyranny\u201d or doesn\u2019t respect our rights.\n\nThis is an argument Cruz makes with some frequency: you need guns to protect yourself against government tyrants. And there he is on the campaign trail describing the opposition party candidates as would-be tyrants, fitting themselves for jackboots. His response to this summer\u2019s Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage was to describe it as \u201cthe very definition of tyranny.\u201d His official statement on the arrest of Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis for refusing to do her job declared that \u201cjudicial lawlessness crossed into judicial tyranny.\u201d He opposed Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration by invoking \u201cdespotic executives\u201d and \u201cunaccountable monarchs.\u201d If you hear all this, and you also hear Ted Cruz say you need a gun to ward off tyranny, you have to start to wonder when people begin putting two and two together.\n\nIt\u2019s not limited to Cruz. Ben Carson has spent the better part of a fortnight arguing that the Holocaust could have been prevented, or at least impeded, if Jews or anti-Nazi Germans had been armed and capable of inflicting violence upon the Third Reich. It\u2019s a profoundly ahistorical argument that accomplishes little beyond appropriating the horror of the Holocaust to bolster Carson\u2019s view that present-day Americans should be armed to protect against their own government\u2019s slide into Nazi-like tyranny \u2013 something he believes could very well happen. But again, we have to take a look at what Ben Carson considers tyranny. He\u2019s described Obamacare, for example, as \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d He\u2019s said that Barack Obama is working to \u201cdestroy the country\u201d and that Democratic leaders are \u201ctrying to destroy this nation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A question for gun-nut Republicans who think Obamacare and gay rights are \"tyranny\": when does the shooting start?", "author": "Simon Maloy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A question for gun-nut Republicans who think Obamacare and gay rights are \"tyranny\": when does the shooting start?", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s crazy \u201cjackboot\u201d talk: When inflammatory rhetoric starts getting dangerous", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/16/ted_cruzs_crazy_jackboot_talk_when_inflammatory_rhetoric_starts_getting_dangerous/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/ted_cruz_colbert.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A question for gun-nut Republicans who think Obamacare and gay rights are \"tyranny\": when does the shooting start?", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/ted_cruz_colbert.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s crazy \u201cjackboot\u201d talk: When inflammatory rhetoric starts getting dangerous", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s crazy \u201cjackboot\u201d talk: When inflammatory rhetoric starts getting dangerous", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, 2016 Republican primary, Ben Carson, Conservatives, gun rights, Guns, militia movement, Right-wing militias, Second Amendment, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But again, we have to take a look at what Ben Carson considers tyranny.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, 2016 Republican primary, Ben Carson, Conservatives, gun rights, Guns, militia movement, Right-wing militias, Second Amendment, Ted Cruz, Elections News, Politics NewsYou\u2019ve probably noticed by now, but Ted Cruz can sometimes be a bit melodramatic.\n\u201cIt was more socialism, more pacifism, more weakness and less Constitution,\u201d Cruz said to a crowd of Iowa supporters.\nAnd there he is on the campaign trail describing the opposition party candidates as would-be tyrants, fitting themselves for jackboots.\nThis is an argument Cruz makes with some frequency: you need guns to protect yourself against government tyrants."}
