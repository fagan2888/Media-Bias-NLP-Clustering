He already has their number(s).\n\nDe La Rosa took the mound having beaten the Padres eight times in his last nine decisions against them. He picked up where he left off, tossing five shutout innings before the Padres rallied for two runs in the sixth.\n\nThat prevented De La Rosa from getting the victory \u2014 a 3-2 Rockies win provided when Drew Stubbs hit his 15th home run of the season in the eighth inning \u2014 but it marked the sixth straight time the left-hander limited them to three or fewer runs.\n\n\u201cJorge did a good job,\u201d said Rockies manager Walt Weiss. \u201cIt got away from him a little bit there in the sixth when they tied it up, but he got through the inning, kept it even and put us in position to win like he almost always does.\u201d\n\nRockies first baseman Justin Morneau went 1-for-4 in the game, dropping his National League-leading batting average to .319, still two points higher than Pittsburgh\u2019s Josh Harrison.\n\nMorneau had a two-out single to right field in the third inning off Padres starter Robbie Erlin, scoring teammate Rafael Ynoa with the game\u2019s first run.\n\nThe Rockies made it 2-0 in the fourth inning when Brandon Barnes, Josh Rutledge and DJ LeMahieu hit back-to-back-to-back singles, Barnes coming home on LeMahieu\u2019s hit.\n\nDe La Rosa has had tremendous success against the Padres the past five seasons, going 8-1 in 12 starts.\n\nWeiss attributes a portion of the left-hander\u2019s success to mixing his changeup with a cut fastball on the inner half of the plate to right-handed hitters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good complement for his changeup,\u201d Weiss said before the game. \u201cThey work off each other.\n\n\u201cHe can speed hitters up with that cutter and set up his bread and butter, which is his changeup. It\u2019s been very effective for him.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado Rockies vs San Diego Padres, Sept. 23, 2014\n\nThe most trouble De La Rosa faced through the first five innings was from a fan in the field-level seats behind home plate who appeared to be shining a bright light from his cellphone out toward the pitcher.\n\nUmpires stopped the game briefly in the bottom of the fifth inning and directed security to the offender to resolve the issue.\n\nYangervis Solarte singled after the disruption to put runners at first and second with two outs, but De La Rosa then coaxed an infield grounder from Cameron Maybin to get out of the inning.\n\nTo that point, De La Rosa had allowed just three hits.\n\nThings unraveled for him in the sixth when the Padres collected four hits \u2014 all singles \u2014 stringing three of them together with two outs to tie the game 2-2.\n\nBut that was when Weiss said \u201csome guys stepped up and made big plays when it counted.\u201d\n\nStubbs\u2019 homer in the eighth came off Padres reliever Dale Thayer, who had not allowed a run in his previous eight appearances (7 innings).\n\nStubbs had struggled in two of his previous at-bats, striking out in both the third and fifth innings.\n\n\u201cThat was the first good swing for me,\u201d said Stubbs. \u201cThis is a game of redemption and you have second chances. I was very unhappy with some of the at-bats I had before, so it felt good to get that one.\u201d\n\nIn the bottom of the eighth, Barnes made a tremendous, leaping catch at the wall in left field, robbing Rene Rivera of extra bases, and possibly a home run. The play gained added significance when Yasmani Grandal followed with a single.\n\n\u201cWe were just reviewing it,\u201d Barnes said afterwards in the clubhouse. \u201cIt looked like it was going to hit the top of the wall and bounce over.\u201d\n\nBut Barnes was confident he could make the play. \u201cAnytime a ball is hit to the wall I think I have it,\u201d he said.\n\nRymer Liriano\u2019s two-out walk made things tense. But LeMahieu\u2019s Gold Glove-caliber, diving stop at second on a hard-hit ball by Alexi Amarista ended the threat.\n\nIn the ninth, the Padres advanced the potential tying run to second base with no outs before closer LaTroy Hawkins retired the next three batters for his 23rd save.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies beat Padres behind De La Rosa, Stubbs, Barnes", "title": "Rockies beat Padres behind De La Rosa, Stubbs, Barnes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/23/rockies-beat-padres-behind-de-la-rosa-stubbs-barnes/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140923__rockies-stubbsp1.jpg", "height": 511}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140923__rockies-stubbsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-23T23:34:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:43:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "De La Rosa took the mound having beaten the Padres eight times in his last nine decisions against them.\nDe La Rosa has had tremendous success against the Padres the past five seasons, going 8-1 in 12 starts.\nRockies starting pitcher Jorge De La Rosa had no interest in the promotion.\nTo that point, De La Rosa had allowed just three hits.\nThe Rockies made it 2-0 in the fourth inning when Brandon Barnes, Josh Rutledge and DJ LeMahieu hit back-to-back-to-back singles, Barnes coming home on LeMahieu\u2019s hit."}
