Fox News newscasters, no matter what subject they are speaking about, always manage to slip in a negative remark about Obamacare. It tends to destroy the content of whatever message they are trying to deliver. It clearly shows a very deceitful inner shell to the outer shell character of the newscaster. It seems that all the Fox News newscasters are trying to please their Fox News owners by belittling Obama and making our president look bad. I would like for them to explain to the American public why they feel that the private insurance industry would offer our citizens a more fair and better national health care system: The private insurance companies, which have treated ordinary citizens of this country unmercifully for countless years, vs. Obamacare, which is trying to hard to bring coverage to everyone. I would like to hear the Fox News newscasters really explain rather than complain.
