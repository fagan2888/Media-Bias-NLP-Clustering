Yet its RFRA, signed into law last week, provides a \"my religion made me do it\" defense to allegations of discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nThere's a belief and fear that the statute is an affirmative attempt to provide a lawful basis for such discrimination. Such an attempt would surely run afoul of prevoius Supreme Court rulings, notes Napolitano.
