President Barack Obama had one unforgettable year.

The president had a plethora of moments that made us laugh, cry, and more in 2015. With monumental trips to India, Germany, and Jamaica – among many more – Obama helped the world procure a better view of his policies, while his engagement on social media pushed awareness about the Affordable Care Act, criminal justice reform, and gun control.

His moments were off the cuff — who can forget the “angry translator?” They were also extremely touching — remember when the president sang “Amazing Grace” during the funeral of Charleston AME massacre victim Rev. Clementa Pinckney?

All the while, Obama had his “woe,” vice president Joe Biden, and his beautiful First Family by his side.

It’s clear who had the best year ever in politics. Here are a few unforgettable moments from the president’s last full year in the White House.
