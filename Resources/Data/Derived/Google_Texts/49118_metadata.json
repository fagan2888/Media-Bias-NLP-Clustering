In the meantime, the Court is deciding on Whole Women\u2019s Health vs. Hellerstedt, arguably the most important abortion case in a generation.\n\nYet nobody seems to know what Judge Garland thinks about abortion. He won\u2019t have a say in the current abortion case, but his position could be important for future abortion rulings.\n\nDemographically, it seems likely that Garland is probably pro-choice: he\u2019s not super-conservative, he\u2019s Jewish, and he\u2019s the father of two daughters (and Judges with daughters are more likely to rule in favor of women\u2019s rights). But nobody knows for sure.\n\nAs journalists scoured his earlier decisions for any hint of a social agenda, former clerks said the search was futile: Garland has never issued an opinion on an abortion case, and would never have discussed a case he wasn\u2019t deciding, even in private. Since the DC Circuit Court of Appeals usually hears procedural or administrative cases, he\u2019s never had to make a major ruling on a case about reproductive issues.\n\nEven in private, former clerks say Judge Garland never revealed his views on reproductive issues. \u201cThe mask never slipped,\u201d says David Pozen, an associate professor at Columbia Law School who clerked for Garland in 2008.\n\n\u201cWe truthfully never talked about it,\u201d says Jay Michaelson, a legal affairs columnist for the Daily Beast who clerked for Garland in 1998. \u201cWe knew better than to ask.\u201d\n\nJack Goldsmith: Blocking Garland Means Danger for Conservatives\n\nMichaelson says Garland has a strong respect for legal precedent (which implies he might be reluctant to overturn Roe v Wade). He\u2019s also repeatedly upheld \u201csubstantive due process,\u201d the legal name for so-called \u201cright to privacy\u201d: the notion that there\u2019s no process by which the government can regulate decisions as personal as sexual relationships or reproduction. \u201cThe doctrines that underly Roe vs Wade are doctrines that he has upheld,\u201d Michaelson adds.\n\nBut the lack of a tangible record has led both pro-choice and anti-abortion groups to project their hopes and fears onto Garland, and both sides are drawing assumptions about his position based on the fact that Obama appointed him.\n\n\u201cWe do not know this nominee but we do know Barack Obama,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, in a statement. \u201cAnyone he nominates will join the voting bloc on the Court that consistently upholds abortion on-demand.\u201d\n\nPro-choice groups didn\u2019t condemn the nomination, nor was there a resounding cheer. Cecile Richards, President and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said Garland seems \u201cresponsible and qualified,\u201d but acknowledged a lack of information about his record on reproductive issues. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that we don\u2019t know about his judicial approach, and that\u2019s why the Senate needs to do its job and hold a fair hearing and up or down vote,\u201d she told TIME in an email. \u201cA hearing is the American people\u2019s chance to learn more about Judge Garland, his qualifications and his judicial temperament.\u201d\n\nNARAL Pro-Choice America president Ilyse Hogue also said in a statement that \u201cJudge Garland does not have a public record on reproductive rights,\u201d but urged the Senate to give him a fair hearing, arguing that obstruction \u201cdenies all of us our right to know where this nominee stands on core constitutional questions of women\u2019s privacy, dignity, and equality.\u201d\n\nAnd unless there was a pinky-swear in the Oval Office, Obama himself may not know where Garland stands.\n\nThe fact that Obama is nominating someone with zero public record on reproductive issues shows just how broken and partisan the system has become. Abortion is among the most divisive issues in an already toxic political climate\u2013 any public statements indicating a pro-choice or anti-abortion position would likely hamstring a nominee. That\u2019s why other SCOTUS hopefuls have manage to avoid weighing in on abortion or reproductive issues in their careers. Anything that hints at a pro-choice sentiment could give Senate Republicans an excuse to blow up the whole process. \u201cSmart judges don\u2019t do that,\u201d Michaelson says.\n\nThen again, Garland\u2019s stance on abortion might not matter as much as we think. The Court has already heard oral arguments about abortion restrictions in Whole Women\u2019s Health vs. Hellerstedt and it\u2019s likely to decide that case later this spring. If the Court finds the Texas abortion restrictions unconstitutional, it could strike a blow to the anti-abortion movement and strengthen abortion rights across the country. Given that the Senate GOP is preparing for a months-long battle over the nomination, the earliest Garland could possibly get on the bench is likely to be during the lame-duck session, after the November elections. By then, the case about Texas abortion restrictions will have been long decided, and that could be the last major abortion decision for some time.\n\nAnd, even nominees who have extensive public records on social issues have gone on to surprise or disappoint their ideological base\u2013 just look at what happened when Chief Justice John Roberts voted to uphold the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThat\u2019s a risk Obama \u2014 and the GOP\u2013 will have to take.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nominee is a sphinx on the divisive issue", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The nominee is a sphinx on the divisive issue", "title": "Nobody Knows Where Merrick Garland Stands on Abortion Rights", "url": "http://time.com/4261844/merrick-garland-the-abortion-rights-sphinx/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/merrick-garland-supreme-court-nominee.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/merrick-garland-supreme-court-nominee.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The nominee is a sphinx on the divisive issue", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Nobody Knows Where Merrick Garland Stands on Abortion Rights"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "abortion, abortion sphinx, merrick garland, obama, reproductive rights, scotus", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "merrick garland, SCOTUS, abortion, abortion sphinx, reproductive rights, obama"}, "article_summary": "He won\u2019t have a say in the current abortion case, but his position could be important for future abortion rulings.\nThat\u2019s why other SCOTUS hopefuls have manage to avoid weighing in on abortion or reproductive issues in their careers.\nIn the meantime, the Court is deciding on Whole Women\u2019s Health vs. Hellerstedt, arguably the most important abortion case in a generation.\nEven in private, former clerks say Judge Garland never revealed his views on reproductive issues.\nIf the Court finds the Texas abortion restrictions unconstitutional, it could strike a blow to the anti-abortion movement and strengthen abortion rights across the country."}
