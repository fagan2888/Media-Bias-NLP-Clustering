You're not alone. Our 2014 annual salary survey found that despite a recovering economy, many are still feeling the effects of the recession \u0097 and it's especially hard on retirement-aged Baby Boomers who don't feel they've saved enough along the way to comfortably call it a career, and who feel forced to work into their golden years.\n\n\"There just isn't enough money to survive on a day-to-day basis as well as plan for the future,\" says Kathi Gascho, RN, BSN, CASC, director of nursing at the Camp Lowell Surgery Center in Tucson, Ariz.\n\nIn this year's salary survey, in which nearly 900 surgical facility leaders shared with us the size of their paychecks, a major theme emerged: Nearly one-third of the OR managers and nurses we surveyed are working into their golden years \u0097 some because they want to, others because they have to.

Yet, half of both groups of leaders say their salaries are largely staying the same when compared to the last couple of years, thanks in large part to rising costs and lower reimbursements.\n\n\"I am blessed to be in an occupation I am passionate about,\" says the CEO of one surgery center. \"However, each year it takes hard work to succeed, as vendors increase costs and payors decrease payments at the same time as they are increasing premiums.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not the retiring type.
