Merrill still carries out that role in a 293.2-acre corner of the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forests. It\u2019s hard to reach, several miles outside of Dahlonega in Lumpkin County, but not unreachable, as attested to by hikers and other outdoor lovers who roam the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that we take care of the environment, but we take care of the folks up there,\u201d said Maj. Jason A. Henderson, executive officer for the 5th Ranger Training Battalion. \u201cI\u2019d say that once a quarter, there\u2019s a (rescue) incident up there, and about every couple of weeks, there\u2019s an incident where a civilian will ask a Ranger instructor (for directions).\u201d\n\nThe camp, which serves as mountaineering training for the U.S. Army Ranger School, figures into the proposed National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2014, with an amendment by U.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Gainesville, calling for transferring control of the land from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to the Department of Defense.\n\nIt\u2019s an issue that has raised some hackles in the public, as well as from the U.S. Forest Service, which falls under USDA.\n\nLand feud\n\nThe amendment was included \u201cwithout consideration\u201d from the Forest Service, states the website for Gainesville-based Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forests.\n\nAlso, critics have charged that public hearings should have been held before the amendment was introduced.\n\nThe freshman congressman said he is trying to resolve an issue that has lingered too long.\n\n\u201cWe brought light on a subject that\u2019s been going on for 20-something years,\u201d Collins said in an August interview at his Gainesville office. \u201cPeople are tired of government not working ... and we\u2019re talking about two government entities that just can\u2019t talk. They almost got it settled, then one agency decided to back out and hold out for more.\u201d\n\nThe Forest Service believes the amendment isn\u2019t needed.\n\nThe agency \u201cis confident that through active, ongoing discussions with Army officials, we are addressing and resolving any issues associated with operations at (Merrill),\u201d said Judy Toppins, spokeswoman for the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forests.\n\nThe Army and Forest Service have tried six times to exchange government land, as early as 1992 and as recent as 2008, Henderson said.\n\nAn Aug. 16 news release from the Army states that \u201cmore than 50 years of demonstrated good stewardship of the environment ... won\u2019t change regardless\u201d of what happens with the defense bill, which has moved to the Senate after its June 14 passage in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cResidents in the area will notice very little change if this legislation is passed,\u201d said Gary A. Jones, director of public affairs for the Maneuver Center of Excellence and Fort Benning near Columbus.\n\nThey \u201cwould continue to have the same access to the land, the Etowah River and area roads as they have now,\u201d states the Army.\n\nCollins\u2019 amendment does call for the ongoing protection of two endangered species of fish in the Chattahoochee National Forest: the Etowah and holiday darters.\n\nForest Hilyer, chairman of the Lumpkin Coalition, which describes itself as a \u201cnonpartisan, issue-based organization to facilitate projects that benefit North Georgia,\u201d has said he fears, if the bill passes as is, that the transfer would reduce watershed oversight.\n\n\u201cI think the Forest Service does a pretty good job of overseeing some of those protections,\u201d he said.\n\nCollins, a U.S. Air Force reservist, has said he also believes the move would \u201cremove a layer of unnecessary government intervention and save millions of dollars in the (defense) budget.\u201d\n\nThe Army states the same in its press release.\n\n\u201cAt present, Camp Merrill has two layers of business rules and operating procedures \u2014 one Forest Service layer and one Army layer,\u201d the Army says. \u201cThis duplicate layer of oversight causes unintended but inevitable delay and extra cost to the day-to-day operation of the camp.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything wrong with the way the Forest Service has managed the property, but historically the extra layer of management has meant certain projects take longer to complete, and therefore can add additional costs to a project.\u201d\n\nAging infrastructure\n\nMerrill\u2019s history dates to 1951, when the Army started the mountaineering phase in the area.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of throughout the North Georgia mountains and settled in (its current location),\u201d Henderson said.\n\nBuildings were first put up in 1960 and the average age of the buildings on base are 45 years old. The base was officially designated as Camp Merrill in 1972.\n\n\u201cThe camp was intended to be a temporary training location,\u201d according to the Army. \u201cAs such, the temporary structures had a design life of five to seven years.\u201d\n\nLt. Col. Michael A. Scarpulla, 5th Ranger Training Battalion commander, said, \u201cFor years, our ability to do construction was limited because buildings were coded as (temporary).\u201d\n\nSome modernization has taken place on campus \u2014 and there is a master plan laying out upgrades across Merrill \u2014 but work still needs to be done.\n\nFor example, Merrill has the second oldest dining hall in the Army, with the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., having the oldest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve recently gotten a few upgrades,\u201d Scarpulla said of the building during a recent tour of the base.\n\nA pond that serves as the setting for an outdated sewer treatment facility, dubbed as the \u201clagoon\u201d by those at the camp, also could be the site for future improvements, including new pipes and a plant, costing more than $1 million.\n\n\u201cThis has been an eyesore pretty much since the camp has been here,\u201d Scarpulla said. \u201cAre we in compliance? Yes. Is this something that needs to be improved with modern technology? Absolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is we\u2019ve got 4 acres of sewage 300 yards away from the headwaters of the Etowah River,\u201d Henderson said.\n\nThe levy had a minor breach in the early 2000s, releasing some 400,000 gallons, he said.\n\n\u201cIt was stopped prior to reaching the Etowah, but you can imagine if it had not been,\u201d Henderson said.\n\nScarpulla said he believes the land transfer would help speed up improvements at the camp.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t own this, so we\u2019re kind of like a renter and we have to ask the landlord permission to do (improvements),\u201d which delays a project from getting approved, he said.\n\nAnd with delays, \u201cyou have the potential for increased costs,\u201d Scarpulla said.\n\nSharing space\n\nToppins said, \u201cArmy use of national forest land in Georgia and throughout the southeastern United States is cost-effective and in the public interest.\n\n\u201cThe Forest Service works effectively with the Army to ensure forest resources are protected and provides land management expertise and assistance to ensure any environmental impacts from the Army\u2019s training activities are mitigated and minimized.\u201d\n\nMerrill \u201cis unique in that it is transected by about a mile of the Etowah River, which provides habitat to two endangered fish species and flows on to form Lake Allatoona, providing drinking water to hundreds of thousands of Georgians. ... As land managers, we understand the importance of this site to the public.\u201d\n\nThe Army believes that upgrades at Merrill, which is home to 200 soldiers year-round and an additional 150-300 Ranger students per 21-day training cycle, \u201cwill not just improve conditions for the Ranger students training there, but they will help us better safeguard the environment as well.\u201d\n\nThe camp, estimated to have an annual $9.2 million economic impact on the area, also interacts with area agencies \u2014 such as during mountain rescues.\n\nKate Maine, spokeswoman for the University of North Georgia in Dahlonega, said the school\u2019s incoming cadets train there one day in fall and one day in spring. Also, its National Leadership Challenge class, a group of high school students interested in joining the Corps of Cadets assembled each semester, visits Merrill.\n\nLikewise, UNG provides some services and facilities to military personnel stationed at Merrill, such as the university pool for training sessions.\n\nOverall, UNG \u201chas a very positive relationship\u201d with Merrill, Maine said.\n\nThe Army says its soldiers at Merrill \u201chave enjoyed a good relationship with the civilian community for more than 50 years, and we intend to maintain that relationship.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/88442/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2013/09/07/0908merrill6.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "DAHLONEGA \u2014 More than 60 years ago, while America was fighting a war in Korea, the U.S. Department of Defense turned to the North Georgia mountains to start a training phase for one of its most elite units, the Army Rangers.", "title": "Debate stirred over proposed Camp Merrill move from Forest Service"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Debate stirred over proposed Camp Merrill move from Forest Service"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81d3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAt present, Camp Merrill has two layers of business rules and operating procedures \u2014 one Forest Service layer and one Army layer,\u201d the Army says.\nIt\u2019s an issue that has raised some hackles in the public, as well as from the U.S. Forest Service, which falls under USDA.\n\u201cI think the Forest Service does a pretty good job of overseeing some of those protections,\u201d he said.\nThey almost got it settled, then one agency decided to back out and hold out for more.\u201dThe Forest Service believes the amendment isn\u2019t needed.\nLand feudThe amendment was included \u201cwithout consideration\u201d from the Forest Service, states the website for Gainesville-based Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forests."}
