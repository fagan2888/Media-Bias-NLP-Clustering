But in March, the court will look beyond the mandate itself and decide whether the government\u2019s olive branch to the objecting nonprofits still imposes an undue burden.\n\nThe nonprofits object to a government opt-out form designed to put up a firewall between the nonprofits and the mandated coverage, while still allowing their female workers to obtain the drugs and services.\n\nUnder that policy, faith-based universities and charities notify either their insurers or the federal government of their objections to providing contraception, and the insurers or plan administrators then step in and make sure employees can get contraception without the religious charity having to pay for it.\n\nFaith-based groups say the waiver drafted by the Health and Human Services Department still makes them complicit in sinful activity, so they should receive a full exemption from the rules.\n\nAttorneys for the sisters also noted that certain employers are already exempt from the mandate, including houses of worship and those with plans that were grandfathered and haven\u2019t changed much since the law was enacted.\n\nThe faith-based nonprofits want to be carved out the mandate, too, with no strings attached.\n\nAfter a series of high-level defeats, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the nonprofits in September, creating the type of circuit split that makes cases ripe for Supreme Court review.\n\nThe mandate\u2019s defenders say it fulfills a vital function and that the justices would set a dangerous precedent if they rule for the nonprofits.\n\nJustice Department attorneys have compared the nonprofits to conscientious objectors who duck the draft and then want to block the government from naming someone else to fight.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An elder-care charity run by nuns asked the Supreme Court on Monday to shield them from Obamacare's birth control mandate, arguing that the government can provide their organizations' female employees with contraceptives if it really wants to but shouldn't force them to facilitate the coverage.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An elder-care charity run by nuns asked the Supreme Court on Monday to shield them from Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate, arguing that the government can provide their organizations\u2019 female employees with contraceptives if it really wants to but shouldn\u2019t force them to facilitate the coverage.", "title": "Little Sisters of the Poor nuns will take Obamacare birth control mandate to Supreme Court", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/4/little-sisters-poor-nuns-will-take-obamacare-birth/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/14/f7941d7565ec331f7c0f6a70670009b4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/14/f7941d7565ec331f7c0f6a70670009b4.jpg", "description": "An elder-care charity run by nuns asked the Supreme Court on Monday to shield them from Obamacare's birth control mandate, arguing that the government can provide their organizations' female employees", "card": "summary", "title": "Little Sisters of the Poor nuns will take Obamacare birth control mand"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Labor, Law Crime, Supreme Court"}, "article_summary": "It will be the fourth time that a skirmish over all or part of Obamacare has made it to the Supreme Court.\nCircuit Court of Appeals sided with the nonprofits in September, creating the type of circuit split that makes cases ripe for Supreme Court review.\nThe nonprofits object to a government opt-out form designed to put up a firewall between the nonprofits and the mandated coverage, while still allowing their female workers to obtain the drugs and services.\nAn elder-care charity run by nuns asked the Supreme Court on Monday to shield them from Obamacare\u2019s birth control mandate, arguing that the government can provide their organizations\u2019 female employees with contraceptives if it really wants to but shouldn\u2019t force them to facilitate the coverage.\nBut in March, the court will look beyond the mandate itself and decide whether the government\u2019s olive branch to the objecting nonprofits still imposes an undue burden."}
