A Tallahassee court reaffirmed the Florida Board of Medicine’s decision to revoke a Bonita Springs cardiologist’s medical license, the Naples Daily News reports.

Dr. Zannos Grekos had his license revoked in a unanimous decision by the Florida Board of Medicine in 2013. According to the Daily News, the board determined that he committed medical malpractice in connection to a 69-year-old woman, who died after suffering a stroke from a stem-cell procedure.

Meanwhile, a Pinellas Park doctor facing charges in the deaths of three people who overdosed on painkillers had many previous complaints about his practice, the Tampa Bay Times reports.

The Florida Board of Medicine accused Dr. Edward Neil Feldman of medical malpractice three times in the past three years, charging that he overprescribed drugs like oxycodone to patients that he did not properly screen. According to the Times, at least 16 people in possession prescriptions from Feldman have died of overdoses, including the three cases for which he is currently facing charges.
