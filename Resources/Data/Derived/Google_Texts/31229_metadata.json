The report, produced annually each year since 2004, tracks child welfare trends over recent decades starting with a benchmark year of 1975.\n\nThe report draws upon the U.S. Census as well as data from the Center for Disease Control\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics, the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of Justice, the U.S. Department of Education, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the national Monitoring the Future study.\n\nThe newest results suggest the Great Recession cast a lingering shadow over child well-being for several years after it ended. The economic downturn lasted for 18 months, from December 2007 through June 2009, but the recession\u2019s effect on children continued from 2009 through 2012. Overall child well-being began showing improvement in 2013, six years after the recession started.\n\nNot surprisingly, the recession\u2019s biggest effect on children was economic. Parental employment and income dropped and remained depressed through the end of 2012 before showing some improvement. Child poverty rates, which worsened immediately after the recession, have been slower to improve and remained high in 2014.\n\nThe recession also had some less obvious indirect effects.\n\nFor instance, preschool enrollment dropped during and just after the recession years. The dip was likely due to cutbacks in funding of public preschool programs, the report states.\n\nAnd while the overall effect of the recession on children was negative, there were also a few surprising bright spots. During and immediately after the recession, fewer young people reported committing or being victimized by violent crimes. Young people may have been less involved in crime in those years in part because they spent more time at home, the authors suggest.\n\nAlso, despite the recession, the numbers of people aged 25-29 who have earned a bachelor\u2019s degree continued to climb.\n\nHealth insurance coverage for children provided another bright spot, the report states. The numbers of children living in families with health insurance climbed steadily beginning in 2007. By 2013, nearly 93 percent of children lived in families with health insurance. The increase in coverage can be traced to the expansion of the state Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, and to the 2010 implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the report states. The availability of health insurance for families helped to cushion the recession\u2019s effects on children, the authors state.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://today.duke.edu/2016/02/childwell-beingindexreport", "site_name": "Duke Today", "description": "America\u2019s children are starting to recover from the worst effects of the Great Recession, although some ill effects still linger, says a comprehensive new report on child well-being from Duke Universi", "title": "Years Later, America&#039;s Children Finally Start to Recover From Recession"}, "description": 196375}, "article_summary": "The newest results suggest the Great Recession cast a lingering shadow over child well-being for several years after it ended.\nDurham, NC - America\u2019s children are starting to recover from the worst effects of the Great Recession, although some ill effects still linger, says a comprehensive new report on child well-being from Duke University.\nThe availability of health insurance for families helped to cushion the recession\u2019s effects on children, the authors state.\nAnd while the overall effect of the recession on children was negative, there were also a few surprising bright spots.\nBy 2013, nearly 93 percent of children lived in families with health insurance."}
