WASHINGTON — Former Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius, disputing the description of MIT professor Jonathan Gruber as an architect of the Affordable Care Act, says she had never met with him and minimized the significance of his controversial comments describing passage of the law.

Gruber, a prominent health economist and federal consultant, is scheduled to testify before a House committee next week about his remarks that the 2010 law deliberately was drafted "in a tortured way" to obscure the reality that it created a system in which "healthy people pay in and sick people get money."

In a 2013 video that recently emerged, he said the law passed in part because of "the stupidity of the American voter." Republican critics of the health care law have seized on the comments as exposing deception by the administration from the law's beginnings.

But Sebelius, who headed health care policy before stepping down under fire in April, said in an interview on Capital Download that Gruber was "an architect" of the 2006 Massachusetts health care plan known as Romneycare but not of the federal plan that followed, known as Obamacare.

Although Gruber was hired as a consultant and met with staffers and advisers, he never sat down with her, she told USA TODAY's weekly video newsmaker series. "Maybe he was in a large room; he could have been on a phone call. But in terms of small meetings, discussing policy, that never happened." ...

Sebelius: ‘Financial Literacy Of A Lot Of People … Is Very Low’

By Chuck Ross, The Daily Caller

In an interview in which she tried to distance herself from Jonathan Gruber’s remarks about how Obamacare was crafted, former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sounded a lot like the MIT economist.

“I think one of the things that we have learned with the passage of the law … is a lot of Americans have no idea what insurance is about,” Sebelius told USA Today.

Sebelius served as Health and Human Services secretary from the beginning of President Obama’s first term through this June. She came under heavy fire for the federal health law’s rocky roll-out.

Consumers “have no idea, even if they have coverage, what it means, what a deductible is, what a co-pay is, how to choose a network,” Sebelius said, adding that those were “complicated terms.”

“I think the financial literacy of a lot of people — particularly people who did not have insurance coverage or whose employers choose their coverage and kind of present it to them — is very low,” said Sebelius. “And that has be a sort of stunning revelation, and it’s not because anybody hid it from folks, it’s that this is a complicated product.”

In citing the public’s low financial literacy, Sebelius sounded a lot like Gruber who, at a speech at the University of Rhode Island in 2012, said that the passage of one portion of Obamacare — the so-called Cadillac tax — involved “a very clever, you know, basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter.”

In another video recording from 2013 that surfaced last month, Gruber said that “the stupidity of the American voter” was “really really critical for the thing to pass.”

“This bill was written in a tortured way to make sure [the Congressional Budget Office] did not score the mandate as taxes,” Gruber continued. “If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies.”

Sebelius denied that Gruber was an “architect” of Obamacare, as many have called him. She told USA Today that she has never met with Gruber and said he was “one of many” consultants on the federal health bill. She did concede that Gruber could be considered an “architect” of Romneycare, the Massachusetts health care bill passed during then-Gov. Mitt Romney’s term.
