These wars of attrition are desperate affairs, with nervous candidates begging for cash and jittery operatives looking for any edge and eager to go ugly.\n\nBut away from the glare of the cameras, a handful of Republican governors are cruising to victory in swing states that will be crucial to winning the presidency in 2016. But their successful playbook seems to be attracting little attention and even less analysis from a party that just can\u2019t quit playing to the base.\n\nEven a quick glance offers a clear and simple lesson: When you seize the center, you romp to reelection, especially in swing states.\n\nJust take a look at Nevada, Ohio, New Mexico, and Iowa, where Govs. Brian Sandoval, John Kasich, Susana Martinez, and Terry Branstad are beating their opponents by an average of 20 points.\n\nYes, all politics is local. But you\u2019d be a fool to overlook the obvious. And in each of these coveted swing states, where millions will be spent courting voters over the next two years, Main Street Republican governors have crafted a winning record by avoiding the ideological extremes of their Tea Party cohort.\n\nThey are reformers, not reactionaries. They believe in fiscal responsibility and strengthening the middle class, but they take a more inclusive approach to social issues, embracing and often embodying the essential diversity of their states. Most fundamentally, as chief executives they believe in governing, not the kind of Kool-Aid-chugging grandstanding that leads to government shutdowns and playing chicken with the fiscal cliff.\n\nSandoval should already be a national Republican star. The telegenic former state attorney general and federal judge is Hispanic and hugely popular in Nevada. He\u2019s focused on education reform and achieved measurable results through plans inspired by former Florida governor and possible 2016 candidate Jeb Bush. Sandoval has sidestepped tax hikes in closing a budget deficit, streamlined government bureaucracy, and gotten a bipartisan vote in the legislature to give tax breaks to Tesla in exchange for long-term investment in the state. He also has backed Medicaid expansion and a state-run exchange under Obamacare. And under this pro-choice Republican\u2019s leadership (yes, you read that right), the state GOP dropped its platform opposition to abortion and gay rights. His pro-choice stand is the reason Sandoval is conveniently overlooked in national Republican conversations, but can they really afford to ignore a massively popular, energetic, and effective Mexican-American chief executive who is coasting to reelection in Harry Reid\u2019s home state by 25 points?\n\n\n\nOhio is the essential Midwest battleground for any presidential campaign. And while other Midwest governors elected in the Tea Party wave are desperately fighting for re-election like Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker or going down to humiliating defeat like Pennsylvania\u2019s Tom Corbett, Ohio\u2019s Kasich has built strong support after an initially narrow win in 2010. A former House Budget chairman and Fox News alumnus, Kasich was a libertarian leaning fiscal conservative before it was cool. But in the Buckeye State, he\u2019s been a moderating force, focusing on the economy and the embattled middle class, boasting an impressive job-creation record since the Great Recession started. Conservatives love that he\u2019s cut business and income taxes while ending the estate tax and reforming collective bargaining. But he\u2019s stood up to attempts to roll back environmental regulations, backed the Common Core education reforms, and proposed higher severance taxes on fracking. Most controversial to conservatives, he expanded Medicaid, allowing the state access to federal funds that are part of Obamacare, admitting to the AP that opposition to the law \u201cwas really either political or ideological. I don\u2019t think that holds water against real flesh and blood, and real improvements in people\u2019s lives.\u201d By setting an example of principled independence, advancing what was once known as \u201ccompassionate conservatism,\u201d Kasich has created a rare Rust Belt success story. No wonder he\u2019s beating Democratic nominee Ed Fitzgerald by 23 points.\n\n\n\nOver in Iowa, Branstad is aiming for a record sixth term in office in his second stint as governor. In a state with a deeply divided GOP, Branstad has always served as a bulwark against Wingnuts like Rep. Steve King, an essential executive quality in educated Iowa, where independents outnumber Democrats or Republicans. The Tea Party never loved him, and Branstad\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid did nothing to heal those wounds. Nonetheless, he cut property taxes and balanced the budget. And while Republican Senate nominee Joni Ernst is in a tick-tight race against Democrat Bruce Braley, Branstad is lapping Democratic nominee Jack Hatch by 23 points, according to the most recent NBC/Marist poll. Branstad\u2019s example should give courage to center-right Republicans competing in the state\u2019s pivotal presidential caucuses.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s Martinez is the closest thing to a GOP star in this list of Main Street Republican governors. She is a money-raiser much in demand on the national campaign trail as the first female Hispanic governor in U.S. history. But the former district attorney has established a strong record in a swing state that has trended Democrat in recent years, cutting taxes and bureaucratic perks like the state\u2019s luxury jet and banning lobbyists from contracts with state agencies. She\u2019s anti-abortion, which helps account for her higher national GOP profile than, say, Sandoval. But she decided not to combat her state\u2019s decision to legalize medical marijuana and same-sex marriage, though she personally opposes both. And like all the other governors on this list, she expanded Medicaid in conjunction with Obamacare. New Mexico\u2019s recovery from the great recession has been comparatively sluggish, and Martinez has the smallest lead of any of these centrist Republican governors\u201415 points, according to the most recent Albuquerque Journal poll. But that\u2019s even more than the dozen-point margin the state\u2019s popular Democratic senator, Tom Udall, is leading his GOP opponent by this year.\n\nRemember that all these swing-state centrist Republican reelection cakewalks are occurring in an anti-incumbent year, at a time when more conservative gubernatorial colleagues first elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010 are fighting for their political lives. It\u2019s not a coincidence.\n\nAll these popular GOP incumbents have chosen to focus on economic issues rather than social issues, rebuilding the big tent by reaching out to win over new converts rather than simply playing to the base. And their support for expanding Medicaid stands in sharp contrast to the GOP House, which obsessively voted to defund Obamacare more than 40 times.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "johnavlon"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201410280945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Forget about the battle for control of the Senate and ugly congressional fights\u2014the real story this cycle is a handful of moderate Republican governors cruising to reelection.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Secret GOP Swing State Election Romp", "tags": "topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Secret GOP Swing State Election Romp\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/28/the-secret-gop-swing-state-election-romp.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/28/the-secret-gop-swing-state-election-romp/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47149650.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/28/the-secret-gop-swing-state-election-romp\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-10-28T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"John Avlon\",\"tags\":[\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "John Avlon", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-10-28T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/john-avlonhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/28/the-secret-gop-swing-state-election-romp", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Forget about the battle for control of the Senate and ugly congressional fights\u2014the real story this cycle is a handful of moderate Republican governors cruising to reelection.", "title": "The Secret GOP Swing State Election Romp", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/28/the-secret-gop-swing-state-election-romp.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/28/the-secret-gop-swing-state-election-romp/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1414489518714.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/john-avlon", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6dc\"", "article_summary": "And under this pro-choice Republican\u2019s leadership (yes, you read that right), the state GOP dropped its platform opposition to abortion and gay rights.\nNew Mexico\u2019s Martinez is the closest thing to a GOP star in this list of Main Street Republican governors.\nBut in the Buckeye State, he\u2019s been a moderating force, focusing on the economy and the embattled middle class, boasting an impressive job-creation record since the Great Recession started.\nThe Tea Party never loved him, and Branstad\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid did nothing to heal those wounds.\nUnder the RadarForget about the battle for control of the Senate and ugly congressional fights\u2014the real story this cycle is a handful of moderate Republican governors cruising to reelection."}
