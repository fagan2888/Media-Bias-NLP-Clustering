An Arizona State University professor is embroiled in controversy after a journalism student complained about an English course on race theory was announced. Appearing on Fox News, Lauren Clark said she was disturbed by the class offered in the Spring 2015 catalogue because it singled out white people as “the root cause of social injustices for this country.”

White supremacist groups, including the National Youth Front — an arm of the white nationalist organization American Freedom Party— were awakened and objected to a class called “Race Theory & the Problem of Whiteness.” According to Talking Points Memo, Professor Lee Bebout has been subjected to death threats and other menacing messages after his personal contact information and photos of his mixed-race family were shared on message boards.

New Jersey-based Angelo John Gage, a prior service Marine who chairs the NYF, called Bebout’s course “racist” and a clear indication that white people were again being victimized. “We’re an oppressed majority,” he said, quizzically. “But we’re becoming a minority, and that’s the concern I have with the future.”

He also maintained that his group is non-violent and not behind the flurry of e-mail threats sent to the professor. “We’re pressing on [the university] because what they’re doing is completely racist and hypocritical.” He questioned why ASU did not offer similar studies about a “blackness problem” or a “Jewishness problem.”

ASU defended the course and in a statement said the “problem of whiteness” class would “examine how people talk about – or avoid talking about – race in the contemporary United States.” It also defended the course as “designed to empower students to confront the difficult and often thorny issues that surround us today and reach thoughtful conclusions rather than display gut reactions.”
