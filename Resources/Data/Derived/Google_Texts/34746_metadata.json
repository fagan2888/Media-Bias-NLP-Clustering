However, rarely do we hear about someone eating healthier in an effort to improve their cognitive skills. A recent study published in the American Academy of Neurology\u2019s journal Neurology has found that adhering to a healthy diet can lower a person\u2019s risk for suffering a decline in memory and thinking as they get older.\n\n\u201cThe difference in our study is we didn\u2019t prescribe a particular diet or explore for a particular diet pattern,\u201d Smyth told CNN. \u201cWe just wanted to look at a diverse cohort of people all around the world and analyze what their risk for cognitive decline would be if they consumed what most organizations would consider a \u2018healthy diet.\u2019\u201d\n\nSmyth and his colleagues monitored the eating habits of 27,860 men and women from 40 different countries. Participants received grades based on reports indicating the amount of food they consumed from both healthy and unhealthy categories. Researchers also tested each participant\u2019s memory and thinking skills at baseline, two years, and five years after the start of the study.\n\nBy the end of the study, 4,699 men and women experienced a decline in their memory and thinking skills. After accounting for potential related factors, such as physical activity, high blood pressure, and a history of cancer, the research team found that people adhering to the healthiest diets based on a maximum scoring grade of 30 were 24 percent less likely to experience cognitive declines compared to people with the unhealthiest diets.\n\n\u201cAdoption of a healthy diet probably begins early in life, and a healthy diet might also go along with adoption of other healthy behaviors,\u201d Dr. Andrew Smyth, lead author of the study and nephrologist at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Harvard Medical School, the effect an unhealthy diet has on our brain is remarkably similar to the effect it has on our heart. A diet high in saturated fat and trans fats raises blood levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or \u201cbad\u201d cholesterol, which, over time builds up, resulting in damaged arteries. That same process can lead to the formation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain. Increased production of these stick protein clusters is often considered a warning sign for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nSource: Dehghan M, O\u2019Donnell M, Smyth A, et al.
