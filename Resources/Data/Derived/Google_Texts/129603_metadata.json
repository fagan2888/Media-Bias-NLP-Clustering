There\u2019s Frank Waln, a hip-hop artist seeking to protect the environment and his heritage, and pop musician Inez Jasper, demanding attention for women\u2019s rights and safe harbor from violence.\n\nMusicians Nataanii Means, son of American Indian Movement activist Russell Means, and Mike Clifford, working together to foster hope and fight suicide among American Indian youngsters, also are featured in the series, which recently debuted on MTV\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\u201cThe music is my shield and my weapon,\u201d Waln, a Sioux Indian from the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, says with touching determination in the film.\n\n\u201cRebel Music: Native America\u201d will air on channels including MTV2 and mtvU, and will be made available free for downloading or streaming on iTunes, Hulu and other platforms. It\u2019s the first long-form MTV program to debut on Facebook, the network said.\n\nThe episode \u2014 premiering well before season two begins next year in order to coincide with Native American Heritage Month \u2014 surprised even the executive behind it.\n\n\u201cI have never been so moved and inspired as I was by this production,\u201d said Nusrat Durrani, general manager of MTV World and creator of the \u201cRebel Music\u201d series. \u201cAs soon as we started the research, we knew we have a very compelling story right here in our own backyard.\u201d\n\nThe film does not shrink from touching on the harsh realities American Indians face, including suicide and poverty rates greater than the general U.S. population, he said. But that is \u201cbaseline,\u201d as Durrani put it.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to tell here is, \u2018Look at these young people and how they\u2019re overcoming their own circumstances and how they\u2019re empowering themselves to (bring) change,'\u201d he said.\n\nAmerican Indian filmmaker Billy Luther, the documentary\u2019s co-director, found the young artists to be as intrepid as they are impressive: One started making beats on an old Casio, he said, and others searched out in the community what they lacked at home.\n\n\u201cThese kids aren\u2019t necessarily victimized or complaining about what they don\u2019t have. They\u2019re using all their resources to make the change and create the art they want to,\u201d Luther said.\n\n\u201cRebel Music\u201d will return in March, featuring stories from Iran, Myanmar, Senegal, Turkey and Venezuela, and Durrani is eager for viewers to discover it and, he said, be heartened.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s another way of looking at the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world is not only steeped in negativity and conflict. \u2026 There are beautiful stories, too, stories that will inspire us and give us hope.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "MTV\u2019s \u2018Rebel Music\u2019 highlights American Indian activists", "title": "MTV\u2019s \u2018Rebel Music\u2019 highlights American Indian activists", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/13/mtvs-rebel-music-highlights-american-indian-activists/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141113__20141116_E6_AE16TVREBELMUSICp1.jpg", "height": 431}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141113__20141116_E6_AE16TVREBELMUSICp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-13T17:59:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:37:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "This time around, it stays close to home with American Indian activists.\nMusicians Nataanii Means, son of American Indian Movement activist Russell Means, and Mike Clifford, working together to foster hope and fight suicide among American Indian youngsters, also are featured in the series, which recently debuted on MTV\u2019s Facebook page.\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 When MTV\u2019s \u201cRebel Music\u201d debuted last year, the globe-trotting documentary series searched out passionate young artists driving change in hotspots including Egypt and Afghanistan.\n\u201cI have never been so moved and inspired as I was by this production,\u201d said Nusrat Durrani, general manager of MTV World and creator of the \u201cRebel Music\u201d series.\n\u201cThe music is my shield and my weapon,\u201d Waln, a Sioux Indian from the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, says with touching determination in the film."}
