Breaking apart the creed segment by segment, the writers at Ignite Your Faith expound on the beliefs presented.\n\nJesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary (from the Apostles\u2019 Creed).\n\nThe Tooth Fairy grabs a tooth out from under a pillow and then leaves a buck in its place. A big, bearded jolly guy parks his flying deer on roofs, squeezes himself through chimneys and leaves gifts under Christmas trees. A rabbit hops around the neighborhood (always unnoticed) and gives out candy \u2014 filled baskets. Admit it. You once believed all that. It\u2019s OK, we all did.\n\nThen somebody wise to the ways of the world \u2014 maybe a big, grown\u2013up 8-year-old cousin \u2014 tips us off: \u201cIt\u2019s not true! Nobody believes that kid stuff anymore!\u201d\n\nThen we stopped believing in fairy tales. We were no longer that gullible. We no longer believed the unbelievable. We were wise to the ways of the world. We wouldn\u2019t be fooled again.\n\nJesus was born of a virgin?\n\nHow are we to make sense of this outrageous idea found in our faith? We know how babies get here, and it has nothing to do with fairy tales or storks.\n\nThe truth is: Mary knew this, too. When told by an angel (yes, an angel), she was going to have a baby, she reacted like any smart, young virgin would react.\n\nFirst, she kind of freaked out \u2014 after all, a strange supernatural being was talking to her! Luke, a historian and not a writer of fairy tales, records that Mary was \u201cthoroughly shaken\u201d (Luke 1:29, The Message).\n\nThen Luke tells us how Mary responds to the angel: \u201cBut how? I\u2019ve never slept with a man.\u201d\n\nMary was right on target, wasn\u2019t she? She knew how women got pregnant. The angel then went on to answer her reasonable question. He told her that she would conceive a baby by the power of the Holy Spirit.\n\nMary may not have believed in fairy tales, but she did believe in the power of the God she followed. Here\u2019s how she replied to the angel\u2019s message: \u201cI am the Lord\u2019s servant, and I am willing to accept whatever he wants. May everything you have said come true\u201d (Luke 1:38, NLT).\n\nMary helps us to see that a miracle can happen\u2014God can do things that seem impossible. I guess that\u2019s what makes it a miracle. The impossible becomes possible.\n\nOf course, we don\u2019t have to simply take Mary\u2019s word for it. There is the ancient prophecy that predicts the virgin birth 750 years before Jesus was born. Isaiah 7:14 (NIRV) says: \u201cThe Lord himself will give you a miraculous sign. The virgin is going to have a baby. She will give birth to a son. And he will be called Immanuel [which means \u2018God with us\u2019].\u201d\n\nThe virgin birth is important. That\u2019s why it shows up in the Apostles\u2019 Creed. It tells us that Jesus\u2018 birth was a unique, once-and-only-once event. There have been no virgin births since, and we have no reason to believe there will be any virgin births in the future.\n\nGod wanted to get humanity\u2019s attention. He wanted to shout loud and clear: \u201cHere I am on Planet Earth! And to prove it, I will be born miraculously from a young and godly woman.\u201d\n\nGo to your Bible and read Isaiah 7:14. Now, spend a few minutes thinking about three truths:\n\nThese words were written hundreds of years before Jesus was born.\n\nThe birth of Jesus is a miraculous event that happened only once in history.\n\nThe virgin birth allowed God to be with us in the flesh. Christians believe these awesome truths.\n\nAnd that\u2019s no fairy tale.\n\nFor further reading, please visit Christianity Today and iDisciple.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Breaking apart the creed segment by segment, the writers at Ignite Your Faith expound on the beliefs presented on the virgin birth.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Breaking apart the creed segment by segment, the writers at Ignite Your Faith expound on the beliefs presented on the virgin birth.", "title": "CHRISTIANITY TODAY: Believing the unbelievable", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/20/christianity-today-believing-unbelievable/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/08/ap789236112823.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/08/ap789236112823.jpg", "description": "Breaking apart the creed segment by segment, the writers at Ignite Your Faith expound on the beliefs presented on the virgin birth.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "CHRISTIANITY TODAY: Believing the unbelievable"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Jesus, Luke"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe173a\"", "article_summary": "Nobody believes that kid stuff anymore!\u201dThen we stopped believing in fairy tales.\nWe know how babies get here, and it has nothing to do with fairy tales or storks.\nAnd he will be called Immanuel [which means \u2018God with us\u2019].\u201dThe virgin birth is important.\nThe virgin birth allowed God to be with us in the flesh.\nMary may not have believed in fairy tales, but she did believe in the power of the God she followed."}
