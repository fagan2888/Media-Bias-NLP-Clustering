The combination of problem software, changing deadlines and shifting regulations over the last two months is unprecedented, insurers say.\n\n\u201cGoing into this, knowing things weren\u2019t going to go swimmingly, we did a lot of scenario planning so the health plans could build out contingency plans,\u201d said Paul Lambdin of Deloitte Consulting, which advises insurers. \u201cAnd thank goodness we did. But no one thought up the scenario we\u2019re living in.\u201d\n\nMedical plans, with potentially billions in revenue at stake in the health law\u2019s expansion of private coverage, have hired extra workers to run phone banks and tangle with paper applications that were supposed to be processed online.\n\nThey\u2019ve assigned staff to pore through electronic enrollments that might be inaccurate or incomplete, or to remind customers to pay. They\u2019re guiding applicants who were expected to sign up on the federal healthcare.gov site or portals run by the states.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the problems associated with healthcare.gov and how long it took to be fixed, it seems unfair to ask insurance companies to have their systems incorporate these changes within a few weeks,\u201d said Stephen Zaharuk, an insurance industry analyst for Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which rates bonds.\n\nImplementing the health law involved countless deadlines, but one that can\u2019t budge is coverage for Jan. 1.\n\nOn Thursday the administration disclosed another change, exempting those whose policies have been cancelled from next year\u2019s coverage requirements and allowing them to buy high-deductible \u201ccatastrophic\u201d plans. Fewer than 500,000 people face losing insurance because of cancellation, administration officials told reporters.\n\nYesterday, the Obama administration pushed the deadline for enrollment until midnight on Christmas Eve, allowing consumers in three dozen states an extra day to sign up for coverage that is to begin on Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nAlthough marketplace enrollment for 2014 doesn\u2019t end until March 31, many consumers are counting on insurance in January to replace expiring 2013 plans. Others without coverage, many with existing illness, have been promised for years that Jan. 1 is when they can have affordable, subsidized, comprehensive coverage for the first time.\n\n\u201cI can tell you they\u2019re going to have people working through New Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d Lambdin said of the insurers. \u201cIf someone wants to see how hard the health plans are working, they can join them at their party.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office projected that 7 million would buy policies in 2014 issued by private insurers through the subsidized marketplaces, or exchanges. (That\u2019s in addition to millions more low-income consumers expected to gain new Medicaid coverage in states that chose to expand it.)\n\nBut thanks largely to computer problems that surfaced after the exchanges opened in October, fewer than half a million had signed up through November.\n\nThe phones are ringing\n\nSince then insurers and marketplace administrators have reported enrollment surges and substantially improved software.\n\n\u201cWe have definitely staffed up,\u201d said Jon Urbanek, a senior vice president at Florida Blue, the Blue Cross affiliate in that state. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at extremely high volumes coming in during the holidays.\u201d\n\nCall volume to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota \u201csort of ebbs and flows with the wait times on MNsure,\u201d the Minnesota portal that sometimes keeps people waiting an hour or more, said Scott Keefer, the insurer\u2019s vice president of policy.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan wrote a program to let applicants learn their eligibility for subsidies via phone text.\n\nHealth Care Service Corp. got a flood of calls related to President Barack Obama\u2019s request last month that insurers allow customers to renew 2013 plans that don\u2019t include required benefits under the Affordable Care Act, said Jeff Tikkanen, the company\u2019s president of retail markets. HCSC runs Blues plans in New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Illinois and Montana.\n\nThat, too, required more staff, he said.\n\nThe original signup deadline for January coverage was Dec. 15. In November, the Obama administration extended it to Dec. 23. This month it ordered insurers to accept payment even later \u2014 up to Dec. 31. Then insurers agreed to take payment until Jan. 10.\n\nInsurers have said little about the administration\u2019s request that they provide Jan. 1 coverage for those who sign up and pay after that.\n\nTaking preventive steps\n\nIn any case, nobody expects everything to be done on time.\n\nThe health maintenance organization Kaiser Permanente expects some new subscribers to walk into clinics without yet having received their membership cards.\n\n\u201cWe already have established mechanisms in place for handling people who show up at the medical centers but are not in our systems as members,\u201d said Kaiser spokesman Chris Stenrud. \u201cWe trust the member and provide any immediate care needs. If the person turns out not to be a member, we will bill them for those services.\u201d\n\n(Kaiser Health News is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.)\n\nCigna, selling exchange plans in Florida, Texas and elsewhere, has set up 24-hour hotlines, and a team to deal with new members and \u201cpost-enrollment snafus,\u201d said spokesman Joe Mondy. New subscribers should expect a welcome package, but \u201cif they don\u2019t get a binder within a week\u2019s time, they need to call us and make sure everything is in place,\u201d he said.\n\nBlue Cross Minnesota assigned people to double check electronic applications from MNsure.\n\n\u201cSometimes the addresses don\u2019t match. The date of birth may not match,\u201d Keefer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had cases showing the dependents are the parents, and the parents are actually the children. Weird stuff like that.\u201d\n\nAnother concern is that insurers might not get any enrollment file, flawed or not, from the federal healthcare.gov site run by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Insurers have reported continuing failures in data handoffs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem most of us are worried about \u2014 people who have selected a health plan and we haven\u2019t heard from CMS on,\u201d said HCSC\u2019s Tikkanen. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have a record of them I don\u2019t know who they are.\u201d\n\nFlorida Blue advises new customers to print a screen shot of the enrollment confirmation on healthcare.gov just in case related emails and data submissions don\u2019t get sent.\n\n\u201cThat gives them something to keep in hand,\u201d Urbanek said.\n\nJay Hancock and Julie Appleby write for Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
