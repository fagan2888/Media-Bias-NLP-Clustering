Rick Perry, in a speech today that hinted he might run for president again, said he is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the future of the United States.\n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly resilient country,\u201d said Perry. \u201cWe lived through a civil war, two world wars, we lived through the Great Depression, we lived through Jimmy Carter. We\u2019ll live through Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nPerry, addressing the audience at the First in the Nation Summit hosted by the New Hampshire Republican State Committee, said the next president shouldn\u2019t be \u201cof Washington\u201d or \u201cfrom Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cChange is only going to come from the outside from my perspective,\u201d said Perry. \u201cThere is nothing wrong in America that can\u2019t be fixed with new leaders. I believe that with all my heart. We are only a few good decisions away\u2014and a leadership change at the top\u2014from the best days this country has ever seen.\u201d\n\nHe criticized leaders in Washington, whom he referred to as \u201celites,\u201d for failing to listen to the will of the American people on issues like Obamacare, Common Core, national security and the tax rate.\n\n\u201cA congressional majority is a terrible thing to waste,\u201d said Perry, adding that \u201cliberals in Washington have spent 30 years criticizing Reaganomics while delivering what I refer to as trickle down liberalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cChange is only going to come from the outside from my perspective,\u201d says @GovernorPerry.\n\nThe next president, said Perry, must know how to address the threat of radical Islam, grow the economy and ease the tax burden.\n\nPerry outlined his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as the former governor of Texas, highlighting achievements in the state of Texas like job growth and efforts to secure the border.\n\nPerry added that a \u201cyoung, first-term senator\u201d may not have the necessary executive experience to be president, a possible allusion to his potential Republican opponents Sens. Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio.\n\nAsked by an audience member what would differentiate his second White House run from his first, Perry cited his own health.\n\nPerry said that in 2011 he had \u201cmajor back surgery,\u201d but he is now healed, and has used the years since to study the issues facing the United States and gain more executive experience.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Texas Gov.
