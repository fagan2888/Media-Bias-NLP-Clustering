Travis Hutson faces Democrat David Cox, an educator at Bethune-Cookman College. Republican attorney Paul Renner faces Democrat Adam Morley, until recently the owner of a recycling business, in the House race. But as often as the competing candidates agreed with each other, it was at times difficult to distinguish Democrat from Republican.\n\nNeither debate nor discussion\u2014candidates could not engage each other, the moderator could not pose follow up questions, time limits or scant knowledge, with a few exceptions during the Hutson-Cox portion of the evening, kept candidates from so much as challenging each other\u2019s statements\u2014the forum was short on substance or surprises and long on generalities and sloganeering (about cutting taxes and representing Flagler especially). If some 20 of the 52 people who\u2019d been in the room at the start had walked out between the first and second segment, you couldn\u2019t blame them (though some of them had just sought a break or a bit more wine before facing the slog of the second segment).\n\nAnd while prominent local Republicans were in the audience, few Democratic leaders were\u2014perhaps a sign that the party has already surrendered to the inevitable, with two Republican candidates already benefiting from crushing financial advantages set to profit from voting districts drawn purposefully to heavily favor Republican candidates.\n\nThey agreed that state trust funds should not be raided. On the state retirement system\u2014considered among the most sound in the nation, and made even sounder by the relatively new requirement that all state employees pay 3 percent of their wages into it\u2014neither candidate could answer the question of how to reform it beyond Renner\u2019s call for making it \u201cfairer,\u201d ensuring its stability and making it more transparent (none of which have been an issue with the system). Morley didn\u2019t know how to answer the question. On economically aligning Flagler with Volusia or St. Johns\u2014north or south\u2014the responses were vague, too, with Morley speaking of developing this region\u2019s own identity and Renner saying it could \u201ctry to belong in both places and try to capture what we can from both.\u201d\n\nOn taxes, Renner, who repeatedly stressed his conservative credentials, spoke in favor of reducing the sales tax on commercial leases, saying\u2014not quite accurately\u2014that \u201cwhatever we tax, we get less of.\u201d Morley, who just sold his recycling business, did not answer the question directly (which had specifically asked how the Legislature should reform taxes on commercial leases), saying he is in \u201cfull support of anything that\u2019s going to help our small, local entrepreneurs start their own companies.\u201d Neither sounded thrilled by a proposed sales tax holiday the Saturday after Thanksgiving.\n\nCompeting candidates oddly comfortable agreeing with each other in a forum that forcibly limited substantive discussion.\n\nIt was not until the fifth question that the two candidates displayed a definable difference on policy. The question was about Amendment 1, the constitutional amendment that requires that a third of all revenue from the tax on documents on real estate transactions be dedicated to the Land Acquisition Trust Fund. The fund\u2019s purpose is explicit: to underwrite sensitive land preservation in the state. The initiative was the end result of five years of the Scott administration zeroing out funding for Florida Forever, which had fulfilled that purpose previously. The amendment passed with 75 percent approval. But the GOP-dominated Legislature has since been pushing to redefine the amendment\u2019s allowances, interpreting it as license to spend money on water projects, including flood-control and other infrastructure initiatives that don\u2019t fit under the ballot initiative\u2019s conservation definition.\n\nMorley stated explicitly that the Legislature was changing voters\u2019 intent \u201cinto what\u2019s going to work best for political gain. I would like to see Amendment 1 used how it was intended to be used, and the way that voters thought it was going to be used.\u201d Renner, echoing a majority of local political sentiment, said he believed voters\u2019 intent was broader, including beach restoration and such ongoing issues as the drainage problems in the Malacompra-Marineland Acres area of Flagler\u2019s Hammock. The Flagler Beach City Commission, anticipating its own wastewater and beach restoration projects ahead, passed a resolution calling on the Legislature to take the broader approach, and the county commission is hoping to secure dollars for Malacompra drainage under that same definition.\n\nWNZF Audio: Cox-Hutson Get the Flash Player to see the wordTube Media Player.\n\nA misleading question about \u201crising health care cost\u201d and what the candidates propose to \u201calleviate that burden\u201d was an occasion for Renner to declare he is \u201cabsolutely, unequivocally opposed to the Affordable Care Act, I think it\u2019s bad on many, many levels.\u201d Morley, who agreed with Renner to some extent, said he was more inclined to find a \u201chappy medium\u201d with the law. (The verdict on post-ACA health care costs is mixed: while more people are reporting hardship with the affordability of basic medical care because of rising out of pocket costs, which the ACA did not address, fewer people are reporting hardship from medical debts, fewer people are avoiding doctors\u2019 visits for fear of medical bills, and 10 million more people are insured, while the nation\u2019s overall health costs increased at their slowest pace since 1960 in 2013, the last full year for which numbers are available.) (An earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed Renner\u2019s opposition to the law to Morley.)\n\nCandidates then turned their attention to questions provided by the audience, including such softballs as what they would do to \u201cpromote the positive message that Flagler County is open for business\u201d (a question Moreley said was too broad and undefined to elicit an answer), on legalized gambling (both are opposed) and what to do to better develop the solar energy industry in the state: Morley lives in an all-solar house and is an ardent proponent of the industry, which he said has been purposefully held back by the Legislature and state law that favors fossil-fuel industries. Renner said solar panels are not affordable for now, but could become so, giving the industry a \u201cbright future.\u201d He did not say what he would do as a legislator to make that possible.\n\nAsked if they\u2019d support a proposal to allow guns on Florida\u2019s college and university campuses, Renner said yes, while Morley said he supported \u201ccommon-sense approaches to guns,\u201d without answering the question.\n\nMorley sought to use his underdog role to his advantage, but with limited effect. Addressing his detractors, he said: \u201cYou know what I say? When something is worth fighting for, you don\u2019t give a crap what the odds are, you don\u2019t care what the critics think, and you don\u2019t wait for someone else. You fight. That is what I\u2019m doing here today. I am fighting for my district.\u201d But it was never clear exactly what he was fighting for, leaving one of the only prominent Democrats in attendance to say during a great: \u201cHow do I vote for this guy?\u201d The response was not much different than the one Morley got when he met local Democratic leaders earlier this month.\n\nThe Senate candidates got largely different questions except for the one on Amendment 1, the land-acquisition amendment, which Hutson interpreted so broadly as to include initiatives that would include desalination plants, sewage treatment and recycling plants. Cox, surprisingly for a candidate keen on environmentalism, did not disagree, and went so far as to wrap in erosion control into his definition of the amendment. \u201cWe need to get up there and we need to start fighting for some of these funds to come right here to our communities,\u201d Cox said, \u201cas Travis was talking about, the waterways, we can talk about Flagler Beach which is right here and the road that is eroding and literally falling into the ocean, the issue of not if, but when.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the questions were quite a bit more wonkish than the House round, focusing on the Senate\u2019s appropriations process, online voter registration, incentives targeted to specific industries (which they both favor in times of surplus), the job shortage in science and engineering and how to \u201cimprove the business climate.\u201d Hutson conflated the question about online voter registration with online voting, and was categorically opposed, saying it lends itself to fraud. \u201cI like the fact that you come in, present an ID, this is who I am, it matches my face, this is where I live, check me off, yes, I\u2019m going to vote,\u201d Hutson said. \u201cI believe that we\u2019ve done several different things to provide more access for voter registration and more access for early voting days and special times for voters to vote.\u201d But, he said, an online would be too costly and voter-prone.\n\n\u201cI have to completely disagree with everything that my opponent just said,\u201d Cox countered. \u201cWe need more people to vote in this country. Our voting is down significantly. We just look at the primary my opponent just went through, and the numbers are abysmal.\u201d Easing registration would help, he said, describing the issue in bi-partisan terms and citing other states\u2019 success with online systems. Paying for it should not be an issue in a state that pays for 10 days of early voting. The two candidates were more aligned on a question about Florida\u2019s closed primary system: they \u201cabsolutely\u201d agreed with each other, in Hutson\u2019s words: keep it closed.\n\nHutson, who\u2019s only served one two-year term in the House, sought to portray himself as a seasoned incumbent who knows how to pass bills. Cox has never served in any elected office. He\u2019s an administrator and teacher at Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach. But to counter Hutson\u2019s recurring theme, he returned a few times to criticizing Republican-driven process that led to the special election he\u2019s running in, criticizing its cost, its timing, and its short-changing Flagler and the rest of the district of a senator until late in the session. Hutson sought to counter that criticism by describing himself as an active House member still pushing for local dollars\u2014even as, in another answer, he spoke of cutting tax revenue and supporting state employee job cuts.\n\nAs in the Morely-Renner segment of the evening, the Hutson-Cox segment dragged and slogged until the end, when they got a bit more interesting with the forum organizer\u2019s last question and with audience-written questions, particularly with the last question: allowing firearms on college campuses. The question had resonance for Cox, being an administrator on a campus where just two evenings ago, three bystanders on campus\u2013Juanya Jones, 20, Keshaun Reeves, 18, and Dante Ridford, 18\u2014were injured by graze wounds from a shooting, though only Reves was hospitalized. (A previous version of this story incorrectly reported that all three had been hospitalized.) Police were still seeking the shooter Wednesday.\n\nWNZF Audio: Morley-Renner Get the Flash Player to see the wordTube Media Player.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m vehemently against this idea,\u201d Cox said. \u201cI work in a school system, I think that guns have absolutely no place in schools. I spent the majority of the day today, and I was late to the meeting today because we had a school shooting last night at Bethune-Cookman University, where three students were shot.\u201d He summarized the event. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you, if we allowed concealed weapons and allowed guns to be on our campus, that situation could have continued to escalate and become the OK Corral. They have no place in the classroom, they have no place in the educational system.\u201d The university president, Cox said, echoed the same sentiments.\n\nRenner\u2019s statement against the Affordable Care Act aside, it was the most categorical position-taking of the evening. Hutson cos-sponsored the bill to allow guns on campuses. Cox called for him to withdraw the measure, \u201cas this is now in our backyard.\u201d\n\nHutson, of course, will not do so. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about concealed weapons carry guns, an individual that\u2019s over 21 years old, that\u2019s gone through a complete background check, has nothing in his past, that can carry on campus,\u201d Hutson said. \u201cSome of these are ex-military guys. Some of those have been around and understand how to handle firearms.\u201d Hutson had one caveat: if the student live primarily on campus and the weapon is not in his or her possession, it must be locked in a secure environment like a safe. But safe storage is already the law in Florida.\n\nCox invited Hutson to visit Bethune-Cookman \u201cto have this discussion about weapons on campuses, because I think if you talked to the students that are on these campuses and the ones that had bullets flying by their heads yesterday, they\u2019ll have a much different opinion of that bill.\u201d Hutson agreed \u201cgladly.\u201d\n\nAsked about their top three issues beyond economic development, job growth and education, Hutson cited beach restoration, water issues and transportation, while Hutson cited Medicaid and Social Security \u201cbeing secure here\u201d (though neither fall under the Legislature\u2019s authority), and the Affordable Care Act (which in many ways does). \u201cThe state of Florida just became No. 1 with the Affordable Care Act, we passed 1.6 million folks, and yet we continue,\u201d Cox said, referring to the Florida Legislature\u2019s opposition to federally funded expansion of Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor that can be vastly enlarged through the ACA, \u201cto deny the federal funds coming in here to the state. Those are federal funds we desperately need here to service this population. The program is in place, it\u2019s here. My opponent and others are adamantly against the Affordable Care Act, but it\u2019s here, it\u2019s in place, we need to work on funding it.\u201d\n\nCox also cited \u201copportunities for all\u201d as one of his priorities\u2014the Workforce Opportunity Act, which Hutson co-sponsored last year before the bill died, and which focuses on the LGBT community rights (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) in a state where it\u2019s \u201cstill legal\u201d to fire someone based on sexual orientation., Cox said.\n\nThe forum was organized by the Flagler County Chamber of Commerce and Affiliates, the Flagler County Home Builders Association and the Flagler County Association of Realtors, whose members developed the questions that preceded audience-supplied questions.
