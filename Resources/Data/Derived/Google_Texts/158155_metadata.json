A battle over defunding President Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, spearheaded by Cruz, led to a 16 day government shutdown that some estimate cost the country $24 billion.\n\nRELATED: Cruz defiant, unapologetic and critical of GOP colleagues as Senate leaders reach deal\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t win this battle, but I am encouraged that we have demonstrated that when the American people stand up, the House of Representatives will listen, and I hope in time the Senate will listen also,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked about his appetite for another standoff when the current debt ceiling extension expires, Cruz signalled his willingness to do it again. \u201cWhat I intend to do is continue standing with the American people to work to stop Obamacare because it isn\u2019t working,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an interview played on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Cruz reiterated that he is not finished attacking the nation\u2019s fledgeling health care plan. \u201cThere are a lot of politicians in Washignton who want to put Obamacare behind us, who say, \u2018Ok fine, no more. No more discussing Obamacare.\u2019 You know what? The American people are not satisfied with that.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Ted Cruz gains popularity among conservatives, poll shows\n\nCruz insisted he was acting on behalf of Americans who share his position. While his statement is not necessarilysupported by national polls, he is able to assert enough anecdotal support, particularly in Texas, to form the basis of a critique of some of his Washington colleagues.\n\nHe continued to blame Senate Republicans for not supporting the House in its endeavour. \u201cThe reason this failed is simple: Senate Republicans didn\u2019t unite,\u201d he said. Implicit in Cruz\u2019s criticism is an admonisment of Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell. Without critizing McConnell directly, Cruz expressed a lack of respect for party hierarchy, saying \u201cI don\u2019t work for the party bosses in Washington.\u201d\n\nOn ABC, Cruz repeated the line that is quickly becoming his trademark: \u201cI\u2019m not serving in office because I desperately needed 99 new friends in the U.S. Senate.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Joe Scarborough \u201cdares\u201d Ted Cruz to keep \u201churting\u201d Americans", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "NBC Latino", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Latino", "description": "A defiant Ted Cruz vowed to continue fighting Obamacare on Sunday, and criticized his fellow Senate Republicans for not coalescing\u2026", "title": "Ted Cruz: I would \u2018do anything\u2019 to stop\u00a0Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://nbclatino.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/senatortedcruzshutdownaverted.gif", "height": 480}, "url": "http://nbclatino.com/2013/10/20/ted-cruz-i-would-do-anything-to-stop-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCLatino.com", "description": "A defiant Ted Cruz vowed to continue fighting Obamacare on Sunday, and criticized his fellow Senate Republicans for not coalescing \u2026 Read More", "creator": "@nbclatino", "url": "http://nbclatino.com/2013/10/20/ted-cruz-i-would-do-anything-to-stop-obamacare/", "title": "Ted Cruz: I would \u2018do anything\u2019 to stop Obamacare", "site": "@nbclatino", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "The Voice of American Hispanics", "fb": {"app_id": 330581213700140}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "texas", "published_time": "2013-10-20T19:39:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-21T09:10:56+00:00", "author": "Will Femia, MSNBC"}, "google-site-verification": "IqILHHObWa8hawB1yh-cpqDPoygQ3Fb6IhXiQP7RZPM", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nbclatino.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/12f061d117b958a4951214da16b5cab8?s=16"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhat I intend to do is continue standing with the American people to work to stop Obamacare because it isn\u2019t working,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI will continue to do anything I can to stop the train wreck that is Obamacare,\u201d the Texas Republican said on ABC\u2019s This Week.\nA defiant Ted Cruz vowed to continue fighting Obamacare on Sunday, and criticized his fellow Senate Republicans for not coalescing around his failed strategy.\n\u201cThere are a lot of politicians in Washignton who want to put Obamacare behind us, who say, \u2018Ok fine, no more.\nHe continued to blame Senate Republicans for not supporting the House in its endeavour."}
