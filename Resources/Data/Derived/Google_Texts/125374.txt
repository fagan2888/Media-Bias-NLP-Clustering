There’s no time for chatter during a Gary Kubiak training camp. No standing around. No minute or second spared.

The energy at Kubiak’s practices is palpable, even to those watching from the sidelines. For the 90 players running through drills and formations, the practices can be draining.

“I’m exhausted,” safety T.J. Ward said Saturday. “These have been two really hard output days, but we got some good work in and guys are fighting through it.”

The morning workouts open to fans feature a heavy rotation of individual and situational drills, with units changing often to give coaches a look at every combination of players. Weight-room sessions are quick but efficient. The afternoon walk-throughs are more like jog-throughs. And the three meetings — up from the usual two — are sandwiched in between.

For some, the pace is nothing new. Kubiak has created a following, and many of his players from past teams have re-joined him in Denver. They know the routine — and its benefits.

“There are some camps out there that definitely shorten careers. Kubes’ camp is one that allows you to stay fresh the whole season,” said tight end Owen Daniels, who played under Kubiak in Houston and Baltimore before signing with Denver. “He’s awesome about throwing us a bone here or there to get us fresh mentally or physically. Both of those things that are very important. I don’t remember a lot of times in the past where we really dragged late in the season. We’ve been pretty consistent all the way through and the camp has a lot to do with it.”

For the others, the up-tempo practices and camp days are grueling but welcome.

“I like it,” said Demaryius Thomas, who missed mini camp and organized team activities because of contract negotiations. “It gets you in better shape quick. You’re always on the go. When you get on the field, you’re always on the go. (We’re) going to be able to run longer than any other team, I feel like, if we just stick with it.”
