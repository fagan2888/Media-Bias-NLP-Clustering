The federal government paid the startup costs for HealthSource RI \u2013 to the tune of nearly $170 million at last count \u2013 but it\u2019s up to the states to figure out how to pay to keep it operating going forward.\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act was passed, top Democrats in Washington assumed most states would set up their own marketplaces (also known as exchanges). But the enormous political backlash against the law led more than half the states to refuse, so they\u2019re using the federal HealthCare.gov website instead.\n\nRhode Island, though, is one of 14 states that opted for the original plan and set up its own, locally-run exchange. And that means the state has to come up with its own way to pay the tab for HealthSource RI, which has 33,000 enrollees and also serves as a sign-up portal for Medicaid.\n\nNot that Rhode Island has been immune from the mixed emotions surrounding Obamacare; a significant number of state lawmakers, up to and including Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, have questioned whether the state should bother keeping (and paying for) HealthSource RI rather than default back to HealthCare.gov. But the Raimondo administration has come down firmly in favor of retaining HealthSource RI.\n\nNeither option is free.\n\nTo pay for HealthCare.gov, the federal government calculates a 3.5% \u201cuser fee\u201d on all health plans sold on the exchange \u2013 but then spreads the cost of the assessment across all similar health plans, including those sold off the exchange, which reduces the amount of the charge on each one.\n\nTo pay for HealthSource RI, Article 28 of Raimondo\u2019s budget proposes charging two different assessment rates starting Jan. 1: a 4.7% assessment on all individual health plans sold in Rhode Island, and a 1% assessment on all small-group health plans sold in the state. That generates more money than the HealthCare.gov assessment would.\n\nAnother difference between the two: Raimondo\u2019s assessment rate would be set annually by the secretary of health and human services \u2013 currently Elizabeth Roberts \u2013 at whatever level is necessary to generate enough money to cover HealthSource RI\u2019s budget, and the rates for small group plans versus individual ones will be apportioned by their share of total HealthSource RI enrollment. (Note that an executive-branch official, not lawmakers, would have the power to set the rate.) The Obama administration\u2019s regulations reserve the right to change the fee as necessary, too, but so far it\u2019s been kept at 3.5% for three years.\n\nConfused yet?\n\nA new brief from Steve Whitney\u2019s Senate Fiscal Office team makes things a little clearer. Here\u2019s a graphic they worked up to show how much the two assessments would generate in Rhode Island, based on HealthSource\u2019s projections that Rhode Island\u2019s health-insurance market will sell 39,000 individual plans and 63,000 small-group plans in 2016:\n\nAs you can see, once you get through all the complicated math of how the fees work, Raimondo\u2019s proposed HealthSource RI assessment is projected to cost Rhode Islanders 66% more than the HealthCare.gov assessment, or an extra $4.7 million, in its first year (2016).\n\nThe key difference is between the \u201cofficial\u201d rates: 3.5% for HealthCare.gov and 1%/4.7% for HealthSource RI. Nobody actually pays 3.5% for HealthCare.gov, because the cost gets spread out among all health plans, even those off the exchange, which lowers the effective rate paid by each plan. The HealthSource RI assessment, by comparison, calculates its 1% or 4.7% fee off all health plans to begin with, so the effective rate is the same.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Senate Fiscal Office put that in chart form:\n\nTo simplify things a little, here are two charts I made comparing just the effective assessment rates that would be added to Rhode Island\u2019s individual and small-group plans to pay for each version of the Obamacare marketplace:\n\n(In reality, of course, there is no \u201c2015\u201d fee since it\u2019s not being charged this year \u2013 but those charts show how much Senate Fiscal estimates it would come to at current enrollment levels.)\n\nWhen all is said and done, HealthSource RI is seeking an annual budget of a bit more than $11 million. The question is whether that\u2019s more than Rhode Island\u2019s individual and small-group health plans would have to pay if the state switched to HealthCare.gov instead. Here\u2019s what Senate Fiscal says about the cost of switching:\n\nThe option for the State to transition from a state-based exchange to the federal exchange remains open. HSRI reports that the State would incur one-time costs of $2.7 million in both FY2017 and FY2018 to transition to the federal exchange. Ongoing costs associated with the federal exchange include a 3.5 percent federal assessment on policies sold within the exchange, which totals $8.6 million at enrollment levels assumed for FY2017 and FY2018, as well as $240,000 in ongoing state costs.\n\nAdd all that together \u2013 $8.6 million in assessment fees, $2.7 million in one-time transition costs, $240,000 in ongoing state costs \u2013 and voil\u00e0, the cost of joining HealthCare.gov in the 2016-17 budget year is about $11.5 million. That\u2019s slightly more than the $11.2 million HealthSource RI says it will need to operate in the same year.\n\n(Another interesting statistic in the Senate Finance brief: Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island says its annual premiums already include an average of $432 in federal and state taxes this year, even before any HealthSource RI/HealthCare.gov assessment gets added.)\n\nAll this leaves lots of unanswered questions. Would the $2.7 million in transition costs to join HealthCare.gov last for more than two fiscal years? How likely is it the next president keeps the HealthCare.gov assessment at 3.5%? (Or keeps the Affordable Care Act at all?) Will HealthSource RI\u2019s budget grow, shrink or stay around $11 million down the line? How many large employers, if any, will use HealthSource RI once they\u2019re allowed to join in 2017? And will the coming decision in King v. Burwell mean Rhode Islanders can\u2019t get insurance subsidies unless the state keeps HealthSource RI?\n\nAnother question: how solid are HealthSource RI\u2019s enrollment projections? The exchange\u2019s current forecast calls for small-group enrollment to jump by a whopping 220% in 2016 \u2013 from 3,282 enrollees currently to 10,515 \u2013 and then by another 38% in 2017. The HealthCare.gov assessment would be lower if enrollment falls short of those projections, since the federal fee is driven by the number of plans sold in the marketplace \u2013 which would likely make HealthSource RI more expensive.\n\nCost, of course, is just one piece of the HealthSource RI debate. Christine Ferguson, its founding executive director, often made the case that a state-based marketplace would give state officials more power to push for beneficial changes in the medical sector overall.\n\n\u201cMore than just an online health insurance marketplace, HealthSource RI is envisioned as a driver of healthcare reform through negotiating lower-cost insurance options for individuals and small businesses, increasing accountability through new quality measures for plans and providers, and providing industry-wide transparency of costs and prices,\u201d Senate Fiscal says. \u201cIt will allow for broader regulatory authority over the health insurance market and will support larger health care system reform goals.\u201d\n\nLawmakers now have to decide whether they want to pay for that.\n\nTed Nesi (tnesi@wpri.com) covers politics and the economy for WPRI.com and writes the Nesi\u2019s Notes blog.
