Fabrizio Costantini for the Wall Street Journal\n\nWall Street Journal reporters John Emshwiller and Gary Fields have uncovered a largely unnoticed but extremely important consequence of the decades-long war on crime: In the past 20 years, their reporting found, authorities have made more than a quarter billion arrests.\n\nAbout 80 million individuals \u2013 nearly one in every three adults \u2013 have a criminal record on file with the FBI.\n\nMr. Emshwiller and Mr. Fields answered questions in a Reddit AMA. Read the AMA here.\n\nThe impact of this has been huge, affecting people\u2019s ability to get jobs, housing, admission to college, professional licenses and loans, among other repercussions\n\nThe damage has been magnified by the rise of the Internet, which has made access to criminal-records information far more available. A generation ago, someone had to go to a court house and sift through paper records. Now, a computer search can turn up such information in seconds.\n\nTheir reporting also found that the law-enforcement crackdown turned many juvenile offenses that were once viewed as worth nothing more than a visit to the principal\u2019s office into crimes that could burden a kid\u2019s future.\n\nFor many adults, their criminal records were being created in courts that often failed to provide due-process rights guaranteed by the Constitution, including the right to have a defense attorney.\n\nThe failure to ensure such rights raised questions about whether people were being convicted of crimes they didn\u2019t commit.\n\nThe stories:\n\nAs Arrest Records Rise, Americans Find Consequences Can Last a Lifetime\n\nFor More Teens, Arrests by Police Replace School Discipline\n\nJustice Is Swift as Petty Crimes Clog Courts\n\nDecadeslong Arrest Wave Vexes Employers", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "About 80 million individuals \u2013 nearly one in every three American adults - have a criminal record on file with the FBI.
