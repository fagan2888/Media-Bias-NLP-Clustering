MOGI DAS CRUZES, Brazil (AP) — Belgium winger Kevin De Bruyne was helped off the pitch, limping on a lame right ankle. At the same time, Divock Origi was already getting ice treatment on his ankle.

No World Cup opponents were to blame for these knocks, just some very fired up teammates.

Belgium is among the teams still waiting for its opening game in Brazil, and that means nerves are ever more on edge. Everyone wants to secure a spot in Tuesday’s starting lineup against Algeria, and training sessions have been fierce.

Belgium coach Marc Wilmots, known as the Fighting Boar in his playing days, sees the positive of it, though he hopes the sore ankles don’t turn into real injuries.

Wilmots said that “maybe it went over the edge a couple of times, but I’d rather have this. Everyone has something to prove.”
