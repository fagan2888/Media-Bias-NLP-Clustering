Rockwell Complements Jacobs Automation with MagneMotion Acquisition

The deal follows the purchases of Adept Technology and B+ Equipment

Rockwell Automation (NYSE: ROK) has agreed to buy packaging systems manufacturer MagneMotion. Financial terms were not disclosed.

MagneMotion, based in Devens, Massachusetts, makes automated conveyor belts and assembly lines for the automotive, packaging and industrial sectors. The target will become part of Rockwell’s motion business after the deal closes.

For Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Rockwell, the MagneMotion acquisition will complement its 2013 purchase of motion control systems provider Jacobs Automation. Jacobs is known for its iTrak technology brand, which Rockwell said will supplement MagneMotion. iTrak produces motion systems that is designed to make manufacturing processes quicker. Rockwell makes sensors and automated processing systems for the food and beverage, infrastructure and industrial industries.

“We see a future where the transportation of products within the factory, whether inside of a particular machine or between machines, will be fully controlled to optimize the productivity and flexibility of the entire process,” says Rockwell vice president Marco Wishart.
