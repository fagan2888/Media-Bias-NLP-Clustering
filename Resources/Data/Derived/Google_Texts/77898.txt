A Lafayette police officer was hospitalized Saturday after being struck by an intoxicated man who drove into the cop on his way out of the Flatirons Community Church parking lot, officials said.

Around 6:45 p.m., Flatirons staff contacted Lafayette police to report a man who appeared to be intoxicated inside the church. When police reached him in the parking lot, Cmdr. Gene McCausey said, he struck an officer and drove away.

In the rain, officers pursuing the man westbound on Baseline Road lost sight of him.

"Louisville (police) got involved but they quickly lost sight of him, too," McCausey said.

He was ultimately arrested in Cottonwood Park in Louisville after a citizen called in to report she'd seen the man's car, a description of which was aired by radio.

The man was booked at about 7 p.m. on suspicion of first-degree assault, resisting arrest, obstructing a peace officer and a slew of traffic infractions.

As of 10:45 p.m., McCausey said, officers still had not identified the man because "he's not being very cooperative with us." McCausey said the man had neither identification nor any ownership paperwork related to the car. Depending on whether the man is able to show that paperwork, he may be charged with not having a valid driver's license.

The injured officer, who McCausey didn't identify, has been released from the hospital and a full recovery is expected.
