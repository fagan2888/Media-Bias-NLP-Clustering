An Oklahoma City man who grew up poor and who benefited from free community meals is giving back to help others.

Jabee Williams is an award winning rap artist. He put together a free concert with several other artists to bring in donations for the homeless.

The Oklahoma City rap artist struggled with homelessness growing up.

“My mom was driving around with all of her kids in the car, not knowing where we were going to be,” Williams said.

Hunger was a problem, holidays or not.

“This is a great time of year, it's a happy time of year, but for a lot of people it's not,” he told News 9.

Williams and his family often survived on the generosity of others.

“There were Christmases where we did stand in line for the dinners and the turkeys and stuff like that,” Williams explained.

Now, he is giving back and using his music to do it.

Williams will lead an all-star line-up for Gift Raps 2, an annual concert that also serves as a food and clothing drive to support CityCare OKC, a homeless outreach organization.

“Even though I'm not like some super celebrity, I'm not rich, I don't have a lot of money, there are things that we can do that can give back to our community and also fight hunger and just make a change in people's lives,” Williams said.

Williams wrote his first rap at age 7 and he is proud of the fact that he does not use curse words in his music.

“My heart is for my community, my heart is for youth, my heart is for the people of Oklahoma City,” Williams said.

The more people who attend the concert, means more donations for those who are struggling.

“The core, the heart of what we are doing tonight is to help other people,” he added.

The Gift Raps 2 free event is at the Speakeasy at 1114 NW 51st Street in Oklahoma City at 9 p.m. on Friday, December 18.

Bring warm clothing items or non-perishable food items to donate.
