A West Palm Beach doctor faces new charges that he botched cosmetic surgeries and allowed unlicensed employees to perform procedures.

Another 46 former patients at West Palm’s Health and Beauty Cosmetic Surgery center have come forward since the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office first charged Dr. William Marrocco and three employees in February.

On Wednesday, Marrocco and employees Juan Carlos Pinzon and Monica Daza were arrested on new charges, connected to 15 new alleged victims, according to the Palm Beach Post. Each one is charged with 15 counts of practicing medicine without a license.

Arrest reports allege that one employee ate lunch during surgery, and that he also asked a patient under local anesthesia to get up and reposition herself during a procedure, the Post reports.
