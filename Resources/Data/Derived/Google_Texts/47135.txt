A strange scene in Midwest City landed one suspect in cuffs with another on the run. This was a wild one that partly played out right in front of one of News 9's cameras. News 9 caught the tail end of what turned out to be one bizarre ordeal.

It ended with the suspect yelling for his mother, but before it got to that point, there was a chain of events that even police had a hard time putting together. Neighbors also were not sure what went down at the house where it all started.

“I don't even know who all lives over there,” Kelly Demick said. “I've never seen a constant vehicle over there.”

On that night, it was a maroon minivan parked in the street. A probable cause affidavit said police showed up after two people said a man by the name of Kevin Clay and another unidentified man walked inside, and the unidentified man hit a woman in the head. That's when the document said that man and another man started fighting. Clay soon joined in, and before you knew it, that fight poured out to the porch and eventually, Clay took off in the minivan.

The report stated there were "children yelling and screaming in the van as it sped away at a high rate of speed."

“These people dragged a guy out and were beating him,” Demick said. “It's something else.”

So was what happened next. That minivan with the crying children inside was involved in a hit-and-run accident. Clay finally ditched the van and with the children took off running on foot into the backyard of a house.

He also tried to hijack another vehicle that was parked in the street while he was at it. However, he couldn't find the keys, and police found him.

Clay was taken into custody and faces a slew of charges.
