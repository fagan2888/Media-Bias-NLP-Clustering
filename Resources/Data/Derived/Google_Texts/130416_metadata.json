How can one state elect two senators with such differing views on a wide range of issues? But for those of us who live in this purple swing state, home to the hotly contested first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses and two strong political parties that routinely battle it out in close elections, we see a split that fits our landscape.\n\nMuch of Harkin\u2019s and Grassley\u2019s success can be attributed to the fact that both senators, although dedicated partisans, repeatedly have shown Iowans a pragmatic side that\u2019s appealing to voters beyond their respective parties. Although both senators have been at the center of highly partisan fights over the years, each also has had many moments when they bucked their parties\u2019 agenda to stand up for what\u2019s best for Iowa.\n\nFor the most part, Iowa has benefited. And Iowans of all political stripes have been well represented, regardless of which party controls the Senate.\n\nBut now, Harkin is leaving the stage. And Iowans are faced with the remarkably rare prospect of an open U.S. Senate seat. And it is through this prism of three decades of balanced, bipartisan representation and political pragmatism that we view our current choice.\n\nUnfortunately, the race between the major party nominees, U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley, a Democrat from Waterloo, and state Sen. Joni Ernst, a Republican from Red Oak, has been anything but bipartisan or pragmatic. Tens of millions of dollars have been poured into the campaign by outside interest groups on both sides of the political aisle. Much of that money has been spent on a blistering barrage of negative TV ads assailing each candidate.\n\nSubstance has been among the main casualties of that barrage. Much of the campaign has been focused on the candidates\u2019 personalities, with chickens and pigs making prominent appearances. Debates have offered us too little insight into what Braley and Ernst hope to do if they win the Senate seat. It\u2019s been largely attack and counterattack.\n\nSo we hoped, amid all the noise and negativity, to meet with Braley and Ernst in a setting that would allow us to ask questions on the issues. Braley met with our editorial board for more than an hour. But Ernst\u2019s campaign failed to make time in her schedule.\n\nWe admire Ernst\u2019s career of public service, in local government, in the Legisalture and in the Iowa National Guard, and were looking forward to hearing more. We met with Ernst before the June primary and came away impressed, even if she ultimately did not earn our primary endorsement. But the general election campaign is a different beast, which clearly has provided more than enough new issues and questions to warrant a second meeting and a second look.\n\nWe\u2019ve been troubled by several of the issue positions Ernst has taken on the campaign trail. This editorial board has, for instance, been supportive of stepped up efforts to clean up dozens of impaired waterways, with an eye on flood mitigation and soil conservation. But Ernst has said she favors not just curtailing but fully eliminating the federal Environmental Protection Agency, while relying on states to police pollution. As we\u2019ve learned in recent years, watersheds and water quality problems don\u2019t respect state boundaries. Ernst\u2019s position strikes us as politically motivated and environmentally unsound.\n\nWe\u2019ve favored a modest, incremental, increase in the minimum wage, while Ernst has suggested that there should be no federal minimum at all. In a 2012 questionnaire, Ernst said she favored state action to nullify the federal Affordable Care Act and arrest federal officials who sought to implement it. It\u2019s one thing to oppose the Affordable Care Act as bad policy, but Ernst\u2019s view would seem to fall far beyond the mainstream.\n\nWe would have liked to ask Ernst about these and many other positions. It\u2019s possible that the Republican\u2019s views have been misunderstood. But we weren\u2019t given that chance.\n\nSo we\u2019re left to conclude that Ernst\u2019s views would make her a poor choice to carry on Iowa\u2019s pragmatic senatorial legacy.\n\nWe\u2019re far more familiar with Braley, who has represented much of Eastern Iowa in Congress since 2007. That\u2019s how we know, contrary to TV attack ads, that Braley\u2019s record on veterans\u2019 issues has been solid, regardless of which meetings he did nor did not attend. And we appreciate Braley\u2019s cautious approach to reintroducing ground troops to Iraq.\n\nThe congressman also has compiled a positive record on rural issues, from helping dairy farmers to sticking up for renewable fuels, despite his opponents\u2019 efforts to cast him as an urban elitist. He\u2019s called for a national manufacturing strategy, which strikes us as prudent here in a city where the continuing success of manufacturing and processing are vital.\n\nBraley was swift in his response to the 2008 flood, when his district included Waterloo-Cedar Falls but not the Cedar Rapids metro. Since Cedar Rapids became part of his district, Braley has pushed for federal recovery assistance, including funding for Cedar Rapids flood protection. He disagrees with Ernst\u2019s call for eliminating federal environmental oversight, pointing out that President Richard Nixon formed the EPA because states were doing little to protect the environment.\n\nOn immigration, Braley favors bipartisan legislation that passed the U.S. Senate, providing more resources to secure the nation\u2019s borders while also creating a long pathway to legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants living and working in the U.S. We\u2019ve supported that legislation, and reject attempts by Ernst and others to simply label it as \u201camnesty.\u201d We also agree with Braley that although the Affordable Care Act needs significant changes, its overall effort to provide health coverage to millions of Americans is worth continuing.\n\nBraley has demonstrated the ability to work across party lines and make the compromises necessary to govern the country, which is sorely needed in the Senate. He\u2019s experienced, and demonstrates a deep understanding of important issues beyond sound bites, attacks and talking points.\n\nWe see Braley as the best choice to carry on Iowa\u2019s bipartisan Senate tradition.\n\n\u2022 Comments: editorial@thegazette.com or (319) 398-8262.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | For nearly 30 years, Iowa has been represented in the U.S. Senate by Tom Harkin, a liberal Democrat, and Chuck Grassley, a conservative Republican.Looking in fr", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "For nearly 30 years, Iowa has been represented in the U.S. Senate by Tom Harkin, a liberal Democrat, and Chuck Grassley, a conservative Republican.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/opinion/staff-editorial/bruce-braley-is-best-choice-for-us-senate-20141019", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20141019/ARTICLE/141019634/AR/0/AR-141019634.jpg", "article": {"section": "Opinion"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/opinion/staff-editorial/bruce-braley-is-best-choice-for-us-senate-20141019", "description": "For nearly 30 years, Iowa has been represented in the U.S. Senate by Tom Harkin, a liberal Democrat, and Chuck Grassley, a conservative Republican.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Bruce Braley is best choice for U.S. Senate"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2014-10-17T17:02:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_opinion", "pubDate": "2014-10-19T00:25:00-05:00", "title": "Bruce Braley is best choice for U.S. Senate"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "We see Braley as the best choice to carry on Iowa\u2019s bipartisan Senate tradition.\nDebates have offered us too little insight into what Braley and Ernst hope to do if they win the Senate seat.\nBut Ernst\u2019s campaign failed to make time in her schedule.\nBraley has demonstrated the ability to work across party lines and make the compromises necessary to govern the country, which is sorely needed in the Senate.\nAnd Iowans of all political stripes have been well represented, regardless of which party controls the Senate."}
