House Administration Committee Chairwoman Candice Miller (R-Mich.) announced on Monday her committee's hiring of David Rivkin from the law firm BakerHostetler to represent the U.S. House of Representatives in its lawsuit against President Barack Obama.

The House passed a resolution on July 30 authorizing House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to sue Obama over what House Republicans contend is the president's inadequate enforcement of the Affordable Care Act.

"No president is above nor should operate beyond the limits of the Constitution," Miller said in the statement Monday.

"The president must be held accountable, and the House will continue to act in an open and transparent manner to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution," she added.

According the contract, the House will pay $500 per hour in legal fees, up to a maximum of $350,000.

Rivkin has previously represented GOP Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Kelly Ayotte (N.H.), and worked in both the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. He has also spoken out before on the prospects for such a lawsuit's success.

A CBS News poll released on Aug. 6 indicated that a majority of Americans do not agree with the House GOP lawsuit against Obama.
