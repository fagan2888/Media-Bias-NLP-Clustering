In a statement, his unit said they concerned \u201cthe FIFA issues.\u201d\n\nIn the DOJ indictment, senior South African bid officials and the government were accused of channeling $10 million through FIFA to some of its top executives as bribes for them backing the country\u2019s bid to host the 2010 World Cup, the first in Africa.\n\nOne of the FIFA officials, Chuck Blazer, admitted in court documents unsealed on Wednesday in the U.S. to receiving bribes around the vote that gave the World Cup to South Africa.\n\nSouth Africa won the 2004 vote 14-10 over Morocco, which was also accused of trying to bribe voters.\n\nThe South African government has denied involvement in any bribes, and said the $10 million was an \u201cabove-board payment\u201d given to former FIFA vice president Jack Warner to help soccer development in his Caribbean region.\n\nInstead, Warner and Blazer, both former FIFA executive committee members, shared the money, the DOJ says. Another FIFA official from South America is also implicated in bribes for voting for South Africa.\n\nWarner is one of 14 soccer and sports marketing officials indicted in the U.S. investigation, which appears to stem from Blazer\u2019s guilty plea in 2013 to racketeering and other charges.\n\nFormer South African president Thabo Mbeki also denied any knowledge of any bribes when he was in office during the bid process.\n\nAlberts said he also had information on other supposed improper payments connected to South Africa\u2019s World Cup bid \u201cabove and beyond\u201d the $10 million that went to Warner and Blazer.\n\nSo far there has been no contact between South Africa\u2019s crime unit, known as the Hawks, and the FBI, but Mulaudzi said South African investigators were willing to work with the Americans if required.\n\nNo specific officials were yet being investigated, Mulaudzi added, denying reports that current South African soccer head and 2010 World Cup organizer Danny Jordaan was implicated in the bribery allegations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "South African authorities have opened a \"preliminary\" investigation into World Cup bribery allegations, and an opposition lawmaker said Thursday he had information suggesting \"high-level\" involvement.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "South African authorities have opened a \u201cpreliminary\u201d investigation into World Cup bribery allegations, and an opposition lawmaker said Thursday he had information suggesting \u201chigh-level\u201d involvement.", "title": "South African police investigating World Cup bribes", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/4/south-african-police-investigating-world-cup-bribe/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/03/9e5d5637cbd65718780f6a706700979e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/03/9e5d5637cbd65718780f6a706700979e.jpg", "description": "South African authorities have opened a \"preliminary\" investigation into World Cup bribery allegations, and an opposition lawmaker said Thursday he had information suggesting \"high-level\" involvement.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "South African police investigating World Cup bribes"}, "Author": "Gerald Imray", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, South Africa, World Cup, Anton Alberts, Hangwani Mulaudzi"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92fc\"", "article_summary": "PHOTOS: South African police investigating World Cup bribesDocuments were being handed over to the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation unit and needed to be investigated fully, Alberts said.\nCAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 South African authorities have opened a \u201cpreliminary\u201d investigation into World Cup bribery allegations, and an opposition lawmaker said Thursday he had information suggesting \u201chigh-level\u201d involvement.\nNo specific officials were yet being investigated, Mulaudzi added, denying reports that current South African soccer head and 2010 World Cup organizer Danny Jordaan was implicated in the bribery allegations.\nFormer South African president Thabo Mbeki also denied any knowledge of any bribes when he was in office during the bid process.\nAlberts said he also had information on other supposed improper payments connected to South Africa\u2019s World Cup bid \u201cabove and beyond\u201d the $10 million that went to Warner and Blazer."}
