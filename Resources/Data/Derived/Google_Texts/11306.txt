Spring will be nipped in the bud on Sunday, weather forecasters predict, with rain and snow mixing below 6,000 feet early in the morning but turning into heavy snow in the Denver area in the late afternoon and evening.

After a high Saturday of 72 degrees, meteorologists advised switching out garden spades for snow shovels for a wet, cold Sunday.

The Boulder-based National Weather Service predicted snow totals of 4 to 7 inches through Sunday night around the Denver metro area.

Anyone who got fertilizer onto their grass was ahead of the game, with a half inch to 1 inch of water expected from the storm.

Forecasters warned residents to clear off any snow-laden branches in danger of breaking.

A winter storm warning was in effect by Saturday afternoon for the foothills and mountains, which could get upward of a foot of snow. Travel from ski areas will be affected.

“It’s been warm, so, with snow falling during the day Sunday, a lot of it could melt below 6,000 feet,” NWS meteorologist Bob Kleyla said Saturday afternoon. “But April is, on average, our second-snowiest month.”

Since record-keeping began in 1881, of the 24 greatest one-day snowfalls to hit the Denver area, one-fourth of them came in April — and most of those late in the month. On April 23, 1985, the area received 23 inches.

On average, the metro area receives 9 inches of snow in April. As of early Saturday, snowfall for the month stood at 3.4 inches.

Overnight Sunday through Monday morning, temperatures are expected to hit lows in the high teens to mid-20s throughout the metro area, so there is potential for frozen flora, Kleyla said.

The record low temperature recorded for April 13 was 17, set in 1933. It is expected Denver could get close to that overnight Sunday.

Monday morning’s commute will be a messy one, with a chance of lingering snow showers and, at best, wet and slushy roads, but a warming trend begins with forecast highs in the mid-40s.
