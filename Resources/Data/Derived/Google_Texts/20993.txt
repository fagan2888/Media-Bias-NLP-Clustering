The Navajo Nation said Monday morning it will not reopen the San Juan River for agricultural use even after the Environmental Protection Agency announced last week water quality rebounded from the major mine wastewater spill upstream.

The tribe says it is waiting on testing from its internal environmental agency before reopening the river.

“I’m glad the (EPA) water samples indicate the water is safe for irrigation use, but I remain concerned over the soil and sediment that lines our (river’s) bank,” said tribe President Russell Begaye in a statement. “Every time a heavy storm hits or the soil is disturbed it can recontaminate the water.”

The tribe, in a news release, said the majority of chapters impacted by the closure voted last week against reopening the San Juan out of fears its waters might contaminate their crops.

The EPA said Wednesday the river’s levels had returned to what they were before the agency spilled 3 million gallons of mine contaminants Aug. 5 upstream in Colorado.

Navajo officials have chastised the EPA since the spill and tribal leaders say the aftermath of the release left their people on the brink of economic disaster since use of the San Juan for agricultural purposes was banned.

Many Navajo farmers said their crops died in the disaster’s wake.

The contamination left the Navajo, already mistrustful of the federal government, angry at the EPA and seeking damages. The tribe’s leaders have vowed to file suit against the agency.

While the river remains closed, the Navajo Nation says it will continue to work with the Bureau of Indian Affairs to provide water to residents for irrigation, livestock and drinking purposes.
