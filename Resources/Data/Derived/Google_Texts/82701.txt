LAS VEGAS (AP) — Taylor Swift’s headlining set at Rock In Rio USA featured her anthemic pop hits, screaming fans and bright lights beaming from the stage. It also played like a fashion show.

Swift changed multiple times Friday night at the festival in Las Vegas. She wore a shimmery, silver jacket, cropped top and skirt when she sang “Welcome to New York,” working the stage with light dance moves aside her male background dancers.

“Good evening, Las Vegas,” she said. “We begin our story in New York.”

Swift sported a little black dress — and a golf club — when singing “Blank Space” as the crowd sang along, and she wore a bikini and short shorts when performing “Trouble” in front of her shirtless male dancers.

She changed multiple times throughout her two-hour set, including a pink cropped top and knee-length skirt that lit up during her performance of “How You Get the Girl.” Her outfits matched her new sound and style since going full-blown pop with the album “1989.”

Videos featuring her famous friends — Lena Dunham, Selena Gomez and others — played in between songs while Swift changed outfits. They talked about being friends and spending time with the multiplatinum singer.

The pop star mainly performed songs from her new album, including the hits “Shake It Off” and “Style.” She played the guitar and was joined by Ed Sheeran for a duet; she told the crowd the singers were celebrating their third “friendaversary.”

Swift also performed from part of the stage that rose in the air when she sang “Love Story” and “Clean.”
