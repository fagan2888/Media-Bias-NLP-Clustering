Dan Atkins cutting into a thick stack of pancakes or digging into a plate of eggs. But this Saturday\u2019s menu is a bit spartan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably just have coffee and a piece of toast,\u201d said Atkins, the pastor of Holy Family Catholic Church in New Albany, Indiana.\n\nThe Catholic priest isn\u2019t on a diet. Rather, he\u2019s one of many believers across the country - and throughout the world - heeding the call of Pope Francis to fast and pray for peace in Syria on Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to be in solidarity with people who are suffering terribly from war,\u201d said Atkins, a native of southern Indiana. \u201cI\u2019m going to be thinking about the children, the kids, affected by this terrible conflict.\u201d\n\nHoly Family is opening its doors Saturday afternoon and inviting parishioners to pray and reflect before the Blessed Sacrament, also known as the Eucharist, asking Jesus to bestow a blessing on the world. A special Mass for peace and and justice will follow.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be inviting people to stop and think: Is the world more peaceful this world because of something I did, or not?,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of bringing the pope\u2019s message home.\u201d\n\nPope Francis has proclaimed September 7 a churchwide day of prayer and fasting for peace in Syria. It was the first such proclamation since 2003, when Pope John Paul II called for fasting and prayer before the Iraq War, according to CNN Vatican analyst John Allen.\n\n\u201cHumanity needs to see these gestures of peace and to hear words of hope and peace!,\u201d Francis said. He called on the world\u2019s 1.5 billion Catholics, other Christians, people of different faiths and \u201call men of good will\u201d to join him in prayers and fasting. Many are.\n\nThe Vatican expects to host huge crowds at its prayer vigil in St. Peter\u2019s Square in Rome on Saturday evening.\n\nIn a poignant conjunction, U.S. President Barack Obama on Friday declared September 6-8 to be National Days of Prayer and Remembrance of the 9/11 attacks.\n\nObama encouraged Americans to remember the victims and their families through prayer, contemplation, vigils and other ceremonies.\n\nThe Catholic day of prayer and fasting is the spiritual component of a wider push by Francis and other religious leaders to persuade the United States not to use military force in Syria, even as they acknowledge the severity of suffering there.\n\nIn a letter to G20 leaders on Thursday, the pope decried the \u201csenseless massacre\u201d in Syria but said a military solution would be \u201cfutile.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Pope to G-20: Keep your armies out of Syria\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops echoed the pope, calling on Congress to consider this moral calculus: \u201cWill more or less lives and livelihoods be destroyed by military intervention?\u201d\n\nAccording to the United Nations, more than 100,000 people have already died in Syria's bloody civil war, which has drawn fighters from Iran, Iraq and Lebanon.\n\nIn a letter sent to Congress on Friday, a coalition of Muslim, Christian and Jewish leaders organized by the Washington-based Friends Committee on National Legislation urged legislators not to approve the use of military force in Syria.\n\n\"Rather than yielding to the temptation to fuel the fire with more violence,\" the letter says, \"we see an opportunity for the U.S. to leverage the full weight of its diplomatic influence and resources to advance a just, negotiated settlement.\"\n\nSister Patricia Chappell, president of the Catholic peace group Pax Christi USA, signed that letter and said she's combining protests with prayers on Saturday.\n\nShe\u2019s fasting most of the day and joining a vigil at noon outside the White House with Catholic groups and other activists.\n\nBut if she wants to transform others, she must first be transformed herself, Chappell said, a process aided by fasting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically a way of cleansing myself and trying to be open to what God is directing me to say and do,\u201d Chappell said.\n\nIn addition to the political advocacy, Catholic parishes from Alaska to Washington are holding prayer services and fasting on Saturday.\n\nAccording to Catholic teaching, people who are fasting are allowed one full meal and two smaller meals. Ash Wednesday and Good Friday are obligatory fast days for Catholics ages 18 to 59, but the church occasionally asks members to fast on other momentous days as well.\n\nREAD MORE: Syria explained: How it became a religious war\n\nCatholics aren\u2019t the only believers praying and fasting for Syrian peace this Saturday.\n\nBishop Michael Vono of the Episcopal Diocese of the Rio Grande asked congregations in Texas and New Mexico to set Saturday and Sunday aside as days of \u201cprayer, action and contemplation.\u201d\n\nThe pope\u2019s call to prayer and fasting is \u201ctoo serious to ignore,\u201d said Enuma Okoro, an author who has written several books about prayer. While granting the frailty of human faculties, human prayer has a quiet power, she said.\n\n\u201cSuch things have been known to topple kingdoms, to bring down walls, to free those held captive, to heal and comfort, and to do what appears impossible for our limited imaginations,\u201d Okoro said.\n\nEven when prayer doesn\u2019t move mountains (or mortar shells), it can still be worthwhile, said other Christians participating in Saturday\u2019s spiritual campaign.\n\nRachel Held Evans, a popular Christian author and blogger, said she\u2019s weighed the theological and political options, wept over images of disfigured Syrian children, sent money to help refugees and listened to the counsel of wise people.\n\nAnd still, she said, she feels helpless. \u201cIt\u2019s just so big, so complicated, so out of my control.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a \u201cstrange power\u201d in acknowledging helplessness before the divine and holding on to hope that God will answer, Evans said.\n\n\"In a world where opinions get whittled down to 140 characters and allegiances are declared on Facebook walls and 30-second TV spots, focused and deliberate prayer says: I don\u2019t know. This is bigger than me. Help us, God.\u201d\n\nLike Evans, the Rev. James Martin said he has watched the news coming out of Syria with \u201cgrowing alarm and sorrow.\u201d\n\nThe Gospels say that when Jesus saw suffering, his \u201cheart went out to them.\u201d But that\u2019s a weak translation of the Greek, said Martin, a Jesuit priest and prolific author. What the Bible really means is that it was gut-wrenching for Jesus to see people in pain. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel when I look upon Syria,\u201d Martin said.\n\nHow do fasting and prayer help?\n\nAbstaining from food forms a physical connection between the person fasting and people half a world away whose stomachs growl because they can\u2019t find a safe place to eat, said Martin. Fasting puts our bodies in need, just as others do involuntarily.\n\nAs for prayer, Jesus famously said, \u201cAsk and you shall receive.\u201d Martin said he\u2019s taking him up on that offer and asking for peace in Syria.\n\n\u201cHow will God answer? I don\u2019t know: I\u2019m not God,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t need to understand God; I only need to be in relationship with God. I believe God hears us, so I pray.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Syria's rebels: 20 things you need to know", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke,\u00a0CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor (CNN)\u00a0-- After morning Mass on most Saturdays, you\u2019d find the Rev.
