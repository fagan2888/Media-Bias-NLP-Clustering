Ted Cruz made a bit of a foul play during a campaign stop in the famed \u201cHoosiers\u201d basketball gym.\n\n\u201cThe amazing thing is, that basketball ring in Indiana, it\u2019s the same height as it is in New York City and every other place in this country,\u201d he said, referencing the famous movie.\n\nTypically, fans call the \u201cbasketball ring\u201d a \u201choop.\u201d\n\nBut the 900 supporters in the Knightstown Hoosier Gym Tuesday night remained enthusiastic as the rally went on.\n\n\u201cI think [Cruz] has more backing in rural areas than he does in metropolitan areas,\u201d Frank Craig of Knightstown said. \u201cBecause of this, I think he will make a great president.\u201d\n\nWhile most presidential candidates have been targeting large cities like Indianapolis and Bloomington, almost all of Cruz\u2019s stops have been in smaller cities, including Tuesday night\u2019s stop in Knightstown, a town with less than 2,500 residents.\n\n\u201cIf Cruz goes to the smaller cities, it is showing that he doesn\u2019t just care for certain parts of the state, he cares for the whole state in general \u2013 which is very important,\u201d said Chase Stevens of Knightstown.\n\nCruz said he expected GOP frontrunner Donald Trump to have a good night in the five states with primaries on Tuesday. But Cruz ensured Hoosiers the campaign will move to more favorable terrain \u2013 Indiana.\n\nTypically, a candidate has secured enough delegates to receive the nomination by this point in the election cycle. That means as a state with a late primary, Indiana\u2019s delegates are not as important. This year, however, none of the Republican candidates have the majority of delegates needed, so Indiana is now in the spotlight. Cruz has high hopes for a win in the Hoosier state.\n\n\u201cTogether the people of Indiana are going to send a powerful message to the Washington establishment,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThey are not going to decide the Republican nominee\u2014it is going to be we the people.\u201d\n\nThe similarities between Hillary Clinton and Trump were the main focus of Cruz\u2019s speech, as he thinks Trump is truly a Democrat. Cruz explained 13 policies where he believes Clinton and Trump see eye to eye.\n\nThe economic status of America was at the top of Cruz\u2019s list. According to Cruz, Clinton and Trump are in favor of raising taxes, but he said he would cut taxes.\n\n\u201cIf I am president, we are going to cut taxes,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cMy number one priority is bringing back jobs and economic growth.\u201d\n\nCruz plans to fight every piece of Obamacare. He said he will stop amnesty and secure borders in sanctuary cities, as well as investigate Planned Parenthood. Cruz also expressed deep concern regarding foreign policy.\n\n\u201cWe will stand with Israel,\u201d Cruz said as the crowd went wild. \u201cAnd as president, I will rip to shreds the nuclear Iranian deal.\u201d\n\nMarc Jacobs of Springfield, Illinois supports Cruz because of his ability to bring people together.\n\n\u201cThe next president should be elected on his ability to bring people together to weed out and compost hatred into something more constructive,\u201d Jacobs said.\n\nToward the end of the rally, a protestor started yelling at Cruz. Cruz said he believed the protestor was a Trump supporter.\n\n\u201cTrump does not understand the first amendment gives everyone the right to speak, but it does not give people the right to disrupt,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nHe politely asked rally attendees to keep their hands off the protestor as law enforcement quickly escorted him out. But the protestor did not slow Cruz down.\n\n\u201cThis election is about jobs, it is about freedom, it is about security,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThank you and God bless you!\u201d\n\nCruz then left the stage and met with his supporters.\n\nAdrianna Pitrelli is a reporter for TheStatehouseFile.com, a news website powered by Franklin College journalism students.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 Republican presidential candidate Sen.
