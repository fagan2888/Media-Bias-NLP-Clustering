Saying she\u2019ll be running as an independent, Mrs. Schwartz has become a member of the D.C. gang that doesn\u2019t shoot straight.\n\nAnd what voters should most look forward to is how the former at-large D.C. Council member positions herself against a wild card \u2014 veteran at-large lawmaker David A. Catania, another independent \u2014 and ward boss Muriel Bowser, Ward 4 Democrat.\n\nMr. Catania is gay, Ms. Bowser is black, and neither is married, so a victory for either in November would be historic.\n\nMrs. Schwartz, meanwhile, is as familiar a commodity as they come in D.C. politics.\n\nVoters and other stakeholders know where she stands because her actions always spoke more loudly and clearly than the Democrats\u2019 usual doublespeak.\n\nIn her lengthy statement announcing her candidacy for mayor, Mrs. Schwartz pointed out that during her long run on the council, she:\n\n\u2022 helped to lower the income taxes;\n\n\u2022 stood up for medical marijuana;\n\n\u2022 created the Department of the Environment and rebooted recycling programs;\n\n\u2022 made D.C. the second jurisdiction to require hands-free devices while driving;\n\n\u2022 created tax-free holidays for back-to-school and Christmas holiday purchases;\n\n\u2022 prohibited the harassment of students based on sexual orientation;\n\n\u2022 pushed for the separation of emergency medical and fire services;\n\n\u2022 toughened drunk-driving laws;\n\n\u2022 voted for baseball;\n\n\u2022 provided safeguards for victims of domestic violence.\n\nOf course, her list doesn\u2019t end there, and that\u2019s the caveat.\n\nSince Mrs. Schwartz left office in 2009, tens of thousands of new residents and voters have come to call D.C. home, and most of them could easily say, \u201cCarol, we hardly know of you.\u201d\n\nThese newbies are young, money-making progressives and independents, the very stakeholders Mr. Catania, a former Republican, can count on to back him all the way to victory.\n\nInterestingly, neither Mr. Catania nor Mrs. Schwartz could have ever been labeled conservative, or right wing, while in office.\n\nIndeed, they both are politically predisposed to allergic reactions to social conservatism.\n\nIt\u2019s the primary reason they easily fit in in Washington, and why Ms. Bowser has a tough road ahead.\n\nMs. Bowser is definitely holding the next generation, Democratic baton, as Kwame Brown, Michael Brown and Harry Thomas Jr. did.\n\nMrs. Schwartz could upset the mayor\u2019s race if she taps into the pertinent demographics and shoots from the hip.\n\nFive years is a long time in politics, and some folks are still wondering if she still has Texas swag.\n\n\u2022 Deborah Simmons can be reached at dsimmons@washingtontimes.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here comes Carol Schwartz.
