And the artist now is getting his due.\n\nThe Halsey Institute of Contemporary Art has organized an exhibition of Holley\u2019s work called \u201cSomething to Take My Place,\u201d which opens with a free public reception at 6:30-8 p.m. Friday, and runs through Oct. 10. The solo show features 40 works on loan from the artist, collector William Arnett and the Atlanta-based Souls Grown Deep Foundation.\n\nHolley crafts sculptures using found objects, both natural and man-made. These \u201cassemblages\u201d typically refer to specific experiences and rely on coded language common among self-taught African-American artists and musicians, according to William Arnett\u2019s son, Matt Arnett, who is Holley\u2019s chaperone, fan, business partner, advocate and music promoter.\n\nThe artist, now 65, also has become a unique presence on the stage, performing jazz-like songs the lyrics of which Holley makes up on the spot while tapping a small keyboard. His musical approach is so particular and fascinating it has inspired many fine musicians to collaborate with Holley: Bradford Cox and Josh McKay of the band Deerhunter, for example; Richard Swift of The Shins and Black Keys; Kelly Pratt of Beirut, Arcade Fire and the Antlers; Dave Hartley of War on Drugs; Bill Callahan, Jon Batiste and many others.\n\nFor those who want a taste of Holley\u2019s idiosyncratic musical style, he will perform at 8 p.m. Sept. 12 at the Charleston Music Hall.\n\nMore is planned, including visits to K-12 schools and college classrooms by Holley, an appearance at the Charleston Farmers Market 9 a.m.-noon Sept. 12 and a gallery walk-through with scholars and catalogue essayists at 2 p.m. that day.\n\nThe broken mule\n\nHolley\u2019s devotion to art as a primary means of expression began when the children of his sister were burned to death in a house fire. Holley carved two tombstones, the tears dripping from his face onto the surface of the rock, sanctifying the material, transforming it from an object into a story.\n\nThis is how Holley\u2019s art works. It tells stories of his incredible life.\n\nHe was born on Feb. 10, 1950, the seventh child of a mother who would go on to have 20 more. He was adopted (though not in the traditional sense) by a burlesque dancer who worked for a traveling fair. Holley grew from a baby to a boy, malnourished, filthy, witness to life\u2019s depravities.\n\nAdopted again by another woman, he ate a bit better, but endured drunken attacks, including a strike to the head with an iron poker by a man who wanted to eat the food from Holley\u2019s plate.\n\nAt 6 years old, he got a job picking up trash at the fairgrounds, a place that \u201cenlarged my mentality, expanded my thought capability,\u201d Holley told Ted Rosengarten, a local historian and writer. \u201cI was curious \u2014 I was so curious about natural things.\u201d He preferred digging in ditches to school. He liked to contemplate the weather.\n\nAt 7, his adoptive mother died, and her husband blamed the boy, beating him, cursing him, forcing him to cut wood. A terrible car accident nearly killed him, but he recovered after three-and-a-half months, surprising the doctors. Soon, Holley could no longer endure his circumstances and he ran away. When he was caught, he was beaten, then he would run away again.\n\nHe made it to New Orleans and learned a few things, before the authorities shipped him back to Birmingham. But he ran away again, with the energy of the civil rights movement buzzing through the South, and soon landed in a juvenile residency, \u201ca victim of surprise circumstance,\u201d picked up for vagrancy during a curfew.\n\nHolley was forced to pick cotton, harvest watermelon and suffer more abuse. Once, he escaped, running and running all day and into the dark, until he fell into an open grave and, exhausted, fell fast asleep.\n\nBut he was caught again, returned to the detention center, beaten mercilessly. Holley would remember these episodes all his life, transforming them into works of art. \u201cBlood on the Rock Pile.\u201d \u201cMemory Paper.\u201d \u201cLeaving You Alone.\u201d \u201cI Can\u2019t Eat Locks.\u201d \u201cMule Trying to Feed Himself.\u201d\n\nHolley was the mule. The broken mule.\n\nAt around 14 (he can\u2019t be sure), he was reunited with his mother, and a new phase of his life began, with new experiences, traumas and challenges. His art tells this story, and more. It tells the story of the African-American experience. It tells of hardship and endurance and the narratives spun by unsettled minds.\n\n\u201cSome of the greatest performers in America is us, the African American,\u201d Holley told Rosengarten. \u201cBecause Negroes of America watched, we observed, and we became America. We are truly Americans.\u201d\n\nRosengarten traveled with Holley to Alabama late last year where the artist wanted to trace his roots and the historian wanted to revisit the terrain of Ned Cobb, the tenant farmer he wrote about in his 1975 National Book Award-winning \u201cAll God\u2019s Dangers: The Life of Nate Shaw.\u201d The trip was sponsored by the Halsey and part of an effort to create an essay-laden catalogue to accompany the show.\n\n\u201cLonnie Holley as a little boy was discarded, and he has made a life of trying to retrieve all discarded things,\u201d Rosengarten said. \u201cHe\u2019s, in a sense, given new life, but even more than that, new meaning, to trash.\u201d\n\nHolley\u2019s modus operandi is to retrieve, reimagine and reuse. \u201cHe goes a little bit further than the rest of us, and that\u2019s part of what makes him an artist.\u201d\n\nHolley never knew he was an artist until others pointed it out to him. Today, he knows enough about the art world and its marketing biases and priorities to reject such labels as \u201cvernacular artist,\u201d \u201cnaive artist\u201d and \u201cfolk artist,\u201d preferring instead, simply, \u201cartist,\u201d Rosengarten said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m considered an outsider artist,\u201d Holley recently told Mark Sloan, director of the Halsey. \u201cOutside of what?\u201d\n\nPatronage\n\nHolley\u2019s most important patron is Bill Arnett, an art scholar and promoter who has devoted himself to discovering and protecting obscure African-American artists in the South. In 2010, Arnett started the Souls Grow Deep Foundation, which is dedicated to documenting, researching, preserving and exhibiting the work of self-taught black artists.\n\nHis approach is to provide certain artists with a monthly stipend and other financial assistance in exchange for the right of first refusal for works of art for sale.\n\nBill Arnett has \u201ccorrected\u201d the value of this obscure art, according to Sloan. Self-taught black artists once collected far too little money for their work, if they sold it at all, Sloan said. Arnett pays them thousands of dollars per piece, effectively resetting market values and creating demand for work that often went unnoticed, Sloan said.\n\n\u201cWhat Lonnie\u2019s work was about just struck a chord with my dad,\u201d Matt Arnett said. \u201cHe realized that all of these other artists were part of a bigger system.\u201d\n\nAll were operating outside of the commercial art market. All were documenting their history and unleashing the ingrained creativity of people accustomed to poverty and hardship.\n\nThey worked on their own, never expecting recognition, not to mention fame, Arnett said. Indeed, it was as if the work was designed to evade public admiration; it was not meant to look anything like \u201cregular\u201d art, Arnett said. It dared to express a cultural experience and a version of history that most whites in the art world preferred not to confront, he said.\n\n\u201cSo it had to be disguised, it had to take on forms that weren\u2019t readily recognizable to people who would see it,\u201d Arnett said. \u201cThis kind of work began almost certainly in the cemeteries, because the cemeteries were more or less the one place where blacks were left on their own.\u201d\n\nArt then migrated from the cemeteries to backyards. Only with the onset of the civil rights movement, when blacks felt empowered by the forces of change, did this art find its way to the front yards and, eventually, into the sights of outside admirers, Arnett said.\n\nThe work of self-taught black artists partly was a result of the clash between rural and urban sensibilities, he said. Many blacks moved from small country towns and farms to bigger cities where work in textile factories and other industries was available. As a result, black artists gained access to a variety of new materials they used in their creations.\n\n\u201cWhen my dad met Lonnie is when he realized that the study and documentation of all of this would become his life\u2019s work,\u201d Arnett said.\n\nOn the verge\n\nFor Sloan, this show is as meaningful as any he\u2019s curated, he said. It features a relatively obscure artist of enormous talent with a hard-to-believe biography, and it gives the Halsey Institute a chance to raise his profile. The show, therefore, fits precisely the Halsey\u2019s basic mission, he said.\n\nA few of his pieces will be installed in the Addlestone Library rotunda during the course of the Halsey exhibit, Sloan said. A documentary film has been produced, shot by John David Reynolds.\n\nSloan thinks Holley is on the verge of a greater success. Several important collections already possess some of his assemblage pieces, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.\n\nAnd he won a prestigious Robert Rauschenberg Residency in 2014.\n\nThe artist finally is enjoying the fruits of his labor.\n\n\u201cWe have gone out of the way to give Lonnie Holley his voice,\u201d Sloan said.\n\nReach Adam Parker at 937-5902.
