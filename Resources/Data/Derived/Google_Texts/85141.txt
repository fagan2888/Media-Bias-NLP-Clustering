As we approach World AIDS Day on December 1, we are making important progress in our national and global responses to HIV/AIDS.

In recognition of these efforts, we invite you to watch a live webcast of the White House World AIDS Day event. The event will focus on this year’s Federal theme, The Time to Act is Now.

Watch the event live by visiting www.whitehouse.gov/live on Tuesday, December 1, from 1:00 p.m. – 3:15 p.m (ET).

There is no need to preregister–and you can also join the conversation on Twitter with the hashtag #WAD2015.

The event will highlight President Obama’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals and the recent release of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy: Updated to 2020, which are significant markers on our collective journey toward an AIDS-free generation.
