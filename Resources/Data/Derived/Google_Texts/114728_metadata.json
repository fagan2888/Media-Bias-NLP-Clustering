Eighty percent of users who get news on Twitter said that they do so by scrolling through their timelines. Sixty-seven percent said they browsed tweets of people they followed for news.\n\nOnly 34 percent said they followed the news by checking Twitter\u2019s trending topics. Fifteen percent said that they followed the news using the \u201cDiscover\u201d tab \u2014 a feature that was recently eliminated but existed when the survey was administered.\n\nTwitter is looking to do more curation during news events, in part to grow the service beyond its relatively small base of active users. The company is preparing to launch a service where human editors select tweets during live events and bundle them together on a page for users.\n\nThe hope is that such efforts will expand the appeal of the service to more of the general public. Currently, the service has 316 million monthly active users, compared to Facebook\u2019s 1.49 billion monthly active users.\n\nThe survey had a sample of 3,713 Twitter users and 1,000 general social media users. It was conducted online between Nov. 23 and Dec. 15, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Seventy-four percent of those users get news from the social media platform daily.", "description": "Seventy-four percent of those users get news from the social media platform daily.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "David McCabe", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Seventy-four percent of those users get news from the social media platform daily.", "title": "Nearly 9 in 10 people on Twitter use it to get news", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/252521-survey-almost-90-percent-of-twitter-users-turn-to-platform-for-news", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/twitter_081115getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/252521-survey-almost-90-percent-of-twitter-users-turn-to-platform-for-news", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-02T10:51-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "David McCabe", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-02T10:51:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/252521-survey-almost-90-percent-of-twitter-users-turn-to-platform-for-news", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Seventy-four percent of those users get news from the social media platform daily.", "card": "summary", "title": "Nearly 9 in 10 people on Twitter use it to get news"}, "dcterms.title": "Nearly 9 in 10 people on Twitter use it to get news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeca5\"", "article_summary": "Almost 90 percent of Twitter users turn to the platform to learn about the news, according to a new study.\nThe survey had a sample of 3,713 Twitter users and 1,000 general social media users.\nCurrently, the service has 316 million monthly active users, compared to Facebook\u2019s 1.49 billion monthly active users.\nTwitter is looking to do more curation during news events, in part to grow the service beyond its relatively small base of active users.\nEighty percent of users who get news on Twitter said that they do so by scrolling through their timelines."}
