Halle Tecco, Founder and CEO of Rock Health, discusses emerging trends in health care in the wake of the Affordable Care Act.

Jackson Hewitt found that employers in Texas, one state not expanding Medicaid, could be on the hook for up to nearly $400 million in new taxes each year, beginning in 2015. Florida employers could pay as much as $253 million in new taxes, and North Carolina employers as much as $120 million.



The cumulative hit to employers in the 25 states could be between $1.03 billion and $1.55 billion, Jackson Hewitt found.

Diane Rowland, a Medicaid expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told CNBC.com, "All of us have said there's a cost to not expanding" Medicaid.

"This is the employer side being able to quantify the effect," Rowland said. "I think as some of these economic arguments come out, the harder it is for some of these political arguments in states where [Medicaid expansion] is still under consideration" to hold sway, she said.

The Affordable Care Act, as written, originally mandated that the government-run Medicaid health-care program for the poor be expanded nationally to include previously ineligible adults who earned less than 139 percent of the federally poverty line. Those who qualify are mostly low-income earners who aren't elderly or disabled. But the 2012 Supreme Court decision upholding Obamacare's legality said Medicaid eligibility expansion would be left up to individual states.

Twenty-five states are expanding Medicaid eligibility. There, the federal government will foot 100 percent of the increased costs of expansion until 2017, when its share of costs drops to 95 percent, and then to 90 percent from 2020 on.
