Martin does his writing on a processing system from the 1980s. Given the success of his novels, and wildly popular HBO show adaptation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hurt him.\n\nIt is, however, a fascinating thought. With cutting-edge technology rolling out by the minute, why revert to using WordStar 4.0 on a DOS word processor?\n\nLast night on \u201cConan\u201d Martin explained his word processing choices. \u201cI have a secret weapon,\u201d Martin says. \u201cI actually have two computers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a computer I browse the Internet with and I get my email on, and I do my taxes on,\u201d Martin continues. \u201cAnd then I have my writing computer, which is a DOS machine, not connected to the Internet.
