It took a couple of days, but Jon Stewart finally got around to addressing the truly enlightening interview that Fox aired between Bill O’Reilly and President Barack Obama before Super Bowl XLVIII—or, as Stewart called it, the interview between “the most powerful man in the free world” and Obama.

Lamenting the fact that O’Reilly chose to ignore issues like nuclear proliferation, Middle East peace talks, and the environment, Stewart points out that O’Reilly instead dipped “whole scale into the full Fox scandal grab-bag.” O’Reilly pressed the president on topics that Fox viewers genuinely care about, like Benghazi, IRS corruption, and the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act, because as Stewart says, “it’s a big show, it’s the Super Bowl pre-show, you got to play the hits.” Who cares if the matters O’Reilly brought up have been, according to Stewart, “thoroughly investigated on multiple occasions?” On the biggest stage of the year, Fox is going to stick with its specialty: wasting time on pseudo-scandals.

The highlight of the interview came when O’Reilly asked the president if he thought the interview was unfair, to which Obama responded, “absolutely.” Oh boy. In the words of Jon Stewart: “Pass the nachos, mama.”

“These kinds of things keep on surfacing in part because you and your TV station will promote them,” Obama told O’Reilly.

Stewart’s reaction to Obama's smack down of Fox News:

“Holy Moley. That is quite an accusation—that Fox News unfairly promotes, and in some cases creates scandals for the sole purpose of undermining this president. Although, in Obama’s defense, it is true. That is exactly what Fox does every day.”
