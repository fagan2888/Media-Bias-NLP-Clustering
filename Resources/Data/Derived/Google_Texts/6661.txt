Be on the lookout for contractors and roofers prowling tornado-ravaged Garland and Rowlett with deceptive marketing practices.

The Dallas Morning News Watchdog found two examples.

This flyer is deceptive because the blue lettering advertises that the Mississippi-based company will work with insurance companies on behalf of consumers. Only that’s illegal in Texas.

This sign by a Dallas construction company pretends that the company has a state “TRCC license.” Only problem is that license was killed by the Texas Legislature in 2010.

Do they think we won’t figure it out?

On New Year’s Day 2016, The Dallas Morning New Watchdog desk – Dave Lieber and Marina Trahan Martinez – officially kicked off their state campaign for a contractors/roofers license in the 2017 Legislature.

Citing the above examples, this kickoff column – “Let’s rein in dishonest contractors” – informs readers (we call them “citizens of Watchdog Nation”):

“My campaign for a contractors/roofers license begins today. As usual, I call on you for help.

“Tell me what you see out there. Collect fliers. Take pictures of signs. Send me your stories.

“I’ll collect it all, and when the Legislature convenes in a year, we’ll swoop in like those contractors and roofers. Only our information will be accurate.

“As for those who think they can come in and do as they please?

“The Watchdog will see you around town, fellas.”
