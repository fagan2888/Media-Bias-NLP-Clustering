(Photo: Courtesy of Duke Farms Foundation) Story Highlights There are two eggs in the eagles\u2019 nest at Duke Farms.\n\nNest is about 70 feet in a sycamore tree\n\nLocation of nest remains secret\n\nThe Eagle Cam has developed such a dedicated and loyal following that if the mother and father eagles are gone from the nest for a long period of time, Duke Farms starts receiving phone calls from people worried that something bad happened.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d said Nora Wagner, director of strategic planning and programs at Duke Farms. \u201cPeople ask if they\u2019re OK.\u201d\n\nPeople call when it\u2019s cold or it\u2019s snowing because they are worried about the eggs, she said.\n\nThose phone calls, she said, are evidence that Duke Farms is achieving its primary mission of connecting with the community on conservation issues and making people aware of the importance of protecting the environment.\n\nWatching the Eagle Cam has become an Internet addiction in the period from when the eagles start preparing the nest in late fall to when the eggs hatch in the first weeks of spring and eventually when the eaglets leave the nest. The Eagle Cam has registered more than 9.4 million views since it started in 2008.\n\nThe Eagle Cam focuses on a nest about 70 feet off the ground in a sycamore tree on the 2,740-acre former estate of the Duke family, which is now a regional center for environmental stewardship.\n\nThe first egg of 2015 was laid Feb. 16 and the second egg followed on the afternoon of Feb. 20. It will take about five weeks for the eggs to hatch.\n\nIn 2014, the first egg was laid Feb. 17 with the second on Feb. 20 The hatchings were on March 29 and April 1.\n\nMost of the time, the webcam captures nothing more exciting than an adult eagle protecting the eggs and keeping them warm. When the eggs hatch, the nest becomes busy with activity.\n\nBut occasionally there is drama. In a harrowing scene captured by the webcam on March 24, 2013, a red-tailed hawk swooped down on the nest but was killed by one of the adult eagles, who then fed the hawk\u2019s remains to a chick. The webcam captured every second of the life-and-death drama.\n\nVisitors to Duke Farms should not expect to see the eagles. The location of the nest is kept confidential, and the eagles keep private, Wagner said.\n\nEven Wagner, who has worked on the estate for 10 years, said she has seen the eagles \u201conly a handful of times\u201d when they\u2019ve been fishing for food in one of the property\u2019s bountiful lakes.\n\nNew this year is a weekly blog, https://dukefarms.wordpress.com/, on the Duke Farms website by naturalist Jim Wright.\n\nAlso new this year is a collaboration between Duke Farms and the Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey to encourage teachers to write lesson plans incorporating the Eagle Cam. The teacher who submits the best plan, Wagner said, will have the \u201conce-in-a-lifetime opportunity\u201d to join biologists and Duke Farms staffers in the banding of the eaglets sometime in May.\n\nAn eagles\u2019 nest first was discovered at Duke Farms in 2004. But in 2012, Sandy\u2019s 90-mph winds tore the top off the nest tree, destroying the nest. But like many New Jersey families whose homes were destroyed in the storm, the eagles returned to Duke Farms, and two months after the storm built a new nest in the sycamore, about 100 feet from the first nest. The camera was moved to the new nest tree in fall 2013.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come so far,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1G9hSM5", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Eagle Cam has registered more than 9.4 million visits since it started in 2008", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "The Eagle Cam has registered more than 9.4 million visits since it started in 2008", "title": "Eagle Cam watches over two eggs in nest at Duke Farms", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/2015/03/06/eagle-cam-watches-two-eggs-nest-duke-farms/24543089/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Eagle Cam has registered more than 9.4 million visits since it started in 2008", "title": "Eagle Cam watches over two eggs in nest at Duke Farms", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8600e4c5e8c4ebc841a6d9bd541929c784b66246/c=88-0-552-464&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2015/03/06/B9316514471Z.1_20150306224455_000_GS5A488TV.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Courtesy of Duke Farms Foundation) Story Highlights There are two eggs in the eagles\u2019 nest at Duke Farms.\nThe Eagle Cam has registered more than 9.4 million visits since it started in 2008Mom incubating two eggs on Feb. 22.\nAn eagles\u2019 nest first was discovered at Duke Farms in 2004.\nNew this year is a weekly blog, https://dukefarms.wordpress.com/, on the Duke Farms website by naturalist Jim Wright.\nThe Eagle Cam has registered more than 9.4 million views since it started in 2008."}
