As many as 9 mil\u00adlion people could lose their cov\u00ader\u00adage if the justices side with the plaintiffs, un\u00addo\u00ading much of what the law has achieved.\n\nBut while no law passed by Con\u00adgress is per\u00adfect, the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act was par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly flawed by its un\u00adusu\u00adal jour\u00adney through the Cap\u00adit\u00adol, as even its sup\u00adport\u00aders have ac\u00adknow\u00adledged time and again. Those im\u00adper\u00adfec\u00adtions have giv\u00aden the law\u2019s op\u00adpon\u00adents re\u00adpeated op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adit\u00adies to ask the courts to un\u00adder\u00adcut it.\n\nThe latest chal\u00adlengers seize on just a few words\u2014\u201des\u00adtab\u00adlished by the State\u201d\u2014and they would be un\u00adlikely to have a case had Demo\u00adcrats made even a minor tweak.\n\nSo how did the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act be\u00adcome law with a flaw that could sink its fu\u00adture but seems so easy to fix? The an\u00adswer comes from the com\u00adplic\u00adated pro\u00adcess Re\u00adid used to res\u00adcue the health care bill when it was on the brink of fail\u00adure.\n\n(RE\u00adLATED: Obama\u00adcare Prom\u00adises Tax-Sea\u00adson Sur\u00adprises)\n\nWhile his nemes\u00adis, then-Minor\u00adity Lead\u00ader Mitch Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell, united the GOP against the bill, Re\u00adid had to mol\u00adli\u00adfy a caucus that ranged from so\u00adcial\u00adist Bernie Sanders, agit\u00adat\u00ading for a pub\u00adlic op\u00adtion, to con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive Ben Nel\u00adson, who needed a $100 mil\u00adlion Medi\u00adcaid kick\u00adback (which was later re\u00admoved) and oth\u00ader con\u00adces\u00adsions to sup\u00adport it.\n\nNev\u00ader\u00adthe\u00adless, Re\u00adid pro\u00adduced a bill and cor\u00adralled his con\u00adfer\u00adence around it, and the Sen\u00adate cleared its ini\u00adtial health care re\u00adform le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion in the days be\u00adfore Christ\u00admas 2009. At the time, fi\u00adnal pas\u00adsage looked prom\u00adising: Demo\u00adcrats had the House, the White House, and with 60 sen\u00adat\u00adors and a united caucus\u2014the votes they needed to to over\u00adcome a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan fili\u00adbuster in the Sen\u00adate.\n\nThen, in Janu\u00adary of 2010, Scott Brown threw everything in\u00adto chaos. Sen. Ed\u00adward Kennedy, the long\u00adtime Mas\u00adsachu\u00adsetts Demo\u00adcrat and lib\u00ader\u00adal health care stal\u00adwart, had died in Au\u00adgust, but Demo\u00adcrats be\u00adlieved they were near-cer\u00adtain to keep his seat and their 60-vote ma\u00adjor\u00adity. But the up\u00adstart Brown bested Mas\u00adsachu\u00adsetts At\u00adtor\u00adney Gen\u00ader\u00adal Martha Coakley in the Janu\u00adary 2010 spe\u00adcial elec\u00adtion, break\u00ading Re\u00adid\u2019s 60-seat-strong fire\u00adwall against a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan fili\u00adbuster.\n\nSome in the party wavered: then-White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel re\u00adportedly urged Obama to scale back his am\u00adbi\u00adtions. Rep. Barney Frank of Mas\u00adsachu\u00adsetts pub\u00adlicly doubted that com\u00adpre\u00adhens\u00adive health care re\u00adform could still be achieved. But Re\u00adid and House Speak\u00ader Nancy Pelosi de\u00advised a plan to fin\u00adish the job: The com\u00adplic\u00adated pro\u00adcess known as budget re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation, which re\u00adquires only 50 votes to pass in the Sen\u00adate but lim\u00adits how the le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion be amended.\n\n(RE\u00adLATED: The Eight Cra\u00adzi\u00adest Stor\u00adies About Harry Re\u00adid)\n\nIt took two bills, shuttled back and forth between the cham\u00adbers in the last half of March, and Re\u00adid\u2019s thinned ma\u00adjor\u00adity with\u00adstand\u00ading 30-plus amend\u00adments from Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans. On March 30, 2010, Obama signed the Health Care and Edu\u00adca\u00adtion Re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation Act of 2010, which put the fin\u00adish\u00ading touches on the ACA and turned it in\u00adto law.\n\n\u201cI think it was the ex\u00adample, the prime ex\u00adample, of sev\u00ader\u00adal things about Re\u00adid that many of the ste\u00adreo\u00adtypes miss,\u201d Orn\u00adstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just his mas\u00adtery of the pro\u00adcess. It\u2019s also that, this pub\u00adlic im\u00adage of Re\u00adid as this bom\u00adbast\u00adic guy who of\u00adten ex\u00adhib\u00adits thug\u00adgish be\u00adha\u00advi\u00ador, masked that trust, and the af\u00adfec\u00adtion, vir\u00adtu\u00adally all the mem\u00adbers of his con\u00adfer\u00adence have for him.\u201d\n\nDemo\u00adcrats cel\u00adeb\u00adrated, but with the vic\u00adtory came a caveat. Amend\u00ading the le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion that passed be\u00adfore Brown\u2019s vic\u00adtory, and then re\u00adcon\u00adcil\u00ading it with the House\u2019s bill, was dif\u00adfi\u00adcult un\u00adder the con\u00advo\u00adluted pro\u00adced\u00adure that Re\u00adid and Pelosi took. There was nev\u00ader a con\u00adfer\u00adence com\u00admit\u00adtee, and so there was nev\u00ader a chance to make the type of minor fixes and tech\u00adnic\u00adal cor\u00adrec\u00adtions that most le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion re\u00adceives in the fi\u00adnal stretch.\n\n\u201cWe meant to clean it up in con\u00adfer\u00adence, but we nev\u00ader got to con\u00adfer\u00adence,\u201d one staffer said in early 2014. \u201cIt\u2019s def\u00adin\u00aditely in\u00adart\u00adfully draf\u00adted.\u201d\n\n(RE\u00adLATED: 5 Years In, 5 Bus\u00adted Pre\u00addic\u00adtions About Obama\u00adcare)\n\nAnd the lack of one of those minor fixes has opened a win\u00addow for a con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive leg\u00adal chal\u00adlenge that strikes at the heart of the law. In King v. Bur\u00adwell, the plaintiffs ar\u00adgue that the let\u00adter of the law doesn\u2019t al\u00adlow Obama\u00adcare\u2019s cru\u00adcial tax cred\u00adits on Health\u00adCare.gov, which 30-plus states and mil\u00adlions of ACA en\u00adrollees use.\n\nDemo\u00adcrats al\u00adlege that the clause cent\u00adral to the plaintiffs\u2019 case is simply poorly worded and that the rest of the law makes their in\u00adten\u00adtion to al\u00adlow the cred\u00adits every\u00adwhere clear. But one lower court has already ruled against them, and des\u00adpite their cer\u00adtainty, the Su\u00adpreme Court\u2019s mar\u00adgin looks likely to be 5-4, one way or the oth\u00ader.\n\nThe leg\u00adal struggle is an\u00adoth\u00ader in a con\u00adstant string of re\u00admind\u00aders of how con\u00adten\u00adtious Demo\u00adcrats\u2019 health care ef\u00adfort has been since the day they put it for\u00adward\u2014as well as a re\u00admind\u00ader of the high wire Re\u00adid walked to move it through the Sen\u00adate.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a man who loves work\u00ading hard, but when it came to that bill, he gave it everything he\u2019s got,\u201d Man\u00adley said. \u201cThe thing died any num\u00adber of times, but he nev\u00ader wavered in his de\u00adsire to get it done.\u201d\n\nStill, time\u2014and nine Su\u00adpreme Court justices\u2014will tell wheth\u00ader that achieve\u00adment stands, or wheth\u00ader the forces that al\u00admost blocked it in the Sen\u00adate will even\u00adtu\u00adally find a way to take it down.
