Main St. in Leesburg, closed its doors on Jan. 31 because of distance problems from the rest of the company\u2019s operations.\n\nAccording to Ann Albright, the owner of Swan Creek Candle, the Leesburg store was just too far away from the company\u2019s 30,000 square-foot factory in northwest Ohio. The company has three other outlet stores each in Ohio and Michigan.\n\n\u201c(It) took a lot of resources to manage the store and also to get product there,\u201d she said of the Leesburg outlet.\n\nThe local store had two full-time and two part-time employees. Albright said health insurance costs under the Affordable Health Care Act played a role in the store\u2019s closing, but wouldn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nBusiness in Leesburg was trending in the right direction and the community was supportive, but Albright said she had to close the outlet.\n\n\u201cThis was a tough decision,\u201d she said.\n\nThe company came to Leesburg to test its model since the area had a significant Midwest population, Albright said. She added the company only puts stores in historic main street areas.\n\nJoyce Huey, the president of the Downtown Leesburg Business Association and the owner of the Two Old Hags Wine Shoppe, said it was unfortunate the downtown area lost Swan Creek, but its location has already been sold and a new business was looking to come in there.\n\n\u201cBecause they did so much work on the building itself, and made it so nice, that I think people are ready to take right over and come on down,\u201d she said.\n\nSwan Creek opened here in the fall of 2010. The company itself has been in business since 1978.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Commercial", "description": "The only Swan Creek Candle store in Florida, at 707 W.
