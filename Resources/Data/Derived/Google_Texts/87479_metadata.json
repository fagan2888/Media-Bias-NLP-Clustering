A knock that means the city has exhausted its efforts to negotiate with Rodriguez and her family and is moving to condemn their house to make way for a $200-million high-end mall.\n\nRodriguez, along with her neighbors on First Avenue, is fighting the city of West Haven to keep her home. But still, every day, she waits.\n\nIn 2005, a pregnant Rodriguez; her husband, Fernando; and their young son decided to leave New York for West Haven in search of more room for their growing family. The young mother had previously visited relatives who lived in the area, and the Connecticut town appealed to the family as a good place to raise their children.\n\nThey fell in love with a house on the east side of First Avenue, and for the last 10 years, it\u2019s what the Rodriguez family have called home.\n\n\u201cMoving is hard for people,\u201d Rodriguez said in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cIt\u2019s very stressful, and to find another place to live and call your home\u2014your home is memories. We\u2019ve endured so many things in this house. Bad things have happened to us, but this is our house.\u201d\n\nIn January, Rodriguez learned that the city and two developers were interested in her property, along with other homes and businesses along First Avenue, after a surveyor knocked on Rodriguez\u2019s door and asked to take measurements of her property.\n\nThe city, Rodriguez later found out, was working with a developer to build a $200-million, 425,000-square-foot waterfront project called The Haven, a high-end mall that includes 100 outlet stores and six restaurants.\n\nAnd Rodriguez\u2019s property sits in the southern corner of the proposed project.\n\nFor months, Rodriguez never heard anything from the city regarding what land would be redeveloped for The Haven. Then, in May, a realtor knocked on her door and told Rodriguez the home was included in the redevelopment plan.\n\n\u201cI told the realtor the house wasn\u2019t for sale,\u201d Rodriguez recalled.\n\nOne month later, the West Haven City Council approved a plan giving the city and its development authority, the West Haven Development Authority, the ability to exercise its eminent domain powers and condemn Rodriguez and her neighbors\u2019 properties to build The Haven.\n\n\u201cWe pay taxes. This is our home,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201c[Developers] don\u2019t even know West Haven. They just look at the map and say we\u2019re going to make a mall. They don\u2019t even look at the people in the middle.\u201d\n\n50 Miles Down the Road\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Takings Clause, the government can exercise its eminent domain power to take property from private residents if it satisfies two conditions: it\u2019s for public use, and just compensation is provided.\n\nHowever, over the last few decades, the definition of public use has broadened from what was traditionally thought of as the transfer of property for a school, bridge, or road to the transfer of property from one private party to another.\n\nThat change occurred in 2005, after Susette Kelo, a mother of five boys, led a years-long battle against the city of New London, Conn., in an effort to save her little pink house.\n\nOfficials in New London, located just 50 miles east of West Haven, exercised their eminent domain power to condemn Kelo\u2019s home, along with property belonging to six other families, to make way for a hotel, restaurants, shops, and a renovated marina.\n\nThe redevelopment was intended to complement an adjacent Pfizer facility, but after the pharmaceutical giant left New London, the city\u2019s redevelopment plans never panned out. Kelo\u2019s pink house, which became a symbol of the fight, and her neighbors\u2019 homes were demolished, but today, all that sits on the property is an empty field overgrown with weeds.\n\nKelo\u2019s case against New London went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in 2005 that the city was well within its rights under the Takings Clause to seize property under eminent domain for the purpose of transferring it to another private entity.\n\nThe ruling became one of the most despised in the high court\u2019s history, and it sparked backlash from the public and state legislatures. After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision was handed down in 2005, more than 40 states passed laws limiting the use of eminent domain for transfers of property from one private party to another. In 11 of those states, legislatures passed constitutional amendments.\n\nConnecticut was not one of those states.\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Signal, Brooke Fallon, activism manager for the Institute for Justice, pointed to the Kelo case as an example of how redevelopment plans can fall through. The Institute for Justice represented Kelo.\n\n\u201cIn this situation, we have a town that\u2019s 50 miles down the road from Kelo,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s an example down the street of how using eminent domain for private use can fall apart. All they have to do is see what\u2019s going on there and that it\u2019s a risky move for them. They should allow the property owners to stay.\u201d\n\nA \u2018Last Resort\u2019\n\nNext door to Rodriguez\u2019s home sits property owned by Bob McGinnity, who has lived in West Haven for nearly 50 years.\n\nA lifelong Connecticut resident and retired railroad conductor, McGinnity thought his family \u201cupgraded\u201d when they moved from nearby New Haven to West Haven when he was just a little kid.\n\nToday, McGinnity\u2019s sister still resides in the town.\n\nLike Rodriguez, McGinnity didn\u2019t know his home on First Avenue was going to be included in the redevelopment plan for The Haven, and like Rodriguez, he doesn\u2019t plan to move.\n\n\u201cThey say they\u2019ll use eminent domain as a last resort,\u201d he said in an interview with The Daily Signal. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that means. That means nothing. I don\u2019t care if you say the very last resort; you\u2019re taking my home.\u201d\n\nThe developers, two \u201ccowboys from Texas,\u201d McGinnity said, have offered what he calls \u201cfear-market value\u201d for his home. However, he has no plans to accept the developers\u2019 offers.\n\n\u201cWhat they want to give me compared to what they\u2019re going to make from my property is quite wide of a difference,\u201d he said, \u201cand I also believe if you\u2019re taking my house, you can\u2019t tell me how much you want to give me.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re Going to Fight\u2019\n\nIn the two months since the West Haven City Council approved the use of eminent domain for the properties where The Haven will be built, Rodriguez has received several offers from the developer to purchase her home.\n\nHowever, after paying off the current mortgage on her First Avenue home, Rodriguez said she wouldn\u2019t have enough money to make a down payment on a new home.\n\n\u201cTo buy another house wouldn\u2019t be like buying your first house,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder to get another mortgage and good interest rate. We don\u2019t want to start from the bottom again. It\u2019s not being greedy. I have two kids. We\u2019ve been here for almost 10 years.\u201d\n\nRodriguez last heard from the developer on August 29, when the realtor working with the developers left her a voicemail saying they wanted to work with the family and help them get to \u201cyes.\u201d Rodriguez never called the realtor back.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the end of the conversation,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the city, of the 56 parcels located on the land for The Haven, 48 are currently under contract.\n\nIn an email to The Daily Signal, Joe Riccio, the commissioner of Planning and Development for West Haven, said the city will negotiate with property owners if the developer\u2019s negotiations fail.\n\n\u201cThe city hopes that the Haven will provide much needed tax revenues and jobs for its citizens,\u201d he said in the email. \u201cOf equal importance is what The Haven will mean to the city of West Haven. This will be the largest investment in the city of West Haven in its history.\n\n\u201cIt will make West Haven a destination, stimulate other development (it already has), and it will buoy the spirit of its citizens.\u201d\n\nWhile Rodriguez doesn\u2019t blame the city for wanting good things for West Haven, she doesn\u2019t see why the city has to take her home to accomplish its goals of bringing more revenue and jobs to the city. And she plans on fighting to keep her home.\n\n\u201c[My youngest son] said, \u2018Mommy, why are you letting these people take our home?\u2019 I said it\u2019s not up to me. It\u2019s up to the people who have the power and the money,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI want him to see me fighting. I will fight to the end.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a statement of fact for Rodriguez, one McGinnity echoed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every day, Janet Rodriguez sits at her home in West Haven, Conn., and she waits", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Every day, Janet Rodriguez sits at her home in West Haven, Conn., and she waits", "title": "CT Homeowners Fight to Stop City From Taking Their Homes", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150915_WestHavenFEAT_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-16T10:51:19+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Y9JjQG"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Every day, Janet Rodriguez sits at her home in West Haven, Conn., and she waits", "title": "CT Homeowners Fight to Stop City From Taking Their Homes", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150915_WestHavenFEAT_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "property rights", "published_time": "2015-09-16T03:01:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-16T10:51:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "West Haven, The Haven, Brooke Fallon, Institute for Justice, eminent domain, Public Use Clause, New London, Susette Kelo, Pfizer"}, "article_summary": "Rodriguez, along with her neighbors on First Avenue, is fighting the city of West Haven to keep her home.\n\u201cThey say they\u2019ll use eminent domain as a last resort,\u201d he said in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\u201cOf equal importance is what The Haven will mean to the city of West Haven.\nThis will be the largest investment in the city of West Haven in its history.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an example down the street of how using eminent domain for private use can fall apart."}
