They landed on the beach at Normandy in France. They were the first American unit to roll into Paris. And they met the Russian army as World War II ended in Germany.

The story of the 102nd Cavalry is being told with a new exhibit opening Friday at the New Jersey National Guard and Militia Museum, marking the 70th anniversary of D-Day.

"Seventy Years On: New Jersey's 102nd Cavalry in World War II," covers the chronology of New Jersey Guard soldiers in Europe from the landings in France to the liberation of Europe in 1945. The exhibit uses images, artifacts, historic weapons, uniforms and primary source documents to tell how 102nd, popularly known before the war as the Essex Troop for its roots in northern New Jersey, played an important role in overcoming German defenses in northern France. The unit went on to fight in the Battle of the Bulge and other major engagements, and notably was the first U.S. unit to officially enter Paris.

"Soldiers of today's New Jersey Army National Guard can trace our lineage back to the units who fought their way across Europe," said Capt. Vincent Solomeno, museum curator and command historian. "The troopers of the 102nd Cavalry battled from D-Day to the German surrender. The intent of our exhibit is to present their heroic story and honor the sacrifices of those who served."

The exhibit runs through October at the museum, located at the Sea Girt National Guard camp. It's open seven days a week from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. with free admission. For information, visit the museum website at www.state.nj.us/ military/museum or call 732-974-5966.
