Take, for example, ice cream. The current serving size is a half-cup. But who eats that little?\n\nUnder the proposed new label, the serving size would become 1 cup. So, when you scoop a bowl of mint chocolate chip, the calorie count that you see on the label will probably be much closer to what you\u2019re actually eating.\n\nAnother example: A 20-ounce bottle of soda would be labeled as one serving. And with that, the calorie count at the top would come closer to reality.\n\nAnother significant change: The new panel will include a separate line for added sugars.\n\nThis is aimed at helping consumers distinguish between the sugars that are naturally found in foods (such as the sugar in raisins found in cereal) from the refined sugars that food manufacturers add to their products.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hoping for years that the FDA would list added sugars,\u201d Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University, tells us. \u201cI definitely think it\u2019s helpful.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve reported, there\u2019s a solid body of evidence linking excessive sugar consumption to an increased risk of heart disease and other ailments.\n\nAnd the intent here, senior administration officials say, is to help cue Americans to consume less of it. Despite industry opposition to the listing of added sugars, officials say they\u2019re confident the science is strong enough to justify adding it to the label.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration Thursday released its proposed tweaks to the iconic black and white panel that we're all accustomed to seeing on food packages.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"New Food Labels to Focus on Calories, Sugar\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/02\\/27\\/fda-proposes-food-label-overhaul\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-27 10:58:46\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-11-11 12:02:22\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":17912,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Nutrition\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/02\\/8407037563_11bbebbee2_b-e1393528757666.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The Obama administration Thursday released its proposed tweaks to the iconic black and white panel that we're all accustomed to seeing on food packages.", "title": "New Food Labels to Focus on Calories, Sugar", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/02/27/fda-proposes-food-label-overhaul/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-27-at-10.55.04-AM-640x553.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "nutrition,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "New Food Labels to Focus on Calories, SugarBy Allison Aubrey, NPRReady for a reality check about how many calories you\u2019re eating or drinking?\nDespite industry opposition to the listing of added sugars, officials say they\u2019re confident the science is strong enough to justify adding it to the label.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hoping for years that the FDA would list added sugars,\u201d Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University, tells us.\nAnother significant change: The new panel will include a separate line for added sugars.\nThe proposed new nutrition facts panel may help."}
