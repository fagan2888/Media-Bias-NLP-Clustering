We also know the government thinks it needs to protect us. But news of the last few weeks \u2014 Amazon(s amzn) and IBM(s ibm) planning to open up cloud services in China, for example \u2014 seems to indicate that things are moving along.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmazon Web Services CTO Werner Vogels recently told Om that international expansion is hot, hot, hot for the company which, including its new China operation, fields full regions out of Tokyo, Singapore, Sydney, Dublin, and Sao Paulo in addition to its North America regions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe theory is that just as countries without good fixed-line telephony were able to soar past that problem with the mobile phone revolution, the advent of cloud services and cheap endpoints will help these countries progress fast.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe cloud is eliminating the need for IT infrastructure and as a result we are starting to see cloud just catch up internationally, and how businesses are changing as a result,\u201d Vogels said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s not too difficult to conclude that China is just the beginning of planned new AWS regions around the world I\u2019ve bet in the past that, given data sovereignty concerns spiked by NSA gate, Amazon will set up a slew of localized GovCloud type regions where it can guarantee that data that\u2019s mandated to stay in country will, in fact, stay in country. The new Beijing-based AWS region sounds a lot like that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, China has some huge companies forging into cloud as well. China Telcom, China Unicom, Alibaba\u2019s Alyun division \u2014 will all compete with AWS both inside China and beyond.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpen Data and what it can do for you\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJonathan Reichental, the CIO of the city of Palo Alto, talked to us about the government\u2019s Open Data push and why it could be a very big deal for citizens.
