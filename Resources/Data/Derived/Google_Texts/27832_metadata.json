Mark Kirk.\n\nIran\u2019s defense budget ranges anywhere between $14 billion to $30 billion a year and much of that money goes to fund terrorist groups and rebel fighters throughout the region, according to the Congressional Research Service report conducted at the request of Mr. Kirk, an Illinois Republican.\n\nThe report, first viewed by The Washington Free Beacon, discloses that funding for these terrorist groups could be much higher than originally estimated, as Iran often hides public records about its defense spending.\n\n\u201cSome regional experts claim that Iran\u2019s defense budget excludes much of its spending on intelligence activities and support of foreign non-state actors,\u201d the report states, stressing that actual military spending could far exceed the $30 billion that Iran discloses annually, The Free Beacon reported.\n\n\u201cSimilarly, another study claims that actual funding for the [Iranian Revolutionary Guard Force\u2019s Al Quds Force] is \u2018much greater\u2019 \u201d than the amount allocated in the state budget, as the group\u2019s funds are supplemented by its own economic activities,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report gives \u201clow-ball\u201d estimates for each of the groups supported by Iranian funding. Researchers estimate Iran spends between $100 million and $200 million per year on Hezbollah, $3.5 billion to $15 billion per year in support of Syria\u2019s Asad Regime, $12 million to $26 million per year on Shiite militias in Syria and Iraq, $10 million to $20 million per year to support Houthi rebels in Yemen and tens of millions per year to support Hamas terrorists in Israel.\n\nIn Syria, for example, Iranian-backed fighters are paid between $500 to $1,000 a month to fight in support of Bashar Assad\u2019s regime, according to the report.\n\nAfghan fighters in Syria have disclosed that they \u201chad recently returned from training in Iran and planned to fight in Syria,\u201d the report notes. These militants \u201cexpected to receive salaries from Iran ranging from $500 to $1000 a month.\u201d\n\nThe report comes as the Obama administration gained the final critical vote needed to suppress a resolution to disapprove a nuclear deal with Iran. Under the deal, the U.S. and other world powers will gradually lift economic sanctions on the Islamic Republic in exchange for dismantling its nuclear weapons program.\n\nSimilar reports from watchdog groups have revealed that releasing Iranian assets sanctions could allow Tehran to spend more money on its terrorist-link Quds force, as well as beef up its own military in general.\n\n\u201cThe administration is celebrating support from a partisan minority of senators for a nuclear deal that threatens the security of the United States and our allies,\u201d Mr. Kirk said, The Free Beacon reported. \u201cThis deeply flawed agreement will transfer over $100 billion to a regime that U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper calls the \u2018foremost state sponsor of terrorism,\u2019 and pave Iran\u2019s path to nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cLike North Korea before it, Iran will cheat on this flawed deal in order to get nuclear weapons. Congress must hold accountable the Iranian regime and ensure that our children never wake up to a nuclear-armed Iran in the Middle East.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iran has been sending billions of dollars to fill the pockets of terrorist fighters across the Middle East, including in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, according to a private U.S. government report ordered by Sen.
