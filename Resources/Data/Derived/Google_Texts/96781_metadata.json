The restaurant will close Tuesday, ending a 4\u00bd-year run at the James Island location.\n\nOwner Ellis Grossman said the restaurant is the top performer of the three he owns and operates, but because of changes in federal health care insurance laws and overtime regulations, he said it\u2019s not financially viable to keep all of them open.\n\nHe said \u201cit makes more sense\u201d to focus on his King Street shop in downtown Charleston because he recently acquired a beer and wine license for the location. He employs 20 people at the James Island restaurant. The other restaurant is in Columbia.\n\nGrossman will sublease the Folly Road space to a new sandwich shop called The Hen and The Goat, which will be operated by Thomas Smith within 90 days, he said.\n\nRecord run\n\nAfter 45 years, an Upper King Street business has called it quits.\n\nHonest John\u2019s TV Repair and Record Shop at 509 King closed last Thursday.\n\n\u201cBusiness wasn\u2019t like it used to be,\u201d said shop owner James Peterson. \u201cOn a 100 percent scale, we have only been doing about 30 percent of what the store used to do. It has been declining for about 30 years.\u201d\n\nNow 68, Peterson said it\u2019s time to relax.\n\nThe shop repaired all types of televisions and sold all kinds of music. The store\u2019s stock was donated to Habitat for Humanity.\n\nPeterson, a former police officer for several years, is now a volunteer chaplain with the Coastal Crisis Chaplaincy. He lives on Johns Island.\n\n\u201cI believe in giving back,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cCharleston has been so good to us.\u201d\n\nSpringing to life\n\nA new coffee shop is headed to midtown Charleston.\n\nBearded Cafe & Coffee has leased a 275-square-foot space at 121 Spring St., according to real estate agency Coldwell Banker Commercial Atlantic. A January opening is planned, but it could open earlier if build-out and permitting happen more quickly. The owner/operators of the new to-go cafe are Rick Wofford, Rick Summers and Scott Morouse.\n\nOn the way\n\nDairy Queen is headed to Goose Creek.\n\nThe former Tenichi Steak House at 203-A N. Goose Creek Blvd. recently sold for $575,000 to WD LLC, which plans to do business as Dairy Queen, according to the commercial real estate firm Lee & Associates. CresCom Bank sold the 2,605-square-foot, free-standing restaurant.\n\nAlso, Walterboro is getting a new IHOP. The new restaurant will be built in front of the Wal-Mart Supercenter at 2110 Bells Highway, Lee & Associates said.\n\nCircling back\n\nStarting in January, all Kangaroo Express stores throughout the Southeast will be rebranded Circle K.\n\nKangaroo Express started in 1967 as The Pantry in North Carolina and now boasts more than 1,500 Kangaroo Express stores in 13 states. In March, The Pantry was acquired by Canada-based Couche-Tard, which lists Circle K as its largest and more international brand.\n\nThe rebranding will be completed within six to nine months.\n\nPet project opens\n\nThe new Petco at 1101 N. Main St. in Summerville will have a ribbon-cutting ceremony at 8:55 a.m. Saturday. The pet superstore in the new Earth Fare-anchored Summerville Marketplace Shopping Center opened earlier this week.\n\nThe first 100 Pals Rewards customers Saturday will receive a free $10 gift card. The first 50 Pals Rewards customers Sunday will get a free tote bag. The shop will offer pet adoptions as well.\n\nDifferent field\n\nGolden Sun Taxi, the solar-powered golf-cart taxi business on Folly Beach started by three College of Charleston graduates, has shut down after just over a year in business, according to Matt Coda, one of the co-owners.\n\n\u201cUber was the catalyst,\u201d Coda said, referring to the new ride-offering service via an app that is competing with traditional taxi businesses across the country.\n\nTwo of the original Golden Sun operators \u2014 Coda and Jake Coutreau \u2014 have now turned to a drone aerial video photography business called Vive Media.
