A Florida insurance agent will spend 21 months in federal prison for defrauding professional NFL and NBA athletes.

Keven D. Webster, 44, an insurance agent in Pensacola, Fla., was sentenced after earlier pleading guilty to 11 counts of felony wire fraud. In addition to jail time, Webster must also make $144,229.07 in restitution.

The crimes took place between 2008 and 2012. Webster is licensed as an insurance agent in several states.

According to officials, Webster knowingly defrauded NFL and NBA player clients by falsely representing that he had used the clients’ money to obtain umbrella insurance policies, with coverage amounts ranging from $5 million to $1 million, from United States Liability Insurance Group.

Instead, there were no policies and Webster stole approximately $140,000 in client payments meant for policy premiums.

The case involved the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the the FBI and the Florida Department of Financial Services.
