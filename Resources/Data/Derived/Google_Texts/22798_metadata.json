She estimated that the tax would bring in at least $1.2 million in its first year.\n\nThe penny-per-ounce tax, the first of its kind in the nation, took effect March 1. It is levied on the distribution of most sugar-sweetened beverages, including sodas and energy drinks.\n\nCity Councilman Laurie Capitelli said the funds will be used for programs aimed at reducing obesity, poor dental health and diabetes among children.\n\n\u201cWhat we really want to do in 10 years is collect no tax,\u201d Capitelli said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want soda consumed in this community. We don\u2019t want 50 percent of our African-American and Latino children facing diabetes in our lifetime.\u201d\n\nThe Berkeley City Council has already approved advance funding of $500,000, and wants half of that to go to the school district\u2019s nutrition education program. Tuesday night is the first meeting of an expert panel \u2014 the Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Product Panel of Experts \u2014 that will advise the City Council on which specific health programs to fund or establish.\n\nPanel member Joy Moore, a cooking and gardening instructor at Berkeley Technical Academy, said the rest of the allocated money will be directed to community-based groups and programs, with an emphasis on programs that serve low-income children and people of color.\n\n\u201cThe place we can make the most difference is in the schools,\u201d Moore said. \u201cEducation is going to be important to everyone because we need all people to implement, to buy into, to understand the dangers that overconsumption of sweetened beverages will do.\u201d\n\nThe nine-member panel plans to consult with the community and will make recommendations to the City Council by Oct. 1. Local organizations will be able to apply for community-based funds.\n\n\u201cWe are tired of burying our family members,\u201d said Xavier Morales, executive director of the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California, and another member of the expert panel. \u201cWe have a diabetes crisis in Berkeley.\u201d\n\nHe said that having dedicated revenue to fund programs to help people with diabetes or families at high risk \u201cwill really help us in Berkeley.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Beverage Association spokesman Roger Salazar, who was standing only a few feet from the jubilant press conference, called the tax measure \u201cvery confusing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard from a lot of grocers, retailers, restaurateurs who want to comply with the measure but can\u2019t get real clarity of what it applies to and who it applies to,\u201d Salazar said.\n\nDuring the month of March, 36 entities, mostly larger distributors, paid the tax. Maio said the city is doing person-to-person outreach to inform smaller merchants about how the tax might affect them. Measure D stipulated that the tax take effect on Jan. 1 \u2014 but to give time to businesses to adjust, the council delayed the start date until March 1.\n\n\u201cWe want to do a truly good job of implementing this, because we know we are being watched very carefully,\u201d Maio said, \u201cand that particularly the (soda) industry is watching very carefully. \u2026 We want it to work well.\u201d\n\nMaio also praised Dairy Queen\u2019s recent decision to remove soda from its children\u2019s menus \u2014 following the lead of Burger King, McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, Chipotle and Panera.\n\n\u201cWe think we are at the beginning of a continuum that has to move forward for the health of our kids,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "City Council members say the money will fund programs related to childhood obesity and diabetes.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Berkeley Soda Tax Brings in $116,000 in First Month\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/05\\/19\\/berkeley-soda-tax-brings-in-116000-in-first-month\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-19 09:27:53\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-05-28 22:18:45\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":28347,\"author_id\":\"213\",\"author_name\":\"Andrew Stelzer\",\"author_display_name\":\"Andrew Stelzer\",\"tags\":[\"Soda Tax\",\"Sugar-Sweetend Beverage\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/05\\/RS15218_IMG_20150518_133659532-qut.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "City Council members say the money will fund programs related to childhood obesity and diabetes.", "title": "Berkeley Soda Tax Brings in $116,000 in First Month", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/05/19/berkeley-soda-tax-brings-in-116000-in-first-month/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/05/RS15218_IMG_20150518_133659532-qut-1440x811.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "soda tax,sugar-sweetend beverage", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcacf7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe have delivered for the city of Berkeley,\u201d said Berkeley City CouncilwomanLinda Maio, one of several council members who gathered on the steps of City Hall on Monday to announce the numbers.\nBerkeley\u2019s tax on sugary drinks brought in $116,000 in its first month, in line with projections made before voters overwhelmingly approved Measure D last November.\nMaio said the city is doing person-to-person outreach to inform smaller merchants about how the tax might affect them.\nShe estimated that the tax would bring in at least $1.2 million in its first year.\nThe penny-per-ounce tax, the first of its kind in the nation, took effect March 1."}
