Technology consultant Booz Allen Hamilton is following in the footsteps of UnitedHealth Group subsidiary QSSI, winning a $202.4 million contract to be the Affordable Care Act HealthCare.gov marketplace general contractor.

The five-year contract was awarded July 23 “after a competitive contracting process,” the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said.

UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Quality Software Services Inc. of Columbia, Md., which was put in charge of fixing the problem-plagued federal website in 2013, will remain for a three-month transition period from August through October, the CMS said.

HealthCare.gov is the primary vehicle for providing subsidies for most people buying health plans through the ACA, and it is used in most states. Federal and state marketplaces allow individuals and small businesses to shop for ACA qualified health plans.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) and Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) have raised questions about possible conflicts of interest between acting CMS administrator Andy Slavitt, who has been nominated by President Barack Obama to be CMS administrator, and Optum, another UnitedHealth subsidiary. Slavitt was chief executive officer of Optum, which contracted with QSSI to administer the roll out of HealthCare.gov.

Slavitt was one of the primary executives involved in fixing HealthCare.gov after its launch in October 2013. UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation’s largest health insurers, sells health insurance policies through the ACA marketplaces.
