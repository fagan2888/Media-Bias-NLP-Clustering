A Lakehurst man was sentenced Friday to five years in state prison for distributing child pornography over the Internet.

Michael R. Allen, 28, had been trading graphic images of sexual assaults on children, until his arrest at his Maple Street home just after sunrise on May 7, 2013, according to Al Della Fave, a spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office.

The search for evidence resulted in the recovery of 26 items of digital evidence, Allen's computer, multiple electronic storage devices and more than 5,000 images, according to Della Fave.

The case stems from an investigation which spanned two months during the spring of 2013. It began as a referral from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children to New Jersey's Crimes Against Children Task Force. The High Tech Crime Unit of the county Prosecutor's Office took control of the investigation and enlisted the help of the Lakehurst Police Department.

Allen was charged at the time with two counts of second degree distribution of child pornography. Ocean County Assistant Prosecutor Hillary Bryce prosecuted the case.

Allen pleaded guilty in September before state Superior Court Judge Francis R. Hodgson Jr.

Upon his release from prison, Allen will be required to register as a sex offender under Megan's Law, according to Della Fave.

The Ocean County Regional SWAT Team had assisted detectives with the execution of the search warrant two years ago.
