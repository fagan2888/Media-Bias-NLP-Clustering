The Obama administration's arrangement is intended to spare faith-based hospitals, colleges and charities from paying for contraceptives for women covered under their health plans, while still ensuring that those women can obtain birth control at no extra cost as required by the health-care law.

The Kaiser analysis found that for nonprofits with more than 1,000 employees, 10 percent reported that they had requested an "accommodation." Many of these organizations are likely faith-based health systems or educational institutions.

The data is based on employer responses in the Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Education Trust (Kaiser/HRET) 2015 Annual Employer Benefits Survey. Overall, 3 percent of nonprofits offering health benefits (with 10 or more workers) reported that they elected the accommodation.

As part of the ACA's preventive services coverage requirement, most employers that offer health insurance are required to include coverage for no-cost contraceptives for women. Houses of worship and other religious institutions whose primary purpose is to spread the faith are exempt from the requirement.

For other religious-affiliated nonprofit groups, the administration argues that the accommodation creates a generous moral and financial buffer between religious objectors and birth control funding. The nonprofit groups only have to attest that paying for any or all of the 20 devices and methods approved by government regulators would violate their religious beliefs.
