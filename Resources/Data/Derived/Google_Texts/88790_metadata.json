We stopped by Avera and Sanford Hospitals to meet the newest additions to the community.\n\nNew Year's Eve is traditionally a day for celebration. But it was especially exciting for a Southeast South Dakota family, who welcomed the last baby born at Avera Health in 2014.\n\n\"I figured there'd be more babies because I think there was some last night. I thought there was more going into labor after us, but I guess not,\" mother, Brittany Clark said.\n\n\n\nJohanna Jane Clark was born around 12:30 p.m. yesterday. She joins 3 other siblings, who all have an easy way to remember each other's birth years.\n\nBrittany: We have one in 2012, 13 and now 14.\n\nSammi: Did you plan that out? Or was that a pleasant surprise?\n\nBrittany: No. They're all surprises.\n\nWhile Johanna was the last baby born in 2014 for Avera, it was a little boy over at Sanford who was the first 2015 baby born in Sioux Falls.\n\nCorban Judson Selzler was born around 2:00 a.m. Unlike Johanna, Corban did not arrive when planned. He was already five days past due.\n\n\"I was more than ready. He was actually scheduled for an induction tomorrow morning. So apparently he didn't want to wait that long. He wanted to have a moment in the spot light apparently,\" mother, Kymberlee Selzler said.\n\nAnd even with the holiday births, both moms say they'll make sure birthdays are a special celebration.\n\n\"I had a few of my friends and family who wanted him to be born on Christmas, so I'm glad that that didn't happen. I think there's enough space that we can definitely make sure that his birthday is independent of Christmas,\" Selzler said.\n\nBoth moms say they are not going to try for another new year's baby any time soon.\n\nHealthBeat\n\nChildren's Health {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
