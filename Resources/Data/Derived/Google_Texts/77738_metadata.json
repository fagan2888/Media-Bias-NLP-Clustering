Millions of those getting insurance cancellation notices are finding out how fraudulent that promise was, too.\n\nMatthew Fleischer, a freelance writer in Los Angeles, recently learned ObamaCare will force him off a plan he likes, and a comparable policy will cost him nearly $800 more next year.\n\n\u201cMost young, middle-class Americans I know are happy that millions of previously uninsured people will receive free or heavily subsidized insurance under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he wrote in a Los Angeles Times op-ed. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t realize that, unless we had health insurance at work, we\u2019d be the ones paying for it.\u201d\n\nAdam Weldzius, a nurse practitioner in Illinois, came to the same realization after finding that his premiums will go up nearly $3,000 a year. \u201cI believe everybody should be able to have health insurance, but at the same time, I\u2019m being penalized. And for what?\u201d\n\nLori Gottlieb, an Atlantic contributing editor, learned her premiums could climb $5,400. Obama \u201cshould be protecting the middle class, not making our lives substantially harder,\u201d she wrote in the New York Times.\n\nObama dismisses such complaints as those of a small portion of the public \u2014 just 5%, he says \u2014 who are in any case getting \u201cbetter\u201d insurance because of ObamaCare.\n\nBut what\u2019s actually happening is that this relatively small group is being hit with a massive ObamaCare tax hike, which is being run through insurance premiums and which will reach into the thousands of dollars.\n\nIt\u2019s a tax hike these people had no reason to expect, since Obama not only promised that they could keep their plans, but that he\u2019d never raise their taxes.\n\n\u201cI can make a firm pledge,\u201d he said during his first presidential run, that \u201cunder my plan no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.\u201d\n\nAs with his phony \u201ckeep your plan\u201d promise, he made this one over and over again.\n\nLeft-wingers \u2014 at least those who aren\u2019t getting cancellation notices \u2014 don\u2019t see anything wrong with this.\n\n\u201cHow terribly smug,\u201d wrote Paul Waldman in the leftist American Prospect, \u201cto think that the fate of millions of poor people who will now get insurance is as important as the suffering of this one person who might have to pay more for comprehensive coverage.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s smug is for liberals like Waldman to think that Obama should get away with yet another bald-faced lie.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taxes: Once upon a time, President Obama promised he wouldn't raise taxes on the middle class.
