Biden Jr.\n\nBudget watchers of differing political stripes have recognized that if there\u2019s one idea from the President\u2019s budget that might have some bipartisan legs it\u2019s the proposed expansion of the earned income tax credit (EITC) for childless, adult workers.\n\nToday's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.\n\nThe EITC is a highly successful and politically popular antipoverty program that lifts the wages of low-income workers. In 2012, these extra earnings helped to lift 6.5 million people, including 3.3 million children, out of poverty. And research finds the program to be powerfully pro-work.\n\nBut the credit has a hole when it comes to childless adults. The average family with kids ends up with around $3,000 from the credit but for childless workers, the average credit amounts to less than $300. Yes, families with kids need more resources, but it\u2019s hard to argue the policy is \u201cmaking work pay\u201d for low-wage workers without kids.\n\nThe President\u2019s proposal would expand this part of the credit significantly, by both increasing the size of the subsidy and expanding the eligibility criteria to include more workers. The figure below shows just how much that expansion would mean for two types of workers.\n\nFor someone whose earnings put her at the poverty line\u2014around $12,500\u2014the credit would jump from about $170 to $840; a full-time minimum wage worker receives virtually no benefit from the current EITC, but under this proposal, her income would rise by $540.\n\nPhoto\n\nSo this is very big deal for a sizeable number of folks. The White House estimates that it will lift the earnings of 13.5 million low-wage workers.\n\nBut there\u2019s another motivation for this change that is little known.\n\nOur current federal tax system reduces the poverty rates of families with children, but raises poverty for those without. In 2012, federal taxes\u2014including credits like the EITC and the child tax credit\u2014helped to reduce poverty among non-elderly households with children by 3.7 percentage points. But for childless workers, that same system increases their poverty rate by 1.4 points.\n\nThe President\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t fully erase the tax burden for every one of these workers, but it significantly reduces it. And given the increases shown in the figure above, any childless worker with income well below the poverty line would find their federal tax liability fully offset by the proposal.\n\nI should also note that the proposal\u2019s $60 billion (over ten years) price tag is paid for by closing a couple of tax loopholes that benefit the wealthy, like the carried-interest loophole whereby the earnings of investment fund managers get favorable treatment in the code such that they end up paying a smaller share of their income in taxes than many middle-income workers.\n\nWhat with that whole (ridiculous) \u201cmakers and takers\u201d argument that came up in the last election, it might surprise you to find that, in fact, our tax system\u2014including both payroll taxes and income taxes\u2014actually does hit some very low-income workers. Here\u2019s a good way to do something useful about that while increasing the fairness of the tax code at both ends.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140306143004, "twitter": {"description": "Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to childless adult workers would help pull more people out of poverty and add tax fairness, an economist writes.", "title": "How to Raise Both Take-Home Pay and Tax Fairness", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/how-to-raise-both-take-home-pay-and-tax-fairness/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000002754262, "DISPLAYDATE": "March 6, 2014", "keywords": "Federal Budget (US),Income Tax,Poverty,Tax Credits Deductions and Exemptions,Today's Economist", "GBLC": "Today's Economist", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/How to Raise Both Take-Home Pay and Tax Fairness ( 20140306 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jared Bernstein", "SCG": "Economy", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "CLMST": "Jared Bernstein", "byl": "Jared Bernstein", "BN": "economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "description": "Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to childless adult workers would help pull more people out of poverty and add tax fairness, an economist writes.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 6, 2014", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Today's Economist", "published_time": 1394134204, "modified_time": "2014-03-06T19:30:04-05:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20140306193004, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140306, "pdate": 20140306, "des": "Federal Budget (US);Income Tax;Poverty;Tax Credits, Deductions and Exemptions", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to childless adult workers would help pull more people out of poverty and add tax fairness, an economist writes.", "title": "How to Raise Both Take-Home Pay and Tax Fairness", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/how-to-raise-both-take-home-pay-and-tax-fairness/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/how-to-raise-both-take-home-pay-and-tax-fairness/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "How to Raise Both Take-Home Pay and Tax Fairness", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3ee\"", "article_summary": "The President\u2019s proposal doesn\u2019t fully erase the tax burden for every one of these workers, but it significantly reduces it.\nHere\u2019s a good way to do something useful about that while increasing the fairness of the tax code at both ends.\nThe average family with kids ends up with around $3,000 from the credit but for childless workers, the average credit amounts to less than $300.\nOur current federal tax system reduces the poverty rates of families with children, but raises poverty for those without.\nBut for childless workers, that same system increases their poverty rate by 1.4 points."}
