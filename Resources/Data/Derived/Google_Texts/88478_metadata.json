Telegram was installed on 2.35 percent of android devices before the blackout and Facebook Messenger on 74 percent, SimilarWeb said.\n\nA judge in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo, had ordered the suspension of WhatsApp's services from midnight on Wednesday (0200 GMT Thursday). The order was made after the California-based company, despite a fine, failed to comply with two judicial rulings to share information in a criminal case.\n\n\"Considering the constitutional principles, it does not look reasonable that millions of users be affected as a result of the company's inertia to provide information,\" Judge Xavier de Souza from the 11th criminal court of Sao Paulo said in the ruling, recommending a higher fine be imposed on WhatsApp.\n\nThe incident highlighted growing international tensions between technology companies' privacy concerns and national authorities' efforts to use social media to recover information on possible criminal activities.\n\n\"Until today, Brazil has been an ally in creating an open Internet,\" Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg posted after the interruption of WhatsApp's services. \"I am stunned that our efforts to protect people\u2019s data would result in such an extreme decision by a single judge to punish every person in Brazil who uses WhatsApp.\"\n\nAccording to Band News TV, the criminal case involves a drug trafficker linked to one of Sao Paulo's most dangerous criminal gangs, the PCC, or First Command of the Capital. The trafficker allegedly used WhatsApp services while committing crimes, and the court wants access to his communications with others.\n\nWhatsApp said it was unable, not unwilling, to comply.\n\n\"We're disappointed that a judge would punish more than 100 million people across Brazil because we were unable to turn over information we didn\u2019t have,\" a WhatsApp spokesperson said.\n\nWhatsApp is used by individuals, companies and federal and local governments to send messages and share pictures and videos.\n\nOn the floor of Congress, lawmakers expressed their frustration at the suspension.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" yelled congressman Caio Narcio. \"What about our freedom to communicate?\"\n\nThe suspension appeared to affect WhatsApp users outside Brazil's borders, as hundreds in Chile and Argentina took to social media on Thursday to complain that the messaging system was also interrupted in the two countries.\n\nChilean telecom provider VTR, owned by Liberty Global Inc, said it had re-established service to WhatsApp for its clients by using an \"alternative international link.\" Earlier it said that difficulty in accessing the app \"originated outside of Chile,\" without giving details.\n\n(Additional reporting by Silvio Cascione in Brasilia, Marcelo Teixeira in Sao Paulo and Rosalba O'Brien in Santiago; Editing by Leslie Adler, Dominic Evans, Lisa Von Ahn and Leslie Adler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge on Thursday ordered the lifting", "title": "Brazil court lifts suspension of Facebook's WhatsApp service", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/16/Brazil-court-orders-phone-companies-block-WhatsApp-message-app", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/brazil-whatsapp-ban_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/16/Brazil-court-orders-phone-companies-block-WhatsApp-message-app", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/brazil-whatsapp-ban_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge on Thursday ordered the lifting", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The trafficker allegedly used WhatsApp services while committing crimes, and the court wants access to his communications with others.\nA judge in Sao Bernardo do Campo, an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo, had ordered the suspension of WhatsApp's services from midnight on Wednesday (0200 GMT Thursday).\n\"Until today, Brazil has been an ally in creating an open Internet,\" Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg posted after the interruption of WhatsApp's services.\nThe suspension appeared to affect WhatsApp users outside Brazil's borders, as hundreds in Chile and Argentina took to social media on Thursday to complain that the messaging system was also interrupted in the two countries.\n(Additional reporting by Silvio Cascione in Brasilia, Marcelo Teixeira in Sao Paulo and Rosalba O'Brien in Santiago; Editing by Leslie Adler, Dominic Evans, Lisa Von Ahn and Leslie Adler)"}
