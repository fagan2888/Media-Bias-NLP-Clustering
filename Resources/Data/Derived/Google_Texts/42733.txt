COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) - A University of Missouri associate law professor has filed a lawsuit contending that the school’s ban on concealed weapons on campus violates his constitutional rights.

The lawsuit filed Saturday by Royce de R. Barondes against the Board of Curators and President Tim Wolfe also argues the ban conflicts with a state law that allows guns to be stored in the passenger compartment of a vehicle by an adult with a permit.

His attorney, Jennifer Bukowsky, also argues the ban violate Barondes’ right to keep and carry weapons on campus for self-defense. Barondes is licensed to carry a concealed firearm.

The lawsuit also cites an amendment approved last year by Missouri voters that said state residents have an unalienable right to bear arms and any gun regulations must be subject to “strict scrutiny.”

University spokesman Christian Basi declined to comment because the lawsuit is pending, the Columbia Daily Tribune reported (http://bit.ly/1V6gBRF ).

“This is a sensitive subject to many people, but it doesn’t change the fact that it is a constitutional right for Mr. Barondes,” Bukowsky said. “He should be able to exercise that right, and the university shouldn’t be able to violate it.”

The lawsuit cites three incidents near the Columbia campus this year, including an officer-involved fatal shooting in a parking garage of a suspect in several violent crimes. It also recalls the 2005 death of assistant professor Jeong Inn, who was killed and stuffed in his car, which was set on fire, in a parking garage.

Barondes, who has worked at the university since 2002, fears he will lose his tenured job and be arrested if he conceals a gun in his car or on his person, according to the petition.

Bukowsky said Monday the lawsuit can provide a test case to interpret how far the amendment approved last year in Missouri goes in expanding gun rights.
