But no dice.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nInstead, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew rolled out a set of more moderate rules to tamp down the offshore tax deals \u2014 like not allowing a U.S. company to merge with a foreign rival and then take shelter in a third country. The Obama administration also seeks to stop the foreign partner in a merger from artificially inflating its size to skirt anti-inversion rules, and to beef up the substantial business exception by forcing a new foreign parent company to be a tax resident of the country where it was created.\n\nOur Katy O\u2019Donnell has more: http://politico.pro/1LpfgdK\n\nSome of the highlights \u2014 Treasury officials think the third country rule is likely to have the most teeth. And administration officials swear up and down that Pfizer\u2019s talks with Allergan aren\u2019t why we\u2019re seeing the new rules now. \u201cWe\u2019re really not focused on particular companies or particular transactions,\u201d one Treasury official said.\n\nFair enough, because experts like Steve Rosenthal at the Tax Policy Center say the new rules wouldn\u2019t be much of an impediment to a Pfizer deal. \u201cThese measures are technical changes around the edges,\u201d Rosenthal told The Financial Times. \u201cIt\u2019s a welcome mat for Pfizer to combine with Allergan and strip its earnings.\u201d http://on.ft.com/1l8vdiZ\n\nWSJ reports on a new potential wrinkle for that deal: Allergan, despite being the smaller company, might actually \u201cbuy\u201d Pfizer, which could skirt anti-inversion rules. http://on.wsj.com/1kIA4In\n\nAND YES, ANOTHER WEEK IS ALMOST IN THE BOOKS \u2014 and it couldn\u2019t come sooner for those of you who maybe had one drink too many at the Tax Foundation's tax prom last night. (We\u2019ll also take this time to say happy birthday to Morning Tax\u2019s dad and, I guess, Joe Biden.) Let us know what\u2019s going on.

Democrats like Ron Wyden and Sander Levin applauded Treasury for trying to limit inversions but agreed with Lew that the situation cries for congressional action. Republicans like Orrin Hatch and Kevin Brady agreed that Congress should be the one making tax policy but also warned that the new rules could have the unintended consequence of pushing more companies offshore.\n\n** A message from The ADvertising Coalition: Last year, advertising expenditures and sales supported by advertising accounted for $5.8 trillion \u2014 or 16 percent \u2014 of all economic activity in the U.S. Advertising also supported more than 20 million American jobs in 2014, and is projected to create 3 million more by 2019. A new study out today: http://bit.ly/1HyR39M. **\n\nSLOW GO ON EXTENDERS TALKS: The bad news, as our Brian Faler reports, is that this year\u2019s extenders talks aren\u2019t exactly proceeding swiftly.\n\nBut the good news is that this is far from tax writers\u2019 first rodeo when it comes to restoring extenders, and this year\u2019s debate over whether to extend some of the incentives for good sounds awfully similar to the 2014 negotiations. So we\u2019re pretty sure things can escalate quickly.\n\nBrian writes that tax aides are getting deeper into discussion, which could lead to a bigger deal than just a two-year extension. But Levin said the current talks are \u201cvery preliminary.\u201d And Hatch, while hoping for a deal to materialize shortly after Thanksgiving, didn\u2019t sound overly confident about getting anything permanent: \u201cYou never know \u2014 we might be able to pull it off.\u201d More from Brian: http://politico.pro/1SJ15G1\n\nSANDERS ON SOCIALISM: Sen. Bernie Sanders sought to wrap democratic socialism in the cloak of FDR, in his long-awaited speech on the topic. POLITICO's Gabriel Debenedetti: \u201cAt times, the address was an echo of his stump speech, down to individual statistics on income inequality he likes to repeat at his signature mega rallies.\u201d http://politi.co/1OhS9GH\n\nBut if you were looking for a little more detail on Sanders\u2019 tax plan, well, you left disappointed. Sanders gave the usual spiel about corporations and the wealthy needing to pay more, the scourge of Cayman Islands tax strategies and the need for both an estate tax and Wall Street transactions tax. \u201cGreed for the sake of greed is not something public policy should support,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nThere was this little bit of wiggle room, however, after Hillary Clinton has been making the case that Sanders would have to raise taxes on the middle class to finance his wide range of domestic initiatives: \u201cI believe that most Americans can pay lower taxes \u2014 if hedge fund managers who make billions manipulating the marketplace finally pay the taxes they should.\u201d Whole speech here: http://bit.ly/1I1ZF3u\n\nIRS NEEDS YOU: Congratulations, you. First, Time\u2019s Person of the Year, and now an IRS deputy in the fight against identity theft.\n\nMore from Katy: \u201cThe agency launched a 'Taxes. Security. Together.' initiative, releasing a YouTube video and a fact sheet urging taxpayers to, among other things, \u201ctreat your personal information like cash, don\u2019t leave it lying around.\u201d http://politico.pro/1MFu8GD\n\nIRS chief John Koskinen said the rationale for the new program is pretty simple: \u201cThe criminals are evolving, and so must we.\u201d And one of the best ways to box out potential thieves, Koskinen added, is to make sure your personal data is secure.\n\nHIGHWAY UPDATE: We\u2019ve now officially got until Dec. 4 to put together a new highway bill. But Lauren Gardner over at Pro Transpo reports that Sen. Jim Inhofe, a key figure on highways, says there could be big news on that front today. Stay tuned. http://politico.pro/1Oi9grD\n\nLauren and Heather Caygle also write about another highway twist: New York lawmakers trying to find a ride for health benefits for 9/11 first responders on the highway bill. http://politico.pro/1l7Yt9H Lauren adds: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who\u2019s urging a resolution to the lapsed program and a companion compensation fund that runs out of money next year, proposed paying for the bill this week by closing a tax loophole, according to the Poughkeepsie Journal. CBO has scored the bill as costing between $8 billion and $11 billion, and that offset has seen daylight in both a GOP tax overhaul proposal and in President Barack Obama\u2019s budget requests. The Huffington Post reported Thursday that Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch said he, too, could support the idea to pay for 9/11 health care.\n\nCELEBRITY INTERLUDE: You might have heard that the actor Charlie Sheen announced he was HIV-positive this week, and that he went public in part to end a cycle of extortion. Robert Woods, a Forbes contributor, says Sheen and his lawyers were almost certainly thinking about taxes as well. Woods points to the recent trial of former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, among others, as he makes the following case: \u201cHush money \u2014 even blackmail \u2014 has probably been claimed on more tax returns than you might think. Bribes and illegal payments are nondeductible, but it\u2019s often not so clear exactly what something is.\u201d http://onforb.es/1I1FuCQ\n\nTAX PROM UPDATE: The Tax Foundation went bipartisan with the honors at its 78th annual gala last night, giving distinguished service awards to both Sen. Rob Portman and Robert Stack, Treasury\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for international tax affairs.\n\nSTATE NEWS \u2014\n\nGOLD(EN) STATE: Nearly 60 percent of the deals inked by the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) with private equity firms allow the firms to reduce their tax bills, Reuters reported. CalPERS, the largest public retirement fund in the country, often agrees to waive management fees, which are subject to ordinary income tax rates. Instead, that money is treated as a \u201ccapital contribution\u201d and taxed at lower capital gains rates. \u201cThis is basically a tax-avoidance strategy from the GPs [firms\u2019 general partners]. \u2026 It is a controversial practice but one that does persist in the industry,\u201d CalPERS senior staff counsel Marte Castanos told Reuters. http://reut.rs/1O6q6vC\n\nLITTLE HOPE FOR N.J. TAX RELIEF?: New Jersey residents hoping for some property tax relief may have to wait a while. In fact, the Asbury Park Press reports, some tax increases may be in store. \u201cDuring a panel discussion, [state lawmakers] agreed that New Jersey\u2019s highest-in-the-nation property tax is a concern, but they focused much of the discussion at potentially raising a different tax. Democrats on the panel said replenishing the state\u2019s transportation trust fund is the top issue facing the Legislature and that hiking the gasoline tax is an option to address it.\u201d Republicans, who are the minority in the state Legislature, were frustrated. \u201cAll we\u2019re talking about is raising taxes. But first why don\u2019t we talk about some tax that we can lower?\u2019\u2019 the newspaper quoted Republican Assembly Leader Jon Bramnick saying. http://on.app.com/1kI5oqq\n\nSTICKER SHOCK: St. Louis County officials are promising to promptly refund overcharges in tax bills mailed out to a whopping 380,000 homeowners and businesses last week. The officials blamed the problem on a software glitch, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. \u201cThe county said the errors resulted in average overcharges of 71 cents on road and bridge taxes, $24 for the Clayton school taxes, $133 for the Parkway school taxes and $1 for Clayton property taxes.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Lo6BYW\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\n\u2014 The Justice Department announced three more settlements under its Swiss Bank Program: http://1.usa.gov/215RC1j\n\n\u2014 Trump adviser Carl Icahn is no fan of limited government: http://cnb.cx/1NenD39\n\nDID YOU KNOW? Charlie Sheen once owned the baseball that infamously went through Bill Buckner\u2019s legs during the 1986 World Series.\n\n** A message from The ADvertising Coalition: If you think the economic benefits of advertising stop at Madison Avenue, think again. Last year, the U.S. advertising industry supported 20 million jobs across the country in all economic sectors, like agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare and retail.\n\nA new study released Monday finds that advertising activity represented $3.4 trillion, or 19 percent, of U.S. GDP, a number just short of the total GDP for Germany. The study was commissioned by The ADvertising Coalition (TAC) and spearheaded by the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), which represents more than 680 companies and 10,000 top global brands.\n\nCompanies need advertising to reach customers and stay in business, which is why this year 88 Members of Congress signed a letter to maintain the treatment of advertising as an ordinary and necessary business expense as it has been for 102 years.\n\nRead the study and learn about the economic benefits of advertising at http://bit.ly/1HyR39M. **", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Extenders talks a slow go \u2014 Sanders keeps it general on taxes", "title": "Inversion rules skip earnings stripping", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-tax/2015/11/inversion-rules-skip-earnings-stripping-extenders-talks-a-slow-go-sanders-keeps-it-general-on-taxes-211388", "image": "http://static.politico.com/97/de/e15842c94e928ce8b561e20745a0/whitelogoondots.jpeg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Extenders talks a slow go \u2014 Sanders keeps it general on taxes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Inversion rules skip earnings strippingWith help from Toby EckertSTRIP AWAY: Well, we thought Treasury might take aim at earnings stripping in its second round of regulations on Thursday.\nAnd administration officials swear up and down that Pfizer\u2019s talks with Allergan aren\u2019t why we\u2019re seeing the new rules now.\n** A message from The ADvertising Coalition: If you think the economic benefits of advertising stop at Madison Avenue, think again.\nOur Katy O\u2019Donnell has more: http://politico.pro/1LpfgdKSome of the highlights \u2014 Treasury officials think the third country rule is likely to have the most teeth.\nFair enough, because experts like Steve Rosenthal at the Tax Policy Center say the new rules wouldn\u2019t be much of an impediment to a Pfizer deal."}
