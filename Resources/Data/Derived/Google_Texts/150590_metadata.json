From 1991-2000, Fraser worked with San Francisco City Attorney\u2019s Office as managing attorney for the team advising the San Francisco departments of Public Health and Human Services.\n\nShe holds a law degree from Yale Law School, and a bachelor\u2019s degree from Yale University.\n\nCounty Manager John Maltbie will begin recruiting immediately for Fraser\u2019s successor. If a successor is not named prior to Fraser\u2019s departure, Health System Deputy Chief Louise Rogers will serve as interim chief.\n\n\u201cJean has been an outstanding asset to the Health System and the county of San Mateo as a whole,\u201d Maltbie wrote in a statement. \u201cShe has provided invaluable leadership, successfully steering the Health System through many challenges like the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and assuming the county\u2019s public administrator program. She is a champion of fair and equal health care for all and she will be truly missed. I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Health System chief resigns -", "title": "Health System chief resigns - San Mateo Daily Journal", "url": "http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2015-04-17/health-system-chief-resigns/1776425141833.html", "image": "http://www.smdailyjournal.com/adv_image/smdj-large.jpg", "ttl": 2592000, "type": "website"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000103315106, "app_id": 484828421538257}, "GENERATOR": "San Mateo Daily Journal"}, "article_summary": "If a successor is not named prior to Fraser\u2019s departure, Health System Deputy Chief Louise Rogers will serve as interim chief.\nJean FraserJean Fraser announced her resignation as chief of the San Mateo County Health System Thursday.\n\u201cBut with most San Mateo residents insured, the Health System\u2019s finances stable and a strong Health System leadership team in place, now is a good time for me to leave.\u201dFraser was previously the CEO of San Francisco Health Plan, a county-created health plan providing affordable health coverage to low- and moderate-income families.\nShe is a champion of fair and equal health care for all and she will be truly missed.\nFraser, 52, served as chief executive officer of San Francisco Health Plan from 2000 to 2008 after a career path that included stints as a prosecutor for the federal government and the San Francisco City Attorney\u2019s Office."}
