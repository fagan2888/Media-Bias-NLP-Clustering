Exercise advocate Michelle Obama was sweating it out on Martha’s Vineyard over the weekend, when journalists caught her on camera before being told to shut down filming.

For all her fitness advocacy on behalf of the “Let’s Move!” campaign, you’d think it would be a good idea to show Americans that Obama practices what she preaches.
