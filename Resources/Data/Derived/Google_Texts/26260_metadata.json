Phelps\u2018 longtime foe also competed in the 200 freestyle, winning the \u201cB\u201d final less than an hour before he returned to the water to face a rested Phelps.\n\nMore important for Lochte \u2014 his left knee seemed to hold up well.\n\nThis is his first meet for the laid-back Floridian since he reinjured the surgically repaired knee at the Mesa Grand Prix in April. It was initially hurt late last year when he tried to catch an exuberant fan and fell into a curb, requiring surgery.\n\n\u201cI hope I lose,\u201d said Lochte, who plans to swim a grueling six events in Athens. \u201cIt will just make me more hungry.\u201d\n\nPhelps is set to swim three events at the weekend meet on the University of Georgia campus, a hastily arranged event that gave some of the top swimmers on the East Coast a chance to swim one more time competitively before the next month\u2019s national championships in Irvine, California.\n\nThe results from nationals, as well as the Pan Pacific Championships being held in Australia later in August, will determine the U.S. team for the 2015 world championships.\n\nPhelps seems to be right on course, at least in his signature fly, finishing just 0.46 off the time that won the gold at the 2012 London Olympics. The only faster times this year were Thomas Dal\u2019s 51.44 in the Belgian Open and Viacheslav Prudnikov\u2019s 51.60 at the Russian national championships.\n\n\u201cI am very pleased with being able to go 51,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cBut in the grand scheme of things, I think it\u2019s just a small steppingstone to go where we hope to be.\u201d\n\nHe is still struggling with the consistency of his stroke. When things are going well, Phelps needs 16 strokes to cover the first 50 meters, 18 for the return lap. When he\u2019s just a little off, he winds up gliding into the wall too much, either when he\u2019s making his flip turn or coming to the finish.\n\n\u201cI was kind of bummed that I still can\u2019t hit a wall correctly,\u201d Phelps said.\n\nAdded his coach, Bob Bowman, \u201cHe looked crazy coming off the wall.\u201d\n\nAll in all, though, no complaints.\n\nPhelps, who retired after the last Olympics and stayed away from the pool for more than a year, didn\u2019t come back to tarnish his legacy, which includes 18 golds and 22 medals overall \u2014 far more than any other Olympic athlete.\n\n\u201cI always set high expectations for myself, no matter what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said. \u201cBob and I have a plan of what I want to do. He knows what it\u2019s going to take to get there.\u201d\n\nIn other events, French Olympic star Yannick Agnel took the men\u2019s 200 freestyle in 1 minute, 47.27 seconds, followed by U.S. Olympians Conor Dywer (1:47.44) and Connor Jaeger (1:47.94). Lochte, swimming in that consolation final, actually posted the fourth-fastest time of the evening at 1:48.69, some 4 seconds faster than he went in the morning preliminaries while wearing a non-racing suit.\n\nAllison Schmitt, coming back strong after a disappointing post-Olympic year, won the women\u2019s 200 freestyle in 1:58.16. Winner of five medals in London, she struggled a bit with fame and didn\u2019t even qualify for the 2013 worlds.\n\nShe\u2019s back on track with the Rio Games just two years away.\n\n\u201cI have more goals that I want to accomplish, which is why I\u2019m back,\u201d Schmitt said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to this summer.\u201d\n\nIn the 400 individual medley, Olympic gold medalist Tyler Clary blew away the field in the men\u2019s race. His time of 4:21.66 was nearly 4 1/2 seconds ahead of runner-up Kevin Litherland. Melanie Margalis finished first on the women\u2019s side.\n\nMicah Lawrence touched first in the women\u2019s 100 breaststroke, while the men\u2019s breaststroke was captured by Nicolas Fink. Seventeen-year-old Kathleen Baker took the women\u2019s 100 fly in 59.69, the only swimmer to break the minute barrier.\n\nOf course, Phelps drew most of the attention.\n\nHis main foe was impressed by what he saw.\n\n\u201cHe swam a fantastic race,\u201d Lochte said. \u201cThat was really fast.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Phelps turned in perhaps the most impressive performance so far in his comeback, posting the third-fastest time in the world this year while easily beating Lochte in the 100-meter butterfly at the Bulldog Grand Slam on Friday night.", "Author": "Paul Newberry", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Phelps turned in perhaps the most impressive performance so far in his comeback, posting the third-fastest time in the world this year while easily beating Lochte in the 100-meter butterfly at the Bulldog Grand Slam on Friday night.", "title": "Michael Phelps comeback continues with win over Ryan Lochte", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/12/michael-phelps-comeback-continues-win-over-ryan-lo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/12/phelps-comeback-swimm_lanc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/12/phelps-comeback-swimm_lanc.jpg", "title": "Michael Phelps comeback continues with win over Ryan Lochte", "description": "Phelps turned in perhaps the most impressive performance so far in his comeback, posting the third-fastest time in the world this year while easily beating Lochte in the 100-meter butterfly at the Bul", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Michael Phelps, Ryan Lochte"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb241\"", "article_summary": "ATHENS, Ga. \u2014 Michael Phelps surged to the wall and quickly searched for the scoreboard.\n\u201cI was sick and tired of seeing 52.1.\u201dHe had no trouble finishing ahead of Lochte, though it really wasn\u2019t a fair fight.\n\u201cI was kind of bummed that I still can\u2019t hit a wall correctly,\u201d Phelps said.\nPhelps\u2018 longtime foe also competed in the 200 freestyle, winning the \u201cB\u201d final less than an hour before he returned to the water to face a rested Phelps.\n\u201cI hope I lose,\u201d said Lochte, who plans to swim a grueling six events in Athens."}
