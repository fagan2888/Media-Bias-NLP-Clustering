This partnership ensures their ease of access to an entire network of high quality care, and reaffirms McLaren\u2019s long-term commitment to the health of the Gaylord community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe see many patients with very complex needs,\u201d added Samalik, \u201cand we\u2019ve been partnering with McLaren Northern Michigan for many years for their treatment. McLaren is a quality health care organization with specialists from some of the most renowned programs in the country.\u201d\n\nAll across the country, independent physician practices are seeking closer alignment with larger health systems.\n\n\u201cRunning an independent practice has become increasingly more complex since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2012,\u201d stated Lingaur. \"McLaren took these challenges on early and developed a robust practice management model that has proven to be successful in practices all over the state. It\u2019s a model that allows physicians to maintain their focus on patient care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis affiliation is also about planning for the future,\u201d added Milan. \u201cWe\u2019re all very aware of the physician shortages in America. And, practicing in a rural area makes physician recruitment even more challenging. If we want to ensure that our practice is here to serve patients in Gaylord long into the future, we\u2019ll need the resources of a health system like McLaren.\u201d\n\nGaylord Family Practice will continue to see patients at the current location, 1320 E. M-32 in Gaylord.\n\nFor information on services available at McLaren Northern Michigan, call (800) 248-6777 or online at northernhealth.org.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Petoskey News-Review", "description": "GAYLORD\u2014Gaylord Family Practice, the office of Dr. Gary Lingaur, Dr. Christopher Milan and Dr. Michael Samalik, has signed an agreement to join the McLaren Northern Michigan network of health care providers.
