(The how and the why of his absence become gradually clear through the exposition.) It\u2019s a tall order for any actor, particularly one of such youth, but Mr. Winn, a veteran of several New York productions, brings unusual depth and complexity to Luke \u2014 which is appropriate, given the worldliness thrust upon Luke during his time away from his Kansas family.\n\nWhile Luke\u2019s torment is seen in excruciating flashback, the scenes of his readjustment to domesticity are as equally unbearable. His mother, played by Christiane Noll, is controlling and far from understanding Luke\u2019s ordeal and feelings. His father, portrayed by Christopher Bloch, is warm and genteel but ineffectual in breaking through Luke\u2019s self-imposed seclusion.\n\nThen there are the church folk, such as Gail (Donna Migliaccio), who seem to think that all Luke needs to mend fences with his past is some old-time religion and song.\n\nThis is dark material, made no less traumatic by the fact that this is, after all, a musical. The songs by Mr. Kander and Mr. Pierce vacillate between the morbid and the light of foot. The excellent Jeffry Denman is harrowing as Michael, who transmits some unspeakable dialogue and plot that could be related only through song, given the magnitude of their horror. His \u201cbad education\u201d of Luke is made even more frightful by his slick, pedantic nature.\n\nThere are light, upbeat numbers, such as the late-show entry \u201cMatchstick Men,\u201d featuring the effervescent Parker Drown, as Andrew, turning an awkward midnight meeting with Luke in the cornfields into a song-and-dance number that features a tap routine. Mr. Drown appears lighter than air in the number, all smiles and positivity, providing marked contrast to the rapidly increasing spiral swallowing Luke\u2019s soul.\n\nSpecial note must be made of Sarah Litzsinger as Emily, the hippy-dippy owner of a garden accessory store who employs Luke as a helper in her shop. The relationship between Emily, who is not quite middle-aged, and Luke is meant to be ambiguous, riding a fine line of matronly worry \u2014 of which Luke\u2019s mother is incapable \u2014 while bordering on the sexual. Miss Litzsinger\u2019s voice is by far the strongest of the cast, and her ease of character and virility of tone bring zest to the songs \u201cLawn\u201d and, especially, \u201cThe Last He Needed,\u201d a cheery ditty that makes one smile despite the melancholy of the lyrics.\n\nLiesl Tommy\u2019s direction takes full advantage of the Signature\u2019s expansive stage, allowing her to block multiple scenes simultaneously, often in inspired counterpoint. This has the effect of giving the audience a choice of where to direct attention and seeks active participation: By asking for frequent shifts of focus and perspective, Ms. Tommy all but requires the audience to take part and view the shorn humanity of Luke, his family and his friends up close.\n\nYet for such involvement, the story and the production are strangely lacking in empathy between material and audience. Much like Luke\u2019s relationships after his disappearance, it is almost as if the show\u2019s creators and Ms. Tommy wish us to embrace Luke while keeping us at arm\u2019s length \u2014 as if getting too close a look at the horror would show us the strings holding up some of the musical\u2019s far-fetched plot aspects.\n\nIronically, the estrangement between audience and production, while perhaps the point of the show, doesn\u2019t translate well enough into the alienation of Luke onstage. Mr. Winn strives admirably to make Luke real and habitable, but the production surrounding him is often sadly lacking in the humanity that we are meant to believe could \u2014 and possibly will \u2014 be his ultimate salvation. It almost feels that Ms. Tommy doesn\u2019t trust her audience enough to handle Luke\u2019s burden with him, thus keeping the viewer away from perdition\u2019s flames lest we, too, be scorched.\n\nDespite the often heavy disquiet between performers and audience (to say nothing of some by-the-numbers plot points), \u201cKid Victory\u201d is ultimately less about its story than the raw emotions it conjures, not the least of which are regret, anger, disunity and confusion, related in a tight 120 minutes without intermission.\n\nThe show\u2019s final number, \u201cWhere We Are,\u201d sung by Mr. Bloch to Mr. Winn in Luke\u2019s childhood bedroom, certainly does not bring all to close, but it does provide as much of an emotional resolution \u2014 one might even tentatively say redemption \u2014 as is possible in the world of \u201cKid Victory.\u201d\n\nIf You Go\n\nWHAT: \u201cKid Victory\u201d\n\nWHERE: The Signature Theatre, 4200 Campbell Ave., Arlington, Virginia\n\nWHEN: Through March 22\n\nINFO: Tickets $36.80 to $91.15.
