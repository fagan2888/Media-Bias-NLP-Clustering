LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Former TierOne Bank President James Laphen testified in federal court that he, the bank’s former CEO and other bank officers deliberately stalled ordering new and more realistic appraisals of construction developments starting in 2008 to keep bank and market regulators at bay.

Laphen’s testimony came Friday in the fraud and conspiracy trial of TierOne Bank’s former CEO and chairman, Gil Lundstrom, the Lincoln Journal Star reported (http://bit.ly/1GoJBOg ). The trial began Wednesday.

Prosecutors say Lundstrom, 74, and other bank officers hid million-dollar losses from regulators and shareholders. Regulators took over Lincoln-based TierOne in 2010, saying the bank had too many bad loans on its books and lacked sufficient capital to cushion losses. The bank’s assets were sold to South Dakota-based Great Western Bank.

Laphen testified Friday that the bank’s troubles started to show up late in 2007 in Florida, and that by 2009, bank officials were preoccupied with trying to hold off recognizing the rapidly declining value of construction projects, which could have had regulators requiring the bank to come up with reserves for loans that were no longer performing.

Laphen has pleaded guilty to mail and wire fraud. He acknowledged from the stand that he hoped his testimony against Lundstrom would result in his getting a more lenient sentence.

Former chief credit officer, Don Langford, also has pleaded guilty to similar charges.
