But as the Federal Reserve starts to pull in the reins, few can predict exactly how the story will end.\n\nJoseph Baratta, global head of private equity at the Blackstone Group, told a group of attendees at the Harvard Business School\u2019s private equity and venture capital conference on Sunday that the global capital markets have entered \u201cuncharted territory\u201d when it comes to government and central banking involvement.\n\n\u201cNever in the history of humanity has there been this much intervention in capital markets globally,\u201d Mr. Baratta said. \u201cNo one in this room or anywhere is smart enough to know how this is going to evolve.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Reserve plans to reduce its monthly bond buying program, prompting some to bet that financial institutions will ultimately begin to tighten their lending requirements. Although pricing on deals may not have reached the lofty heights it hit during the peak of the buyout bubble in 2006 and 2007, Mr. Baratta cautioned that loose lending standards have pushed some firms to rely too heavily on cheap debt for returns.\n\n\u201cThe artificially low interest rates are inducing people to do things that may not be sensible at this point in time,\u201d Mr. Baratta said. \u201cOur true north in every decision is the yield we\u2019re making on an unlevered basis. If it doesn\u2019t work on an unlevered basis, it doesn\u2019t make sense as an investment.\u201d\n\nHe added that for its part Blackstone is particularly bullish on deals in the energy space these days. The firm is expected to hit the market with its second energy focused fund later this year, LBO Wire reported in December.\n\nIn 2012, the buyout firm invested in the construction of a liquefied natural gas facility in Louisiana alongside Houston-based Cheniere Energy.\n\n\u201cRight now we see energy as one of the few global sectors with enormous demand for capital that is not easily met by the public debt and equity markets,\u201d Mr. Baratta said.\n\nWrite to Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com Follow her on Twitter @laurakreutzer", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Joseph Baratta, global head of private equity at Blackstone Group cautions that some private equity firms are relying too heavily on cheap debt to fuel returns.", "title": "Blackstone\u2019s Baratta on Private Equity\u2019s \u201cUncharted Territory\u201d", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/02/10/blackstones-baratta-on-private-equitys-uncharted-territory/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Blackstone\u2019s Baratta on Private Equity\u2019s \u201cUncharted Territory\u201d", "description": "Joseph Baratta, global head of private equity at Blackstone Group cautions that some private equity firms are relying too heavily on cheap debt to fuel returns.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Laura Kreutzer", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Joseph Baratta, global head of private equity at Blackstone Group cautions that some private equity firms are relying too heavily on cheap debt to fuel returns.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-02-10T16:25:17-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/02/10/blackstones-baratta-on-private-equitys-uncharted-territory/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-16274", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Joseph Baratta, global head of private equity at Blackstone Group cautions that some private equity firms are relying too heavily on cheap debt to fuel returns.", "title": "Blackstone\u2019s Baratta on Private Equity\u2019s \u201cUncharted Territory\u201d", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/02/10/blackstones-baratta-on-private-equitys-uncharted-territory/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-16274", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-02-10T16:18:13-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff51\"", "article_summary": "Peter Reitzfeld Blackstone Group\u2019s Joseph Baratta, global head of private equity, at the Dow Jones Private Equity Analyst Conference in September.\n\u201cNever in the history of humanity has there been this much intervention in capital markets globally,\u201d Mr. Baratta said.\nJoseph Baratta, global head of private equity at the Blackstone Group, told a group of attendees at the Harvard Business School\u2019s private equity and venture capital conference on Sunday that the global capital markets have entered \u201cuncharted territory\u201d when it comes to government and central banking involvement.\n\u201cThe artificially low interest rates are inducing people to do things that may not be sensible at this point in time,\u201d Mr. Baratta said.\n\u201cRight now we see energy as one of the few global sectors with enormous demand for capital that is not easily met by the public debt and equity markets,\u201d Mr. Baratta said."}
