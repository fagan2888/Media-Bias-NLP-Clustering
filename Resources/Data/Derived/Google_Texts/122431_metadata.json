Mike Lee is willing to drop his objection to the Flint, Mich., federal aid package under one condition: It can\u2019t add to the deficit.\n\nThe Utah Republican would lift his hold on the legislation, an aide told The Daily Signal Wednesday, if the bill is \u201cbudget neutral,\u201d and if relief dollars are paid for immediately after they\u2019re spent.\n\nAs the Senate tries to reach a deal to address Flint\u2019s contaminated drinking water, it\u2019s unclear if either of those options is even possible.\n\nThe aid package for Flint, which is attached to a larger Senate energy bill, would redirect $250 million from an existing Energy Department fund for advanced vehicle manufacturing. Those tax dollars wouldn\u2019t flow until 2020, but by then Lee worries the fund would be completely dry.\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., has said that the initial version would be fully funded and wouldn\u2019t increase spending \u201cby one penny.\u201d\n\nAnd on Wednesday, lawmakers seemed close to reaching a deal. Stabenow doesn\u2019t need Lee to support a refurbished bill; she just needs him to get out of the way for it to move forward.\n\nFor more than a week, Lee has been standing against a tide pushing for a federal aid package. So far, he\u2019s been successful at delaying what he considers \u201cpolitical grandstanding.\u201d\n\nAdvocates for federal aid say it\u2019s critical to helping Flint cleanse lead from its water supply. And pressure has been building against Lee to lift his hold. He is the only senator publicly opposing the measure after Sen. David Vitter, R-La., scuttled his opposition Tuesday.\n\nThough Lee is willing to let the bill advance, the Senate aide told The Daily Signal the Utah senator still considers it bad policy and plans to vote against it on the Senate floor. Earlier, he told The Daily Signal aid for Flint could \u201cfederalize\u201d traditionally municipal concerns.\n\n\u201cIf we create a precedent that suggests any time there\u2019s a significant problem with a locally operated utility that operates entirely intrastate,\u201d Lee said on Monday, \u201cI would ask, where\u2019s the stopping point? What\u2019s the limit?\u201d\n\nLast September, researchers from Virginia Tech reported that dangerous lead levels were present in 40 percent of Flint homes. Local parents first sounded the alarm when they noticed changes in young children like sudden rashes and serious weight loss.\n\nThat suffering in Flint has come center stage politically in recent months. Democrats have chastised Republican opposition to aid.\n\nBut Lee maintains that the Great Lake State already has enough resources to clean up its own problems. He points out that Michigan has $386 million in a rainy day fund and a budget surplus of $575 million.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
