Delta Dental of Missouri today announced the launch of individual.deltadentalmo.com, an e-commerce site for persons looking to purchase individual or family dental coverage.

The new site allows shoppers to compare plan options, obtain a quote, access the provider network, view a wealth of oral health information and purchase dental coverage online.

While pediatric dental care is covered under the Affordable Care Act, adult coverage is not.

“We understand that every dollar spent on preventive care saves money on restorative and major care down the road,” commented David Haynes, president and CEO of Delta Dental of Missouri.. “Access to affordable coverage is closely tied to the probability that an individual will visit the dentist regularly. These are essential factors in protecting the oral health and overall health of Missourians and their families, and this drives our business and social mission.”

The company has developed several benefit plans that focus on prevention and comprehensive oral health care. Those who purchase a Delta Dental Individual and Family plan can choose any dentist and have coverage, but individuals will pay the lowest out-of-pocket costs when they receive services from a dentist in the Delta Dental PPO Network. On the new site, members can find a dentist, print an ID card, manage their own accounts, make profile changes and review claims. Personal assistance is also available at 866-991-7345.
