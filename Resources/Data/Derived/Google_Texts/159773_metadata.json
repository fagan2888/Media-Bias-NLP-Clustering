The filing indicated assets are unlikely to be available for distribution to creditors.\n\nOsborne said he invested in Focus Red Mango a few years ago after being impressed with the company\u2019s product. Restaurant reviewer Zagat has twice cited Red Mango for exceptional frozen treats, ranking them No. 1 in two categories.\n\n\u201cI was simply an investor,\u201d said Osborne, listed in the petition as a 10 percent shareholder. \u201cI received no return on my investment and will lose all that I did invest.\u201d\n\nOsborne declined to specify how much he invested with Focus Red Mango, saying only that it was \u201ca fair amount.\u201d\n\nHe also said he loaned money to the company this fall to keep things going in the hopes of salvaging enough assets to pay off creditors.\n\n\u201cBut I had no idea bankruptcy was contemplated,\u201d he said. \u201cI am philosophically against it. Creditors ought to be paid, and if I have any obligation or responsibility I will stand up and accept it.\u201d\n\nThe largest creditor in the case is Omaha\u2019s American National Bank, owed about $335,000 for business loans.\n\nOne of the three Omaha-area locations, at One Pacific Place, is open for business under new ownership, Red Mango said. Locations in Kearney and Grand Island also are open.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing lists Bret Cain as Focus Red Mango\u2019s managing member and largest shareholder, with 80 percent. The company\u2019s bankruptcy lawyers did not respond to email and voicemail messages.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Osborne said in an interview he wasn't informed of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidation plans of Focus Red Mango, operator of three Omaha shops of the Dallas-based chain.", "title": "Tom Osborne: 'I had no idea' Focus Red Mango would file for bankruptcy", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/money/tom-osborne-i-had-no-idea-focus-red-mango-would/article_dd2a4b3f-e837-537f-bc78-c303ad6e4ac1.html", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/a4/7a459ab4-6876-51c9-a182-39ebea7cfac0/5332ee56192f1.image.jpg?resize=600%2C400", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Osborne said in an interview he wasn't informed of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidation plans of Focus Red Mango, operator of three Omaha shops of the Dallas-based chain.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "money", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "money"}, "article_summary": "Osborne said he invested in Focus Red Mango a few years ago after being impressed with the company\u2019s product.\nThe bankruptcy filing lists Bret Cain as Focus Red Mango\u2019s managing member and largest shareholder, with 80 percent.\nFocus Red Mango cited about $400,000 of debt and virtually no assets in the filing last week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Omaha.\nOsborne said in an interview that he wasn\u2019t informed of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy and liquidation plans of Focus Red Mango, operator of three Omaha shops of the Dallas-based chain.\nRestaurant reviewer Zagat has twice cited Red Mango for exceptional frozen treats, ranking them No."}
