Her musician friends, hoping to help cover the singer\u2019s crushing medical debt, also played benefit concerts.\n\n\u201cSweet Relief\u2019s\u201d renditions of \u201cCrazy Mary\u201d and \u201cSummer of Drugs,\u201d by Pearl Jam and Soul Asylum respectively, were especially popular. The Jayhawks, Michelle Shocked and the Waterboys also contributed songs to the album.\n\nThis month, Williams, a resident of Joshua Tree, California, since 1995, is performing a rare series of engagements back home in Louisiana.\n\nShe\u2019ll be accompanied by fellow Joshua Tree residents Lisa Mednick-Powell (formerly of the New Orleans-based Song Dogs), Powell\u2019s husband, Kip, plus multi-instrumentalist Ryan Erskins.\n\nThe group is performing Thursday, Jan. 15, at Chickie Wah Wah in New Orleans, as well as in Baton Rouge, Monroe and Shreveport.\n\nPaste Magazine ranked Williams\u2019 first post-\u201cSweet Relief\u201d album, 1994\u2019s \u201cLoose,\u201d among the best albums of the \u201990s. In 2006, Paste listed her among the Top 100 living songwriters.\n\nSinging in a high, childlike voice, the stylistically unfettered Williams roams from down-home folk and country to Cajun-flavored songs to rhythm-and-blues to standards such as \u201cMoon River\u201d and \u201cWhat a Wonderful World.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 original material, including the narrative \u201cTarbelly and Featherfoot\u201d and \u201cSummer of Drugs,\u201d shows her gift for depicting places and characters.\n\nWilliams\u2019 Louisiana tour isn\u2019t part of campaign to promote a new album. The grassroots trek grew from an invitation to play a return engagement at Fairfield Studios in Shreveport.\n\n\u201cThis is really just about playing with some friends,\u201d she said last week.\n\nHer early winter return to Louisiana is the singer\u2019s third visit to the state in the past three months.\n\nIn December, she was in Shreveport to spend Christmas with her 84-year-old mother. In November, she visited New Orleans to attend birthday celebrations for Rickie Lee Jones, the singer who recently began living in New Orleans.\n\n\u201cIt was like a three-day thing,\u201d Williams said of Jones\u2019 birthday celebrations. \u201cWe had a parade. And then Susan Cowsill loaned me her bicycle. So I was just riding Susan\u2019s bicycle all over New Orleans.\u201d\n\nWilliams has another New Orleans connection in Dave Pirner, lead singer of Soul Asylum and a longtime New Orleans resident.\n\n\u201cI love it down there,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWhen I was down there for Rickie\u2019s birthday party, I was like, \u2018Why I am living in California in the desert?\u2019 I\u2019ve got so much in Louisiana. I\u2019ll probably move back. I\u2019ve always wanted to live in New Orleans.\u201d\n\nFeeling well enough to perform these days, Williams recently signed a new songwriting publishing deal. She plans to begin recording songs for a new album following her current tour.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act helped the singer obtain MS medication she previously couldn\u2019t afford, she said.\n\n\u201cI was off of it because I don\u2019t have insurance. It was like $1,600 a month. Now the same thing that used to cost so much is $1 a month. I love \u2018Obamacare.\u2019 I don\u2019t understand why anybody could not want it.\u201d\n\nWilliams believes making music has a therapeutic effect as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a healing thing,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Orleans, LA /Entertainment/: In 1993, Shreveport singer-songwriter Victoria Williams became famous after Soul Asylum, Pearl Jam, Lucinda Williams, Lou Reed and other star musicians recorded an album of her songs.
