JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Jacksonville Sheriff's Office investigators are looking for several people wanted in connection with a drive-by shooting Tuesday afternoon on the Northside.

The shooting left two men hospitalized. Police have detained a third.

One victim was shot in the leg and the other was shot in the upper left shoulder outside a home at 11400 Whisperingbrook Lane in the Northbrook neighborhood, just north of Dunn Avenue. Neither had life-threatening injuries.

The shooting appears to be drug-related, according to police, who said they found guns in the home.

The shooter or shooters fled in a small, compact, gold car, police said.

Everyone involved appears to be in their late teens to mid-20s, police said.

Donald Foy, the founder of MAD DADS who spends his time trying to stop this kind of violence, happened to live one street over from the shooting.

He said he's never seen anything like that happen in the neighborhood in the 10 years he's been living there.

Anyone who has any information on the shooting is asked to contact the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office at 904-630-0500 or email JSOCrimeTips@jaxsheriff.org. To remain anonymous and receive a possible reward up to $3,000, contact Crime Stoppers at 1-866-845-TIPS.
