The former uproar event of the company was the launch of Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus but the live streaming provided that time was too hitchy and slow. Hoping it works better this time.\n\nCertainly, iPhone 6 live streaming was a disaster, as lots of fans complained that the streaming never worked on the Apple\u2019s devices, though we were meeting the requirements of Safari Browser. This disastrous incident has also given the chance to the Samsung marketing, media team to make fun of live streaming failure.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "16 oct, apple, california, cupertino, event, ipad, ipad air, ipad gold, iphone 6, iphone 6 plus, safari browser, samsung", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "Capital Wired", "description": "Follow Apple, technology giant recently announces that October 16th event will be a live stream.
