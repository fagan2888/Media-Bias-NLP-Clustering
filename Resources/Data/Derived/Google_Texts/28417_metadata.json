Stein is a staunch liberal, whose record includes votes against several pro-life bills during the last legislative session and strong support for same-sex marriage, having received an award from the Equality NC Foundation for his advocacy on the issue.\n\n\u201cStein has long been considered one of the state\u2019s strongest allies for LGBT equality,\u201d the foundation said in a press release. \u201cThe progressive Democrat actively worked to include sexual orientation and gender identity in K-12 anti-bullying legislation.\u201d\n\nThe district leans solidly Democrat after it was specifically redistricted to be a safely Democrat seat. It is so solidly Democrat, that in the last election, Stein ran unopposed.\n\nMitchell told WND that while he knows it will be a difficult battle to win, he nevertheless believes he has a strong shot at taking down this Democrat Goliath and conquering a liberal stronghold in the state.\n\nMitchell explained to WND he believes the tide is turning back to conservatism in the state, noting that in 2010 a Republican revolution took control of both chambers of the legislature as well as the governorship and lieutenant governorship. Since that time the Republicans have used conservative principles to turn things around in the state.\n\n\u201cIn just three brief years we have taken our state from the 44th most toxic tax environment to No. 17 in no time at all,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe have also balanced the budget and are currently trying to get legislation through offering the highest teacher pay in the history of North Carolina and have expanded gun rights to include all public locations. The Carolina comeback is real.\u201d\n\nDespite efforts of some to portray him as a fringe radical, Mitchell has actually earned some impressive local endorsements. Among them are State Senators Thom Goolsby and Neal Hunt, Rep. Jim Fulghum and the Wake County Republican Party.\n\nMitchell told WND, however, he has no intention of relying on strictly Republican votes but intends to aggressively target Democrat voters by running on a platform that transcends party lines. His views on several issues are on his website NC2014.com.\n\n\u201cI intend to fight for privacy, business and personal freedom,\u201d Mitchell declares.\n\n\u201cIn District 16 the NSA has set up facilities on the NCSU campus right in my back yard,\u201d Mitchell explained. \u201cNormally that would be handled at the federal level, but when they are in my district, it is my job to protect the privacy rights of my constituents and protect their constitutional rights. I intend to do everything in my power to get the NSA out of District 16.\u201d\n\nThe issue has the potential to be a winner, as the NSA spying issue has received the ire of both those on the left as well as on the right and particularly resonates with younger voters. Recently Sen. Rand Paul received applause from students in the bastion of liberalism, the University of California, Berkeley for going after the NSA.\n\nAccording to Mitchell, there are already signs his appeal to principles of liberty are working.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I really resonate, especially on the issue of privacy,\u201d Mitchell told WND. \u201cWe have had a lot of people from the left come out and tell us that while they can\u2019t admit it publicly they are going to vote for Molotov Mitchell.\u201d\n\nMitchell says he also wants to continue to help North Carolina rebound economically by reducing taxes and regulations.\n\n\u201cBeing a businessman myself,\u201d Mitchell told WND, \u201cI intend to work with Republicans, who are in a supermajority, to continue the Carolina comeback to reduce taxes and all of these burdensome regulations on businesses to allow the economy to grow and bring work to North Carolina.\u201d\n\nAnd while his opponent, State Sen. Stein, advocates expanding Obamacare through the state\u2019s Medicaid program, Mitchell says he wants to keep Obamacare out of North Carolina.\n\nMitchell also maintains a focus on national and personal security. His resume includes work as a firearms instructor who also operates combat training centers around the state and teaches police and military. He recently came back from Moldova, where he held classes in counter-abduction in order to fight human trafficking. From his experience he said he believes terrorists\u2019 next big target is soft targets such as schools.\n\n\u201cWe have seen what happened with the terrorist attack at Beslan in 2004, which a lot of experts believe was intended as a test run where they besieged a school in Russia and held people hostage for days while they tortured and raped them before killing everyone with fire,\u201d Mitchell related. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything in other states, but I want to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nHe believes it is vital to allow responsible citizens to be able to carry firearms onto school property and that gun-rights supporters who oppose it are simply looking out for themselves at the expense of children.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, allowing firearms in most places while banning them in educational facilities is essentially a contract with killers,\u201d Mitchell explained. \u201cWe have essentially told the bad guys we\u2019ll make you a deal: If you leave us alone and let us carry our firearms in our businesses, our homes and on the streets, we\u2019ll let you have our kids. Leave us alone and you can shoot up the school if you want \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what the bad guys have done.\u201d\n\nMitchell explained his role model for the type of Republican he wants to be is former Congressman Ron Paul of Texas, who Mitchell considers to be his mentor.\n\n\u201cI have learned a lot from Dr. Paul, and he has refined a lot of my beliefs,\u201d Mitchell told WND. \u201cAs a Christian one of the foundational tenets is free will. Part of that is the right to be free to fail.\n\n\u201cI am a big proponent of leaving people alone,\u201d he continued. \u201cI used to want to see people\u2019s lives regulated more to the \u2018right,\u2019 but now I believe people, especially at the local level, have the right to decide what is best for them and their culture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I believe the Christian way is always best, I also believe if you have the people and you have the votes to disagree with that, then that\u2019s OK with me,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cYour community can try whatever you want to try. Up in Dearborn, Michigan, they are trying Islamic principles. While I expect it to go down in flames, I am now at the point where I support their right to do that as long as they don\u2019t harm other people.\u201d\n\nWatch the latest \u201cFor the Record\u201d videos from Molotov Mitchell now!", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "One of WND\u2019s edgiest voices is challenging a liberal stronghold in North Carolina by running for state senator on a platform of personal freedom for everyone \u2013 liberal, conservative or otherwise. \u201cI am the GOP cruise missile, and I intend to crush the Obama clone in Raleigh,\u201d says Molotov Mitchell, who appears in WND each [\u2026]", "title": "WND personality challenges top Dem\u2019s Senate seat", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2014/07/wnd-personality-challenges-top-dems-senate-seat/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2014/07/140719molotovmitchellz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e88\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI have learned a lot from Dr. Paul, and he has refined a lot of my beliefs,\u201d Mitchell told WND.\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I really resonate, especially on the issue of privacy,\u201d Mitchell told WND.\nMitchell is taking on Democrat State Senate Minority Whip Josh Stein in November.\nMitchell told WND, however, he has no intention of relying on strictly Republican votes but intends to aggressively target Democrat voters by running on a platform that transcends party lines.\nOne of WND\u2019s edgiest voices is challenging a liberal stronghold in North Carolina by running for state senator on a platform of personal freedom for everyone \u2013 liberal, conservative or otherwise."}
