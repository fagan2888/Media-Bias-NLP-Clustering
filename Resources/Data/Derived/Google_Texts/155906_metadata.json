Their work includes a survey of 500 West Michigan residents about their health insurance coverage, and a survey of 200 Michigan firms about changes they have made under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt's been nearly six years since President Barack Obama signed the controversial federal legislation, often called Obamacare, into law, that was intended to reduce the escalating medical costs by requiring Americans to have some form of private or public health care coverage.\n\nRELATED: Michigan Representatives votes to repeal Obamacare\n\nThe proportion of the West Michigan population with no health insurance was significantly lower in 2014 than in 2013, as was the percentage of respondents who report having no personal health care provider, according to the report.\n\nThe influx of new patients who have come with the ACA's mandated health care exchanges and Medicaid expansion have been able to find primary care providers.\n\nThe majority of 500 West Michigan residents surveyed over the summer by GVSU researchers say that getting access to a primary care physician has either stayed the same, or become easier.\n\nMedicaid patients, who traditionally have the most difficultly finding doctors who will see them because their government insurance plan pays at a lower rate than private insurance, are among that group successfully finding doctors.\n\nOne reason there isn't a primary doctor shortage in Kent County is because more doctors are part of group practices, which are more cost-effective, so they can afford to take on Medicaid patients, Callison said.\n\nHe added these medical practices are employing more mid-level practitioners such as Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioners to see patients for routine appointments, which lowers their operational costs.\n\nFears that firms would opt to pay the penalty rather than providing coverage, hasn't happened either.\n\n\"What we think is that health insurance for so long has been used to attract the most productive employees to firms,\" said Muller. \"If you don't have a good health care package, you'll have hard time getting the best workers.\"\n\nThe GVSU report is being released as part of the Grand Rapids area university's seventh annual West Michigan Health Care Economic Forecast that identifies significant health-related trends and issues for the West Michigan region.\n\nThe research was expected to presented Friday by GVSU's Seidman College of Business faculty members, and to include a panel discussion by area health care experts about industry trends.\n\nJean Nagelkerk, GVSU vice provost for Health, said the event and report are intended to inform health care policy and community decisions about the types of health care professionals, services and delivery systems that could best serve the area.\n\n\"West Michigan's health care organizations, businesses, governmental agencies, foundations, and educational institutions share collective responsibility to improve the health, safety and vitality of our region,\" Nagelkerk said. \"Perseverance toward integrated, cost-effective, safe, quality healthcare across the lifespan is essential.\"\n\nThe report also includes the analysis of data provided by the state's biggest health insurers: Priority Health, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Blue Care Network.\n\nThe report attributed the rising cost of care to an aging and overweight population.\n\nThe number of people in the 45 and over range continues continues to outpace the 20 to 34 demographic. In general, those in the 65 and over demographic tend to use the most health care resources, resulting in the highest cost.\n\nHealth care costs related to binge drinking and smoking are on the decline, while treatments for diseases related to obesity is on the rise. Two out of every three people in West Michigan are overweight or obese.\n\nThat unhealthy condition is often an underlying condition of six chronic diseases: asthma, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidaemia (high cholesterol) and low back pain.\n\nThe cost of treating the six diseases is rising, although diabetes treatment leads the pack because more people have the disease that affects the way a body processes sugar.\n\nResearchers' access to private insurers' data allowed them to break down cost rates by regions and even ZIP codes, which revealed how costs vary dramatically depending on geography.\n\nTreating coronary heart disease in rural communities in Newaygo and southern Allegan and Van Buren counties costs nearly double that of Kent County.\n\nCallison isn't sure whether that is a reflection of more treatments or higher price per treatment. But physician discretion appears to be a factor. There are a number of ways to treat coronary heart disease, and some are more expensive than others, he said.\n\nInsurance companies are trying to lower their costs by motivating people to adopt healthy habits - from eating better to exercising more -- to prevent these diseases.Their methods including using high-deductible health plans, price tools and price transparency to people tie their health to their pocketbooks.\n\nThe goal is to encourage patients to behave more like consumers, Callison said.\n\nRELATED:\n\n\u2022 Affordable Care Act penalties, premiums on the rise for 2016\n\n\u2022 'Obamacare' marketplace rates to rise an average of 6.5 percent in Michigan next year\n\n\u2022 Michigan health centers receive $18M under Affordable Care Act\n\nShandra Martinez covers business for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.
