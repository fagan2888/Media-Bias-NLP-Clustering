It hasn\u2019t been reflected in national legislation, of course. With Congress in the hands of flat-earthers, the federal minimum wage is still stuck at less than half that\u2014$7.25, the level it reached in 2009, as a result of legislation passed in 2007.\n\nBut what first registered as a surprising anomaly\u2014a one-day strike in New York City involving just over 100 workers on Black Friday, Nov. 29, 2012\u2014has come to serve as a focal point for articulating demands for a dignified living wage, not just for fast-food workers, but for everyone who works for a living. What began as a movement of those holding \u201cMcJobs\u201d is now brimming over with new participants making the point that virtually all jobs nowadays are, or at least can be, McJobs\u2014even the latest to join in with demonstrations held on April 15: adjunct college professors.\n\nThe build-up to this point has been remarkably swift, even as the rest of the political system seems paralyzed. After a brief lull to lay further groundwork, NYC fast-food workers held a second strike on April 4, 2013, the anniversary of Martin Luther King\u2019s assassination, while supporting the Memphis Sanitation Workers\u2019 Strike. Covering the strike for Salon, Josh Eidelson made a number of key points. First, that far from being peripheral, fast food jobs represent a de facto employment paradigm for today\u2019s America:\n\nFast food is becoming an ever-larger and more representative sector of the U.S. economy. \u201cWe should think of these jobs as the norm,\u201d said Columbia University political scientist Dorian Warren, \u201cbecause even when you look at the high-skilled, high-paying jobs, they\u2019re even adopting the low-wage model\u201d of management. That means erratic schedules, paltry benefits, and \u2013 so far \u2013 almost no unions. \u201cThese are the quintessential example of the kinds of jobs that we have now,\u201d said Warren, \u201cand of the kind of job that we can expect in the future for the next few decades.\u201d\n\nEidelson also discussed how the changing nature of work required changing labor strategies as well, and gave a hint of what was to come in the way of further actions:\n\nA parallel effort is underway in Chicago, where workers are also demanding $15 an hour and unionization without intimidation, but so far haven\u2019t gone on strike. While New York\u2019s and Chicago\u2019s are the only ones to go public so far, similar organizing efforts are underway elsewhere as well.\n\nFinally, he quoted a prescient message of support from then-mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio,\u201cFast Food Forward is fighting for solutions for working people right here and now, and it deserves the support of all New Yorkers.\u201d\n\nFrom there, movement spread rapidly through a series of widening one-day strikes in 2013\u2014Chicago on April 23, then St. Louis on May 8, followed swiftly by Detroit on May 10, then Milwaukee on May 15, and Seattle on May 30, culminating in a seven-city strike on July 29, after which organizers gave Salon a heads-up on the massive expansion to come, which was quickly fulfilled by a 58-city strike on Aug. 29, and has continued spreading ever since. It\u2019s certainly no accident that a growing list of cities have either approved or are considering local minimum wage laws at or even beyond the $15 level. The idea of what a minimum wage can and should be has been radically transformed in a remarkably short period of time.\n\nThere are, of course, counter-arguments. But in a way, that\u2019s the point: The \u201cFight for 15\u201d has set the agenda, put forth the argument for others to respond to. One such response has been to renew old attacks on the very idea of a minimum wage. The minimum wage is for losers, the argument goes. It\u2019s intended for teenagers just getting their start in the job market, but anyone who\u2019s been working a year or two and is still making minimum wage is only getting what they deserve.\n\nThere are plenty of counter-arguments to this line of thinking, and anyone seriously tempted by it should definitely read \u201cNo Shame in My Game: The Working Poor in the Inner City,\u201d Harvard anthropologist Katherine Newman\u2019s intensive study of young fast-food workers (my review here). But perhaps the simplest, most powerful counter-argument is the mere presence of a new contingent in the most recent wave of \u201cFight for 15\u201d strikes\u2014adjunct college professors. If you really think people are stuck in low-wage jobs because something is wrong with them\u2014not the economic system\u2014then how do you explain this latest addition to the fight for a humane living wage?\n\nThese aren\u2019t just college-educated workers we\u2019re talking about, they\u2019re college professors, yet many of them live just as precariously as fast-food workers do. An online survey by House Democrats last year (more on this below) found that 55 percent of responding adjuncts had PhDs, another 7 percent were PhD candidates and 35% had masters degrees. Yet, many are on some form of public assistance\u2014earned income tax credits, food stamps, etc. Some are even homeless. \u201cIn short,\u201d the report stated, \u201cadjuncts and other contingent faculty likely make up the most highly educated and experienced workers on food stamps and other public assistance in the country.\u201d\n\nSEIU, the same union that\u2019s been the major backer of the fast-food strikes, has also been involved in faculty organizing as well. It has launched the Faculty Forward campaign with a three-part platform:\n\nDemand $15,000 per course in total compensation;\n\nTarget bad actors in for-profit higher education;\n\nMake quality higher education affordable and accessible for all students.\n\nThe call for $15,000 per course may seem a long way from $15/hour\u2014and it is. But adjunct professors generally carry massive amounts of student debt, and have invested years, even decades, developing the skills they\u2019re being paid a pittance for. Add to that the rates of poverty and economic hardship they endure, and you begin to see much more in common than what divides these workers from each other.\n\nAdjuncts are officially, but usually not really, \u201cpart-time\u201d instructors, paid by the class, but not for the full range of work that entails, nor do they usually get office space, staff support or other work necessities. In her doctoral dissertation, Donna Mae Bergmann explained, \u201cMost of the faculty classified as part-time actually teach a full load. A college may limit the number of courses an adjunct can teach, but they often teach at multiple colleges.\u201d This often adds long, costly commutes to the unpaid burdens they bear.\n\nAdjunct faculty have long been a part of college life\u2014just not such a dominant part. As Bergmann explains, \u201cThe movement to employ adjunct faculty began in the 1960\u2019s on community college campuses. The demand for evening classes was so great that administrators had to find a quick and viable solution, and they hired from the professional community.\u201d At the same time, there was a significant growth in the use of graduate students to teach course sections at large universities. As a result, by 1975/76, 45.6 percent of faculty was either tenured or tenure-track, compared to 55.4 percent classified as \u201ccontingent\u201d\u2014full-time non-tenure-track or part-time faculty or graduate student employees. By 2011, the most recent figures available, the percentage of tenured or tenure-track instructors had fallen almost by half to 23.6 percent, compared to 76.4 percent contingent.\n\nThe story, in short, is one of decades-long erosion of secure employment, essentially the exact same story affecting workers in traditional core industries like manufacturing, as well as those in the growing service sector\u2014such as fast-food workers. What\u2019s key is that the stories are virtually identical, regardless of the work being done. What\u2019s shared is the context, not the content\u2014the economic system, the cultural values and power relations, which combine to make it seem \u201conly natural\u201d that individual workers shoulder the blame for an ever more dysfunctional system. Adjunct professors have been grumbling about their lot for decades, and for decades it\u2019s been getting worse. But now that they\u2019re joining into a broader living-wage movement, their attitudes and expectations are starting to change, even as their involvement promises to help change the broader movement.\n\nAs one article in the Chronicle of Higher Education put it:\n\nThe plight of adjuncting in the U.S. has been well documented within the claustrophobic, hermetically sealed circles of academe, but the public at large is mostly unaware of it. Part of the reason is that the rest of middle-class America is mired in its own deep economic struggles, which virtually consume their every waking moment, and the perception still persists that academics, including adjuncts, have a cushy work life. Until the rest of America learns of the dirty large secret of adjuncting, its deplorable conditions will continue.\n\nNow, it seems, that all may be starting to change.\n\nIn its story about adjuncts involved in the strike, the Chicago Tribune focused attention on Wanda Evans-Brewer, who has PhD in education and \u201cearned so little last year as an adjunct professor at Concordia University in River Forest \u2014 $27,000 \u2014 that she qualified for food stamps,\u201d specifically, \u201c$390 a month in food stamps for her and her three children,\u201d as well as \u201ca $40-a-month Medicaid family plan and subsidized day care for her 4-year-old daughter.\u201d It was not the sort of life she had planned: \u201cIn my wildest dreams, I would never think I would be a Ph.D. On welfare,\u201d she told the Tribune.\n\nThey also cited Matt Hoffmann, currently teaching one class at Loyola University Chicago and another at the Illinois Institute of Technology. His position is precarious, at best:\n\nHoffmann calculates he works about 30 hours a week, which translates to a pay of about $21 per hour. For that pay he said he invested eight years completing a master\u2019s degree in environmental studies and a doctorate in sociology. He has about $10,000 in credit card debt and receives an average of $200 to $300 a month from his parents to help him and his wife make ends meet and support their 16-month-old son. \u201cI\u2019m 35 years old and still need some support from my parents,\u201d Hoffmann said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adjunct professors are joining the fight for a living wage -- and show us all education isn't a guarantee of a job", "title": "They turned college into McDonald\u2019s: Adjunct professors, fast-food wages and how colleges screw more than just students", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Adjunct professors are joining the fight for a living wage -- and show us all education isn't a guarantee of a job", "title": "They turned college into McDonald\u2019s: Adjunct professors, fast-food wages and how colleges screw more than just students", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/02/they_turned_college_into_mcdonalds_adjunct_professors_fast_food_wages_and_how_colleges_screw_more_than_just_students/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/FastTimes_048Pyxurz-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Adjunct professors are joining the fight for a living wage -- and show us all education isn't a guarantee of a job", "title": "They turned college into McDonald\u2019s: Adjunct professors, fast-food wages and how colleges screw more than just students", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/FastTimes_048Pyxurz-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@PaulHRosenberg", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Rosenberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Adjunct Professors, College, Editor's Picks, fight for 15, Income inequality, Minimum wage", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ae0\"", "article_summary": "The idea of what a minimum wage can and should be has been radically transformed in a remarkably short period of time.\nAs Bergmann explains, \u201cThe movement to employ adjunct faculty began in the 1960\u2019s on community college campuses.\nOne such response has been to renew old attacks on the very idea of a minimum wage.\nTopics: Adjunct Professors, College, Editor's Picks, fight for 15, Income inequality, Minimum wage, Business News, NewsThe fight to raise the minimum wage to $15 has already had an enormous impact on American politics.\nAdjunct faculty have long been a part of college life\u2014just not such a dominant part."}
