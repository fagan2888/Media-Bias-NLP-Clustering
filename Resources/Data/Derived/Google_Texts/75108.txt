Small business owners are flocking to Capitol Hill this week to press lawmakers for regulatory relief and changes to ObamaCare.

The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) is organizing a fly-in lobbying day on Thursday, where 150 small businesses owners will meet with senators and congressmen.

Regulatory relief is one of the top issues they’ll be pushing. The NFIB is backing the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act, which passed the House in February.

The NFIB is hoping to generate “momentum for legislative action” in the Senate.

The small business owners are also pressing for a change to a controversial provision in ObamaCare. They should be allowed to reimburse employees for purchasing individual policies, the NFIB said.

They’re also looking to double down on an IRS tax exemption that allows small businesses to expense $500,000 from a major capital investment.
