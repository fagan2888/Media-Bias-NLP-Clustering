The Canberra Gunners let slip a golden opportunity to revive their South-East Australian Basketball League finals hopes after a late fadeout cost them dearly in an 81-77 home loss to Hobart on Saturday.

The Gunners led by seven points heading into the final term, but a 26-15 fourth quarter from the visitors proved crucial.

A win would have placed them just one win behind fourth-placed Hobart in the south conference, but they are instead now three wins outside the top four.

The Gunners ran out of steam in their second leg of back-to-back matches after a 111-98 victory over Basketball Australia Centre of Excellence on Friday.

In the women's division the Canberra Capitals Academy is yet to register a win this season after succumbing 78-56 to the Centre of Excellence, and 71-56 to Hobart.

Caitlin Rowe had a strong game against Hobart with 18 points and eight assists. Canberra heads back on the road against Ballarat this Saturday.
