(Choose from male, female. trans male/trans man, trans female/trans woman, genderqueer/gender non-conforming, or different identity)\n\nWhat sex were you assigned at birth, such as on an original birth certificate? (Male or female)\n\nDo you consider yourself to be heterosexual or straight, gay or lesbian, bisexual, or not listed above (Please specify)\n\n\u201cThe measures grew out of the 2014 recommendations from the UC Task Force and Implementation Team on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Climate and Inclusion,\u201d the University stated.\n\nThe University is pushing to have the most progressive LGBT agenda in the nation. UC President Janet Napolitano put together a 15-member advisory council in June 2014 made up of students, faculty, staff, and \u201ccommunity experts on LGBT issues.\u201d\n\nAdditional measures to be instituted include increasing gender-neutral bathrooms and changing rooms, instituting a two-year project proselytizing gender and sexuality studies, and asserting LGBT ideology on students.\n\nCurrently officials say the new questions will not provide preferential admission for sexual or gender classification. However, advisory council member Pamela Brown, vice president of institutional research, said the advisory council actions are related to the 2011 Equality and Equal Access in Higher Education law, according to the Chronicle. The law is billed as improving the quality of LGBT student life and collecting sexual and gender information on staff and students.\n\nUC San Francisco announced plans in June to study LGBTQ health. \u201cSmall-scale studies have hinted that LGBTQ community members are more susceptible to conditions such as depression and anxiety, and are at higher risk of suicide.\u201d This study is planned to provide population-wide data.\n\nThe moves come in the midst of the narrow 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court decision mandating all 50 states issue homosexual marriage licenses. Breitbart News reported that, in the wake of the decision, an Oregon judge ordered two Christian bakery owners silenced from voicing their opinions on same-sex marriage.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "The University of California wants to to take a peek into your bedroom while you apply for admission to college, with new gender identity and sexual orientation questions on their undergraduate application, as just a part of the university's progressive LGBT agenda.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The University of California wants to to take a peek into your bedroom while you apply for admission to college, with new gender identity and sexual orientation questions on their undergraduate application, as just a part of the university's progressive LGBT agenda.", "title": "Sex and Gender Choices On Your College App \u2013 UC Says Yes We Will - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/University-of-Cal-Jeff-Chiu-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/07/04/sex-and-gender-choices-on-your-college-app-uc-says-yes-we-will/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The University of California wants to to take a peek into your bedroom while you apply for admission to college, with new gender identity and sexual orientation questions on their undergraduate application, as just a part of the university's progressive LGBT agenda.", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/University-of-Cal-Jeff-Chiu-AP.jpg", "title": "Sex and Gender Choices On Your College App \u2013 UC Says Yes We Will - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "gender, gender identity, lgbt, lgbtq, sex, sexual orientation, UC, University of California,Breitbart California, Education, Faith,LGBT", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-07-04T18:41:36-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "University of California", "categories": "Breitbart California,Education,Faith"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3563\"", "article_summary": "However, advisory council member Pamela Brown, vice president of institutional research, said the advisory council actions are related to the 2011 Equality and Equal Access in Higher Education law, according to the Chronicle.\nData from the voluntary responses to three questions will be used in \u201callocating resources\u201d and \u201cdeveloping programs\u201d regarding lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) students, faculty, and staff.\nThe law is billed as improving the quality of LGBT student life and collecting sexual and gender information on staff and students.\nCurrently officials say the new questions will not provide preferential admission for sexual or gender classification.\n(Male or female)Do you consider yourself to be heterosexual or straight, gay or lesbian, bisexual, or not listed above (Please specify)\u201cThe measures grew out of the 2014 recommendations from the UC Task Force and Implementation Team on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Climate and Inclusion,\u201d the University stated."}
