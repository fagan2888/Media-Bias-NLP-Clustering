In some instances the dollar amount an individual or family would pay in penalties will more than triple what the fee (penalty) was in 2014.\n\nPart of the Affordable Care Act says that you must obtain and maintain minimum essential health insurance coverage throughout the year or pay a fee (tax penalty).\n\nThe fee for not having health coverage is calculated one of 2 ways. You\u2019ll pay either a percentage of your household income or a flat fee \u2014 whichever is higher.\n\nSo, if you don\u2019t have coverage in 2015, you\u2019ll pay the higher of these two amounts:\n\n\u20222% of your yearly household income. The maximum penalty is the national average premium for a bronze plan.\n\nOR\n\n\u2022$325 per person for the year ($162.50 per child under 18). The maximum penalty per family using this method is $975.\n\nThere is a great free calculator on InsuranceQuotes.com that can help you see how much of a financial penalty you\u2019ll face if you go without health insurance in 2015. Here is a link:\n\nhttp://www.insurancequotes.com/health/obamacare-penalty-calculator\n\nIf you do decide to go without insurance, the fee (penalty) will be deducted from monies you get back as part of any federal tax refund. So if you don\u2019t get insurance in 2015, they\u2019ll go after the refund that your due in early 2016.\n\nPlease note, as with any law, there are some groups that expempt from having to obtain insurance. That includes: members of certain religious groups and Native American tribes; undocumented immigrants (who are not eligible for health insurance subsidies under the law); incarcerated individuals; people whose incomes are so low they don\u2019t have to file taxes (currently $9,500 for individuals and $19,000 for married couples); and people for whom health insurance is considered unaffordable (where insurance premiums after employer contributions or federal subsidies exceed limits of family income); and those going without insurance for less than three months in a row.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "affordable care act, fine, health insurance, jim donovan, obamacare, penalty", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/11/18/penalties-rise-if-you-dont-have-health-insurance-in-2015/", "image": {"width": 1280, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/insurance.png?w=1280", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/insurance.png?w=1280", "height": 1000}, "type": "article", "title": "Penalties Rise If You Don't Have Health Insurance In 2015"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/insurance.png?w=1280", "site": "CBSphilly", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Penalties Rise If You Don't Have Health Insurance In 2015"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "consumer news, affordable care act, fine, health insurance, jim donovan, obamacare, penalty", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca426\"", "article_summary": "By Jim Donovan: We\u2019re just days into open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) and while people begin reviewing their health insurance coverage options I wanted to be sure that everyone was aware that the penalties for failing to have health insurance are changing too.\nThere is a great free calculator on InsuranceQuotes.com that can help you see how much of a financial penalty you\u2019ll face if you go without health insurance in 2015.\nSo, if you don\u2019t have coverage in 2015, you\u2019ll pay the higher of these two amounts:\u20222% of your yearly household income.\nSo if you don\u2019t get insurance in 2015, they\u2019ll go after the refund that your due in early 2016.\nPart of the Affordable Care Act says that you must obtain and maintain minimum essential health insurance coverage throughout the year or pay a fee (tax penalty)."}
