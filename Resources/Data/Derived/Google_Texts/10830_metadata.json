Gov. Kathy Hochul in January announces a state task force to support the Rochester-Monroe Anti-Poverty Initiative. (Photo: Patti Singer/PattiSingerRoc)\n\nTalking about how Rochester will take on the poverty that lands it on lists no city wants to be on, Assembly Majority Leader Joseph Morelle thought of another seemingly impossible challenge.\n\n\u201cI feel like (President John) Kennedy announcing we\u2019re going to the moon,\u201d Morelle said. \u201cAnd they didn\u2019t have anything built.\u201d\n\nThe community got its blueprint Sunday when Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul came to the Monroe Campus of the Hillside Family of Agencies to announce the Rochester Anti-Poverty Task Force. The plan, part of Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s 2015 Opportunity Agenda, brings together city and county government, business, nonprofits, service organizations and academia to coordinate services and evaluate what they\u2019re doing based on changes in the lives of the people they are trying to help.\n\nRochester Mayor Lovely Warren and Morelle talked about the need for a coordinated effort.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental shift in how this community addresses poverty,\u201d said Morelle.\n\nThe task force is one of several aspects of the governor\u2019s economic opportunity agenda, which he\u2019s been rolling out ahead of Wednesday\u2019s State of the State address and release of the budget.\n\nThe Rochester initiative builds off a 10-point statewide plan Cuomo also announced Sunday to combat poverty and inequality. That broader initiative includes measures to increase the minimum wage to $10.50 per hour, double funding for urban youth jobs programs, invest in affordable housing, add to services for the homeless, boost funding for anti-hunger programs and increase opportunities for minority- and women-owned businesses.\n\nAs with the rest of the governor\u2019s agenda, it will go before the legislature and likely be subject to budget battles.\n\nBut the task force is no pie-in-the-sky dream, Morelle said: \u201cThis is real.\u201d\n\nMorelle said he didn\u2019t know how much it would cost to fix the ills that gives Rochester, compared to similarly sized cities, among the highest amounts of people living in poverty, the highest concentrations of poverty and the highest number of children in poverty, according to data from the Rochester Area Community Foundation and others.\n\nHe said smarter spending, not necessarily more money, could buy better results. The task force will focus on housing, health and nutrition, education, workforce training and jobs, and safe neighborhoods.\n\nThe task force has been in the works for months, since Cuomo told some community leaders to \u201cthink bigger\u201d about ways to eradicate the poverty that has plagued certain areas of the city.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t ready to go public until Hochul made the official introduction of the task force.\n\n\u201cPoverty is everyone\u2019s problem,\u201d she said to approximately 150 representatives of the agencies that used to pretty much operate on their own and now are figuring out how to work together to solve it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re connecting the dots,\u201d said Jaime Saunders, chief executive officer of Alternatives for Battered Women. \u201cWe can\u2019t be in our own sandbox and make impactful change. The dialogue is focusing on one agenda.\u201d\n\nThe problem has persisted for years \u2014 Warren said it was generational. That so many people turned out after getting an email of the event the night before was testimony to the urgency.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t stay the course,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cWe\u2019re responding to a crisis. We\u2019re in a crisis ... The fact that the lieutenant governor is here is a game-changer.\u201d\n\nAs the agenda develops, it will be about making individuals a partner in the process of ending poverty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about a handout but a hand up,\u201d Warren told the group. \u201cIt\u2019s not about how we can help you, but how we can help you help yourself.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1IZug1B", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Lt.
