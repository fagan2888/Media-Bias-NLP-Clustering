Yes, I am the Kiss of Death, and yes, I am about to prognosticate on the Ashes, after just a day-and-a-half of play, but I just can't help myself. I REALLY think Australia can win this first Test of the Ashes!\n\nCalm down, I said! And put back those lifeboats, would you!? STOP sending up rocket flares! And will you turn off those damn sirens? I am serious. And I think there is ample evidence for it. I don't just mean that despite the fact that our top order had the usual collapse, our tail wagged strongly enough to get us up to 295 in the first innings. And I don't just mean because our bowling was so strong on day two, that England lost 6-9 in 10 overs.\n\nI mean because Australia at last has the missing ingredient that it has long been looking for. A handle-bar moustache! Mitchell Johnson's is an absolute beauty, and from the moment it has come in to play, with both bat and ball, our blokes have had the swagger of old. Johnson has batted like Ian Chappell, bowled like Dennis Lillee and toiled like Merv Hughes. The machismo is back, the swagger is there once more, the complete CONTEMPT for all things English in whites once more bubbling to the surface.\n\nAnd yes, yes, I know that Johnson has only grown it for \"Movember,\" but he must be prevailed upon to keep it. It has changed everything, and not only does the Australian team now look like an Australian team once more, it is starting to play like one!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn short \u2026 no prisoners, no mercy. If you blokes in the baggy green could arrange for the complete humiliation of this English side, we would all be much obliged. Let England play with the razors, but keep Johnson well away from them.\n\nPOOR DEFENCE\n\nCome off it, Greg Harris, president of the Rugby Union Players' Association. Of course you feel the need to defend the 15 Wallabies suspended and reprimanded for going out on Dublin Town just three days before a Test match. But that defence still has to stay in the real world! \"I can't see any logic or reasoning behind it,\" you said. \"This makes no sense to me. The industry is hemorrhaging money and you go out and do something like this that not only destroys, damages the reputation of the players involved but also the brand of your moneymaker, the Wallabies.\" This would make sense if you were talking about the Wallabies themselves, but instead you were talking about Ewen McKenzie, who insisted on basic discipline, or face the consequences? \"I have spoken to a number of the players,\" you went on, \"and they are adamant there was no provisions about how much they could drink, and there wasn't a curfew. It is hard to hand down penalties when there have not been any guidelines set in the first place.\" Really, Greg? Leaving aside McKenzie's insistence that he had already laid down the law in the clearest of terms, do professional athletes representing their country really need to be told to be back at the hotel sober on a Wednesday morning before a Saturday Test match? Isn't that bleeding obvious? If you heard that members of the Australian cricket team doing battle in the first Ashes Test, starting on Thursday, had been out until the wee hours of Monday morning, and one of them was so pissed he had to be helped to bed, you really think that would be OK, too? Or would you think those blokes just don't have the first clue about the privilege they have been accorded, or the professionalism expected of them? This has nothing to do with the booze - personally, I suspect I have spilt more than they have drunk over the years - and everything to do with the timing. Three freaking days before a Test match! In short, your response is what we call in the trade a \"Shirley,\" as in, \"Shirley, you cannot be serious!\"\n\nBLONDE MOMENT\n\nBe werry, werry quiet. I'm hunting wabbits. Or Englishmen, to be more precise. A concurrence between my Ned Kelly book promo tour and the Ashes, saw me staying in the same Brisbane hotel as the England cricket team this week. Generally, allow me to say, they seem like a likeable, down-to-earth bunch, who look nothing if not confident. As to Kevin Pietersen claiming to be bored with Brisbane, he didn't look too bored on Tuesday morning, chatting to a woman in the foyer, let me tell you that for nothing. (\"She was a blonde,\" to quote Raymond Chandler. \"A blonde for a bishop to kick a hole in a stained-glass window for.\")\n\nRUNNING MATES\n\nOne last thing on Albie Thomas, who died three weeks ago, before we leave it. For I am advised by reader John Hudson, that Harry Gordon's book, titled Young Men in a Hurry - The story of Australia's fastest decade, includes a whole chapter on the extraordinary mile race in Dublin in 1958, whereby the first four runners broke the world record, and Albie, as pacemaker, also ran sub-four minutes. The winner Herb Elliott, broke the previous world record by nearly THREE seconds, followed by Australian Merv Lincoln, then the Irishman, Ron Delany, while fourth was the Kiwi Murray Halberg, who stated: \"To think I ran a mile in 3.57.5, broke the world record, and came fourth!\" But to the loveliest part of all, the final paragraph of the chapter: \"Elliott recognised his debt to Thomas, and he settled it in the way only great athletes can. Next night he arranged to be the bunny, and he ran himself almost into the ground setting a pace for Thomas over the first six laps of a two-miler [eight laps].\" Albie broke the world record, and his first words after the race were: \"Gee, thanks Herb.\" I know. Stunning. Individual Australian athletes helping each other, not just in it for themselves!\n\nSTATS GOLD\n\nMeanwhile, well-known cricket nutter Kersi Meher-Homji points out an interesting fact re the rival Ashes captains Michael Clarke and Alastair Cook. Going into the first Test, both have played 97 Tests each. Their statistics are similar; Clarke scoring 7656 runs at 52.08 with 24 centuries and Cook 7801 runs at 47.85 with 25 centuries. Barring injuries, both will play their 100th Test at Perth next month. This will be the first instance of rival captains playing their 100th Test together. Between them they have so far accumulated 15,457 runs at 49.86 with 49 centuries in 194 Tests. Their combined stats are similar to Sachin Tendulkar's. In 200 Tests the Indian maestro amassed 15,921 runs at 53.78, hitting 51 centuries. (You're right. We TRUE cricket nutters, never saw a stat we didn't like!)\n\nTeam of the week\n\nKangaroos. Will have a World Cup semi-final against Fiji in the wee hours of tomorrow morning. (Can I break the news, even though it is in the future? Australia won.)\n\nRugby League World Cup. Seriously folks, is it me, or does this whole tournament seem to have been going on for an extraordinary long time? Wouldn't it have been easier to just get the Kangaroos to phone in their games for the first five rounds, and now join the rest of them at the semi-finals?\n\nAlistair Murdoch. The one-time Wallabies winger was this week crowned the World Drug-Free Powerlifting Federation champion for the third year in a row. He's now 46, and living in London. On ya, Alistair.\n\nJarrod Lyle. Completed all four rounds at Royal Melbourne for the Australian Masters, in his comeback event after 20 months off the pro circuit fighting leukaemia for the second time.\n\nThe Irish rugby crowd. Were wonderfully silent, even as Wallabies five-eighth Quade Cooper was lining up penalty goals and conversion kicks. Basic courtesy and decency. Perhaps we could try that next year?\n\nSid Wolifson. The 92-year-old won the scratch event at Concord for the first time in 28 years.\n\nSebastian Vettel. Has won the past eight races.\n\nMark Webber. Hangs up his formula one keys after the Brazilian Grand Prix.\n\nOrange Public School. Their first XI has just qualified for the final four in the state cricket knockout event in a fortnight, and nine of the players will then turn around and represent in the final four of the state softball two days later. The girls also made the final eight in netball. Bravo.\n\nMarjorie Jackson. The 82-year-old joins Betty Cuthbert as the only Australians in the International Association of Athletics Federations' Hall of Fame. To be eligible, an athlete must have won at least two world or Olympic titles and set a world record.\n\nAdam Scott. He now has the Australian Masters-US Masters double.\n\nWHAT THEY SAID\n\nClive Palmer, of the Palmer United Party, on the independence of his senators: ''Can you imagine me smacking Glenn Lazarus on the bottom?'' Sadly, I now can, though I wish it were not so. Just a moment. LA-LA-LA-LA-LA! Nup. The image is still there \u2026\n\nThe great Gideon Haigh in The Australian on Thursday: ''Yet at the Gabba this morning, cricket will allow a considerable advantage to accrete on the basis of quaint archaism that should now be called the Two-sided Preparatory Luck Apportionator, but which we know as 'the toss'.'' He was being ironic! I think.\n\nFormer Australian cricket coach Mickey Arthur on why he dropped Brad Haddin: ''Brad \u2026 was left out for a young guy like Matthew Wade to come in for us to build a brand that was going to be sustainable over a period of time, because at [age] 35 the brand wasn't going to be sustainable with Brad Haddin keeping wicket.'' Was he the coach or a freaking marketing executive!?\n\nCoach Ewen McKenzie, announcing the punishment of 15 Wallabies for hitting the booze: ''The worst thing you could do for the Qantas Wallabies in the long term is do nothing, because that would mean we would be ignoring poor culture and a significant performance issue.'' The ''Qantas'' Wallabies? Really, Ewen?\n\nWallaby Tatafu Polota-Nau on putting his hand up: ''Ewen and I had a good chat, and he was definitely keen to see if I could put my hand up for spring tour selection.'' And Tatafu did, but it turns out, he was calling for a beer!\n\nThe Daily Tele's Phil Rothfield, with a surprising admission: ''INTERNATIONAL sport is Australia v England in the Ashes at the Gabba, Wimbledon, a golf major, world championship athletics and swimming, a Bledisloe Cup, boxing in Las Vegas or the Tour de France. Some sports are not meant for the international stage - and the Rugby League World Cup is one of them \u2026 Seriously, no one cares.'' More, Phil, MORE!\n\nRothfield again: ''Outside of Australia, New Zealand and England, it's a tournament of manufactured teams filled with NRL players, many of whom have never even visited the countries they are representing.''\n\nChannel Seven's Sandy Roberts commentating on the gripping closing stages of the Australian Masters golf with Matt Kuchar playing his fourth out of the greenside bunker on the 18th trying to hang on to the lead with Adam Scott. ''Will he be trying to get this in the hole?'' Pick me, Sandy, pick ME! Is the correct answer, ''You bloody betcha!''?\n\nChannel Seven commentator as Adam Scott strode triumphantly towards the 18th green, for the final hole of his Masters victory: ''He is receiving a standing ovation \u2026''\n\nNigerian soccer player Vincent Enyeama: ''I wouldn't be surprised if Nigeria win the World Cup one day \u2026 I believe in God, I believe in the Bible, which says He chooses who He chooses. What if [God] chooses Nigeria?'' Give God a break, Vincent. He's trying to sort out Badds' putting game and Izzy's football career.\n\nTwitter - @Peter_Fitz", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "The Fitz Files", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "OH CALM down.
