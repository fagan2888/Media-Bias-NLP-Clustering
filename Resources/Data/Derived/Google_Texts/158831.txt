Following the demolition of Longmont's Twin Peaks Mall, the American Association of University Women Bargain Book Fair is moving to a new location.

If you go What: AAUW Bargain Book Fair When: 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Oct. 17 and 18; 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Oct. 19 Where: St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, 1303 South Bross Lane, Longmont More info: longmont-co.aauw.net

The fundraiser, which supports scholarships for St. Vrain Valley students and projects for the local chapter of the AAUW, will be held at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church Oct. 17 through 19 in Longmont.

More than 10,000 used books will be on sale this year.

Despite the big change in location this year, volunteers continue to support the sale.

In anticipation of this year's sale, we asked some of the chapter's longest running volunteers about their favorite books and some of the rare finds at the annual sales over the years.
