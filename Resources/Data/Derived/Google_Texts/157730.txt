Deutsch Family Purchases Redemption As Wine and Spirits Deals Pop

Acquiring Redemption gives Deutsch an entry into the American whiskey segment

Deutsch Family Wine & Spirits, originally known as W.J. Deutsch & Sons, Ltd., has picked up Redemption Whiskey for an undisclosed price. The deal marks yet another example of investor confidence in the independent wine and spirits industry.

All of Redemption's products are distilled in Indiana and bottled in small batches in Bardstown, Kentucky. The transaction grants Deutsch ownership over each, including Redemption Straight Rye Whiskey, Redemption High Rye Bourbon, Redemption Bourbon, Riverboat Rye, White Whiskey and Limited Edition Barrel Selections.

The brand will be available in limited states over the next two years due to supply constraints. However, once the deal closes, it will eventually be available across the U.S.

Acquiring Redemption gives Deutsch "a high quality entry" into the American whiskey segment of the spirits business, says Peter Deutsch, CEO of the White Plains, New York-based buyer.

Several spirits deals were announced in 2014, including Constellation Brands' (NYSE: STZ, STZ.B) purchase of Casa Noble tequila and Suntory's $16 billion purchase of Beam Inc. to create the worldÂ’s third-largest premium spirits company.
