Two gunmen had been killed, the sources said.\n\nResponsibility for the attack was claimed by Al-Mourabitoun, an offshoot group of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) based in the northern Mali and headed by a veteran al-Qaeda fighter, Mokhtar Belmokhtar.\n\nIn an audio statement broadcast by the Qatari television network Al Jazeera, a spokesperson for the group said: \u201cWe Al-Mourabitoun, with the participation of our brothers from Al-Qaeda in the Islamis Maghreb, claim the hostage-taking operation at the Radisson hotel.\u201d\n\nBelmokhtar was responsible for an attack on the Amenas gas plant in Algeria in 2013 in which 40 people were killed.\n\nUp to 10 gunmen were reported to have taken part in Friday attack, although official reports said there were only two or three.\n\nThe militants stormed the building at about 8am local time. Reports said they had either smashed through a security gate in a car with diplomatic plates, or simply walked into the building.\n\nAutomatic weapons fire could be heard from outside as the militants attacked the 190-room hotel, the AFP agency reported. The hotel operator, Rezidor, said that 170 people \u2013 140 guests and 30 staff \u2013 were in the building at the time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all happening on the seventh floor, jihadists are firing in the corridor,\u201d one unnamed source told AFP early in the attack.\n\nBut within hours, Malian troops surrounded the building and several hostages were either allowed to go free or escaped. Unconfirmed reports stated that the attackers freed those who could recite verses of the Quran.\n\nBy 2pm, Malian troops backed by French forces based in the capital had stormed the building, leading to the escape of 80 hostages. Local television showed images of soldiers in the foyer area of the hotel.\n\nThe US defence department said that US forces based in Mali had rescued six American citizens, while France said it also had troops at the scene.\n\nThe nationalities of those being held hostage included American, Turkish, Chinese and Indian. Air France, the French national carrier, said 12 staff staying at the hotel were safe. Three Turkish Airlines staff were said to have been among those who escaped.\n\nA Belgian local government worker was confirmed dead by his employer.\n\nMali is a former French colony in West Africa. Following a military coup in 2012, al-Qaeda-linked fighters took control of the north of the country, prompting a French-led military intervention in early 2013.\n\nThe militants were scattered from northern towns and cities, though the north remains insecure and armed attacks have extended further south this year.\n\nMilitant groups have continued to wage attacks in Mali despite a June peace deal between former Tuareg rebels in the north of the country and rival pro-government armed groups.\n\nA spokesman for Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, said that Friday\u2019s attack was an attempt to derail peace efforts.\n\n\u201cThe secretary-general deplores any attempt to derail the implementation of the agreement,\u201d said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.\n\nThe shooting at the Radisson follows a nearly 24-hour siege and hostage-taking at another hotel in August in the central Malian town of Sevare in which five UN workers were killed, along with four soldiers and four attackers.\n\nFive people, including a French citizen and a Belgian, were also killed in an attack at a restaurant in Bamako in March in the first such incident in the capital.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Al-Qaeda offshoot claims responsibility for attack by gunmen in Bamako which left at least 27 people dead., Al-Mourabitoun, Al-Qaeda, AQIM, Mali, Radisson,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Middle Eastern Eye", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Al-Qaeda offshoot claims responsibility for attack by gunmen in Bamako which left at least 27 people dead., Al-Mourabitoun, Al-Qaeda, AQIM, Mali, Radisson,", "title": "Mali Forces Storm Hotel Following Attack By Al-Qaeda Offshoot", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/mali-forces-storm-hotel-following-attack-by-al-qaeda-offshoot/211497/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AP_613517584269.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-20T15:55:26-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Al-Qaeda offshoot claims responsibility for attack by gunmen in Bamako which left at least 27 people dead., Al-Mourabitoun, Al-Qaeda, AQIM, Mali, Radisson,", "title": "Mali Forces Storm Hotel Following Attack By Al-Qaeda Offshoot", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/AP_613517584269.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Radisson", "published_time": "2015-11-21T05:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-20T15:55:26-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "official MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorHowever, Malian security sources told the AFP news agency that 27 bodies had been removed from the hotel.\nBy 2pm, Malian troops backed by French forces based in the capital had stormed the building, leading to the escape of 80 hostages.\nBut within hours, Malian troops surrounded the building and several hostages were either allowed to go free or escaped.\nResponsibility for the attack was claimed by Al-Mourabitoun, an offshoot group of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) based in the northern Mali and headed by a veteran al-Qaeda fighter, Mokhtar Belmokhtar.\nIn a news conference, Malian Security Minister Salif Traore said that the gunmen \u201chave no more hostages in their hands and forces are in the process of tracking them down\u201d."}
