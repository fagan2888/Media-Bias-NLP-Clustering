Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group backed by the industrialist Koch brothers, is continuing to campaign against Medicaid expansion under Obamacare in Florida.

The group plans to launch a new television ad timed with the start of the special Florida legislative session, which begins Monday (a longer web version of the spot is below). AFP has also sent fliers to voters to targeting Republicans in the state Senate who back Medicaid expansion.

"The Florida Senate's Medicaid expansion plan is wrong for Florida," AFP state director Chris Hudson said in a statement. "The only thing that is certain is that Florida families who depend on this already bloated program will have an even harder time getting care and, like other states' expansions, it could cost billions more than expected, ultimately forcing legislators to raise taxes or make cuts from other essential services."

Hudson's father is state Rep. Matt Hudson of Naples.

A Healthy Florida Works Coalition, which supports Medicaid expansion as proposed by the Senate, has been airing its own ad in support of those lawmakers.
