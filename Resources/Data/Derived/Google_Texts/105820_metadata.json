Rand Paul\u2019s statement that John McCain met with ISIS terrorists.\n\nObama\u2019s claim that the GOP filibustered 500 pieces of legislation.\n\nRep. Paul Ryan\u2019s story about a little boy who rejected a school lunch because he wanted one in a brown paper bag.\n\nAlison Lundergan Grimes\u2019 accusation that Sen. Mitch McConnell took $600,000 from anti-coal groups.\n\nAn Agenda Project Action Fund ad, which alleged that GOP spending cuts undermined the nation\u2019s ability to combat Ebola.\n\nThe hosts of \u201cThe Five\u201d weighed in on their \u201cPinocchios of the year.\u201d\n\nKimberly Guilfoyle chose the Agenda Project Action ad, listed above, while Eric Bolling\u2019s \u201cPinocchio of the year\u201d was when Hillary Clinton said that she and Bill were \u201cdead broke\u201d when they left the White House.\n\n---\n\nBy Glenn Kessler, The Washington Post\n\nIt\u2019s time for our annual round-up of the biggest Pinocchios of the year.\n\nThe midterm elections, of course, dominated our coverage of false claims, as an avalanche of negative ads tumbled across televisions screens. Some of those ads, which made it onto our list of the worst campaign ads, have the dubious honor of also appearing on this list.\n\nThis year, we are also highlighting the bipartisan failure of politicians in both parties for failing to accurately describe the impact of the Affordable Care Act. Democrats such as President Obama and Republicans such as House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) either inflated or deflated the numbers to a ridiculous extent. (Before anyone asks, Obama\u2019s \u201cif you want to keep your plan\u201d was on last year\u2019s list.)\n\nWhile The Fact Checker generally focuses on domestic politics, this year Russian President Vladimir Putin gets a special international honor (or dishonor) for his speech on Crimea.\n\nAs always, that and other rulings were met with vehement objections from some readers. The Fact Checker thanks the readers who have offered thoughtful rebuttals to our conclusions. In some cases, in light of new information, we adjusted Pinocchio ratings.\n\nIn compiling this list, which has no particular order, we primarily focused on claims that had earned four Pinocchios during the year. We also tried to focus on issues of broad interest, such as terrorism, health care and the size of government. To keep it simple, we have shortened the quotes in the headlines. To read the full column, click on the link embedded in the quote.\n\nPresident Obama repeated a claim, crafted by the White House communications team, that he was not \u201cspecifically\u201d referring to the Islamic State terror group when he dismissed the militants who had taken over Fallujah as a \u201cJV squad.\u201d But The Fact Checker had obtained the previously unreleased transcript of the president\u2019s interview with The New Yorker, and it\u2019s clear that\u2019s who the president was referencing.\n\nREAD THE FULL STORY AT THE WASHINGTON POST", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "12-16-14", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFnZTE=", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dcterms.modified": "12-16-14", "og": {"url": "http://nation.foxnews.com/2014/12/16/liar-liar-biggest-pinocchios-2014", "site_name": "FoxNation.com", "image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/dec16_pinoch.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Liar, Liar ...
