The attack happened in the village of al-Qudeeh in the eastern Qatif region, the heartland of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Shiite Muslim minority. It was the deadliest militant assault in the kingdom in more than a decade.\n\nThe Islamic State group views Shiites as apostates deserving of death and also seeks the overthrow of the Saudi monarchy, which it considers corrupt and illegitimate.
