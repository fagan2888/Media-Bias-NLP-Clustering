She was foundering badly in the race for Iowa\u2019s open Senate seat, the story goes, until she released an ad boasting of her experience castrating hogs. \u201cWashington\u2019s full of big spenders,\u201d Ernst says to the camera, \u201clet\u2019s make \u2018em squeal.\u201d Through bizarre political alchemy and overwhelming metaphorical significance, her personal story of cutting the balls off pigs propelled her to the GOP nomination. Removing testicles from still-living animals became central to her political identity, as reflected in headlines like this one from ABC News: \u201cHog-Castrating, Harley Davidson-Riding Joni Ernst Wins Iowa Senate Primary.\u201d\n\nNow she\u2019s leading Democrat Bruce Braley in a race for a seat vacated by a Democrat in a state that voted twice for Barack Obama. And that\u2019s fairly impressive when you consider that there\u2019s a large and growing body of evidence that Joni Ernst is an around-the-bend extremist.\n\nLet\u2019s back up a moment and head back to July, when the Daily Beast published an \u201cexclusive\u201d video of Ernst at a 2013 political forum in which she appeared to endorse the theory of nullification, which argues that states can pass laws saying that federal laws don\u2019t apply to them. It\u2019s a theory that was pretty popular with antebellum slaveholders and Jim Crow segregationists, which should be enough of a pedigree to keep any reasonable person away. Conservatives were quick to point out, though, that Ernst\u2019s wording was ambiguous and didn\u2019t really rise to the level of embracing nullification. The Ernst campaign, for its part, issued an unequivocal denial: \u201cJoni has not and does not endorse or support nullification.\u201d\n\nWell, turns out that\u2019s not quite the case. TPM\u2019s Daniel Strauss dug up a candidate questionnaire Ernst filled out in 2012 in which she indicated that she would support \u201clegislation to nullify ObamaCare and authorize state and local law enforcement to arrest federal officials attempting to implement\u201d the healthcare reform law.\n\nSet aside for a moment the endorsement of nullification, which the Ernst campaign said she\u2019d never done. Let\u2019s focus on the part about arresting government employees, which is more than a little disturbing.\n\nJailing bureaucrats for doing nothing more than implementing laws you don\u2019t like is the sort of thing that\u2019s typically reserved for coups and armed insurrections. As such, the federal government tends to frown upon such behavior. It has been, however, a distressingly common phenomenon in conservative states during the Obama era. Kansas passed a law last year asserting that federal gun regulations did not apply to guns made in the state, and made any attempt to enforce those federal regulations a felony. The Justice Department wrote a letter to Gov. Sam Brownback explaining that Kansas can\u2019t actually do that because it\u2019s wildly unconstitutional.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ernst said she'd back a crazy bill to nullify the ACA and jail bureaucrats.
