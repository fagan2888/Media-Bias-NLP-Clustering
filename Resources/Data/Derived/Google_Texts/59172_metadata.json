Consider that the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index, a proxy for the stock market, posted a plump 6.5 percent gain in the fourth quarter, and yet investors withdrew money from their mutual funds in all three months.\n\n\u201cThere is just a lack of enthusiasm to buy stocks,\u201d said Craig Hodges, president of Hodges Capital Management, a Dallas investment firm. \u201cInstitutional investors and other professionals are in there buying stocks, but not small investors.\u201d\n\nThe fourth-quarter performance brought the S&P 500 index back to essentially flat for the year \u2014 down 0.7 percent. Even with that tiny loss, the S&P 500 has gained more than 200 percent since the bull market began in March 2009, and the market\u2019s five-year annualized return is above 10 percent.\n\nStill, investors seem to have grown weary of an uncertain, volatile market where huge gains one day are often followed by big losses the next.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t the most painful of years, but it probably has been one of the most frustrating,\u201d said Hodges, who co-manages the $1.8 billion Hodges Small Cap Fund. \u201cI equate it to running on a treadmill where you think you have done some great things, but you have gone nowhere.\u201d\n\nMarket experts often say that bull markets must climb a wall of worry. Well, this bull, born during the dark days of the global financial crisis of 2009, certainly climbed a huge wall of worry this quarter.\n\nIt faced down the first interest rate hike in almost a decade; horrific terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif.; plummeting corporate earnings; sluggish global economic growth; and collapsing oil prices. Any one of these issues could have spelled the end of the third-longest-running bull market in history.\n\nHowever, all of the major stock indexes lumbered through another year without lapsing into a bear market \u2014 defined as a 20 percent decline from their highs. In fact, the Nasdaq finished 2015 with a 5.7 percent gain. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 2.2 percent.\n\n\u201cThere certainly was enough bad news this year to justify a weaker performance in the stock market,\u201d said Robert Sweet, managing editor of Dow Theory Forecasts, an investment newsletter. \u201cI would not have been surprised if the market had been lower with all this bad news.\u201d\n\nPessimistic start\n\nComing into the fourth quarter, the market\u2019s outlook was decidedly pessimistic, with the S&P 500 down 6.7 percent through the first nine months of the year. Many investors believed sharp declines in August and September were the prologue to a bear market.\n\nThe issues weighing on the market over the summer were an economic slowdown in China and Europe, fear of rising interest rates and sluggish corporate earnings. However, stocks took flight in the first month of the fourth quarter with a fine October rally that erased previous losses from the vicious summer sell-off.\n\nIn fact, the S&P 500 gained 8.3 percent in October \u2014 its best monthly performance in four years, and its fifth-best October performance since 1960. The Nasdaq was up almost 10 percent, and much of the worry over an imminent bear market subsided.\n\nThe catalyst for the October rally was strong quarterly earnings reports coming from some of the technology and e-commerce heavyweights like Amazon.com, Netflix and Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google.\n\nAlso, worries that the slowdown in China would cause a worldwide recession began to subside. Even concern about the much-anticipated rise in short-term interest rates began to wane as investors viewed any hike as confirmation that the U.S. economy was strengthening.\n\nSo it seemed that after stumbling and bumbling its way through the first nine months of the year, the market had regained its composure and was ready to rumble as the holidays approached. The S&P 500 had even moved into positive terrain for the year by mid-November.\n\nBut the market soon lapsed into its all-too-familiar pattern of one step forward and two steps backward. It basically finished November where it started \u2014 with the same result in December.\n\nThe wall of worry\n\nSkittish investors easily found reasons to shun stocks as the year wound down. For starters, corporate earnings growth turned negative for three consecutive quarters. Earnings fell 0.7 percent in the second quarter, declined another 1.6 percent in the third quarter and declined an estimated 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet Research Systems Inc.\n\nIt was the first time companies in the S&P 500 have experienced three straight quarters of negative earnings since 2009.\n\n\u201cDeclining earnings is one of the biggest and most overlooked issues out there,\u201d said Sweet of Dow Theory. \u201cHowever, the issue is not so much the lack of profit growth in the fourth quarter but rather the question is will profits be better in 2016. It\u2019s hard to be confident that they will.\u201d\n\nThe woeful profit picture was basically a reflection of the sluggish economic growth as measured by gross domestic product. It declined from a torrid 3.9 percent pace in the second quarter to 2 percent in the third quarter.\n\nWith those issues already weighing on the market, investors also had to brace for more upheaval in the Middle East and terrorist attacks both in the United States and overseas.\n\nEurope was rocked on Nov. 13 when Islamic State attackers carried out terrorist assaults in the heart of Paris, killing 130 people. Then on Dec. 9, a couple with connections to people with Islamist extremist views opened fire inside the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, Calif., killing 14 people and wounding 21.\n\nAs horrific as all that was, the impact these events had on stocks was difficult to gauge. The market sold off modestly on the two days following the San Bernardino attack but then recovered most of the loss.\n\nCollapsing crude oil prices also weighed on stocks during the final month of the quarter, with supplies far outweighing demand. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil dropped 40 percent during the year to just above $36 a barrel \u2014 its lowest level since February 2009.\n\nAlthough cheaper crude oil is helpful to consumers, with the average price of a gallon of gasoline now below $2, it\u2019s also an indicator that the global economy is struggling. And that worries investors and puts downward pressure on stocks. Energy companies in the S&P 500 index are expected to report an earnings decline this year of 65 percent \u2014 the biggest decline of all 10 sectors in the index.\n\nBright spots for 2016\n\nAmid all this global and domestic turmoil, the U.S. economy and stock market continued to lumber along, albeit at a dilatory pace throughout the year. And one of the brightest spots involved jobs.\n\nThe labor market is doing better even as employment remains 2.8 million jobs below the pre-recession levels of 2008. The economy created 211,000 jobs in November \u2014 a bit more than the 200,000 Wall Street expected \u2014 and the unemployment rate held steady at a respectable 5 percent.\n\nThe tightening job market and at least the potential for some wage inflation gave the Federal Reserve the needed cover to raise short-term interest rates at its Dec. 16 meeting \u2014 its first hike since 2006.\n\nAt first glance a rate hike would seem to be a bad omen for the stock market as higher borrowing costs erode corporate profits and raise borrowing costs for consumers. However, the S&P 500 actually gained 1.5 percent on the day the 0.25 percent hike was announced.\n\nIt sold off slightly a few days later, but ultimately the market took the news in stride. In fact, the message from the Fed in raising rates was clearly that it believes the U.S. economy is finally strong enough to deal with slightly higher rates.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing fundamentally wrong with the stock market or the economy,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think we are going to see a bear market in 2016.\u201d\n\nThat dollop of optimism is built on two factors. First, stock valuations are not excessively high. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500, the most common measure of stock valuations, stands at a respectable 17, close to the historical average of 16.\n\nDuring the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, the P/E of the S&P 500 soared above 30, so current valuations are about half that. And there are many stocks with single-digit P/E ratios, meaning there are still some bargains in the market. In fact, Hodges said he has never seen so many opportunities to buy good companies at low prices.\n\nA second factor \u2014 and this is a bit counterintuitive \u2014 involves the lack of investor enthusiasm for stocks. Historically, big sell-offs and bear markets arrive during periods of market euphoria when virtually everyone is buying stocks. That is not the case today as small investors have been jettisoning stocks all year.\n\nEven as the market rallied early in the fourth quarter, investors continued withdrawing money from stock mutual funds. This is telling because mutual fund flows are a key barometer as to how small investors view the market.\n\nMutual funds had net withdrawals every month from March through December with total withdrawals topping $160 billion, according to the Investment Company Institute.\n\nThe reason this is a positive for the market in 2016 is that eventually all those who wanted to sell have already sold their stock. In Wall Street parlance, selling becomes exhausted as there are simply no sellers left.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever remember a time where a big bear market arrived during a time like this with such a lack of enthusiasm for stocks,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cThat gives me confidence. Once the weak holders have sold, there is really nowhere to go but up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many small investors probably didn\u2019t notice \u2014 or perhaps didn\u2019t care \u2014 that the stock market scratched out a decent gain in the final quarter of 2015.", "og": {"description": "Many small investors probably didn\u2019t notice \u2014 or perhaps didn\u2019t care \u2014 that the stock market scratched out a decent gain in the final quarter of 2015.", "title": "Despite bad year, bull marches on", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/will-deener/20160102-despite-bad-year-bull-marches-on.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20160102-financial_markets_year_in_review_48001061.ece/BINARY/original/FINANCIAL_MARKETS_YEAR_IN_REVIEW_48001061", "height": 853}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-01-04T14:54:12Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-01-02T22:58:31Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Despite bad year, bull marches on\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/will-deener/20160102-despite-bad-year-bull-marches-on.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2600073\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-01-02T22:58:31Z\", \"section\": \"Will Deener\", \"author\": \"WILL DEENER\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-02T22:58:31Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThere certainly was enough bad news this year to justify a weaker performance in the stock market,\u201d said Robert Sweet, managing editor of Dow Theory Forecasts, an investment newsletter.\nIn fact, the S&P 500 gained 8.3 percent in October \u2014 its best monthly performance in four years, and its fifth-best October performance since 1960.\nHowever, the S&P 500 actually gained 1.5 percent on the day the 0.25 percent hike was announced.\nAt first glance a rate hike would seem to be a bad omen for the stock market as higher borrowing costs erode corporate profits and raise borrowing costs for consumers.\nEven as the market rallied early in the fourth quarter, investors continued withdrawing money from stock mutual funds."}
