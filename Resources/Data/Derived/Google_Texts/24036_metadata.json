There was a small satisfaction increase leading up to the implementation of Obamacare in January 2014, followed by a marked return to dissatisfaction. As of September 2012, Americans held a 53-43 pessimistic view that Medicare would provide those over 65 with adequate healthcare in 20 years.\n\nMoore noted that healthcare \u201cprices have risen spectacularly out of control.\u201d\n\nKrugman attempted to persuade the audience otherwise: \u201cIt\u2019s not actually true that healthcare costs rise,\u201d he said, claiming that centralized systems lower costs.\n\nMoore countered, \u201cThe reason that you\u2019re wrong about the driving up of cost\u2013here\u2019s the thing, look at laser surgery, it\u2019s not covered by insurance, and what\u2019s happening with laser surgery, the costs are falling because the government isn\u2019t paying for it.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News has continually reported on skyrocketing Obamacare premiums and the influential role that they will play in the 2016 elections.\n\nThese dueling economic perspectives continued to play out in a discussion over minimum wage laws and rate increases.\n\nWhile Krugman argued that the effect of rising minimum wages on unemployment was zero, he advocated for raising the rate to $15 per hour, seemingly the magic number among advocates of such measures.\n\nMoore pressed that minimum wage workers are largely those under 25, many of whom work in the retail industry. He then stated, \u201cThis is a very sinister trend, if people don\u2019t start working until 22 or so, they don\u2019t catch up.\u201d\n\nHe cited Milton Friedman, who said, \u201cI have often said that the most anti-black law on the books of this land is the minimum wage law.\u201d\n\nHe then asked Krugman if he would at least consider a lower minimum wage for teens, but was met with meager consideration from his opponent.\n\nThe battle of blue-state-versus-red-state economics drew each man to his corner defending the position that states with his own economic views enjoyed greater success. Each man brandished charts in defense of his own position.\n\nMoore pointed to 1990-2014 job growth in lower-tax Texas and Florida trumping growth in blue states California and New York. Krugman\u2019s contention was merely that air conditioning explained job growth in regions with warmer temperatures.\n\nMoore pointed to socialist government failures like Greece, challenging Krugman to come up with one socialist government with winning economic policy results.\n\nMoore and Krugman conflicted over welfare trends and the role of welfare. Moore said if the bottom 20% isn\u2019t working, then they won\u2019t rise out of poverty. Krugman advocated for more welfare, and \u201ca stronger safety net.\u201d\n\nMoore noted welfare reform by President Bill Clinton and Republicans in 1996 that saw some success, but was followed by changes during President George W. Bush\u2019s term.\n\nEach man closed with three issues he would prioritize. Krugman asserted negative effects of land use restrictions, universal pre-K education, and beefed-up union bargaining power. Moore focused on the contaminating touch of unions, said that \u201cmarriage is one of the great economic institutions of our time,\u201d and advocated for a simple 16 or 17 percent across-the-board tax rate: \u201cLet\u2019s blow up the tax system,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Moore vs. Krugman Throw-down at Freedom Fest", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Moore vs. Krugman Throw-down at Freedom Fest", "title": "Moore vs. Krugman Throw-down at Freedom Fest - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2608, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Paul-Krugman-Nicholas-Kamm-AFP-Getty.jpg", "height": 1948}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/10/moore-vs-krugman-throw-down-at-freedom-fest/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Moore vs. Krugman Throw-down at Freedom Fest", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Paul-Krugman-Nicholas-Kamm-AFP-Getty.jpg", "title": "Moore vs. Krugman Throw-down at Freedom Fest - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Air conditioning, blue state, California, Florida, free market, Greece, Heritage Foundation, Keynesian, Milton Friedman, minimum wage, New York, New York Times, obamanomics, Paul Krugman, red state, socialism, Stephen Moore, supply side, Texas, Wall Street Journal, welfare,Big Government, Breitbart California, Economics,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-07-10T09:36:31-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "welfare", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDuring the moderated debate Moore and Krugman were asked: Will Obamacare lead to socialized medicine?\nMoore pressed that minimum wage workers are largely those under 25, many of whom work in the retail industry.\nMoore and Krugman conflicted over welfare trends and the role of welfare.\nMoore pointed to socialist government failures like Greece, challenging Krugman to come up with one socialist government with winning economic policy results.\nThese dueling economic perspectives continued to play out in a discussion over minimum wage laws and rate increases."}
