Immigration reform\n\nSenate Democrats were able to pass comprehensive immigration reform with the help of Republicans last year, establishing a 13-year pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants in America.\n\nBut the measure remains stuck in the GOP-controlled House.\n\nAnd while Republicans do plan to release a set of principles on the issue sometime this year, don\u2019t expect it to include any concrete proposal, according to the National Journal.\n\n2. Gun control\n\nThis issue has been dead in the water for months now, and it\u2019s unlikely to be resurrected with any success in 2014.\n\nPublic support for stricter gun laws has dipped from 57 percent to 49 percent since the immediate aftermath of the Newtown massacre in December 2012, according to a recent CBS News poll.\n\nCongress isn\u2019t likely to act on an issue that remains low on the public agenda during an election year.\n\nThe best chance for any real action on gun reform was a bipartisan compromise to strengthen background checks, but it failed in the Democrat-controlled Senate last April.\n\n3. Minimum wage hike\n\nBuoyed by worker protests across the country, Democrats plan to push for an increase in the federal minimum wage this year.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect it to get anywhere.\n\nMost Republicans are expected to oppose any such legislation, claiming it would hurt job creation by increasing costs for business owners.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pathetic: Congress is expected to do even less in 2014 than in 2013 when the government shut down for weeks", "title": "5 of this year\u2019s biggest issues Congress will probably fail to address", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pathetic: Congress is expected to do even less in 2014 than in 2013 when the government shut down for weeks", "title": "5 of this year\u2019s biggest issues Congress will probably fail to address", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/25/5_of_this_years_biggest_issues_that_congress_probably_will_fail_at_addressing_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/capitol_steps.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pathetic: Congress is expected to do even less in 2014 than in 2013 when the government shut down for weeks", "title": "5 of this year\u2019s biggest issues Congress will probably fail to address", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/capitol_steps.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Wolfe", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Congress, Farm Bill, GlobalPost, Gun Control, Immigration Reform, Minimum wage, U.S. Politics", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Minimum wage hikeBuoyed by worker protests across the country, Democrats plan to push for an increase in the federal minimum wage this year.\nTopics: Congress, Farm Bill, GlobalPost, Gun Control, Immigration Reform, Minimum wage, U.S.\nThe best chance for any real action on gun reform was a bipartisan compromise to strengthen background checks, but it failed in the Democrat-controlled Senate last April.\nCongress isn\u2019t likely to act on an issue that remains low on the public agenda during an election year.\nImmigration reformSenate Democrats were able to pass comprehensive immigration reform with the help of Republicans last year, establishing a 13-year pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants in America."}
