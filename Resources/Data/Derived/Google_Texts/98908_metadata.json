The subsidiary insurer's business is concentrated on the individual market, including customers on the Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges.\n\nHarken Health offers free primary care services at its company-owned clinics.\n\nThe subsidiary's growth on the federal exchanges creates an interesting juxtaposition with its parent, which is departing from the exchanges in roughly two dozen states following financial losses, according to the report.\n\n\"We had an overwhelmingly strong response to our model, which exceeded our expectations,\" Tom Vanderheyden, CEO of Harken Health, said in a statement, according to the report.\n\nThe company, which began selling coverage Jan. 1, had about 33,000 people enrolled in its insurance plans by the end of the first quarter. It collected roughly two-thirds of its $30.6 million in first quarter premium revenue in Illinois, according to the report.\n\nHarken Health policyholders can get primary care with no copays at one of the company's 10 health clinics, four of which are in Cook County, Ill., and six of which are in Atlanta. The company plans to open another six clinics in Cook County and two more in Atlanta by 2017.\n\nThe Harken Health centers provide other wellness services in addition to primary care, such as sessions with \"health coaches,\" nutrition classes, tai chi and yoga.\n\nMore articles on hospital and physician integration:\n\nMGMA, SullivanCotter form partnership\n\nCEP America expands partnership with two San Francisco hospitals\n\nStrategies to help hospitals prepare for residency season\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
