We have good reason to anticipate it.\n\nDon\u2019t accuse me of utopianism. I don\u2019t foresee a future of new human beings who consistently respect the rights of others. Rather, I\u2019m drawing attention to the distinction between crime and tort \u2014 between offenses against the state (or society) and offenses against individual persons or their justly held property. We\u2019re so used to this distinction, and the priority of the criminal law over tort law, that most of us don\u2019t realize that things used to be different. At one time, an \u201coffense\u201d that was not an act of force against an individual was not an offense at all.\n\nWhat happened? In England, the early kings recognized that the administration of justice could be a cash cow. So they grabbed on and never let go. As a result, the emphasis shifted to punishment (fines and imprisonment) and away from restitution (making victims or their heirs as whole as possible).\n\nLiberty-minded people should regret this change. Yet again, the ruling elite exploited the people. It needed wealth to buy war materiel and allegiance, so it took it by force from the laboring masses, and corrupted the justice system in the process.\n\nIn The Enterprise of Law, Bruce Benson explains that before the royal preemption, customary law prevailed in England. One feature of this spontaneous order was that\n\noffenses are treated as torts (private wrongs and injuries) rather than crimes (offenses against the state or the \u201csociety\u201d). A potential action by one person has to affect someone else before any question of legality can arise; any action that does not, such as what a person does alone or in voluntary cooperation with someone else but in a manner that clearly harms no one, is not likely to become the subject of a rule of conduct under customary law.\n\nBenson also notes that\n\nprosecutorial duties fall to the victim and his reciprocal protection association. Thus, the law provides for restitution to victims arrived at through clearly designed participatory adjudication procedures, in order to both provide incentives to pursue prosecution and to quell victims\u2019 desires for revenge.\n\nIn such a system of law, one was not likely to see \u201coffenses\u201d without true victims. Since cooperation through reciprocity is key to the success of customary law, the system is likely to be kept within narrow libertarian-ish limits. (Also relevant is John Hasnas\u2019s paper \u201cToward a Theory of Empirical Natural Rights\u201d [PDF].)\n\nThis arrangement worked out fairly well \u2014 until would-be rulers, who needed money to finance wars of conquest and buy loyalty by dispensing tax-funded jobs, discovered that there was gold to be had in the administration of justice.\n\nAnglo-Saxon kings saw the justice process as a source of revenue, and violations of certain laws began to be referred to as violations of the \u201cking\u2019s peace.\u201d Well before the Norman conquest [1066], outlawry began to involve not only liability to be killed with impunity but [quoting historians Frederick Pollack and Frederick Maitland] \u201cforfeiture of goods to the king.\u201d\n\nThe idea of the \u201cking\u2019s peace\u201d started small but eventually expanded to all of society. The incentive was obvious. \u201cViolations of the king\u2019s peace required payment to the king,\u201d Benson writes. As customary law was co-opted by the crown, the concept felony, arbitrariness in punishment, and imprisonment came to the administration of \u201cjustice.\u201d The people were not pleased with the shifting focus from victims to king and his cronies, so they had to be compelled to cooperate.\n\nFor example, royal law imposed coercive rules declaring that the victim was a criminal if he obtained restitution before he brought the offender before a king\u2019s justice where the king could get his profits. This was not a strong enough inducement, so royal law created the crimes of \u201ctheftbote,\u201d making it a misdemeanor for a victim to accept the return of stolen property or to make other arrangements with a felon in exchange for an agreement not to prosecute.\n\nBenson sums up\n\nBy the end of the reign of Edward I [1307], the basic institutions of government law had been established, and in many instances older custom had been altered or replaced by authoritarian rules to facilitate the transfer of wealth to relatively powerful groups. \u201cPublic interest\u201d justifications for a government-dominated legal system and institutions must be viewed as ex postrationalizations rather than as ex ante explanations of their development.\n\nThus the criminal justice system as we know it is a product of state arrogation and a repudiation of individualism. This perverse approach to law was inherited by the representative democracies that succeeded the absolute monarchies in England and then America.\n\nFor reasons too obvious to need elaboration, a system of justice aimed at restitution makes eminently good sense. Someone is wronged, so the perpetrator should, to the extent possible, make things right. (In the case of murder, the victim\u2019s heirs would have a monetary claim against the killer; in the case of an heirless victim, the claim could be homesteaded by anyone who puts the effort into identifying and prosecuting the killer.)\n\nAt the same time, the principle of restitution undercuts the case for punishment, correction, and deterrence as objectives of the justice system. The point isn\u2019t to make perpetrators suffer or to reform them or to make potential perpetrators think twice. What good are these for the present victim? Correction and deterrence may be natural byproducts of a system of restitution, but they are not proper objectives, for where could a right to do more than require restitution come from?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Would a free society be a crime-free society?", "title": "Crime and Punishment in a Free Society", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/12/08/crime-and-punishment-in-a-free-society", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1386347951633.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1386347951633.jpg", "title": "Crime and Punishment in a Free Society", "description": "Would a free society be a crime-free society?
