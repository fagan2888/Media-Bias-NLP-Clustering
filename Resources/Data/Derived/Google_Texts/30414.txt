The Phoenix Business Journal reported late Tuesday that Meritus Health Partners, the insurance cooperative serving Arizona, is running out of money and will wind down operations. Meritus thus becomes the 12th of 23 Obamacare CO-OPs nationwide to fail.

CEO Tom Zumbotel told the business paper that Tempe-based Meritus was unable to raise enough outside investment to get back in good standing with the federal government by Dec. 1.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had barred the CO-OP from offering coverage on the ACA insurance marketplace for 2016 due to the companyâ€™s precarious financial position. Arizona insurance regulators also have tried to shut down Meritus.
