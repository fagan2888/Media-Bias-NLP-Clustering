Had the judge written \u201ctrample,\u201d the image would be of someone\u2019s religious freedom being stomped into the dust, a much more violent and damaging treatment of the freedom of religion. Instead, the ruling said that the federal requirement to provide contraception impeded the rights of religious freedom, not denies it. It\u2019s the difference between tying someone up (trammel) and crushing someone to death (trample).\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that people are less familiar with \u201ctrammel\u201d than with \u201ctrample.\u201d A look at usage of both words over the centuries shows that \u201ctrample\u201d has always been far more popular than \u201ctrammel.\u201d\n\nWhile usage of both has dropped off considerably, \u201ctrample\u201d has surged since 2000, while \u201ctrammel\u201d gets only a small bump. And \u201ctrammel\u201d must once have been a more familiar word to the reading public: It appears several times a year inThe New York Times of the mid-1800s, but only a few times so far this century, most in legal contexts.\n\n\u201cTrammel\u201d arose from an Old French word for a net with three layers, tramail, according to The Oxford English Dictionary. Even today, \u201ctrammel nets\u201d are used: \u201cThe fish enters through the large mesh on one side, drives the fine netting through the large mesh on the other, and is thus trapped in a pocket or bag of the fine netting,\u201d the OED says. Other \u201ctrammels\u201d are hobbles to restrain a horse or to teach it proper gaits, a mechanism for suspending a pot over a fire, or, in olden days, the hopper of a mill.\n\nAs a verb, \u201ctrammel\u201d in the mid-1500s meant \u201cto bind a corpse,\u201d the OED says, but Shakespeare was the first to use it in a non-physical sense, where Macbeth muses:\n\nif the assassination Could trammel up the consequence, and catch With his surcease success;\n\n\u201cTrammel,\u201d like \u201ctrample,\u201d can be an intransitive verb, meaning it does not need a direct object (\u201cDo you trammel with a three-layer net?\u201d), as well as transitive, needing an object (\u201cThe farrier trammels the horse before shoeing it\u201d). American English uses a single \u201cl\u201d for other forms, like \u201ctrammeling,\u201d while the British use \u201ctrammelling.\u201d\n\nThe more people use \u201ctrammel,\u201d the less hobbled will be their understanding of some of the nuances of English.\n\n\n\nMerrill Perlman managed copy desks across the newsroom at The New York Times, where she worked for 25 years.
