[WATCH] MRC hilariously proves Millennials really don’t want to sign up for Obamacare

If the above picture doesn’t make you want to run away from Obamacare, we’re not sure what will!

It’s no shocker that the Obama Administration’s “pajama boy” campaign didn’t work last fall – and that the administration is still struggling to find the winning ticket that will convince Millennials to enroll in the healthcare exchanges. The fine folks at the Media Research Center have some ideas for them, however.

In their latest anti-Obamacare video, several marketing experts brainstorm new ways to market their “terrible, terrible law” to young Americans, contemplating everything from Woody Allen (who, they note likes kids more than kids like him…) to twerking and the GEICO gecko.

They even consider using the E-Trade baby to promote the fact that Americans now receive free contraception under the law. “Who says you need free contraception better than a baby!” the team leader exclaims.

After the team (and its part-time employees, thanks to Obamacare) disperse to film the new, cat-filled video, reality sets in: NOTHING – not even cats jumping off roofs – will make young Americans more inclined to sign up for coverage under the new law.

It’s pretty safe to say their boss isn’t thrilled about the failed, costly video, however. Fortunately for the staffers, they didn’t lose their jobs – again, thanks to Obamacare!

“Fired! Are you kidding? You work for Barack Obama, you’re all getting promotions!” the manager tells his worried employees. “And get me that cat too, the president wants to make him his newest press secretary.”

To which one of the staffers quips, “Sounds like an improvement!”
