Sunday temperatures are expected to rise only to the mid-40s, he said.\n\nThe foothills are under a high-wind advisory through the weekend, with winds expecting to gust up to 80 mph.\n\nSkiers heading to the mountains Sunday will encounter blizzardlike conditions. The next major weather system is expecting to reach Steamboat Springs by about 2 a.m. Sunday, Barjenbruch said.\n\nA winter storm warning will be in effect from late Saturday through Sunday, said Barjenbruch. Heavy snow accompanied by high winds will combine to make treacherous driving with whiteout conditions.\n\n\u201cUse caution,\u201d he urged. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult driving conditions. The commute into the mountains will be slow and frustrating for skiers.\u201d\n\nMountain ski communities already have received about a foot of snow the past two days and could get at least that much before the end of Sunday. Vail received 16 inches of snow the past two days.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kmitchelldp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Manning, Broncos may tangle with high winds in playoff game", "title": "Manning, Broncos may tangle with high winds in playoff game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/11/manning-broncos-may-tangle-with-high-winds-in-playoff-game/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140108__BroncosManning010813p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140108__BroncosManning010813p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-11T13:52:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T03:12:49+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Heavy snow accompanied by high winds will combine to make treacherous driving with whiteout conditions.\nSaturday\u2019s high winds are only a prelude to stronger gusts expected Sunday afternoon that could reach 50 mph and make it tougher to lob a touchdown pass or kick a long field goal.\n\u201cI can\u2019t comment on how Peyton (Manning) is going to perform in the wind,\u201d said Dave Barjenbruch, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder.\n\u201cThere are going to be swirling winds.\u201dWind gusts were reaching as high as 40 mph Saturday, making balmy temperatures into the high 50s, seem a lot cooler, Barjenbruch said.\nThe foothills are under a high-wind advisory through the weekend, with winds expecting to gust up to 80 mph."}
