All MediExcel small group plans include Essential Health Benefits and meet the federal Minimum Essential Coverage and ACA Actuarial Value requirements. Essential Health Benefits include pediatric dental and vision as well as all of the other new benefits covered in California\u2019s base-benchmark plan as specified in state law. The rate methodology for MediExcel\u2019s small group plans is structured in conformance with the ACA, which follows the compressed age ratios for each enrollee\u2019s age.\n\n\u201cWith the onset of the less-forgiving regulatory environment in 2014 for non-compliance, brokers and employers will undoubtedly feel much more comfortable with ACA-compliant plans, even if it pertains to cross-border healthcare coverage,\u201d says Caitlin Gadel, J.D., Lead Benefits Consultant for Benefits Compliance Link (www.benecomplink.com). \u201cThe potential fines and penalties for employers with non-compliant plans in their employer benefit program will compel all brokers to make small group medical plan recommendations that are ACA compliant,\u201d Gadel adds.\n\nAbout MediExcel Health Plan\n\nMediExcel Health Plan is a Mexican-based company licensed by the California Department of Managed Healthcare to offer group healthcare coverage to U.S. employers in San Diego and Imperial Counties with healthcare delivery in Mexico.
