Robert Patrick has tweeted about guns before, but on Friday, the “Terminator 2,” “X-Files,” and “True Blood” actor tweeted his loud and proud support for the Second Amendment and the NRA:

RT if you support the #SecondAmendment and the #NRA! — NRA (@NRA) January 3, 2014

A screenshot of his retweet:

Another actor who won’t be silenced by Hollywood liberal orthodoxy.

In February, Patrick, an NRA member, said, “There are enough laws regulating guns on the books. New legislation only penalizes those of us who are responsible gun owners.”
