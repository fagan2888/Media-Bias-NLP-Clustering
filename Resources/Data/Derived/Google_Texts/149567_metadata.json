Whether it\u2019s because of his role as head of the Republican Governors Association in an election year, preparation for his own presidential run, or just a desire to get out of the Garden State, where his approval ratings are at the lowest level ever, Christie has been traveling the country making speeches and appearances for the past several weeks.\n\nIn his travels, it\u2019s safe to say he has probably never felt more at home than he did Tuesday at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, where he delivered the keynote speech at a conference on legal reform.\n\nRelated: Three Reasons Why a GOP \u2018Wave\u2019 Is Still Possible\n\nThere was a time, after members of his staff were found to have shut down access to a bridge connecting New Jersey and New York as political revenge, when Christie seemed to think that in order to preserve his standing as a potential presidential candidate, he needed to project a more moderate persona in his public appearances.\n\nApparently, that\u2019s gone out the window since federal investigators have not found any evidence that Christie knew of the bridge closing in advance. Christie may or may not still have a shot at the presidency in 2016, but one thing seems clear \u2013 if he is indeed running, he has decided that the bluster and bravado that won him two terms as governor are his best bet going forward.\n\nWhat the audience in Washington got Tuesday was vintage Christie.\n\nHe bashed public school teachers as greedy and lazy, and then talked over a questioner who objected to the characterization. (\u201cThis isn\u2019t a debate. You asked a question; I\u2019m giving you an answer.\u201d)\n\nRelated: Obama Gets Surprising Bump in Approval Amide Widespread Criticism\n\nHe belittled those who earn the minimum wage (\u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing about the minimum wage. I really am. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a mother or father sitting around a kitchen table tonight saying \u2018You know, honey, if our son or daughter could just make a higher minimum wage then my God, all our dreams would be realized.\u2019\u201d)\n\nAnd, clearly knowing his audience, he insisted, somewhat implausibly, that tort reform would reduce income inequality. Yes, really.\n\nAsked about Obamacare, he proclaimed it a failure. \u201cIt\u2019s not working,\u201d he said, millions of newly insured Americans notwithstanding. He said that Republicans needed to offer a plan to replace it, but offered no such specifics himself.\n\nChristie really warmed up toward the end, when he was asked about a plan to reduce the federal debt. His answer: Tort reform, tax reform and increased exploitation of natural resources.\n\nRelated: Extending Unemployment Insurance isn\u2019t Dead, Says Labor Secretary\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a complicated plan,\u201d he said. \u201cSpend less, grow more. Now, how you implement all those things is part of a longer conversation I\u2019d be happy to have with you sometime. Not today.\u201d\n\nBut he was willing to offer one detail.\n\n\u201cPain will be involved,\u201d he said, then repeated, almost with relish, \u201cPain will be involved.\u201d\n\nJudging from the reaction in the room, it was clear that nobody in attendance expected much of that pain would be theirs.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Chris Christie won\u2019t talk about the details of his plan to bring down the national debt, but he\u2019s happy to promise that he\u2019ll gladly make some people miserable to do it.", "title": "Chris Christie Brings the Pain", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/10/21/Chris-Christie-Brings-Pain", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05152014_Chris_Christie_Summit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/10/21/Chris-Christie-Brings-Pain", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/05152014_Chris_Christie_Summit.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Chris Christie won\u2019t talk about the details of his plan to bring down the national debt, but he\u2019s happy to promise that he\u2019ll gladly make some people miserable to do it.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "You asked a question; I\u2019m giving you an answer.\u201d)Related: Obama Gets Surprising Bump in Approval Amide Widespread CriticismHe belittled those who earn the minimum wage (\u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing about the minimum wage.\nChristie really warmed up toward the end, when he was asked about a plan to reduce the federal debt.\nHis answer: Tort reform, tax reform and increased exploitation of natural resources.\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie is spending a lot of time on the road these days.\n\u201cPain will be involved,\u201d he said, then repeated, almost with relish, \u201cPain will be involved.\u201dJudging from the reaction in the room, it was clear that nobody in attendance expected much of that pain would be theirs."}
