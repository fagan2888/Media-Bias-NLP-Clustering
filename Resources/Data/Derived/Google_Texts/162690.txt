Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz will be airing a parody Christmas-themed infomercial in key Iowa markets during the Saturday Night Live broadcast. “In the spirit of the upcoming holiday, we are excited to bring a Cruz family Christmas into the homes of SNL viewers in Iowa,” the Cruz campaign told the Independent Journal. “Ted is a long-time fan of SNL, so the chance to film his own SNL-style commercial was an opportunity we couldn’t pass up!”

The commercial shows the Texas senator reading some “Christmas classics” to his two daughters and wife. The tales includes the likes of “Rudolph the Underemployed Reindeer,” “Frosty the Speaker of the House,” (“Look! The speaker is melting before Congress”), “How Obamacare Stole Christmas” and “Auditing St. Nick” (I will audit him here or there, I will audit him anywhere). One of his daughters at one point takes a turn in reading from “The Grinch who Lost her Emails.”

“‘I know just what I’ll do,’ she said with a snicker,” Cruz’s daughter reads, “I’ll use my own server and no one will be the wiser.”
