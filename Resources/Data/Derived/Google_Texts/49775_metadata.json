That's 36 percent in Alabama.\n\nThat gap is only wider in Mississippi, where 37 percent of uninsured adults still do not qualify for coverage under either program.\n\nKaiser reports that, as of last month, Alabama was one of 26 states that had decided not to expand Medicaid. That expansion was a key part of the design of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicaid traditionally has been reserved for certain low-income individuals, especially children, parents, the elderly and the disabled.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Alabama many low-income adults have jobs and make too much money to receive coverage under Medicaid. Yet they also earn too little to qualify for tax credits under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Kaiser study, Alabama has the lowest threshold for Medicaid coverage in the nation. Kaiser reports adults without children in Alabama must earn less than 16 percent of the federal poverty level to qualify for Medicaid coverage. That sets a maximum annual income of just $3,221 for an individual without children or disability.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicaid expansion would raise the income ceiling to 138 percent of the poverty level, or $15,415 a year for an individual.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government has proposed paying for the Medicaid expansion for three years, then paying 90 percent of the cost in subsequent years. But the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states can opt out of Medicaid expansion. Gov. Robert Bentley has opposed expansion in Alabama.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI have a long-term goal for this. My long term goal is to resist the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and I believe we are going to succeed in that,\u201d Bentley said last month.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a closer look by AL.com at the coverage gap in Alabama and some of the people affected.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, news", "title": "Kaiser study: 191,000 Alabamians fall into 'coverage gap' between Medicaid and Obamacare", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Kaiser study: 191,000 Alabamians fall into \\u0027coverage gap\\u0027 between Medicaid and Obamacare\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/10/kaiser_study_191000_alabamians.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.al.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11441311\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-16T17:47:47Z\", \"author\": \"Challen Stephens | cstephens@al.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\",\"Affordable Care Act\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.al.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "creator": "@ChallenStephens", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "New study ranks Alabama second in terms of percentage of uninsured adults who still do not qualify for health coverage under Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act.
