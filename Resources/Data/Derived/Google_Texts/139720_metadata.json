Glad you asked.\n\nA passel of retirement surveys have recently been released. I\u2019ve read them \u2014 so you don\u2019t have to \u2014 and here are the highlights and four action steps to take based on the findings.\n\nInterestingly, the results are somewhat contradictory.\n\nMixed messages from retirement surveys\n\nOn the one hand, 60% of Americans worry they won\u2019t ever have enough money to retire, according to a survey from the Insured Retirement Institute (IRI), and 55% of boomers told PNC Financial they worry their savings may not hold out for as long as they live.\n\nThe top financial concern of boomers (cited by 53%) in the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Employee Financial Wellness 2015 survey was \u201cnot being able to retire when I want to.\u201d Yet about half of the New York Life retirees surveyed said they wish they had retired four or five years earlier than they did.\n\nSome of those retirees in the New York Life survey are undoubtedly enjoying their new found freedom. But others likely wish they\u2019d retired earlier because their failing health has kept them from doing some things they\u2019d planned to do in retirement. Even when you take finances out of the equation, though, about half of the retirees surveyed said they should have taken the plunge earlier. Most of the retired men felt they should have retired between three and five years earlier and most of the retired women would have preferred retiring one to three years earlier.\n\n\u201cMany of the clients we work with didn\u2019t realize until after they retired that they should have done it sooner,\u201d said David Cruz, Senior Managing Director at New York Life.\n\nSurvey after survey released this week, however, shows that roughly half of non-retired boomers plan to postpone their retirement, usually because their savings are coming up short. (The boomers PNC surveyed said $1.3 million is the minimum amount they think they need to have saved for retirement.) According to IRI, last year about a quarter of boomers postponed a planned retirement.\n\nOne retirement worry: free time\n\nA second, and important, reason cited by working boomers for postponing retirement was uncertainty about what they\u2019d do with themselves.\n\nIn IRI\u2019s survey, about a fifth of the boomers listed not knowing what they\u2019d do with their free time as one of their top two retirement concerns.\n\nWhile researching my personal finance books, I\u2019ve heard many people worry about retiring, saying they have no hobbies and that they\u2019d go stir crazy without a job and purpose. But as I point out in my book, AARP Roadmap for the Rest of Your Life, chances are, sooner or later in retirement, you\u2019ll decide that there are things you want to do other than veg out on the couch. Then you\u2019ll start filling your days with exciting and rewarding challenges, such as volunteering or continuing your education.\n\nFour action steps to take\n\nNow for four action items based on the latest retirement surveys:\n\n1. Start your retirement planning. Rather than fret about not having enough money to retire, as so many of those surveyed did, beef up your savings. That could mean putting more cash into your 401(k) or an IRA; if your company offers a 401(k), try to maximize your contributions and get the full employer match. You could also look for more money to save by taking a scalpel to your expenses. Or you could do both.\n\n2. Meet with a professional adviser. Just make sure that person has experience working with people around your age and in similar circumstances.\n\n3. Figure out how much the money in your employer-sponsored retirement plan would produce as income for you in retirement. In The Guardian Life Insurance\u2019s Retire Well Study, four-fifths of those with 401(k)s said they\u2019d increase their contributions if they knew how much retirement income the money in the plans would provide. So have an adviser or your 401(k) plan manager help you calculate how much you might receive when you retire.\n\n4. Visualize what you\u2019d do in retirement. Take stock now, before you wake up on that first Monday after quitting your full-time job, whenever that happens. (In the PNC survey, boomers said they expect to retire at age 65 1/2, on average.) Think about what you currently like to do in your spare time and determine how you could do that and other activities when you\u2019ll have more time.\n\nStart dipping your toes into the retirement-life waters. Volunteer. Take a class. Join a gym. Explore what turns you on and begin to make preparations for retirement. Then maybe you\u2019ll become one of those retirees who said they wished they\u2019d retired sooner.", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Here are the highlights of recent retirement research and four action steps to take based on the findings.", "creator": "@MKTWRetirement", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DK536_NA_ret_MG_20150427123749.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Bart Astor", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Retirement", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Here are the highlights of recent retirement research and four action steps to take based on the findings.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-money-moves-for-a-happier-retirement-2015-04-28", "author": "Bart Astor", "parsely-title": "4 money moves for a happier retirement", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-04-28T06:00:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Retirement", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Here are the highlights of recent retirement research and four action steps to take based on the findings.", "title": "4 money moves for a happier retirement", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/4-money-moves-for-a-happier-retirement-2015-04-28", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DK536_NA_ret_MG_20150427123749.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DK536_NA_ret_MG_20150427123749.jpg"}, "article.id": "283FB202-ECFC-11E4-B083-E5FB3B0143B1", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Figure out how much the money in your employer-sponsored retirement plan would produce as income for you in retirement.\nOne retirement worry: free timeA second, and important, reason cited by working boomers for postponing retirement was uncertainty about what they\u2019d do with themselves.\nBut others likely wish they\u2019d retired earlier because their failing health has kept them from doing some things they\u2019d planned to do in retirement.\nRather than fret about not having enough money to retire, as so many of those surveyed did, beef up your savings.\n(In the PNC survey, boomers said they expect to retire at age 65 1/2, on average.)"}
