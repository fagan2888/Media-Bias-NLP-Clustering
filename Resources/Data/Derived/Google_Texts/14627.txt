The executive director of Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback's Council of Economic Advisors has been arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated.

Shawnee County jail records show that Stanley Ahlerich, executive director of the Kansas Governor's Council of Economic Advisors, was arrested early Saturday on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Ahlerich was released about an hour later on $1,000 bond.

A Brownback spokeswoman declined comment Sunday. A message left at a home phone listing under Ahlerich's name Sunday wasn't immediately returned.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Ahlerich, of Winfield, has led the Governor's Council of Economic Advisors since Brownback formed the group in 2011. The council provides the governor with economic insights from assessments of local, national and global business conditions and trends.
