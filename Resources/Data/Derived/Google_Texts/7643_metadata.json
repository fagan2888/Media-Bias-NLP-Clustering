It hasn\u2019t come up in the debates. Undecided voters don\u2019t ask about it in town halls.\n\nAnd some supporters of his at events, who only paid attention to Cruz when he launched his campaign for president in March, couldn\u2019t exactly put their finger on why they had heard of him before.\n\nCathy Peake, 55, didn\u2019t remember a shutdown (\u201cNot specifically, no.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI follow Ted Cruz pretty closely,\u201d Jeanette Dietzenbach, a church musician, said as she waited to hear him speak here in a pizza shop\u2019s basement, \u201cbut not as far back as 2013.\u201d\n\nClifford Bullerman, 71, didn\u2019t remember it either when asked by a reporter, but went on at length about the 2011 shutdown in Minnesota, which he said \u201cwas avoidable.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, there are Republican diehards who recall it with fondness, recollecting Cruz\u2019s decision to read \u201cGreen Eggs & Ham\u201d from the Senate floor as he lambasted the Affordable Care Act as a millstone on the American economy.\n\nJoel Hefti, 47, first heard of Cruz during the Obamacare debate. \u201cHe strongly opposed it, and he was one of the few that actually stood up \u2014 and didn\u2019t waffle,\u201d Hefti told CNN.\n\nAnd other admirers, even if they don\u2019t recollect the shutdown specifically, flock to him because he has shown the spine to stand up to Washington, including on Obamacare.\n\n\u201cPeople want a candidate who has a backbone and who\u2019s not afraid to make a decision \u2014 whether it was the right one or the wrong one, he\u2019s all in,\u201d said Brian Logie, 35.\n\nThe shutdown endeared Cruz to much of the professional right, from the rabble-rousing Senate Conservatives Fund, whose leaders are organizing on his behalf, to the Club for Growth, some of whose donors have been his biggest backers. And several of the House Republicans who also sought a shutdown have endorsed his presidential campaign.\n\nBut it is also likely to have political consequences: The shutdown \u2014 and effort to defund Obamacare \u2014 is sure to be rich fodder for any Democratic nominee in November.\n\nAnd the shutdown has alienated him from contributors with ties to Wall Street or Washington lobbyists who serve as some of the nation\u2019s most prominent bundlers. None of his fellow senators have endorsed him, some still reeling from the fracas two years later.\n\nHas everyone just moved on?\n\nCruz\u2019s closest allies maintain that he isn\u2019t running away from it, but that he, and his voters, have moved on.\n\n\u201cWhy stick it into the dialogue when you\u2019ve got so much future policy to discuss?\u201d asked Rep. Steve King, his top backer in Iowa and a brother-in-arms during the 2013 fight, which he said was wrongly laid at Cruz\u2019s feet. \u201cThere\u2019s no upside to talking about things that will be mischaracterized.\u201d\n\nThe Obamacare fights, of which Cruz writes in his most recent book that \u201cno battle has consumed more energy,\u201d are only gently and occasionally flicked at. When asked to draw a contrast with Trump here at Mabe\u2019s Pizza, Cruz argued that he was campaigning in the true \u201cIowa way,\u201d and also rattled off a series of fights that showed his mettle while others ran away from.\n\n\u201cWho actually has stood up on Washington?\u201d Cruz said, beginning his usual riff on the highlights of his Senate career. \u201cIn 2013, when millions of Americans rose up against the disaster that was Obamacare and is Obamacare, I was proud to stand and lead that fight. You look at the other men and women standing on that debate stage, the natural question is: Where were they?\u201d\n\nIt may be that Cruz does not see the shutdown today as a political winner: Twice as many people had unfavorable opinions of Cruz during the throes of the shutdown than had favorable ones, and polls taken after the impasse majorly damaged voters\u2019 impressions of the Republican Party \u2014 even among Republicans and tea party supporters.\n\nScott Reed, the top political strategist for the Chamber of Commerce, which strongly opposed the Cruz gambit, said it had likely receded from the country\u2019s political conscience because of the GOP\u2019s success in the subsequent midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not surprised it\u2019s not a fever on the campaign trail,\u201d said Reed. \u201cIt was a long time ago, and we had a great election in the meantime \u2014 so it kind of overshadowed that critical buffoonery.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was the most legendary moment in Ted Cruz's young political career.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324711668", "og": {"site_name": "whotv.com", "description": "DECORAH, Iowa \u2014 It was the most legendary moment in Ted Cruz\u2019s young political career, winning him legions of never-going-to-leave-you activists, never-going-to-forget-this enemies and \u2026", "title": "Ted Cruz Doesn\u2019t Talk About the Government Shutdown he Led", "url": "http://whotv.com/2016/01/16/ted-cruz-doesnt-talk-about-the-government-shutdown-he-led/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://localtvwhotv.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/160114232433-ted-cruz-gop-debate-jan-14-exlarge-tease.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvwhotv.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/160114232433-ted-cruz-gop-debate-jan-14-exlarge-tease.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@whohd", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@whohd"}, "keywords": "ted cruz", "p": {"domain_verify": "0b712ce3c768feea09b44013120c6553"}, "fb": {"pages": 383549560312}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "whotv.com", "google-site-verification": "rL7fNdHSnN2PyMcNFC2GBk_LusisYfoPth6XdX-yZ2Y", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WHOHD", "published_time": "2016-01-16T19:31:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-16T19:31:06+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WHOHD"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://whotv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f35371452b04df2deef561dcee55bb01?s=16", "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWho actually has stood up on Washington?\u201d Cruz said, beginning his usual riff on the highlights of his Senate career.\nBut on his six-day Iowa tour last week, Cruz didn\u2019t mention the shutdown once.\nCruz\u2019s closest allies maintain that he isn\u2019t running away from it, but that he, and his voters, have moved on.\nAnd several of the House Republicans who also sought a shutdown have endorsed his presidential campaign.\nJoel Hefti, 47, first heard of Cruz during the Obamacare debate."}
