And so much more.\n\nHere we are after so many failed fixes and the partial-term senator is older but talking no wiser, recently proposing that the federal government underwrite two years of free college for everyone. But the Democrat now faces a Republican-controlled Congress. Little of his overblown liberal hooey is going anywhere legislatively.\n\nAnd Obama seems to have turned to entertaining himself more, spending $2 million in taxpayer money this week to fly to Los Angeles for an appearance on a late-night show. And also, of course, to raise some money for the party. This afternoon he\u2019ll stop for a photo op at a veterans hospital in Phoenix.\n\nBut those taxpayers who paid for Air Force One\u2019s long flights have sure figured him out. A new Gallup Poll out this week shows that Americans aren\u2019t buying the president\u2019s line about big government fixing the country\u2019s problems. In fact, voters now list government itself as the biggest problem facing the country.\n\nAfter lagging lower on the list of the country\u2019s concerns chronicled by a Gallup survey of 1,027 adults, government has recently surged to the top worry, 18%, up one point from February. The government, economy and unemployment/jobs have been the dominant problems on the minds of surveyed Americans for more than a year now.\n\nGovernment has now passed the general economy at 11%, long the top concern in the early years of Obama\u2019s reign.\n\nAlso ticking upward in the last month were unemployment/jobs at 10% and immigration/illegal aliens at 7%.\n\nHealth care concerns slipped three points to 7%. Terrorism concerns slid two points to 6%, to tie with education and one point above concerns with family decline and the federal debt.\n\nISIS, poverty, foreign policy, national security and race relations all hover at the bottom of Gallup\u2019s worry list at 4%.\n\n\u201cWhile dissatisfaction with government is by no means a new issue to the American people,\u201d said the Gallup analysis, \u201cit has not in recent months been as clearly the leading problem as it is now.\u201d\n\nAndrew Malcolm is IBD\u2019s national politics columnist.
