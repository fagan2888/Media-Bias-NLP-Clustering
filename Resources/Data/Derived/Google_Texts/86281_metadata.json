The two issues are \u201ccompletely different,\u201d the spokesman told the Huffington Post.\n\nBut American Family Association president Tim Wildmon told LifeSiteNews that pro-life Christians who avoid taking a stand on the issue of homosexuality risk being defeated by a flank attack in the culture war.\n\n\u201cPeople have different callings and different passions and both of these issues are very important. But I would say that Christians need to see what is going on in America as spiritual darkness vs spiritual light. We have several areas of engagement,\u201d Wildmon told LifeSiteNews.\n\nWildmon said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the strategic allegiance of the homosexual lobby and the abortion lobby in the fight to block religious opposition to their respective causes. \u201cThe common denominator the homosexual activists have with Planned Parenthood is they both promote actions that are diametrically opposed to the laws of God as given to us in the Bible,\u201d Wildmon said. \u201cAbortion is the taking of innocent human life and homosexual behavior is immoral, unhealthy and unnatural.\u201d\n\nIn a blog post criticizing the New York Times for its misleading coverage of the Arizona religious protections bill, Ryan T. Anderson of the conservative Heritage Foundation also acknowledged the link between the battle over the HHS mandate and the ongoing legal persecution of Christian business owners who refuse to service gay \u201cweddings.\u201d But Anderson argued that the discrimination was on the side of homosexual activists and the Obama administration, who wish to force religious believers to abandon their beliefs in order to service an extreme leftist political agenda.\n\n\u201cThe New York Times editorial board [claims] that Arizona has just passed \u2018noxious measures to give businesses and individuals the broad right to deny services to same-sex couples in the name of protecting religious liberty,\u2019\u201d Anderson wrote. \u201cThe Times got it wrong. The proposed legislation never even mentions same-sex couples; it simply clarifies and improves existing state protections for religious liberty. And as the multitude of lawsuits against the coercive HHS mandate and the cases of photographers, florists and bakers show, we need protection for religious liberty now more than ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the government must treat everyone equally, private actors are left free to make reasonable judgments and distinctions\u2014including reasonable moral judgments and distinctions\u2014in their economic activities,\u201d added Anderson. \u201cNot every florist need provide wedding arrangements for every ceremony. Not every photographer need capture every first kiss. Competitive markets can best harmonize a range of values that citizens hold. And there is no need for government to try to force every photographer and every florist to service every marriage-related event.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "Pro-homosexual forces are lining up beside their pro-abortion allies against those who oppose contraceptives, sterilization and abortion on religious grounds.", "title": "Gay activists sign joint statement with Planned Parenthood backing Obamacare contraception mandate", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.data.lifesitenews.com/images/news/plannedparenthood.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/gay-activists-sign-joint-statement-with-planned-parenthood-backing-obamacar", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "Pro-homosexual forces are lining up beside their pro-abortion allies against those who oppose contraceptives, sterilization and abortion on religious grounds."}, "description": "Pro-homosexual forces are lining up beside their pro-abortion allies against those who oppose contraceptives, sterilization and abortion on religious grounds.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded77\"", "article_summary": "The proposed legislation never even mentions same-sex couples; it simply clarifies and improves existing state protections for religious liberty.\nWe have several areas of engagement,\u201d Wildmon told LifeSiteNews.\nBut American Family Association president Tim Wildmon told LifeSiteNews that pro-life Christians who avoid taking a stand on the issue of homosexuality risk being defeated by a flank attack in the culture war.\n\u201cThe New York Times editorial board [claims] that Arizona has just passed \u2018noxious measures to give businesses and individuals the broad right to deny services to same-sex couples in the name of protecting religious liberty,\u2019\u201d Anderson wrote.\nAnd there is no need for government to try to force every photographer and every florist to service every marriage-related event.\u201d"}
