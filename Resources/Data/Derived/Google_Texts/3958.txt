LAS VEGAS (AP) â€” Jon Jones retained his light heavyweight title Saturday night in UFC 182, unanimously outpointing Daniel Cornier.

Jones improved to 21-1, receiving winning scores of 49-46 from all three judges. Cormier fell to 15-1.

Jones gained the edge with his kicks from all angles and his ability to take down Cormier.

Both fighters exchanged strikes throughout the first round, with Cormier pressing forward continuously. Cormier seized slight momentum in the second, continuing to stalk Jones while landing a number of punches.

Jones stood his ground in the third, mounting more of an attack to match Cornier as the two slugged it out. Jones continued the offensive in the fourth, taking down Cornier twice while limiting his ability to inflict much damage. Both men came out charged for the final round, but settled into a grappling match up against the cage for much of the round. Cormier excited the crowd with a slam with just under a minute to go, but neither fighter was able to finish the other.
