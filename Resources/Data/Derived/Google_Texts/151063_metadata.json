Just like the big cooking challenges on television, the chefs had to come up with a meal plan using only donated items at the Day Shelter for the homeless.\n\nIt turned into a moving experience.\n\nChef Christine Dowd of Aunt Pittypat's Catering is the featured chef this month. She and other chefs from the finest metro restaurants have challenged each other to cook a meal for 300 people using only the daily donated ingredients.\n\n\u201cTo be able to walk a mile in someone's shoes is always eye-opening, so that's been a really great experience and we are excited about what we were able to come up with,\u201d said Dowd.\n\nThey came up with fried chicken, jalape\u00f1o cornbread, salad and desserts.\n\nIt is a treat for the Day Shelter clients.\n\n\u201cIt's not like they get an opportunity to eat food prepared by kind of a celebrity chef,\u201d said Dan Straughan, Executive Director of the Homeless Alliance.\n\nThe challenge is inspired by popular reality cooking competitions. The reality is, the Day Shelter cooks have to be creative every single day using limited items to make a balanced meals.\n\nThe challenge helps put a face on homelessness and hunger in Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cWhen I look out and I see the faces in the crowd, it could be my mother, it could be my brother, it could be my daughter,\u201d Dowd said as she started crying. \u201cThat means a lot, so I hope what we can do opens everyone's eyes,\u201d she added.\n\nChef Dowd said she has some great ideas on new recipes for the Day Shelter cooks to help them maximize their resources.\n\nChef Dowd will now challenge another local chef for next month.\n\nThe year-long \u201cTurning the Table on Hunger\u201d challenge kicked off in March with Chef Kurt Fleischfresser, executive chef of Vast and partner with Western Concepts Restaurants. He was followed by Russ Johnson, chef and owner of Ludivine and R&J Lounge and Supper Club.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Chefs from around Oklahoma City are getting an eye-opening look at homelessness.", "author": "Lacie Lowry", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/29129407/local-chefs-turn-the-table-on-hunger-in-cooking-competition", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7847688_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Chefs from around Oklahoma City are getting an eye-opening look at homelessness.", "title": "Local Chefs Turn The Table On Hunger In Cooking Competition"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7847688_G.jpg", "description": "Chefs from around Oklahoma City are getting an eye-opening look at homelessness.", "card": "summary", "title": "Local Chefs Turn The Table On Hunger In Cooking Competition"}, "wnreadableurl": "local-chefs-turn-the-table-on-hunger-in-cooking-competition", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/05/21", "KEYWORDS": "Homeless, Chefs, cook, shelter, Day Shelter, Christine Dowd, challenge, okc, news 9, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS21", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "Homeless, Chefs, cook, shelter, Day Shelter, Christine Dowd, challenge, okc, news 9, kwtv"}, "article_summary": "The reality is, the Day Shelter cooks have to be creative every single day using limited items to make a balanced meals.\nChefs from around Oklahoma City are getting an eye-opening look at homelessness.\nChef Dowd said she has some great ideas on new recipes for the Day Shelter cooks to help them maximize their resources.\nChef Dowd will now challenge another local chef for next month.\nIt is a treat for the Day Shelter clients."}
