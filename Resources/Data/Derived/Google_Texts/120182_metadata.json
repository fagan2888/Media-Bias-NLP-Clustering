(Hudson Star-Observer photo by Chuck Nowlen)\n\nThe only realtor in the heart of downtown Hudson likes to stay ahead of the curve.\n\n\u201cWe try to think outside the box and do it better than anyone else around,\u201d says Jeremy Cudd, whose four-year-old Property Executives Realty moved to new headquarters at 411 Second St. Sept. 15.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s still a bit too early to showcase what might be the company\u2019s most visible marketing and customer-service innovation from a storefront standpoint.\n\nA state-of-the art, large-screen/touch-screen kiosk will debut in Property Executives\u2019 Second Street window in January that allows both inside customers and outside passers-by to search the company\u2019s real-estate listings, schedule showings and even get pre-approved for a mortgage.\n\nCudd describes the kiosk this way: \u201cIt looks kind of like a big iPhone. \u2026 No other company has that. We\u2019ll be taking window-front marketing to a new level.\u201d\n\nBecoming the only real-estate company in Hudson\u2019s bustling downtown core \u2013- at the former site of the home-interiors company, CocoBello Boutique -- was an innovation in itself, Cudd notes.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be downtown because we\u2019re more than a local real estate company,\u201d he says.\u201d We also wanted to be part of that local hometown feeling downtown because it kind of reflects who we are.\u201d\n\nProperty Executives Realty was previously located on Crest View Drive, but \u201cwe didn\u2019t have a lot of exposure there, and we always want to remain top-line in the minds of our customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love being here,\u201d Cudd says of the new location. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many people walk by our storefront every day.\u201d\n\nYet another innovation for the 14-agent company, which also has offices in Somerset and River Falls: drone-generated aerial videos of listed properties, especially at the higher end.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth it when you\u2019re trying to sell a $1.4 million home,\u201d Cudd explains. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give people the best marketing tools possible.\u201d\n\n@by:No franchise fees\n\n@t:Property Executives Realty\u2019s listings \u2013- which are syndicated to more than 900 realty websites, including the top three, zillo.com, realtor.com and truila.com -- range from $100,000 properties to the million-and-up category.\n\nThe company also opened a full-service property-management company three years ago that includes free attorney collection services. The management company is often a boon to sellers who want to relocate while their properties are on the market, Cudd notes.\n\n\u201cNo one else offers free attorney services for their clients,\u201d he adds.\n\nProperty Executives is not a franchise of a larger company, which Cudd says gives the company more leeway to explore trailblazing initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe dropped the franchise because it really opens up doors from a marketing standpoint and allows us to increase our marketing activities,\u201d he explains, for example. \u201cIt allows us to decide how we want to market on our own, rather than as part of the parent company\u2019s program.\u201d\n\nThe franchise-free model has also helped the company attract some of the best, most experienced real-estate agents in the area.\n\nThey pay no monthly or franchise fees. Property Executives also provides its agents with free errors-and-omissions insurance, free sign allowances, free business cards and free cloud-based transaction management.\n\nAgents\u2019 commission split is 70/30 until a $12,500 cap is met, which is \u201cabout $10,000 cheaper\u201d than the next-best local real estate company, Cudd adds.\n\n\u201cWe offer our agents the best commission split in the business, which gives them the ability to spend more on marketing and results in better services for our clients,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to create success for others, and I\u2019m determined to be great for them. \u2026 We measure success, not by an accumulation of awards, but by the satisfaction of our clients. If they haven\u2019t left with an amazing experience, we haven\u2019t done our job.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the Property Executives agent roster: Hesper Cordero, Joanne Gamache, Cudd, Gary Baillargeon, David Bracht, Sandra Weyer, Curt Jacobsen, Amy McCune, Brian Webb, Gregory Gamache, Denise Krogman, Scott Parfitt, Carol Evans and Peter Grabowski.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take the spotlight because I really have a team approach,\u201d says Cudd. \u201cReally, I wouldn\u2019t be here without our realtors. They\u2019re the ones who make it all possible.\u201d\n\nCudd, a River Falls native who lives in Hudson with his wife Dana and kids Jada, 12, Ryder, 8, and Liliana, 4, opened Property Executives Realty after six years as a top performer at another local agency.\n\nThere were no hard feelings after the move.\n\n\u201cI learned under some of the best in the business, but I wanted to take it to the next level,\u201d Cudd says. \u201cWe\u2019re all in a competitive business here, but we\u2019re all friends. We all know that change is part of the business.\u201d\n\nFor more information, stop in, check out the Property Executives Realty website, http://propertyexecutivesrealty.com, call (715) 381-8297 or email info@propertyexecutivesrealty.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,business,Business,Government,social", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Chuck Nowlen", "og": {"site_name": "Hudson Star Observer", "description": "The only realtor in the heart of downtown Hudson likes to stay ahead of the curve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWe try to think outside the box and do it better than anyone else around,\u201d says Jeremy Cudd, whose four-year-old Property Executives Realty moved to new headquarters at 411 Second St. Sept. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortun...", "title": "Property Executives Realty chases the leading edge", "url": "http://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/news/business/3642443-property-executives-realty-chases-leading-edge", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/bu-PropertyExecutivesRealty.jpg?itok=xTCsx7Hi", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The only realtor in the heart of downtown Hudson likes to stay ahead of the curve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cWe try to think outside the box and do it better than anyone else around,\u201d says Jeremy Cudd, whose four-year-old Property Executives Realty moved to new headquarters at 411 Second St. Sept. 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortun...", "title": "Property Executives Realty chases the leading edge", "url": "http://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/news/business/3642443-property-executives-realty-chases-leading-edge", "image": "http://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/bu-PropertyExecutivesRealty.jpg?itok=Gt_KGUg4", "site": "hudsonwi", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 558004674284026}, "keywords": "News,business,Business,Government,social", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/hudsonstarobserver", "tag": "News,business,Business,Government,social", "modified_time": "2014-12-27T07:29:32-06:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Owner and broker Jeremy Cudd in the reception area of Property Executives Realty\u2019s new Second Street headquarters in Hudson.
