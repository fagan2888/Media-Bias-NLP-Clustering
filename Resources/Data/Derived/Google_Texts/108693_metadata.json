Those in attendance were Anthony V. King, president-elect of NAHSE; Tyra Tomlin, president of NAHSE\u2019s local chapter; Jennifer Campbell Fitzgerald, cochair of the 2014 NAHSE conference; and Denise Brooks Williams, cochair of the 2014 NAHSE conference.\n\nUnder the conference\u2019s theme, \u201cTransformation in Leadership: From Volume to Value\u2026Be the Change,\u201d event organizers expect to welcome more than 500 healthcare professionals representing more than 165 healthcare providers, insurers and companies from throughout the United States.\n\nOn this year\u2019s conference theme, Fitzgerald said, \u201cTraditionally, the business of healthcare has been about volume, number of beds filled and how many people come through your doors. Now, the focus has shifted. What we want to do is prepare and empower our members, from an educational perspective, how to better understand that through the Affordable Care Act, quality, not volume, is the most important thing that we must give our patients.\u201d\n\nTomlin, healthcare administrator at Henry Ford Health System, said, \u201cWe are very excited about this conference coming to Detroit. We are ready to welcome the many healthcare professionals from around the nation. There will also be many local professionals representing healthcare facilities and organizations from this region. We have been informed that the conference will bring about $700,000 to the local economy.\u201d\n\nThe 2014 HAHSE conference will feature numerous workshops, programs and activities, created to educate, train and provide resources to improve every aspect of delivering healthcare services to underserved and underrepresented segments of American communities. The conference will feature speakers and presenters such as Drs. Sampson Davis, Rameck Hunt and George Jenkins, all of whom as youngsters growing up in Newark, New Jersey made a pact with each other to become medical doctors.\n\nIn addition, Jeff Johnson, an award-winning journalist, social activist and political commentator, will speak. Other speakers and presenters include Dr. Ronald M. Wyatt, a medical doctor with the Joint Commission, and Dr. Gail Christopher, vice president of program strategy for the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.\n\nThe conference will also offer attendees the opportunity to participant in a golf tournament and fitness challenge. A community service project, aimed at empowering Detroit\u2019s communities through a partnership between NAHSE and Detroit\u2019s Focus: HOPE, will also be implemented.\n\nHeadquartered in Washington, DC, NAHSE is a not-for-profit membership association of minority healthcare executives with a mission to elevate the quality of healthcare services rendered to minorities and underserved communities, and to promote the advancement and development of tomorrow\u2019s minority healthcare leaders.\n\n\u201cAs healthcare professionals and healthcare leaders, we are all interested in the impact the Affordable Care Act and other healthcare initiatives have on minority communities across the nation,\u201d said King, who in addition to being NAHSE\u2019s president-elect, ready to assume office in 2015, is CEO and executive director of the Detroit-based Wellness Plan Medical Centers.\n\n\u201cAt NAHSE conferences, attendees always have unique experiences in how to best elevate healthcare services to best benefit minorities and underserved communities across the nation. We anticipate that this year\u2019s conference will also be extremely impactful.\u201d\n\nFor more information on the 2014 National Association of Health Services Executives conference, visit www.nahse.org.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Donald James", "description": "Amid growing healthcare disparities in the nation\u2019s African-American communities, as well as rising concerns related to the underrepresentation of minority leaders in healthcare management, the National Association of Health Services Executives (NAHSE) will convene to address these and other healt...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=", "og": {"site_name": "The Michigan Chronicle", "description": "Amid growing healthcare disparities in the nation\u2019s African-American communities, as well as rising concerns related to the underrepresentation of minority leaders in healthcare management, the Nat\u2026", "title": "National Association of Health Services Executives to Convene in Detroit", "url": "http://michronicleonline.com/2014/09/04/national-association-of-health-services-executives-to-convene-in-detroit/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://ionemichiganchronicle.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/medical-lead-art.png", "identifier": "https://ionemichiganchronicle.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/medical-lead-art.png", "height": 1107}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://ionemichiganchronicle.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/medical-lead-art.png?w=1400", "site": "@SingleBlkChick", "card": "photo", "creator": "@SingleBlkChick"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-04 22:41:02", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Michigan Chronicle", "sailthru.title": "National Association of Health Services Executives to Convene in\u00a0Detroit", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=, affiliate-data=, app-argument=", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://michronicleonline.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/e90c789ac24e94118841fb7d3f5de4e6?s=16", "application-name": "The Michigan Chronicle", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-09-05T02:41:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-05T02:41:02+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "30473C9E51B1FA7645F80C5736971CF1", "google-site-verification": "0Kd706y6KY88IVdBacxEhfvF93jEEZJt2FiUAXcpHA8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2611\"", "article_summary": "Those in attendance were Anthony V.
