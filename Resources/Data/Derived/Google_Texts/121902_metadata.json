Starting April 15, thousands of former inmates will be eligible for food stamps and other public benefits.\n\nUntil then, how do you feed yourself when you get out of prison with no money and little help? As part of our health series Vital Signs, we hear from Aous Jarrar. He was recently released from prison after serving an 11-year sentence for bank robbery. Now, without food stamps, he\u2019s one charity meal away from hunger. We caught up with him as he rushed around downtown Oakland looking for food.\n\nBy Aous Jarrar\n\nWalking by that restaurant back there, I smelled some barbecue. Somebody\u2019s really cooking. You know the funny thing? Since I got out, I\u2019ve been really full maybe three times.\n\nIt was a shock to me the morning I woke up out here that my breakfast wasn\u2019t ready. I was in prison for a total of 11 years. I took breakfast for granted.\n\nI\u2019m Palestinian. I\u2019m not a citizen so I don\u2019t qualify for food stamps.\n\nThe prison system, they give us $200 to leave with. I had no clothes, and I have no food. So I had to make the choice: do I want look professional, so I can get a job? Or do I want to eat?\n\nI got certified as a drug and alcohol counselor in prison. This is the career I\u2019m pursuing. So I can\u2019t look the way my clients look. I went to Salvation Army for clothes and bought milk and eggs.\n\nI eat a lot of potatoes. When I first got to [transitional housing,] one of the guys said, \u201cThere\u2019s always potatoes and onions here, so you don\u2019t have to go hungry.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m wearing grey slacks, dress shoes, black V-neck, with glasses on \u2014 I look professional, like someone who has a million bucks in the bank. Little do they know, I got $7 in my pocket to last until the end of the month.\n\nI volunteer for internship hours at Options, [a service center for former inmates,] from 8:30am to 4:00pm. I\u2019m trying to get my full accreditation as a drug and alcohol counselor. But it puts me in this situation where I can\u2019t even make it to the food bank because I\u2019m at work. I\u2019m at the office, so I can\u2019t leave for two hours to grab food.\n\nI fell in love with drug and alcohol counseling in prison. I\u2019m out here, and this is what I really want to do. So if I struggle with it a little bit right now, volunteering and doing an internship, it will pay off in the long run.\n\nJeremy Raff reported this story", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"It was a shock to me the morning I woke up out here that my breakfast wasn\u2019t ready.
