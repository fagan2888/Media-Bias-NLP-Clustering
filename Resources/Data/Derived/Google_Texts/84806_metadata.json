(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Story Highlights KidsCare makes sense for Arizona\n\nIt's 100 percent paid by the federal government and it helps children of the working poor\n\nLawmakers need to make sure it passes\n\nKidsCare is not a trap or a trick or part of some sinister federal strategy to undermine Arizona\u2019s independence.\n\nIt is a trip to the doctor for a sick child. It is a well-baby check for an infant. It is ongoing care for a chronic childhood ailment, like asthma.\n\nThis life-changing, life-saving medical care for children is being offered at no cost \u2013 none \u2013 to Arizona.\n\nAll Arizona's Legislature has to do restart a program that was frozen during the recession.\n\nFederal dollars would cover 100 percent of the costs of taking care of the children of the working poor at least through 2017 and possibly through 2019.\n\nOur state\u2019s health care system would benefit from being paid for medical services to children, instead of facing the uncompensated costs when struggling families with sick kids show up at the hospital emergency room.\n\nOur state\u2019s working families would get a break on one of the most costly and unpredictable expenses.\n\nWho and what we're really talking about\n\nWe are talking about families who earn too much to qualify for Arizona\u2019s Medicaid program \u2013 the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System \u2013 and too little to be able to afford to buy into Obamacare.\n\nWe are talking about Arizona families and Arizona kids. An estimated 30,000 kids would be helped, according to AHCCCS estimates.\n\nWe are talking about a program that every other state uses to help sick kids and ease the burden on working poor families.\n\nMY TURN: Why kids with autism need KidsCare\n\nLAWMAKER: Why we need to act on KidsCare\n\nWe are talking about a move that would bring a projected $76 million in federal dollars to Arizona in fiscal 2017 and $86 million in fiscal 2018, generating tens of million in indirect economic benefits and about $2.6 million in state and local taxes, according to a policy paper by the Grand Canyon Institute.\n\nWe are talking about an idea that won bipartisan support in the Arizona House.\n\nSo why are we still talking?\n\nWhy haven\u2019t we seized this opportunity to help hard-working families?\n\nCost worries are bogus - there's an escape clause\n\nArizona Senate President Andy Biggs is holding legislation that would restore previous cuts to KidsCare, a health-insurance program for children in low-income families. (Photo: David Wallace/The Republic)\n\nOne man. Senate President Andy Biggs declared his dislike for the program and refused to let it come to a vote in the state Senate he leads.\n\nBiggs \u2013 and other conservatives \u2013 say Arizona could be left to pick up the costs if Uncle Sam decides to no longer support KidsCare at 100 percent.\n\nIt\u2019s a bogus argument because there is an escape clause built into the bill \u2013 HB 2309 \u2013 that passed the GOP-controlled House 47 to 12. The bill says that if the feds don\u2019t pay, Arizona can cut the program.\n\nMONTINI: His daughter would be dead without KidsCare\n\nIt\u2019s also pure sophistry to say the program \u2013 if restarted \u2013 would become too popular to cut. Lawmakers cut it once before.\n\nFreezing the program during the recession was touted as a cost saving measure because, at that time, KidsCare required the state to put in one dollar for every three the feds ponied up. The 3-to-1 federal match was so generous that eviscerating KidsCare proved counterproductive.\n\nArizona saved $12.9 million in fiscal 2011 by slashing KidsCare, but the state lost $41 million in federal matching money that year, according to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.\n\nDid we mention it's free to Arizona?\n\nThat federal money would have helped families and the state\u2019s health care industry at a time when people were losing their jobs and their homes.\n\nEven if the feds were still offering a 3-to-1 match, it would be a great deal.\n\nBut what we are talking about now is a health-care plan for the children of the working poor that is 100 percent paid by the federal government.\n\nIf Arizona doesn\u2019t use the federal money that is available to help our children, the money will go to other states.\n\nAs the state budget moves through the hurried last days of this legislative session, there will be opportunities to bring KidsCare to a vote in the Senate.\n\nMake it happen.\n\nKidsCare should pass for the sake of 30,000 kids who need to see the doctor, for the sake of making sure Arizona's health professionals are paid for care that would otherwise be uncompensated and for the sake of the indirect economic benefits of bringing tax money back to our state.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/26r8LWa", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Editorial: There's no good reason to keep kids of Arizona's working poor from seeing the doctor.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "Editorial: There's no good reason to keep kids of Arizona's working poor from seeing the doctor.", "title": "Our View: Quit stalling and pass KidsCare", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/editorial/2016/04/26/kidscare-quit-stallling/83517084/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Editorial: There's no good reason to keep kids of Arizona's working poor from seeing the doctor.", "title": "Quit stalling and pass KidsCare", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/451d9f6eb6b16ae697e5b7441f1ab973d743c9d3/c=809-716-1508-1415&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/13/Phoenix/Phoenix/635883037390321762-ThinkstockPhotos-147059167.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/Arizona", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/Arizona", "title": "Our View: Quit stalling and pass KidsCare", "author": "Editorial board", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorial", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/585ad60394e17d9ddbf96f66725444d19ca43190/c=896-716-1420-1415/local/-/media/2016/01/13/Phoenix/Phoenix/635883037390321762-ThinkstockPhotos-147059167.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ccaf6df0b4087c45bdd32e5613becb6d68b0cb5b/c=809-716-1508-1415/local/-/media/2016/01/13/Phoenix/Phoenix/635883037390321762-ThinkstockPhotos-147059167.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/53cb8dd967b2c43dafcd787a235ea673ec4cecb6/c=693-716-1623-1415/local/-/media/2016/01/13/Phoenix/Phoenix/635883037390321762-ThinkstockPhotos-147059167.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ae6b83bd5342cbe13e4dcd880ae163c61f94aba7/c=539-716-1777-1415&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/01/13/Phoenix/Phoenix/635883037390321762-ThinkstockPhotos-147059167.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-26T06:31:57.493000-07:00", "shorthed": "Our View: Quit stalling and pass KidsCare", "articleid": 83517084, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/87cb50fc4b6366bb47089a3b7023cc2537ee70d3/c=539-716-1777-1415/local/-/media/2016/01/13/Phoenix/Phoenix/635883037390321762-ThinkstockPhotos-147059167.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f7c60655ae5654f545636c34d5d02b62e8cc1a00/c=962-716-1354-1415/local/-/media/2016/01/13/Phoenix/Phoenix/635883037390321762-ThinkstockPhotos-147059167.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "KidsCare, Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, AHCCCS, Andy Biggs, Arizona Legislature"}, "article_summary": "Our state\u2019s working families would get a break on one of the most costly and unpredictable expenses.\nWe are talking about Arizona families and Arizona kids.\nArizona froze enrollment in the KidsCare health-insurance program for low-income families in 2010.\nThis life-changing, life-saving medical care for children is being offered at no cost \u2013 none \u2013 to Arizona.\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Ducey talks KidsCare Yvonne Wingett Sanchez/azcentral.comEditorial: There's no good reason to keep kids of Arizona's working poor from seeing the doctor."}
