It includes sharp cuts in health care coverage and subsidies under Obamacare.\n\nIt's clear that Republicans will hit the campaign trail to say that Democrats have shown that big government doesn't work and needs to be cut.\n\nDemocrats will say that Republicans are indifferent to women and the working poor, also noting GOP roadblocks to hiking the minimum wage.\n\nI think there's no doubt the Democrats will try to use class warfare to divide the electorate, rather than have to defend the Obama Administration's record.\n\nWhat's fairness to Democrats, of course, is something very different to Republicans.\n\n\"I think there's no doubt the Democrats will try to use class warfare to divide the electorate, rather than have to defend the Obama Administration's record,\" said John McGovern, a Republican consultant in Chicago.\n\nSenior Democrats said they view the pay gap issue and the Republican budget as election issues which they believe will help turn out the Democratic base in November.\n\n\"He gave us a gift, Paul Ryan did,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, arguing the budget will motivate Democrats to go to the polls.\n\nDemocrats said they relish the Ryan budget as a campaign issue because it requires House Republicans to vote on a host of discrete provisions, such as cutting student loan aid and slashing education support that can each be used against GOP candidates.\n\nSeniors, often a tough group for Democrats, \"will be motivated\" by budget's Medicare cuts, Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said at a Tuesday breakfast with print reporters.\n\nIn New York, Democrats said they plan to highlight Ryan's cuts in infrastructure spending that Rep. Michael Grimm (R-Staten Island) is expected to back as part of the Ryan budget. Infrastructure is especially important to Staten Island commuters.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), accompanied by Sen.

Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nThe Ryan budget also offers openings for Senate Democrats, aides said. Many GOP Senate candidates are House members who will have to vote on it this week.\n\nSen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who is facing a tough re-election fight, said she \"certainly plans to point out\" the various cuts her opponent, Rep. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), is expected to back as part of the Ryan plan.\n\nDemocrats expect to lose a vote Wednesday on passage of their paycheck fairness measure. But Schumer, who heads the party's policy and communications committee, said the party will force additional votes on the bill later this year.\n\n\"It really resonates,\" Schumer said of the issue.\n\nDemocrats also say they'll force repeat votes on raising the minimum wage and extending unemployment benefits.\n\n\"People turnout to vote for the minimum wage,\" Schumer said, explaining that was part of the reason Democrats are pushing minimum wage ballot referendums in eight states.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) dismissed Democrats talk Tuesday as a sputtering effort to distract voters from Obamacare and the economy.\n\n\"You can look for the Democrats all year long to be trying to change the subject to anything else,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "DAVID FRIEDMAN, JAMES WARREN", "twitter": {"description": "Moves by President Obama and congressional Republican on Tuesday leave little doubt how the parties will seek to fight this year's critical mid-term elections.", "title": "GOP, Dems to fight over pay inequity", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/gop-dems-fight-pay-inequity-article-1.1750328", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1750327.1397018992!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-equal-pay.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "James Warren", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-04-09T05:15:45", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/gop-dems-fight-pay-inequity-article-1.1750328", "parsely-title": "GOP, Dems to fight over pay inequity", "sailthru.date": "2014-04-09T01:15:45-0400", "sailthru.title": "GOP, Dems to fight over pay inequity", "nydn_section": "Politics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1750327.1397018992!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-equal-pay.jpg", "description": "Moves by President Obama and congressional Republican on Tuesday leave little doubt how the parties will seek to fight this year's critical mid-term elections.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Moves by President Obama and congressional Republican on Tuesday leave little doubt how the parties will seek to fight this year's critical mid-term elections.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Moves by President Obama and congressional Republican on Tuesday leave little doubt how the parties will seek to fight this year's critical mid-term elections.", "title": "GOP, Dems to fight over pay inequity", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/gop-dems-fight-pay-inequity-article-1.1750328", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1750327.1397018992!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-equal-pay.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "DAVID FRIEDMAN, JAMES WARREN", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1750327.1397018992!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-equal-pay.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfac1\"", "article_summary": "Democrats will say that Republicans are indifferent to women and the working poor, also noting GOP roadblocks to hiking the minimum wage.\nRepublicans will stymie the bill and are also poised to pass a House budget that would slashes $5 trillion in federal spending over 10 years.\n\"People turnout to vote for the minimum wage,\" Schumer said, explaining that was part of the reason Democrats are pushing minimum wage ballot referendums in eight states.\n), the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said at a Tuesday breakfast with print reporters.\n(J.
