They don\u2019t believe in the democratic process. There\u2019s a way you do elections. You have an argument. You have candidates. You evaluate the candidates. You have a vote, and the majority wins, and the minority says, \u2018Well, we didn\u2019t get the majority, but, OK, we\u2019ll go along because we believe in the greater good.\u2019 Well, there are 40 people who don\u2019t believe in that. [Rep.] Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) would have had the majority. And they said, no, we don\u2019t care. We\u2019re still going to \u2014 we\u2019re not giving up. We\u2019re just going to roadblock. And there\u2019s been a set of institutional practices that have been built up within that institution, and they\u2019re just not playing by those rules. And so, as has been true of the Tea Party for a long time, they\u2019re really good at destruction, they\u2019re not so good at construction. And this is \u2014 to me, it\u2019s deep. This has been a party, and particularly our entire political system, that has lost the art of deliberative argument and then coming to\u2026conclusions. And to get elected, especially as a Republican, you have got to be anti-conservative, you\u2019ve got to be radical, you\u2019ve got to be revolutionary, you\u2019ve got to be an outsider, your language has to be totally radical.\u201d Brooks added that the problem is a \u201cmental problem.\u201d\n\nHe also argued attacking the establishment has \u201cbecome a cheap applause line. But I have a sort of counterintuitive view. If you look at the polls, and you ask do you want there to be a government shutdown? Vast majorities of Republicans do not want a government shutdown. They do not want chaos on Capitol Hill. And so they\u2019re sitting out there, a silent majority, sitting out there, taking a look at this, and think, this is my party? Oh, my goodness. And I happen to feel that, come winter, there is going to be a little reaction against all this, as there was against [Sen.] Ted Cruz (R-TX) the last time he and his ilk did the government shutdown, and there will be a swing toward the more normal candidates. \u2026 When he did a government shutdown last time, the party, the establishment wing of the party was strengthened. And I think this mayhem, with Ted Cruz involved, by the way, is going to, in the end of the day, strengthen the Rubios, the Bushes, the Kasichs, that kind of person.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brooks: Tea Party, HFC Has Made GOP 'Anti-Conservative,' Lacks of Belief In Democracy, Has 'Mental Problem'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Brooks: Tea Party, HFC Has Made GOP 'Anti-Conservative,' Lacks of Belief In Democracy, Has 'Mental Problem'", "title": "Brooks: Tea Party, HFC Has Made GOP 'Anti-Conservative,' Lacks of Belief In Democracy, Has 'Mental Problem' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Brooks-1010-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-10-10T08:31:56-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/10/10/brooks-tea-party-hfc-has-made-gop-anti-conservative-lacks-of-belief-in-democracy-has-mental-problem/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brooks: Tea Party, HFC Has Made GOP 'Anti-Conservative,' Lacks of Belief In Democracy, Has 'Mental Problem'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Brooks-1010-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Brooks: Tea Party, HFC Has Made GOP 'Anti-Conservative,' Lacks of Belief In Democracy, Has 'Mental Problem' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "David Brooks, House Freedom Caucus,Breitbart TV, Tea party,Brooks", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-10-10T07:23:25-07:00", "section": "Breitbart TV", "modified_time": "2015-10-10T08:31:56-07:00", "tag": "House Freedom Caucus", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Tea party"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8120\"", "article_summary": "They don\u2019t believe in the democratic process.\n\u2026 When he did a government shutdown last time, the party, the establishment wing of the party was strengthened.\nAnd so, as has been true of the Tea Party for a long time, they\u2019re really good at destruction, they\u2019re not so good at construction.\nAnd so they\u2019re sitting out there, a silent majority, sitting out there, taking a look at this, and think, this is my party?\nThis has been a party, and particularly our entire political system, that has lost the art of deliberative argument and then coming to\u2026conclusions."}
