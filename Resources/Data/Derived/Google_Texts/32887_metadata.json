The provision has raised the ire of conservatives but repealing it would raise insurance costs for staffers on Capitol Hill.\n\nWalker said that repealing that would \u201clight a fire under Congress\u201d to pass the repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nWalker says he would replace President Barack Obama\u2019s signature law with a plan that would return authority to the states and provide sliding-scale tax credits directly to consumers who don\u2019t get coverage at work to help them buy insurance. The tax credits would be based on age \u2014 not income \u2014 an element that immediately drew criticism as a new entitlement.\n\nGOP rivals chastised Walker\u2019s plan for proposing to help Americans who might not need it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve uncovered the central conceit of Walker\u2019s plan: It\u2019s not conservative in the least. We suspect that he collaborated on it with Bernie Sanders,\u201d said a spokesman for Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who until Monday had been the only presidential candidate to outline an Obamacare replacement plan. \u201cIt creates a new federal entitlement program, which gives money to people without any means testing.\u201d\n\nWashington Examiner managing editor Philip Klein wrote that by including elements such as refundable tax credits, Walker chose pragmatism over ideological purity. The decision reflects Walker\u2019s desire to make the plan politically viable by minimizing the disruption to millions of Obamacare beneficiaries who would otherwise lose coverage, Klein said.\n\nWalker would also expand the role of health savings accounts and allow consumers to buy insurance across state lines \u2014 standard Republican ideas. States would also be able to set up high-risk pools with federal funds to help consumers with pre-existing health problems purchase coverage.\n\nIn a nod to the most popular aspect of Obamacare, Walker pledged that people with pre-existing conditions would be protected. He would eliminate the mandate to buy insurance, but consumers would have to maintain continuous coverage to prevent a large premium increase or a denial of coverage. He also said that states would have more flexibility over a restructured Medicaid, as well as over insurance regulations, such as whether to allow children to stay on their parents\u2019 policies until they turn 26, which Obamacare permits.\n\nWalker leaves many other questions unanswered about his plan, including how many people might be covered and how he would pay for it, except to say it would require no new taxes or fees.\n\nConservative health policy expert Avik Roy, an adviser to Texas Gov. Rick Perry, wrote in Forbes Tuesday that Walker\u2019s plan appears to rely on a $1 trillion Medicaid cut and a revised version of an Obamacare tax on expensive health plans. But Roy argued it would do little to usher people out of government-run insurance.\n\n\u201c[T]he key to improving the way we sponsor health coverage for the poor is not by rearranging the Medicaid deck chairs,\u201d Roy writes.\n\nThe speech comes as the Wisconsin governor is losing his foothold atop the polls in neighboring Iowa and served as an attempt to show he\u2019s the party\u2019s best messenger on Obamacare. It was also a chance to showcase his policy chops in an early caucus state. Minnesota Republicans will cast ballots on March 1, as part of the \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d bloc that could be decisive if the early voting states fail to elevate a likely nominee.\n\nUntil now, the only GOP candidate to issue a plan was Jindal, who has scraped the bottom of Republican primary polls. On Monday evening, Sen. Marco Rubio also laid out elements of a health care plan in a POLITICO opinion piece, which recommended a refundable tax credit that consumers could use to buy insurance, and insurance reforms to protect consumers with pre-existing health conditions. Like most Obamacare alternatives, there are few specifics.\n\nBy offering more specifics than his rivals, Walker hopes to be the candidate to exploit the anger over the health care law \u2014 an issue with continuing potency among GOP primary voters.\n\n\u201cThere is both value and risk,\u201d at being first, said Tevi Troy, president of the American Health Policy Institute and former deputy secretary at HHS during the George W. Bush administration. \u201cThe value is that you appear substantive and that subsequent plans may be seen as a reaction to yours. The risk is that it opens you up to other entities scoring your plan and highlighting perceived gaps.\u201d\n\nWalker also criticized congressional Republicans for not doing enough to block the president\u2019s health law. \u201cThey told us during the last election that if we just elected a Republican Senate, the leadership out there would put a bill to repeal Obamacare on the desk of the president,\u201d he said Monday at the Iowa State Fair. \u201cIt\u2019s August, we\u2019re still waiting for that measure.\u201d\n\nWalker is also seeking to differentiate himself from rivals such as Jeb Bush \u2014 who wasn\u2019t in office when Obamacare was put in place \u2014 and Govs. John Kasich and Chris Christie, who embraced the health law\u2019s Medicaid expansion in their states.\n\nOn Tuesday, he defended what he called a \u201ctough\u201d decision to turn down the federal dollars available through Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThat was pretty tough in a blue state like Wisconsin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew how difficult it would be to repeal Obamacare \u2026 if states were adding to it\u201d by expanding Medicaid.\n\nWalker, who has consistently opposed Obamacare and called for its repeal, has a complicated relationship with the health law \u2014 one that his Republican opponents may be able to exploit. But it is not nearly as clear-cut as the critiques that can be lobbed at Kasich or Christie for supporting Medicaid expansion.\n\nWalker used the Affordable Care Act to cut approximately 60,000 people from the state\u2019s Medicaid plan, moving them to subsidized private plans offered through the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange instead. He then used the state\u2019s Medicaid savings to add more of the state\u2019s poorest residents to the Medicaid program.\n\nWalker has defended the decision as one that focuses on protecting the poorest of the poor without growing the Medicaid rolls. It preserves the state\u2019s safety net and provides health insurance without subjecting Wisconsin to unpredictable federal budget decisions.\n\nHe touted the move on Tuesday, saying that he was the only governor to turn down Medicaid and not leave some poor residents in a \u201ccoverage gap.\u201d\n\nCritics say that the messy plan left many people once on Medicaid uninsured or with an Obamacare plan that cost them more money, and that Wisconsin could have saved more money \u2014 and covered more people \u2014 by expanding Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\nIt\u2019s also not a model that can be replicated nationally \u2014 any state that would want to copy it would have had to start out with a relatively liberal Medicaid plan like the one Walker inherited when he became governor.\n\nBut he can use the approach to burnish the well-worn Republican argument that states need to have flexibility to come up with their own Medicaid plans, not a top-down plan delivered by Washington.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought that notwithstanding all the president\u2019s language on this being \u2018a done deal,\u2019 Obamacare and health care issues are still very much at the center of public awareness, particularly among Republican primary voters,\u201d said Lanhee Chen, a Hoover Institute research fellow and former top policy adviser to Mitt Romney.\n\nFor Walker, the Minnesota speech also helps him emphasize a Midwestern strategy, focusing on states near Wisconsin where his name recognition is high and he has a strong base of support.\n\nThough Minnesota, a Democrat-leaning state, embraced major elements of Obamacare, the state\u2019s large medical device industry \u2014 which includes companies like Medtronic \u2014 has cried out for relief from Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax, and flaws in the rollout of the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange hobbled enrollment for several months.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "But conservative rivals say it would create a new entitlement.", "title": "Walker lays out Obamacare replacement plan", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/08/scott-walker-gets-out-front-with-obamacare-replacement-plan-121464.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/08/17/150817_walker_msm_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Congress,Iowa,Health And Human Services,Health Care,Scott Walker,2016 Elections,GOP,Bobby Jindal,Scott Walker 2016", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "But conservative rivals say it would create a new entitlement.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda518\"", "article_summary": "M.Scott Mahaskey/POLITICO Walker lays out Obamacare replacement plan But conservative rivals say it would create a new entitlement.\nIn a nod to the most popular aspect of Obamacare, Walker pledged that people with pre-existing conditions would be protected.\nWalker used the Affordable Care Act to cut approximately 60,000 people from the state\u2019s Medicaid plan, moving them to subsidized private plans offered through the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange instead.\nBobby Jindal, who until Monday had been the only presidential candidate to outline an Obamacare replacement plan.\nHe then used the state\u2019s Medicaid savings to add more of the state\u2019s poorest residents to the Medicaid program."}
