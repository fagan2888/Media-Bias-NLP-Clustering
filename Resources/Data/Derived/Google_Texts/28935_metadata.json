First, social-media stocks as a group aren\u2019t very expensive, and the best of breed, like Facebook and YouTube owner Google GOOG, -0.16% \u2014 are actually pretty cheap. Second, the flaws of less-premium social-media stocks, like Groupon and Zynga ZNGA, +0.00% \u2014 are well-appreciated and realistically appraised, which is one reason why you\u2019ve routinely seen initial public offerings by social-media firms struggle and even flop, in a way barely seen among 1998-1999 Web companies.\n\nAnd, third, a note that means more to macro investors than those who would chase fast bucks in tech stocks: There\u2019s not enough money tied up in social media to hurt the economy even if a bubble were deflated.\n\nApple\u2019s long road to larger iPhone screens (5:18) Apple is gearing up for its biggest initial run of iPhones \u2013 up to 80 million units \u2013 for the model that is commonly known as the iPhone 6. The WSJ\u2019s Ramy Inocencio talks to Daisuke Wakabayashi about why it took Apple so long to go bigger with its screens.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk numbers and valuations.\n\nThe top exchange traded fund in social media is the Social Media Index ETF SOCL, +0.21% from New York-based Global X Funds. Its top 10 holdings, from Facebook down to Groupon GRPN, +1.46% do trade at a hefty average price-to-earnings ratio of 73. But that weighs equally the prospects of social-media blue-chippers like Facebook, at 48 times earnings, or Google GOOG, -0.16% at 23, with cases like Pandora, a 150 P/E, or Yelp YELP, -0.16% at 220. Since Google\u2019s $400 billion market value is 80 times Yelp\u2019s, weighting their valuations equally is off-base.\n\nMost social-media numbers look fine considering how fast companies are growing. Moscow-based Yandex, Google, Facebook and China-based Tencent Holdings all trade at a growth-adjusted P/E of less than 1.5. Dividing their multiple by the pace of expected profit growth over five years, these names are actually cheaper than health-insurance businesses like WellPoint US:WLP or Old Tech\u2019s Cisco Systems CSCO, -0.07% and comparable to IBM IBM, +0.49%\n\nNext, while the Web\u2019s first rule may be that on the Internet no one knows you\u2019re a dog, that\u2019s not the case for social media.\n\nWhen a social-media company is a mutt, skeptics pounce fast and effectively. Groupon\u2019s accounting problems were diagnosed within a half-hour of its initial IPO filing in 2011. Much the same happened to King Digital Entertainment US:KING this year \u2014 it\u2019s highly profitable, but commands only a 10 P/E because no one will assume the publisher of Candy Crush Saga has more hit games up its sleeve. Even Facebook lost half its value before roaring back to life \u2014 a bit of skepticism that sellers who missed its tripling since must regret.\n\nThere are exceptions to the rule that the market judges social-media businesses rationally.\n\nYelp\u2019s P/E of 72 times estimated 2015 earnings (analysts say it will lose money this year) is mostly amusing. Nice business, sure, but aggregating restaurant reviews isn\u2019t worth twice the multiple that bigger, already profitable TripAdvisor TRIP, -0.45% commands for hotel reviews.\n\nLikewise, if Pandora P, +2.09% were getting profitable enough soon to merit its price, its estimated growth rate would be much higher. But Pandora has too much competition, and too little differentiation, to build profitability that fast. But even here, top Web analyst Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets says the stock commands 50 times next year\u2019s profit before taxes and non-cash depreciation and amortization charges. Still too high for many, but not insane.\n\nAppraising social stocks gets hard when you consider a handful of legitimately important companies that are still probably way overpriced. Twitter TWTR, -0.76% tops this list, and, more controversially, you can put LinkedIn on it too. Editorially, Twitter is one-of-a-kind; financially, it\u2019s an advertising-targeting business among many. Choosing between Facebook at 48 times earnings or Twitter at 922 is easy. Lots of writers put Twitter\u2019s pre-IPO value at about $12 billion, before the market took it to $22 billion today. That\u2019s still broadly right. These companies could grow into their valuations \u2014 or not.\n\nBut you can\u2019t really have a bubble made up of four or five companies, commanding between them a market cap of $40 billion to $50 billion. There are no Pets.coms in this crowd, no mortgage securities made up of loans to insolvent borrowers whose teaser rates will soon reset. They\u2019re all worth something. The worst you can say about LinkedIn LNKD, -0.48% or Twitter is that enthusiasts think they will grow faster than skeptics do.\n\nThe economy faces basically no risk from such a microbubble. If Yelp, Pandora, Zynga and Groupon all closed tomorrow, it would cost the economy $17 billion in lost value \u2014 about what Google shares have gained since July 8. The housing bubble cost $7 trillion. Housing, and telecom in 2000, were bubbles. This is nada.\n\nThe economy and the market may have 99 problems, but a social-media bubble ain\u2019t one.\n\nMullaney writes on economics, health care and technology.
