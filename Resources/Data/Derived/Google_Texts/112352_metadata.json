Besides his academic work, Allen was an activist on behalf of civil liberties.\n\nAllen was troubled by the way government officials used criminal laws to go after labor union members who were on strike or people who spoke out against government actions. In 1935, he founded an organization of like-minded people and called it the Iowa Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe organization was the fifth affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union and was the first to be formed outside one of the nation\u2019s major metropolitan areas.\n\nThere\u2019s much irony, therefore, that Iowa State University has named one of two designated \u201cfree speech zones\u201d on campus after Allen. The Edward S. Allen Area of Free Debate is where ISU students, employees and the public are supposed to go to express their views on any topic.\n\nThose who wonder how the largest public university in Iowa can control where people speak out are asking an excellent question. But the ISU policy on what officials call \u201cpublic forum areas\u201d is part of a movement at many U.S. colleges to limit the free expression of ideas.\n\nA Yale University lecturer was forced to resign this fall after she challenged a notice from Yale\u2019s Intercultural Affairs Committee about Halloween costumes. The directive said it would be insensitive for students to wear costumes that symbolized \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d by including such things as feathered headdresses, turbans, war paint, blackface or red face, or that made fun of people.\n\nLecturer Erika Christakis urged students to decide for themselves what costumes they wanted to wear to parties \u2014 even if their costumes were \u201cobnoxious,\u201d \u201cinappropriate,\u201d \u201cprovocative\u201d or \u201coffensive.\u201d If a student doesn\u2019t like another student\u2019s costume, look away or tell the student you are offended, she told students.\n\nBut some students found her advice to be offensive. Yale President Peter Salovey defended what he called the students\u2019 \u201cgreat distress.\u201d He said Yale supported better diversity through \u201cgreater inclusion, healing, mutual respect, and understanding.\u201d\n\nThe turmoil on campuses over free speech isn\u2019t confined to Yale or Iowa State.\n\nWe saw this at the University of Missouri and Amherst College this fall. We saw it last year at Rutgers University and the University of California-Berkeley, where students pressured former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and commentator Bill Maher to be dropped as commencement speakers. We saw this at the University of Iowa, where an artist\u2019s sculpture of a Ku Klux Klan member clad in a robe of newspaper clippings about racial violence was removed at the direction of administrators after some students protested its presence.\n\nAt Amherst, a group of students demanded that officials discipline students who put up posters that said, \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cIn memoriam of the true victim of the Missouri protests: free speech, 1776-2015.\u201d\n\nSomewhere along the line, students and administrators forgot, or never learned, that the free speech guarantee in the U.S. Constitution gives people the right to say what is on their minds, even if it offends other people. There\u2019s no better example than Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has stepped on more toes than a beginning ballroom dancer.\n\nWhile students say they like diversity on campus, it really seems that they want views and speakers they agree with, rather than speakers with views that challenge students to rethink their own opinions. And administrators prefer to focus on their schools\u2019 diversity by talking about race, gender or sexual orientation, rather than diversity of ideas.\n\nUI political science professor Tim Hagle told reporters after the KKK art controversy, \u201cThe First Amendment protects offensive and insensitive speech. It's not enough to say, \u2018We respect freedom of speech.\u2019 \u201c\n\nBack to Iowa State University and its free speech zones:\n\nThere are but two designated \u201careas of free debate\u201d on the 2,000-acre Ames campus. People can use one of those areas for what the school calls \u201cexpressive activities.\u201d\n\nBut people who want to use other areas must notify the university\u2019s event management office at least three hours in advance. Approval isn\u2019t necessary if the event meets certain criteria about the hours of the event and the proximity to classroom buildings.\n\nEvents that don\u2019t meet those criteria need to be submitted for approval at least four days in advance. Approval is based on whether the university thinks the event is appropriate for the location.\n\nSomehow for most of its existence, Iowa State University managed to get along without any free speech zones. Of course, that\u2019s how Edward Allen \u2014 and our founding fathers \u2014 envisioned free speech should work.\n\nRandy Evans is executive director of the Iowa Freedom of Information Council and a former Register opinion editor.
