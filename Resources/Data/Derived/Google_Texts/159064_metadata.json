Unlike the pervasive, confused silence on the issue of elective-abortion coverage reported last October by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, insurance companies now are seemingly able to answer the question, \u201cDo your individual plans offered on the exchange cover elective abortion?\u201d The only problem: Those answers keep changing depending on who\u2019s talking.\n\nTo begin at the beginning, CLI selected New York\u2019s health-insurance exchange as a starting point to identify which individual plans include or exclude elective abortion \u2014 or \u201cinterruption of pregnancy,\u201d as it is also termed in the state\u2019s insurance lingo. Via the exchange\u2019s web chat, CLI recently asked a representative whether the multi-state plans offered in New York cover elective abortion. The representative replied, \u201cThis information is not in my portal.\u201d But she did provide a helpful URL to the directory of all the insurance companies in question, so that CLI could contact each directly.\n\nAnd down the rabbit hole we went.\n\nOur findings include these exceptional instances of readily given and yet inconsistent replies to the question of whether elective abortion is covered:\n\nUnited Healthcare\u2019s plans in New York In sum: No, none do; and, yes, all do.\n\nOne agent contacted by phone on July 7 said that none of their plans covers elective abortion. Another representative informed CLI by phone on July 22 that all United Healthcare plans on the New York exchange cover elective abortion, quoting the plan as permitting \u201cone procedure per member per calendar year.\u201d\n\nEmpire BlueCross BlueShield\u2019s plans in New York In sum: Yes, all do cover elective abortion, including the multi-state plans (MSPs). (But, under the terms of Obamacare, at least one MSP in each state must exclude coverage of elective abortion.) And, no, none do.\n\nTwo licensed agents contacted by phone on July 1 and 2 stated, \u201cAll of [Empire\u2019s plans on the New York exchange] cover elective abortion.\u201d When asked if the MSPs offered on the exchange do as well, both emphatically confirmed this twice, one declaring that the \u201cbenefits do not change\u201d according to whether the plan is an MSP or not.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM), on the other hand, states: \u201cAs required by the Affordable Care Act, MSP insurers in each State must offer at least one plan that does not include elective abortion services.\u201d CLI sent a letter to Empire BlueCross BlueShield on July 10 requesting clarification; we still await a reply.\n\nTwo live-chat agents contacted on July 22 informed CLI that no elective abortions are covered, one explaining that \u201cit will be considered\u201d only \u201cif it is medically necessary.\u201d When asked for the definition of medical necessity, the agent responded: \u201chealth-care services or supplies needed to prevent, diagnose, or treat an illness, injury, condition, disease, or its symptoms and that meet accepted standards of medicine.\u201d The agent then apologized that there wasn\u2019t a plan document online stating this. She added: \u201cI know that information because that is what the direct-sales team has been told.\u201d The second live-chat agent likewise stated, \u201cNone of our plans cover elective abortion.\u201d\n\nCLI also looked at individual-marketplace plans in Vermont, a state that lacks legislation banning elective abortion in the exchange and that does not currently participate in the Multi-State Plan Program \u2014 which means that all plans in Vermont are free to cover elective abortion. (It is also on the fast track to being the first state with a single-payer system.)\n\nMVP\u2019s plans in Vermont \u200b In sum: No, none do; no, you need authorization; yes, all do, and you do not need authorization; yes, all do again; sorry, really, none do.\n\nA live-chat agent informed CLI on July 16 that elective abortion is not covered. We were inexplicably disconnected after asking for a plan document stating this.\n\nIn a follow-up phone conversation that same day, a representative stated that only \u201cmedically necessary\u201d abortions are covered. When asked to define what constitutes medical necessity, she replied: \u201cAuthorization is required \u2014 the reason for it, and whether the doctor sees a need \u2014 on a case-by-case basis.\u201d She explained that the doctor submits records and authorization, and these go to \u201cMVP\u2019s authorization department and medical board for review.\u201d\n\nAnother live-chat agent notified CLI on July 17 that \u201call [MVP\u2019s] individual plans cover [elective abortion]\u201d just as their New York plans do. After touting his status as a \u201c13-year veteran rep,\u201d he said: \u201c . . . \u2018Medically necessary\u2019 just means that you\u2019re having the service because you want to, and it [has] nothing to do with anything cosmetic or experimental. Most everything in the insurance world starts out with \u2018medically necessary.\u2019 It\u2019s legal jargon.\u201d He went on to explain: \u201cYou\u2019d have to be worried if you were working for a church or religious group, some of them are allowed to exclude abortion coverage, it gets complicated. But all the individual plans cover it.\u201d\n\nA third live-chat agent clarified on July 21, saying, \u201cYes, these plans cover elective abortion based on Federal Health Care Reform.\u201d When asked about the language of \u201cmedically necessary\u201d as mentioned in an MVP Member Handbook in New York State, she corrected herself, saying, \u201cNo, actually I am very sorry, elective termination of pregnancy is not covered in Vermont for Vermont Health Connect policies.\u201d After being asked for a plan document that would state this exclusion, she replied: \u201cI am unable to locate a document [containing this exclusion] that is on the MVP website. You can use this chat as verification that elective termination of pregnancy is not covered in Vermont.\u201d Upon being asked further if there might be a hard-copy document stating this exclusion, and if she could mail it, she responded: \u201cI checked on that for you while trying to locate a document online for you, and I was advised that you can copy this chat as verification.\u201d\n\nBesides these conflicting accounts, CLI received the following wide array of responses from New York marketplace insurance companies after requesting a plan document confirming the inclusion or exclusion:\n\nCan\u2019t e-mail any specific plan document because \u201cso many [plan] files were transferred to the exchange,\u201d and the company website now has \u201climited information.\u201d \u2014 Independent Health\n\nPlan documents are \u201clegal documents\u201d and therefore are \u201cnot available to be mailed to non-members.\u201d \u2014 Emblem Health\n\nNot able to e-mail a sample plan document, but can send via snail mail, and should arrive within 10 to14 days from request on July 3. CLI subsequently received plan documents, but there was no information on abortion coverage. \u2014 Capital District Physicians\u2019 Health Plan and Healthfirst New York\n\nAbortion information is \u201conly in Member Contracts, and I cannot send these to non-members.\u201d \u2014 Oscar\n\nThe bottom line? The ongoing clamor for transparency in health-insurance exchanges under Obamacare is fully warranted. Of the 300-plus plans offered by the 18 insurance companies on New York\u2019s individual marketplace that CLI inspected, virtually no company listed any \u201cinterruption of pregnancy\u201d information in its Summary of Benefits and Coverage. There was one exception: the Catholic-run Fidelis Care, which excludes it.\n\nTo be fair, a few companies do provide this information online, but only in Member Handbooks, Member Guides, or Member Contracts, which are not necessarily located in the same place online as the accompanying plan, if they are available for viewing pre-purchase at all.\n\nIf a woman\u2019s \u201cright to choose\u201d is so essential, why wouldn\u2019t her \u201cchoices\u201d be clearly stated on each plan\u2019s Summary of Benefits and Coverage? If the plan covers elective abortion, it could easily specify that in its Services You May Need section. If it does not offer this coverage, it could state that in its Excluded Services section. Why not make it as simple to view a plan\u2019s abortion-coverage rules as it is to assess contraception coverage? BlueShield of Northeastern New York\u2019s benefits layout, for instance, shows its contraception coverage directly on its website: \u201cGeneric oral contraceptives \u2014 covered in full.\u201d Whether one identifies oneself as \u201cpro-life\u201d or \u201cpro-choice,\u201d this \u201cyes, no, maybe\u201d guessing game about abortion coverage is utterly unacceptable.\n\n\u2014 Genevieve C.

Unlike the pervasive, confused silence on the issue of elective-abortion coverage\u00a0reported last October by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, insurance companies now are seemingly able to answer the question, \u201cDo your individual plans offered on the exchange cover elective abortion?\u201d The only problem: Those answers keep changing depending on who\u2019s talking.\n\n#ad#To begin at the beginning, CLI selected New York\u2019s health-insurance exchange as a starting point to identify which individual plans include or exclude elective abortion \u2014 or \u201cinterruption of pregnancy,\u201d as it is also termed in the state\u2019s insurance lingo. Via the exchange\u2019s web chat, CLI recently asked a representative whether the multi-state plans offered in New York cover elective abortion. The representative replied, \u201cThis information is not in my portal.\u201d But she did provide a helpful URL to the directory of all the insurance companies in question, so that CLI could contact each directly.\n\nAnd down the rabbit hole we went.\n\nOur findings include these exceptional instances of readily given and yet inconsistent replies to the question of whether elective abortion is covered:\n\nUnited Healthcare\u2019s plans in New York\u00a0In sum: No, none do; and, yes, all do.\n\nOne agent contacted by phone on July 7 said that none of their plans covers elective abortion. Another representative informed CLI by phone on July 22 that all United Healthcare plans on the New York exchange cover elective abortion, quoting the plan as permitting \u201cone procedure per member per calendar year.\u201d\n\nEmpire BlueCross BlueShield\u2019s plans in New York\u00a0In sum: Yes, all do cover elective abortion, including the multi-state plans (MSPs). (But, under the terms of Obamacare, at least one MSP in each state must exclude coverage of elective abortion.) And, no, none do.\n\nTwo licensed agents contacted by phone on July 1 and 2 stated, \u201cAll of [Empire\u2019s plans on the New York exchange] cover elective abortion.\u201d When asked if the MSPs offered on the exchange do as well, both emphatically confirmed this twice, one declaring that the \u201cbenefits do not change\u201d according to whether the plan is an MSP or not.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM), on the other hand, states: \u201cAs required by the Affordable Care Act, MSP insurers in each State must offer at least one plan that does not include elective abortion services.\u201d CLI sent a letter to Empire BlueCross BlueShield on July 10 requesting clarification; we still await\u00a0a reply.\n\nTwo live-chat agents contacted on July 22 informed CLI that no elective abortions are covered, one explaining that \u201cit will be considered\u201d only \u201cif it is medically necessary.\u201d When asked for the definition of medical necessity, the agent responded: \u201chealth-care services or supplies needed to prevent, diagnose, or treat an illness, injury, condition, disease, or its symptoms and that meet accepted standards of medicine.\u201d The agent then apologized that there wasn\u2019t a plan document online stating this. She added: \u201cI know that information because that is what the direct-sales team has been told.\u201d The second live-chat agent likewise stated, \u201cNone of our plans cover elective abortion.\u201d\n\nCLI also looked at individual-marketplace plans in Vermont, a state that lacks legislation banning elective abortion in the exchange\u00a0and that does not currently participate in the Multi-State Plan Program \u2014 which means that all plans in Vermont are free to cover elective abortion. (It is also on the fast track to being the first state with a single-payer system.)\n\nMVP\u2019s plans in Vermont \u200b In sum: No, none do; no, you need authorization; yes, all do, and you do not need authorization; yes, all do again; sorry, really, none do.\n\nA live-chat agent informed CLI on July 16 that elective abortion is not covered. We were inexplicably disconnected after asking for a plan document stating this.\n\n#page#In a follow-up phone conversation that same day, a representative stated that only \u201cmedically necessary\u201d abortions are covered. When asked to define what constitutes medical necessity, she replied: \u201cAuthorization is required \u2014 the reason for it, and whether the doctor sees a need \u2014 on a case-by-case basis.\u201d She explained that the doctor submits records and authorization, and these go to \u201cMVP\u2019s authorization department and medical board for review.\u201d\n\nAnother live-chat agent notified CLI on July 17 that \u201call [MVP\u2019s] individual plans cover [elective abortion]\u201d just as their New York plans do. After touting his status as a \u201c13-year veteran rep,\u201d he said: \u201c\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0 \u2018Medically necessary\u2019 just means that you\u2019re having the service because you want to, and it [has] nothing to do with anything cosmetic or experimental. Most everything in the insurance world starts out with \u2018medically necessary.\u2019 It\u2019s legal jargon.\u201d He went on to explain: \u201cYou\u2019d have to be worried if you were working for a church or religious group, some of them are allowed to exclude abortion coverage, it gets complicated. But all the individual plans cover it.\u201d\n\n#ad#A third live-chat agent clarified on July 21, saying, \u201cYes, these plans cover elective abortion based on Federal Health Care Reform.\u201d When asked about the language of \u201cmedically necessary\u201d as mentioned in an MVP Member Handbook in New York State, she corrected herself, saying, \u201cNo, actually I am very sorry, elective termination of pregnancy is not covered in Vermont for Vermont Health Connect policies.\u201d After being asked for a plan document that would state this exclusion, she replied: \u201cI am unable to locate a document\u00a0[containing this exclusion] that is on the MVP website. You can use this chat as verification that elective termination of pregnancy is not covered in Vermont.\u201d Upon being asked further if there might be a hard-copy document stating this exclusion, and\u00a0if she could mail it, she responded: \u201cI checked on that for you while trying to locate a document online for you, and I was advised that you can copy this chat as verification.\u201d\n\nBesides these conflicting accounts, CLI received the following wide array of responses from New York marketplace insurance companies after requesting a plan document confirming the inclusion or exclusion:\n\nCan\u2019t e-mail any specific plan document because \u201cso many [plan] files were transferred to the exchange,\u201d and the company website now has \u201climited information.\u201d \u2014 Independent Health\n\nPlan documents are \u201clegal documents\u201d and therefore are \u201cnot available to be mailed to non-members.\u201d \u2014 Emblem Health\n\nNot able to e-mail a sample plan document, but can send via snail mail, and should arrive within 10 to14 days from request on July 3. CLI subsequently received plan documents, but there was no information on abortion coverage. \u2014 Capital District Physicians\u2019 Health Plan and Healthfirst New York\n\nAbortion information is \u201conly in Member Contracts, and I cannot send these to non-members.\u201d \u2014 Oscar\n\nThe bottom line? The ongoing clamor for transparency in health-insurance exchanges under Obamacare is fully warranted. Of the 300-plus plans offered by the 18 insurance companies on New York\u2019s individual marketplace that CLI inspected, virtually no company listed any \u201cinterruption of pregnancy\u201d information in its Summary of Benefits and Coverage.\u00a0There was one exception: the Catholic-run Fidelis Care, which excludes it.\n\nTo be fair, a few companies do provide this information online, but only in Member Handbooks, Member Guides, or Member Contracts, which are not necessarily located in the same place online as the accompanying plan, if they are available for viewing pre-purchase at all.\n\nIf a woman\u2019s \u201cright to choose\u201d is so essential, why wouldn\u2019t her \u201cchoices\u201d be clearly stated on each plan\u2019s Summary of Benefits and Coverage? If the plan covers elective abortion, it could easily specify that in its Services You May Need section. If it does not offer this coverage, it could state that in its Excluded Services section. Why not make it as simple to view a plan\u2019s abortion-coverage rules as it is to assess contraception coverage? BlueShield of Northeastern New York\u2019s benefits layout, for instance, shows its contraception coverage directly on its website: \u201cGeneric oral contraceptives \u2014 covered in full.\u201d Whether one identifies oneself as \u201cpro-life\u201d or \u201cpro-choice,\u201d this \u201cyes, no, maybe\u201d guessing game about abortion coverage is utterly unacceptable.\n\n\u2014 Genevieve C.
