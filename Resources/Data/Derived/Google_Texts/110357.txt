LITTLE ROCK,Ark.--There was an aquatic meet and greet at the Little Rock Zoo Saturday afternoon.

The zoo was celebrating their annual blast with a penguin and alligator show.

Dozens of families with their little ones were one hand for the fun event.

Many of them learned how both species survive during the cold months.

The event was all about bridging the gap between science and nature.

The kiddos also had the chance to meet Disney movie, "Frozen", character
