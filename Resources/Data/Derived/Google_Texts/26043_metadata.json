The pair recently reconciled their seven-year relationship following a three-month separation. It was intended to be a one-day or potentially weekend trip, with kids in tow, according to Evie's mom Debbie Kenworthy.\n\n\"When [Evie] left, she hugged me and said, 'I love you and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow,'\" Debbie Kenworthy told The Huffington Post on Friday.\n\nEvie did not pack any clothes for herself or their children, ages 1, 2 and 4, but according to Debbie, Evie's boyfriend \"took all of his clothes.\"\n\n\"He took everything except his cell phone, which I find unusual,\" she told The Huffington Post.\n\nEvie has not responded to her mother's calls or texts. Hominy and Osage County police have tried contacting the family's cell phones, but they appear to be turned off, reported TulsaWorld.com.\n\nThe family of five was last seen in a gray, late-model Ford Escape with an Osage Nation license plate.\n\n\"This is highly unusual. My daughter is the type of person who is always in contact with her family, but there\u2019s been nothing,\" said Debbie, comparing the worrisome disappearance to an \"alien abduction.\"\n\nAnyone who may have seen the family or may have knowledge of the family's whereabouts is asked to call Hominy police at 918-885-4545, the Osage County Sheriff's Office at 918-287-3535, or a local law-enforcement agency.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Osage Nation member Evie Kenworthy, 21, her boyfriend Robert Moseley, 26, and their three young children have been reported missing since February 27.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/03/19/missing-three-weeks-osage-nation-mother-children-and-boyfriend-163818", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/eviekenworthyfamily.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Missing for Three Weeks: Osage Nation Mother, Children and Boyfriend"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/03/19/missing-three-weeks-osage-nation-mother-children-and-boyfriend-163818", "dc": {"title": "Missing for Three Weeks: Osage Nation Mother, Children and Boyfriend"}, "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-19T17:19-04:00", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Missing for Three Weeks: Osage Nation Mother, Children and Boyfriend"}, "article_summary": "Osage Nation member Evie Kenworthy, 21, her boyfriend Robert Moseley, 26, and their three young children have been reported missing since February 27.\nThe family of five was last seen in a gray, late-model Ford Escape with an Osage Nation license plate.\nHominy and Osage County police have tried contacting the family's cell phones, but they appear to be turned off, reported TulsaWorld.com.\nEvie did not pack any clothes for herself or their children, ages 1, 2 and 4, but according to Debbie, Evie's boyfriend \"took all of his clothes.\"\n\"When [Evie] left, she hugged me and said, 'I love you and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow,'\" Debbie Kenworthy told The Huffington Post on Friday."}
