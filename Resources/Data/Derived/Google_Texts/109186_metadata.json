Franchisees who own more than one restaurant could use that tactic to keep their number of full-time employees below the threshold that activates the law, which is 100 full-timers as of next year and 50 as of 2016. Still other employers figure it\u2019s cheaper to pay the penalty than offer insurance.\n\n\u201cOne franchise partner said he\u2019ll pay the fine and pay his workers more money so they can pay for insurance themselves,\u201d said Andy Wiederhorn, chief executive of Fatburger North America Inc., which owns the Buffalo\u2019s Caf\u00e9 and Fatburger chains. \u201cSome franchisees have already rearranged their ownership structure so that if there are two partners who own two restaurants, they each become owners of one.\u201d\n\nPaul Dalrymple wholly owns two Buffalo\u2019s Cafes in Georgia and has a majority stake in three others. He\u2019s considering either selling some of his restaurants or changing their ownership structure to reduce his number of full-time workers.\n\nHalf of his 200 employees are full-time, and he notified his managers earlier this month that he will stop providing them with health insurance starting on Oct. 31. Nor will he start offering hourly workers insurance next year. He\u2019s cutting workers\u2019 hours to reduce the number of eligible employees\u2013the health law doesn\u2019t require coverage for employees working less than 30 hours a week\u2014but likely will face fines.\n\n\u201cThe typical age range of my hourly employees is 17 to 21 and they don\u2019t even want insurance. My turnover rate is 300% to 400%. I can\u2019t afford to shoulder the burden of providing insurance for people who might not be with us in three months,\u201d he said.\n\nPanera Bread decided not to cut workers\u2019 hours, but has been looking for other ways to contain costs, such as by joining a private health insurance exchange called RightOpt, which is run by Xerox Buck Consultants. The exchange includes other companies and therefore is supposed to keep prices down for the employer and employee.\n\nIf the Panera employee who contacts RightOpt appears to be eligible for Medicaid, RightOpt can help them enroll, according to Panera. Panera also is adding a high-deductible, preventive health plan for hourly employees starting next year.\n\n\u201cPart of the unknown is that you had a group of people who weren\u2019t eligible before, so it\u2019s hard to predict what the uptake will be,\u201d said Liz Dunlap, Panera\u2019s chief people officer. \u201cThey could be covered under their parent\u2019s plan or spouse\u2019s plan. If they do enroll with us, will they enroll as themselves or with others in their family and which plan will they select?\u201d\n\nReducing employees\u2019 hours or hiring part-timers in lieu of full-timers has created another conundrum for employers. To provide the same level of service, many have had to hire more part-time workers to cover the same number of shifts, increasing their labor costs at a time of rising minimum wages.\n\nTo address that, Buffalo Wild Wings is replacing outgoing employees who worked about 38 hours a week with new ones who will work 40, while departing employees who worked closer to 30 hours a week are being replaced with people who will work 28 or fewer. That will let the chain fill any lost hours without having to hire extra part-timers, said Chief Executive Sally Smith.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the option to get customers to help cover increased costs related to the health care law, by increasing menu prices.\n\nFatburger\u2019s Mr. Wiederhorn said his franchisees have already raised sandwich prices by 25 cents to 50 cents to overcome rising commodity costs, and he expects to see another 10% increase in sandwich prices in January, when the employer penalties in the health law are set to kick in.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Restaurant owners facing the prospect of fines for not offering workers affordable health insurance are finding some creative ways to keep the number of eligible employees to a minimum.", "title": "Restaurant Owners Look for Creative Ways to Escape Health-Law Penalties", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/10/22/restaurant-owners-look-for-creative-ways-to-escape-health-law-penalties/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Restaurant Owners Look for Creative Ways to Escape Health-Law Penalties", "description": "Restaurant owners facing the prospect of fines for not offering workers affordable health insurance are finding some creative ways to keep the number of eligible employees to a minimum.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Julie Jargon", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "Restaurant owners facing the prospect of fines for not offering workers affordable health insurance are finding some creative ways to keep the number of eligible employees to a minimum.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-22T19:15:39-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/10/22/restaurant-owners-look-for-creative-ways-to-escape-health-law-penalties/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-5692", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Restaurant owners facing the prospect of fines for not offering workers affordable health insurance are finding some creative ways to keep the number of eligible employees to a minimum.", "title": "Restaurant Owners Look for Creative Ways to Escape Health-Law Penalties", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/10/22/restaurant-owners-look-for-creative-ways-to-escape-health-law-penalties/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-5692", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-22T19:17:01-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd26ea\"", "article_summary": "Restaurant owners facing the prospect of fines for not offering workers affordable health insurance are finding some creative ways to keep the number of eligible employees to a minimum.\nNor will he start offering hourly workers insurance next year.\nPanera also is adding a high-deductible, preventive health plan for hourly employees starting next year.\nHe\u2019s considering either selling some of his restaurants or changing their ownership structure to reduce his number of full-time workers.\nHalf of his 200 employees are full-time, and he notified his managers earlier this month that he will stop providing them with health insurance starting on Oct. 31."}
