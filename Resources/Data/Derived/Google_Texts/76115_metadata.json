They have dominated media coverage this year and this has led to discussions on gun control laws and prompted various public institutions to adopt active shooter drills. It is clear that something must be done with America\u2019s gun legislation, as well as its attitude toward mental illness.\n\nSmaller-scale shootings are covered by media outlets almost weekly throughout the country, which is one reason why the public is increasingly becoming more desensitized to the term \u201cmass shooting.\u201d\n\nBetween 1999 and 2013, over 1,500 people were killed in mass shootings, according to the Congressional Research Service, which used the FBI definition of \u201cmass murder\u201d \u2014 four or more victims murdered within the same instance and in close geographical proximity \u2014 in its report.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, along with politicians from various states, have emphasized the need for more gun control laws.\n\nObama recently released a plan of action for gun control, the details of which have been released in a summary by The National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nOne key point made in this plan asks Congress to pass a $4 billion proposal to keep 15,000 police officers on the streets to help prevent gun crimes.\n\nBut stricter gun control laws cannot be the only solution.\n\nAnother way to eradicate mass shootings is to improve mental health awareness and provide more training to mental health employees across the United States.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s plan \u201ccalls for coverage of mental health treatment under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008,\u201d according to the NCLS summary of the proposal.\n\nIt seems people fail to understand that the root of the issue begins not when a potential shooter is buying his gun, or planning his plot but when he is going through emotional and psychological distress that could have been dealt with early on.\n\nIf these would-be shooters had had help early on to deal with issues from circumstances that life threw at them, they most likely wouldn\u2019t have become shooters.\n\nIt is society\u2019s job to reshape American culture in a way that is conducive to solution-oriented approaches to solving problems that affect everybody.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.dailytitan.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/American-culture-guns-feature-100x60.jpg", "description": "From the 1999 attack at Columbine, to the recent San Bernardino shootings, the American public has become used to seeing news coverage of mass shootings.
