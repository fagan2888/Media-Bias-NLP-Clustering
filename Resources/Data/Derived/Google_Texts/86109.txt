Ventura County Supervisor Kathy Long will ask her fellow board members Tuesday to adopt a resolution dedicating a portion of Highway 101 to a Camarillo sheriff’s deputy killed in the line of duty last year.

Assemblywoman Jacqui Irwin, D- Thousand Oaks, introduced a resolution in January to dedicate a 2-mile stretch of the highway to Yevhen “Eugene” Kostiuchenko. The stretch would run between Lewis and Las Posas roads in Camarillo, near where Kostiuchenko was hit and killed Oct. 28.

Kostiuchenko, 41, was wrapping up a traffic stop on the northbound side of the highway near the Lewis on-ramp when Kevin Hogrefe, 25, of Camarillo, hit him with his vehicle, police said. The suspect, who is free on bail, kept driving but was arrested near Las Posas, authorities said.

Hogrefe is suspected of driving under the influence and was charged with murder and felony hit and run. He is scheduled to return to court July 15.

Kostiuchenko was born in Kiev, Ukraine, and had a master’s degree in linguistics. He served in the Ukrainian Armed Forces and was fluent in four languages. While with the Sheriff’s Office, he worked in detention services and eventually became a patrol deputy in Camarillo. He had aspirations of becoming a canine handler and a member of the sheriff’s bomb team.

He was an avid runner who had participated in a 120-mile race from Baker to Las Vegas with other local officers.

“Deputy Kostiuchenko is truly missed by all who had the pleasure and honor of knowing him, and this designation will serve as a fitting tribute to an extraordinary deputy and gentleman,” Long said in a letter to her fellow board members.

The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to take up the matter at 3 p.m. Tuesday during its meeting in the Hall of Administration, 800 S. Victoria Ave., Ventura.
