I told him, \u2018Larry, I\u2019m going to be absolutely fine.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd she was. On Tuesday, Ms. Wilson \u2014 cancer-free and right on schedule \u2014 returned to the play and to her part as Brenda, Mr. David\u2019s wife. (Glenne Headly had filled in for her.) It was scary but exhilarating, she said, to be onstage again after such an odd, life-changing period.\n\n\u201cIt felt surreal in the sense that all these changes had happened,\u201d she said Wednesday morning, \u201cand yet it felt like it was yesterday.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, dressed in jeans, a fringed-suede jacket and a pair of sky-high, back-in-business heels before her re-debut, Ms. Wilson, 58, spoke with wry, humorous candor about her roller coaster of a winter. Though she belongs to one of the highest-profile couples in show business, having been married for 27 years to Tom Hanks, Ms. Wilson says she normally shies away from such openness.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in public because of the nature of what I do,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t feel it necessary to let the world know what I\u2019m thinking, where I\u2019m eating. I\u2019ve always liked being on the periphery of things.\u201d\n\nShe was ambivalent about this too. Among other things, talking openly about mastectomy seems to invite everyone to stare at and speculate about one\u2019s postoperative breasts, and who wants that? (\u201cBut I guess people always look at women\u2019s breasts anyway,\u201d she said.)\n\nThere was also a message that Ms. Wilson was eager to convey. The cancer diagnosis came after she had to serve essentially as her own health advocate. An early test had come back negative, but something did not feel right, she said. Only after she demanded a second opinion was the cancer discovered.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is about telling people, \u2018You can get a second opinion \u2014 your insurance will pay for it, even Obamacare, God bless it, will pay for it,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to say, \u2018I\u2019m just being paranoid,\u2019 but you should trust your gut.\u201d\n\nShe said she had been astounded and touched by the warmth of people\u2019s response. In her Manhattan apartment building, neighbors she had barely met sent up little gifts \u2014 cookies, flowers, body cream. All four of her and Mr. Hanks\u2019s children came to visit.\n\nAnd before and after the surgery, the couple hunkered down at home, laughing, crying and watching movies. Luckily, they had a pile of Academy Award screeners in enticing DVD cases, begging to be viewed.\n\nNeither she nor Mr. Hanks had ever been seriously ill before, so it was new territory. \u201cWho knew it would make you even closer?\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cYou never know how your spouse is going to react in a situation like this,\u201d she added. \u201cI was so amazed, so blown away by the care my husband gave me. It was such a normal, intimate time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Wilson\u2019s cellphone rang. It was Mr. Hanks, calling for a FaceTime chat from Florence, Italy, where he is filming \u201cInferno,\u201d based on the Dan Brown book. Told that his wife was saying nice things about him in an interview, he flashed a cheesy grin and called out from the screen, \u201cMake sure you print them all!\u201d\n\nMs. Wilson\u2019s friends have smothered her with love and distraction. One friend, hearing that her return date was May 5, said, \u201cOh, you\u2019ll be back on Cinco de Drinko,\u201d and promised to spring for margaritas. Others came, sat with her and gossiped.\n\nLed by the publicly splenetic but privately mushy Mr. David \u2014 \u201cYou don\u2019t think of Larry David as a person who would be this way, but he\u2019s incredibly empathetic,\u201d Ms. Wilson said \u2014 the \u201cFish in the Dark\u201d cast kept in close touch, she said. One actor sent humorous \u201cnightly reports\u201d about how the play had gone, featuring details about a moment, for instance, when a plate meant to be picked up instead stuck to the table, throwing off an actor and \u201cdistracting him from his exit.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be exposed to this amount of goodness \u2014 \u201d Ms. Wilson began. \u201cI\u2019m just incredibly grateful.\u201d\n\nNot that it has been easy. Though the cancer was detected early and she did not need chemotherapy or radiation, Ms. Wilson still feels exhausted. Her body is not what it was. Although Hollywood is practically ground zero for women with breast implants, Ms. Wilson had never gone that route.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it \u2014 it\u2019s an amputation,\u201d she said, of the mastectomy. And for people who do not know this, there is an interim step between a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery, in which a device called a tissue expander is inserted into your chest to make room gradually for new breasts.\n\nRight now, the expander feels hard and weird and looks nothing like what breasts should look like, Ms. Wilson said. She can\u2019t wear a proper bra. For the time being, she is sticking to loose tops and layers.\n\nBut she is hardly at the muu-muu stage of life. When she does have the reconstruction, Ms. Wilson said, \u201cI think it\u2019s going to look awesome.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cFish in the Dark\u201d ends in mid-July, and Ms. Wilson, who is also a singer, is releasing a new album in the fall, after which she has tentative plans to go on tour. Meanwhile, she is reprising her role as Marnie\u2019s narcissistic mother on \u201cGirls\u201d; has a part in a Lorne Michaels-produced film, \u201cBrothers in Law\u201d; and is scheduled to produce \u201cMy Big Fat Greek Wedding 2.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Ms. Wilson said she was worried about what she called \u201canesthesia brain,\u201d in which for a time after an operation you feel fuzzy-headed and not quite as sharp as normal. \u201cI\u2019m running lines like mad,\u201d she said. But when the time came to perform, she said later, it all flooded back, almost as if the part had been baked into her mind.\n\nBefore the performance, the cast showered her with cards and flowers, and there was applause when the curtain came up and she was onstage.\n\n\u201cIt was so much fun,\u201d she said. \u201cI had adrenaline coursing through me like never before. In a way, it was like a second opening night.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20150506175441, "twitter": {"description": "Ms. Wilson has gone back to her role in \u201cFish in the Dark,\u201d opposite Larry David, after a one-month break and a double mastectomy.", "title": "Rita Wilson Talks About Cancer Surgery and Returning to Broadway", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/theater/rita-wilson-talks-about-cancer-surgery-and-returning-to-broadway.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003670285"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "sarahlyall", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/07/arts/07WILSON/07WILSON-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/theater/rita-wilson-talks-about-cancer-surgery-and-returning-to-broadway.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003670285", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/theater/rita-wilson-talks-about-cancer-surgery-and-returning-to-broadway.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "theater", "hdl_p": "One Happy, Healthy Return to Broadway", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/theater/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 6, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "ttl": "Fish in the Dark (Play)", "keywords": "Theater,Wilson  Rita,Breast Cancer,Mastectomy,Fish in the Dark (Play)", "news_keywords": "Theater,Mastectomy", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Sarah Lyall", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/07/arts/07WILSON/07WILSON-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Wilson, Rita", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By SARAH LYALL", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Ms. Wilson has gone back to her role in \u201cFish in the Dark,\u201d opposite Larry David, after a one-month break and a double mastectomy.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/07/arts/07WILSON/07WILSON-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "description": "Ms. Wilson has gone back to her role in \u201cFish in the Dark,\u201d opposite Larry David, after a one-month break and a double mastectomy.", "CG": "theater", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 6, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/sarah_lyall/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/theater/index.html", "section": "Theater", "modified": "2015-05-10", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/theater/index.jsonp", "tag": "Fish in the Dark (Play)", "published": "2015-05-06", "section-taxonomy-id": "21D5B838-29CC-46D3-9006-879CAABC8F08"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "07wilson", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150510164402, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/theater/rita-wilson-talks-about-cancer-surgery-and-returning-to-broadway.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/07/arts/07WILSON/07WILSON-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Ms. Wilson has gone back to her role in \u201cFish in the Dark,\u201d opposite Larry David, after a one-month break and a double mastectomy.", "title": "Rita Wilson Talks About Cancer Surgery and Returning to Broadway"}, "pdate": 20150506, "des": "Mastectomy", "articleid": 100000003670285, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Rita Wilson Talks About Cancer Surgery and Returning to Broadway", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe went, \u2018Oh God, Oh God, Oh God,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Wilson recalled, laughing.\nRight now, the expander feels hard and weird and looks nothing like what breasts should look like, Ms. Wilson said.\nAlthough Hollywood is practically ground zero for women with breast implants, Ms. Wilson had never gone that route.\nThough the cancer was detected early and she did not need chemotherapy or radiation, Ms. Wilson still feels exhausted.\nThere was also a message that Ms. Wilson was eager to convey."}
