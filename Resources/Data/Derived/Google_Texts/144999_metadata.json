Also check out the most-clicked stories below, and then read on.\n\nSteamboat Today's most-clicked stories of 2014\n\nSearch for 2 missing residents end in tragedy\n\nPolice have not yet announced why they think two Steamboat Springs residents died.\n\nThe bodies of Page Stockdale and Mark Schiebel were found Nov. 22 in the back of Schiebel\u2019s pickup at the Sarvis Creek parking area south of Steamboat Springs.\n\nIt was suspected carbon monoxide poisoning contributed to their deaths.\n\nAll of the windows to the truck topper were closed, and there was a charcoal grill in the back of the pickup.\n\nThe search for Schiebel and Stockdale began after Stockdale did not show up for a dinner date Nov. 18.\n\nWoman gets 22-year sentence for son\u2019s death\n\nRoutt County is not immune from unthinkable crime.\n\nOn Nov. 5, Meghan McKeon was sentenced to 22 years in prison for the death of her 3-year-old son, Austin Davis. Police think McKeon left Austin alone for three days before he died March 27 from severe dehydration.\n\nMcKeon pleaded guilty to child abuse resulting in death. District Judge Shelley Hill called it one of the most outrageous and egregious acts that a parent could commit.\n\nDuring her sentencing, McKeon spoke and said she was not a monster.\n\n\u201cI know nothing I say or do will bring my little boy back, but I have hope for a brighter future,\u201d McKeon said.\n\nWoman sentenced to 40 years for murdering son\n\nIn recent years, some of the most shocking crimes have involved innocent children.\n\nIn August, Lisa Lesyshen, 47, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for shooting her 9-year-old son, Asher. The shooting took place May 29, 2013, at her home in Stagecoach.\n\nLesyshen is serving a 40-year prison sentence.\n\nAfter shooting her son, Lesyshen shot herself and now is paralyzed. During the court case, Lesyshen was held at the Denver County Jail infirmary.\n\nIt cost Routt County taxpayers $267,234 to care for her.\n\nBlack bears were big news-makers in 2014\n\nWildlife officials are struggling to deal with nuisance bears in the area because there is no good place to relocate them.\n\nIn a single July night, bears broke into four Steamboat homes in search of food.\n\nIn November, bears caused damage at a hot tub area at The Pines condominiums. The bears were scared away, and the area was fortified so they would not return and decide to hibernate for the winter.\n\nIn an effort to curb bear problems, city officials are considering requiring residents to own wildlife-resistant trash containers.\n\nYampa Valley Electric moves out of downtown\n\nYampa Valley Electric Association made two of the biggest and most impactful real estate transactions of 2014 when it put its old downtown headquarters under contract with a developer and purchased the large empty TIC headquarters as its new home.\n\nThe moves brought more clarity to the future of an entire block of Yampa Street and a large industrial complex on the west end of the city that has sat vacant for years.\n\n\u201cTo have a business like YVEA located (at the former TIC campus) will go a long way in stabilizing the area,\u201d former Steamboat Springs Chamber Resort Association CEO Tom Kern said after the $9.7 million purchase was announced. \u201cIt will become an impetus for what happens next there.\u201d\n\nYVEA moved into its new home in December.\n\nBlue Sage Ventures continues to do its due diligence on the electric co-op\u2019s old headquarters on Yampa Street. The developer plans to repurpose the building into a mix of retail, commercial and residential spaces.\n\nRecreational marijuana has low impact on crime\n\nOn Jan. 8, people stood in line for hours to legally buy pot for the first time.\n\nRocky Mountain Remedies was the first store in Steamboat to sell marijuana for recreational use. Golden Leaf opened March 7, and Natural Choice opened Nov. 20.\n\nDuring the first year, police said the availability of marijuana had a low impact on crime, but they continually reminded people that it is illegal to drive while stoned.\n\nThe owners of the marijuana businesses said sales exceeded their expectations.\n\nThe city and state have rules that forbid them from disclosing specifically how much tax revenues the Steamboat businesses have generated.\n\nThird elementary school needed in Steamboat\n\nA demographer this fall told Steamboat Springs School District officials that enrollment at district schools was likely to continue increasing during the next several years, prompting the need for a new elementary school.\n\nEnrollment this fall was the highest ever for the district at about 2,460 students, and demographer Shannon Bingham predicted that number would increase to about 2,700 or 2,800 by the 2018-19 school year.\n\nThe district since has put out a request for proposals for an owner\u2019s representative to study the district\u2019s facility needs and potentially work with an architect to facilitate the planning of a third elementary school.\n\nIntrawest drops seasonal insurance for employees\n\nChanges to the national health care system led to a tough spring for many Steamboat Ski Area employees.\n\nIntrawest, the ski area\u2019s parent company, informed all of its seasonal employees in March that it would no longer offer them health insurance after April 30. The ski area cited changes from the Affordable Care Act as the reason for the cut. The announcement left many employees scrambling to find insurance just days before a March 31 deadline.\n\nErin Gleason, the community and small business health insurance coordinator for the Northwest Colorado Visiting Nurse Association, said the seasonal employees who came to her office for help discovered that their options on the marketplace varied greatly. Some faced higher premiums, while others qualified for subsidies and could get lower rates.\n\nCity of Steamboat tackles downtown parking issues\n\nOne of Steamboat\u2019s most immortal issues entered the spotlight again in 2014.\n\nThe year started with city of Steamboat Springs staff saying they were looking into the prospect of adding paid parking downtown.\n\nParking discussions continued throughout the year, with a highlight being a controversial proposal from council member Kenny Reisman to eliminate 30 to 40 parking spaces on the riverfront side of Yampa Street to make it more pedestrian friendly. His idea narrowly failed to gain enough votes to pass.\n\nThe parking talks culminated with a summer parking study and a slew of small parking changes including some adjustments in parking enforcement hours and a resolve to re-stripe some spaces to open up more parking.\n\nBut big parking questions still loom in 2015. The council appears to be one vote shy of ordering meters, and the city still is looking into the purchase of new license plate reading technology to upgrade its enforcement capabilities.\n\nFuture of Rita Valentine Park still up in the air\n\nA group of children who built makeshift bike jumps in Rita Valentine Park thought they were just having fun when they ended up setting off another passionate debate about the future of the undeveloped park.\n\nAfter a neighbor called the city to report the children, City Council member Walter Magill pushed the city and the council to address what kinds of recreation should be allowed in the park. The council ultimately accepted the recommendation of its Parks and Recreation Commission to scrap a 2009 conceptual plan for the park that called for such things as a disc golf course, a new parking area and trails.\n\nThey then tasked the commission to come up with a new plan after getting public input.\n\nThe scrapping of that plan came after a public meeting, which drew a big crowd of people to talk about the park.\n\nSome in the community see Rita Valentine Park as a prime place to add more recreational amenities, while others want the undeveloped land left alone. The Parks and Recreation Commission has suggested that when they work on a new plan for the park next year, one of the focuses will be on improving existing trails.\n\nBusiness improvement district tax fails, again\n\nDowntown business leaders learned in November they will have to find another way to secure more marketing and maintenance funding for their business district outside of a property tax.\n\nStakeholders in the downtown business district again rejected a tax increase aimed at improving the business district.\n\nA proposal to fund it in 2008 also failed.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the outcome of the vote will impact the Steamboat Springs City Council\u2019s thinking on using an urban renewal authority and tax increment financing to invest millions in infrastructure improvements downtown.\n\nSome council members have suggested that without a funded BID, some other form of maintenance support from private property owners will have to be in place before a URA is considered.\n\nDowntown business leaders already have started meeting again to discuss how they may be able to secure more funding.\n\nGreen Machines in Steamboat are doomed\n\nThere is no free recycling \u2014 that\u2019s the reality that Steamboat and Routt County residents were confronted with in early May when a subsidized recycling drop-off service was cut back then eliminated in the fall.\n\nThe changing economics of recycling led to the end of an easy, feel-good way for area residents to feel like they were doing their parts to save the environment.\n\nThe demise of the Green Machines was precipitated by an announcement from Waste Management that it would begin charging non-customers $5 to drop off recyclables at its yard. That drove more people to leave their recyclables at the overflowing Green Machines at Safeway.\n\nAnother factor in the end of the Green Machines was the city of Steamboat Springs\u2019 realization that the popular recycling dumpsters parked in a grocery store parking lot were in violation of its zoning codes.\n\nCity sales tax collections continue upward trend\n\nSteamboat\u2019s summer season was marked by big concert crowds, tubing traffic and record sales tax collections.\n\nCollections came in 9.6 percent higher from May through August 2014 compared to the same months last year.\n\nIn terms of total sales tax dollars collected, the city had its biggest July in history. The city collected 13 percent, or $218,433 more in July 2014 than July 2013. July also edged close to the amount of money the city collected in the busy ski month of February.\n\nCollections were up 6 percent in May, 8 percent in June and 9 percent in August compared to 2013.\n\nSchool Board takes the lead on open meetings\n\nAnticipating the passage of Proposition 104 by Colorado voters in November, which requires school district contract negotiations to be conducted in open meetings, the Steamboat Springs School Board voted in October to make the meetings public, regardless of the election\u2019s outcome.\n\nThe measure did pass but doesn\u2019t take effect until this month, meaning Steamboat had a head start of nearly three months to better understand what negotiations handled in open meetings would look like.\n\nThe collaborative bargaining team held its first meeting to talk about the new policy in November, and then its first negotiations in December, both of which were open to the public and media.\n\n\n\nCounty sees lots of rainfall during summer 2014\n\nSummer 2014 was so wet that some farmers and ranchers still were trying to harvest their hay crop during late September. August\u2019s total rainfall of 5.05 inches in Steamboat Springs ranked second on the all-time list. And that came on the heels of a wet July.\n\nOnly August 1914, with 5.36 inches of rain, was wetter than August 2014, Matthew Aleksa, a meteorologist intern with the National Weather Service in Grand Junction, confirmed. He said that July here saw 3.69 inches of rain and ranked second only to July 1912, when 4.98 inches was recorded.\n\nProspective tenants face tough rental market\n\nThe fluctuating economy this fall led to one of the tightest rental markets that Steamboat Springs has seen in years, according to state rental data.\n\nApartments and homes listed in the Pilot & Today\u2019s Sunday classifieds were significantly more expensive than similar listings from fall 2013.\n\nLarge complexes like Mountain Village were completely full, and non-employee tenants of The Ponds were being asked to move out to make room for Steamboat Ski and Resort Corp. employees.\n\nA moderately priced apartment complex under construction on the corner of Whistler Road and Skyview Lane is the only new rental housing on the horizon for the area.\n\nLodging tax dollars in city getting spent\n\nIt was a busy year for a group of 14 community members tasked with helping the Steamboat Springs City Council decide how to spend the first year\u2019s worth of lodging tax dollars on local trails and Yampa Street.\n\nIn the end, the dollars were dedicated to a number of trail improvements such as enhanced pedestrian crossings and the purchase of an old home on Yampa Street.\n\nThe home is poised to be removed from the property to make way for a new public park.\n\nWhile most of the Yampa Street money has been accounted for, trail projects will continue to earn millions of dollars in funding in the coming years.\n\nElk River experiences record flow May 28\n\nSpring runoff on the Yampa and Elk rivers were robust in 2014, and although it could not match the records of 2011, the Elk set a new record flow for May 28, reaching 5,370 cubic feet per second where it stayed from 2 to 5 a.m.\n\nThe previous high for May 28 on the Elk River was 4,730 cfs. Eventually, the Elk peaked at 6,300 cfs in 2014. The all-time high on the river was 6,860 cfs, which was recorded June 6, 2011.\n\nThe Yampa peaked at 4,850 cfs where it flows beneath the Fifth Street Bridge in downtown Steamboat.\n\nThe abundant snowpack that fed the rivers led to an abundance of water all summer, and that was before unusually high rainfall in July and August.\n\nThe total volume of flows in the Yampa in Steamboat during June and July was projected to be 118 percent of average. And flows in the Elk were projected to be 145 percent of average during the heart of the summer.\n\nSuper tight county commissioner race\n\nFormer longtime Steamboat Springs City Council member and Republican candidate Cari Hermacinski won the race for Routt County Commissioner District 3 in one of the tightest local races in memory.\n\nOn Nov. 4, Hermacinski\u2019s winning margin over incumbent Democrat Steve Ivancie was 89 votes out of 10,125 votes cast. But there still was a shred of doubt about the ultimate outcome because of how close it was.\n\nAfter all ballots were validated Nov. 13, Hermacinski\u2019s victory margin was trimmed to 77 votes, still not close enough to kick in an automatic recount.\n\nThe election night vote total was 5,107 (50.44 percent) for Hermacinski and 5,018 (49.56 percent) for Ivancie.\n\nOn a percentage basis, the margin of victory was 0.88 percent of the total vote.\n\nUS 40 project beats construction deadline\n\nFor commuters in Steamboat Springs, late summer and autumn 2014 were the season of the traffic backups.\n\nCrews from Connell Resources, working for the Colorado Department of Transportation and under the supervision of Steamboat native Eric Marsh, tackled the major paving project that comprised U.S. Highway 40 at either end of downtown Steamboat. The highway from 13th to Third streets was spared from the construction, which marked the largest highway construction project to affect the city since 2010.\n\nThe paving was combined with rebuilding of intersections and replacement of curbs and gutters. The $5.8 million project, which wasn\u2019t due to be completed until Dec. 5, finished ahead of schedule despite August and September precipitation that was well above average.\n\nSustainable goat ranching arrives in Routt County\n\nCattle are king on Routt County ranches, but Pilot & Today reported in June that the Iacovetto family in rural Milner is tending 1,000 goats in addition to 1,500 head of yearling steers on their 8,000-acre ranch.\n\nThe goats are a way to battle noxious weeds that undermine the quality of pastures on the ranch, while greatly reducing the use of chemical herbicides.\n\nColorado State University agriculture professor Steve LeValley told the newspaper that the sheer persistence of goats actually wears out weeds by eating their flowering tops, which stresses the root system.\n\n\u201cCattle will avoid weed patches,\u201d LeValley said. \u201cGoats are probably a little more aggressive with woody plants than sheep are. They\u2019ll eat brush and roughage that sheep don\u2019t prefer.\u201d\n\nRoutt County Fair turned 100 in August\n\nThe Routt County Fair, held at the historic fairgrounds in Hayden, reached the century mark in August, and organizers made sure the event\u2019s 100th birthday was celebrated in style. There were special ribbons, banners and belt buckles designed for event winners, a commemorative cookbook was published in honor of the anniversary, and the Exhibit Hall set a new record for number of participants submitting entries.\n\nThe county\u2019s first fair, which was held Sept. 9 to 11, 1914, featured an aerial demonstration by W.B. Cooke, the famous bird man of the Pacific Coast, as well as boxing matches and the now-famous horse races.\n\nAfter 100 years, the fair remains one of the most successful continuously running fairs in Colorado with longtime Fair board member Linda Long describing it as one of \u201cthe biggest little fairs in the state.\u201d\n\nFree Concert Series draws record crowds\n\nSteamboat Springs saw a record number of people crowd into the Howelsen Amphitheater on July 4 to attend the Big Head Todd and the Monsters concert, which was part of the 2014 Free Summer Concert Series.\n\nApproximately 7,500 people attended the live show, according to John Waldman, Great Knight Productions concert promoter.\n\nThe series kicked off June 21 with Trombone Shorty and closed Aug. 8 with a show by the Infamous String Dusters\n\n\u201cI think it was one of our most successful series,\u201d Waldman said.\n\nHoly Name building project completed\n\nThe completion of a massive expansion of the Holy Name Catholic Church in Steamboat Springs was marked with a special dedication ceremony in September. The $6 million project broke ground in July 2012 with Fox Construction serving as general contractor and about 30 local subcontractors contributing to the building.\n\nThe construction project more than doubled the church\u2019s seating capacity and also involved the creation of stained glass windows by local artists. To date, 60 of the 170 windows have been completed and the project is ongoing.\n\nStrings Music Festival change in leadership\n\nStrings Music Festival announced a change in leadership this season with Executive Director Kay Clagett set to take her final bow and retire at the end of the 2015 season. She will be succeeded by Elissa Greene, Strings\u2019 current director of artistic administration, education and technology.\n\nIn addition to the change at the top, co-music directors, Andr\u00e9s C\u00e1rdenes and his wife, Monique Mead, retired, and Michael Sachs, principal trumpet for the Cleveland Orchestra, was hired to take their place.\n\nBetse Grassby, Strings director of operations and non-classical programming, retired after 26 years in August 2013, and Anne DeGroff, box office and finance director, who has been with Strings since its early days, will retire this year. Steve Chambers was named as the Strings new production manager.\n\nBeer business is booming in Steamboat Springs\n\nYear 2014 could be tagged as the \u201cYear of the Beer\u201d in Steamboat with two new breweries opening here.\n\nButcherknife Brewing Co., founded by Mark Fitzgerald and Nathan Johansing, boasts a 4,000-square-foot brewery with a tap room, large tasting room and outdoor patio at 2875 Elk River Road. Within its first year of operation, Fitzgerald said Butcherknife delivered more than 1,000 barrels of beer, and the local business was tapped as the Colorado brewery to watch in 2015, according to the Denver Post.\n\nStorm Peak Brewing Co., located at 1744 Lincoln Ave. and founded by Colorado natives and brothers Wyatt and Tyler Patterson, held its grand opening Aug. 2. With a tap room and bar upfront, the brewery offers a range of beer styles from crisp golden ales to darker black ales and other seasonal styles in between.\n\nWyatt Patterson said their plans are to allow the brewery to grow organically and eventually start distributing. For now, Storm Peak brews are available in the brewery\u2019s tap room.\n\nYampa Valley Medical Center turns 100\n\nYampa Valley Medical Center celebrated 100 years of service in 2014.\n\nThe Steamboat Sanitarium first opened in spring 1914, eventually expanding and becoming Routt County Memorial Hospital and then Routt Memorial Hospital before moving into its current facility in 1999 and taking on the Yampa Valley Medical Center name.\n\nThe hospital currently employs more than 500 people in the region and contracts with many highly trained physicians with unique specialties.\n\nDistrict spends $2.8M on efficiency upgrades\n\nThe Steamboat Springs School District spent roughly $2.8 million on energy efficiency upgrades, paying for the updates through Certificates of Participation under a partnership with energy services company Navitas.\n\nThe upgrades, completed this past summer, included more than 5,000 new energy-efficient light bulbs, and remotely controlled thermostats that make it easier to cut energy costs when district buildings are vacant on weekends and breaks.\n\nWall-length sliding glass doors were replaced at the middle school, and light switches were fitted with sensors to save energy when rooms are empty.\n\nLarge sales boost real estate numbers\n\nA series of sizable real estate transactions in the second half of 2014 have helped improve market trends for the region.\n\nThe majority of the Wildhorse Marketplace, including Sports Authority, Wildhorse Stadium Cinema and other businesses, was sold to a local family\u2019s company for $17 million in September.\n\nAlso in September, the Elk River Ranch outside of Steamboat sold for $11.25 million to the granddaughter of Walt Disney, and in November, the Round Mountain Ranch near Clark sold for $12 million to a Wisconsin farmer.\n\nMore than 11 transactions in October topped $1 million, leading to the highest gross volume of transactions in Routt County for October since 2007.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From problem bears poaching food from trash cans and sneaking into condominium hot tubs to Steamboat\u2019s first foray into recreational pot sales, 2014 was a year to remember.", "og": {"site_name": "steamboatpilot.com", "description": "From problem bears poaching food from trash cans and sneaking into condominium hot tubs to Steamboat\u2019s first foray into recreational pot sales, 2014 was a year to remember.", "title": "2014 Year in Review: Top news stories", "url": "http://www2.steamboatpilot.com/news/2015/jan/04/2014-year-review-top-news-stories/", "image": "http://worldwest.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2015/01/03/YearinReview_t640.jpg?a6ea3ebd4438a44b86d2e9c39ecf7613005fe067", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From problem bears poaching food from trash cans and sneaking into condominium hot tubs to Steamboat\u2019s first foray into recreational pot sales, 2014 was a year to remember.", "title": "2014 Year in Review: Top news stories", "image": "http://worldwest.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2015/01/03/YearinReview_t640.jpg?a6ea3ebd4438a44b86d2e9c39ecf7613005fe067", "creator": "@steamboatpilot", "site": "@steamboatpilot", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "1 days", "slurp": "noydir", "tout": {"article": {"id": 171234}}, "article": {"author": "Matt Stensland"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "googlebot": "all"}, "article_summary": "Steamboat Today's most-clicked stories of 2014Search for 2 missing residents end in tragedyPolice have not yet announced why they think two Steamboat Springs residents died.\nUS 40 project beats construction deadlineFor commuters in Steamboat Springs, late summer and autumn 2014 were the season of the traffic backups.\nMore than 11 transactions in October topped $1 million, leading to the highest gross volume of transactions in Routt County for October since 2007.\nAugust\u2019s total rainfall of 5.05 inches in Steamboat Springs ranked second on the all-time list.\nIt cost Routt County taxpayers $267,234 to care for her."}
