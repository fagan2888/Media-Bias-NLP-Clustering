One of the most effective ways to sell your political agenda is to back up your concerns with factual information. That info may be statistical or scientific.

In the absence of solid facts, the next most effective method often seems to be to instill fear. If you don’t support “agenda X” there will be dire consequences.

In the case of global warming, the facts don’t support the agenda.

Temperatures have not increased in 18 years. The 1930s actually have the hottest years on record. Why then do we keep reading headlines that global warming is here and Henny Penny the sky is falling?

Perhaps it is because those pushing this agenda keep changing the so-called facts. Oh, they are masters at using fear. They claim more hurricanes and tornadoes are the result of global warming, even though a hurricane hasn’t made landfall in my home state of Florida in 10 years and last year’s U.S. tornado count was the lowest in a generation. They claim the polar ice caps are melting, even though Antarctic Ice set a new record high — again.

In short, the facts don’t support the theory. As a savvy public catches on, what are those who make their living from global warming to do?

Change the science. That’s right, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is turning science into science fiction — literally.

The federal agency “adjusted” the hiatus in warming out of the temperature record.

New climate data by NOAA “scientists and researchers doubles the warming trend since the late 1990s by adjusting pre-hiatus temperatures downward and inflating temperatures in more recent years.

You read me right. These “scientists and researchers” have determined they know better than the actual weather records what the temperatures around the globe were and are. It’s not fact. It’s not science. It’s their best guess, which by no small coincidence, supports the theory of global warming.

Let’s call it what it is. The science fiction of global warming.
