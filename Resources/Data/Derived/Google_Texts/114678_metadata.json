(Reuters) - University of Scranton employee insurance plans will no longer cover abortions in cases of rape, incest or life-threatening pregnancies under a plan that the Jesuit school says is consistent with Catholic doctrine.\n\nBut the Pennsylvania university's faculty union, which represents about 300 of its 940 full-time employees, says members must first approve any changes to its coverage.\n\nThe union negotiated away coverage for elective abortions nine years ago in return for adoption coverage, but its current contract pays for abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to save the live of the mother.\n\nIn a letter to faculty released by the university on Friday, its president, Rev. Kevin Quinn, said that even limited abortion coverage is \"inconsistent with the moral teachings of the church.\"\n\nThe move comes as Pope Francis, the first Catholic pontiff who is a member of the Jesuit order, prepares to visit Pennsylvania in September. He has called on the Church to deemphasize divisive social issues like abortion and homosexuality.\n\nMichael Friedman, an English professor who serves as union president, insisted that Quinn could not impose the change unilaterally. \u201cThe union must decide,\u201d he said.\n\nStan Zygmunt, a university spokesman, said its lawyers have determined that the school, because it insures itself, need not abide by a Pennsylvania law requiring coverage for those types of abortions in traditional plans.\n\nHe declined to say what Quinn might do if the faculty refused to go along, or if the school would impose the changes only on non-union employees. Half of its employees are women.\n\nQuinn, in a second letter to faculty on Tuesday, said life-threatening pregnancies are rare, but insurance would still cover indirect abortions resulting from procedures such as removal of a cancerous uterus.\n\nFriedman said on Friday that the union plans to meet Feb. 27 to discuss the proposed changes and will also conduct a confidential electronic poll of members.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of fear on our campus that speaking out might damage their employment prospects,\u201d he said.\n\nCatholic universities do not have a uniform approach to abortion coverage, Friedman said. Some cover all abortions, some only the three exceptions, and others none at all.\n\nPlanned Parenthood Keystone issued a statement decrying Quinn\u2019s proposed changes.\n\n\u201cThe University of Scranton\u2019s decision displays a cruel indifference to the women who work there,\u201d said spokeswoman Selina Winchester. \u201cReligious restrictions put a woman\u2019s health at risk.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by David DeKok; Editing by Frank McGurty and Eric Beech)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pennsylvania, college, aims, end, insurance, coverage, abortions, rape, cases", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "University of Scranton employee insurance plans will no longer cover abortions in cases of rape under a plan that the Jesuit school says is consistent with Catholic doctrine.", "title": "Pennsylvania College Aims To End Insurance Coverage of Abortions In Rape Cases", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pennsylvania-college-aims-end-insurance-coverage-abortions-rape-cases-323026", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/21/insurance-scranton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "University of Scranton employee insurance plans will no longer cover abortions in cases of rape under a plan that the Jesuit school says is consistent with Catholic doctrine.", "title": "Pennsylvania College Aims To End Insurance Coverage of Abortions In Rape Cases", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pennsylvania-college-aims-end-insurance-coverage-abortions-rape-cases-323026", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/21/insurance-scranton.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/21/insurance-scranton.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-21T10:21:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-21T10:23:04-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "University of Scranton employee insurance plans will no longer cover abortions in cases of rape under a plan that the Jesuit school says is consistent with Catholic doctrine."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3071\"", "article_summary": "But the Pennsylvania university's faculty union, which represents about 300 of its 940 full-time employees, says members must first approve any changes to its coverage.\nUniversity of Scranton employee insurance plans will no longer cover abortions in cases of rape under a plan that the Jesuit school says is consistent with Catholic doctrine.\nThe union negotiated away coverage for elective abortions nine years ago in return for adoption coverage, but its current contract pays for abortions in cases of rape, incest, or to save the live of the mother.\nFriedman said on Friday that the union plans to meet Feb. 27 to discuss the proposed changes and will also conduct a confidential electronic poll of members.\nHARRISBURG, Pa.
