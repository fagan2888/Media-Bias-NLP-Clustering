The tastings would be blind. Nobody would know what was in the glasses until the end, so the fancy labels wouldn\u2019t influence their judgment.\n\nThe Princetonians liked red wines best, especially those from the French region of Bordeaux, but because the club members were all academics what they really liked was data. They wanted to see if they could articulate some kind of reproducible results that would separate the good wines from the bad. So one of the founders, Richard Quandt, wrote a computer program that would run the appropriate statistical tests on their ratings \u2014 agreement among tasters, correlations, and so on.\n\nQuandt is retired now, with several microeconomics textbooks on his CV (as well as a book on racetrack betting and another on how dogs think). He curses a lot, in a soft Russian accent. \u201cEvery time we had a wine tasting we\u2019d run the program, have some comments, and post it on the website,\u201d Quandt says. \u201cIf anybody wants to test any hypothesis about how wines are ranked, we are now up to 1,030 wines, and every month we add eight more.\u201d The influence of the software and the group \u2014 both dubbed Liquid Assets \u2014 grew. They formalized their research as the American Association of Wine Economics, and started to publish a journal. The entire endeavor has turned into a streamlined locomotive of skepticism about the vast, lucrative world of wine tasting and reviews. It\u2019s not a train you want to get in the way of.\n\nQuandt wants to connect preference to the qualities of the wine, to its indisputable chemistry. If you know what\u2019s in a wine, you ought to know whether it\u2019s good or bad \u2014 objectively. But you can\u2019t. No one knows how to do it. Nobody can even identify, with certainty, all the ingredients, all the molecules, in a glass of wine (or beer or gin or whatever). Nobody understands, exactly, why booze tastes the way it does, and why people like it. And nobody understands, exactly, how human beings actually taste things.\n\nThe difference between Quandt\u2019s group and professional wine reviewers, then, is that the pros attempt to disguise their subjectivity with \u2014 well, put it this way: Quandt\u2019s paper on the subject for the Journal of Wine Economics is called \u201cOn Wine Bullshit\u201d:\n\nSince there are many wine writers, and there is a substantial overlap in the wines they write about (particularly Bordeaux wines), it is important that there be substantial agreement among them. And secondly, what they write must actually convey information; that is to say, it must be free of bullshit. Regrettably, wine evaluations fail on both counts.\n\nQuandt thinks that pros like Robert Parker \u2014 or your friend who always makes a big show over the wine list at a restaurant \u2014 are essentially making it all up. Or, like some storefront psychics, possibly they think they know what they\u2019re talking about, when in actuality they\u2019ve merely intuited their way into a con.\n\nIn defense of wine reviewers \u2014 and reviewers of any booze \u2014 it\u2019s really, really hard to talk about how something smells or tastes. Discussions of flavor, that combination of taste and aroma, are subject to the frustrating limitations of analogy. Benzaldehyde tastes like bitter almond and cherry. Cherry and bitter almond taste like themselves. Or benzaldehyde. That\u2019s excruciatingly non-helpful if you\u2019ve never tasted either of those things or, more likely, if my perception of cherries isn\u2019t like yours. Because how could it be? Our noses are different. Our brains are different. Your cherry need not be my cherry.\n\nSo how do we talk about booze? How do we connect the subjective perception of what we are drinking with the objective knowledge of what\u2019s in it and how it\u2019s made? Perhaps not surprisingly, booze researchers are getting close to solving this problem. Research into the taste of alcohol promises to explain the taste of . . . well, everything, really. Booze, more than any other foodstuff, connects the quantifiable real world to the messy version of it we all create in our own brains.\n\nTalking about taste and smell is not like talking about, say, colors. For these senses, the hard philosophical and scientific work is trying to find words that we recognize in common and can share with each other, so that we all know what we\u2019re talking about.\n\nThe first step is to acknowledge just how limited our senses actually are. A study titled, simply, \u201cThe Color of Odors,\u201d will destroy your faith in anybody\u2019s ability to taste anything. Here\u2019s how it worked: three French researchers started with two wines from Bordeaux, a white made with S\u00e9millon and Sauvignon grapes and a red made with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.\n\nThe researchers first had a group of subjects taste both the white wine and the red, under white light in clear glasses, and write down all the words they could think of to describe each one. In this test it didn\u2019t matter whether the tasters perceived the same things. Inter-rater reliability wasn\u2019t a factor here \u2014 the researchers didn\u2019t care if tasters agreed with each other about the wine color and taste, just that each taster would consistently call one \u201cred\u201d and one \u201cwhite.\u201d\n\nThen the researchers took an odorless, tasteless extract of the grape-skin pigment anthocyanin and dripped it into the white wine, turning it red. And they called the tasters back for a second go-around, asking them to compare the white wine and the colored wine \u2014 the same wine, in other words, with red food coloring. The result was a taste-test catastrophe. Almost to a person, the tasters chose to use the same words for the white wine from the initial tasting on the white wine in the second. And they used the same words for the red wine on the red-colored white wine. They simply could not tell the difference.\n\nColor alone \u2014 not aroma, not flavor \u2014 told them what to expect, and that\u2019s exactly what they tasted.\n\nBut what about experts? At nice restaurants, a professional walks you through a wine list, telling you what each one tastes like and which ones might go best with what dish. Surely these sommeliers must have a more highly developed palate. The four-level training to be a master sommelier, according to the Court of Master Sommeliers, culminates in a grueling, three-part final exam including a twenty-five-minute practical test in which the applicant must identify six wines correctly \u2014 grape variety, country, district, and vintage. Thousands of people take and pass the first two levels of the testing every year, but only a couple hundred try the fourth level \u2014 the one with the practical test \u2014 and only eight or ten pass. Today there are just over 200 of these \u201cmaster sommeliers\u201d in the world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robert Parker and that fancy sommelier might not know more than you.
