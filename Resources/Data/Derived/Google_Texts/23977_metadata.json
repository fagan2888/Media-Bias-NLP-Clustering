Good enough to draw a flurry of kudos from local and national press, which already have made the unusually placed dining establishment a tough place to land a table despite having just opened in September.\n\nThose who secure spots at the leased-out operation are often hospital staff or locals (and sometimes health care journalists) who will find nothing close to a cafeteria upon arrival. Instead, a dimly lit hall gives way to an elegant interior with floor-to-ceiling windows, candlelit tables and bustling wait staff.\n\nAbout the food: The spare dinner menu changes daily, featuring seasonal American food with rich staples, such as a perfectly seared foie gras and bread pudding appetizer with bright notes of cranberry for balance. If the spaghetti with saffron and uni entree is too extravagant, diners can find comfort in an artfully plated Cornish hen \u2014 or just order a cheeseburger. Seafood lovers may choose from sturgeon, oysters, lobster and tuna crudo, the latter lush, with subtle flavors of blood orange and black truffle, while steak fans should know that GreenRiver serves cuts from the highly regarded Slagel Family Farm.\n\nThe dishes' price points are on par with nearby restaurants of their ilk, $12\u201325 per plate, and are consistent in their quality.\n\nThe cocktails are no afterthought, either: Take the pistachio, rye vodka, beet, horseradish and lemon Hinky Dink, for example. In fact, there are 19 pages of drink options to the dinner menu\u2019s three. The drinks, which are served with hand-chipped ice, are named after historic Irish-Chicago figures and places \u2014 such as the Hellcat and Diamond Jim \u2014 which also is the theme behind the establishment's name.\n\nNorthwestern Medicine's Gina Weldy, vice president of real estate, says the restaurant, as well as a Stan\u2019s Donuts shop and other retail shops on the ground floor of the building, have been a hit with hospital employees, patients and visitors.\n\n\u201cIt has changed the feel in the public space,\u201d Weldy said. \u201cThere is a bit more energy now. One of the most important services hospitals provide is to give comfort to its guests, and this has been successful in doing that.\u201d\n\nClockwise from top left: the bar at GreenRiver accomodates both eating and drinking; rich fois gras is balanced by bread pudding and cranberry; a Cornish hen is served with black trumpet mushrooms and micro greens; cocktails span 19 pages of the menu; the terrace offers guests a place to dine outside.
