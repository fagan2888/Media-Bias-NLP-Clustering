While some providers offered free testing, Arnold said the state did not require local health care departments to do so.\n\nThe agency suggested health care providers instead hire commercial private laboratories to offer the testing, saying the science has become standardized and can be done quicker and more cheaply. Arnold said many of the facilities affected could instead bill the federal government under Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"STD testing results typically have one of two outcomes \u2014 positive or negative,\" Arnold said in a statement. \"The IDPH laboratory staff who spend part or most of their work time on STD testing are highly trained and are needed in more complex testing areas.\"\n\nStill, the change came as a shock to many providers that were left scrambling to find new laboratories that are expected to charge more than the state, particularly those that care for patients regardless of their ability to pay.\n\n\"We begged them not to do this,\" said Pam Sutherland, a lobbyist for Planned Parenthood of Illinois, which sent the state tests for an average of 21,000 patients a year. \"It's a partnership that we hate to see go away.\"\n\nmcgarcia@tribpub.com\n\nTwitter @moniquegarcia", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "State drops testing for sexually transmitted diseases", "date": "2015-10-05", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "The Illinois Department of Public Health will no longer provide testing of sexually transmitted infections for dozens of county health departments and other facilities, saying resources must be shifted to more complicated testing to identify disease outbreaks and biological threats.", "title": "State drops testing for sexually transmitted diseases", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/ct-illinois-stops-std-testing-budget-met-1006-20151005-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612fd44/turbine/ct-illinois-stops-std-testing-budget-met-1006-20151005", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp01.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/84615965", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Illinois Department of Public Health, STDs", "news_keywords": "Illinois Department of Public Health, STDs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Illinois Department of Public Health will no longer provide testing of STDs for dozens of county health departments and other facilities."}, "article_summary": "While some providers offered free testing, Arnold said the state did not require local health care departments to do so.\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health will no longer provide testing of sexually transmitted infections for dozens of county health departments and other facilities, saying resources must be shifted to more complicated testing to identify disease outbreaks and biological threats.\nThe state spent $10.2 million on testing for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and HIV specimens during the last budget year.\nThe agency suggested health care providers instead hire commercial private laboratories to offer the testing, saying the science has become standardized and can be done quicker and more cheaply.\n\"The IDPH laboratory staff who spend part or most of their work time on STD testing are highly trained and are needed in more complex testing areas.\""}
