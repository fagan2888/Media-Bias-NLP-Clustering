The Lee County Sheriff's Office is conducting a death investigation in the Iona area of south Fort Myers.

Deputies responded to a home around 4:15 a.m. Sunday at Iona Lakes Apartments off Iona Road.

Neighbors said three people live in the apartment, including a young girl.

Investigators were seen removing evidence that included hard drives.

LCSO said Sunday afternoon they aren't looking for any suspects and there is no danger to the community.

Neighbors said they've been suspicious before of activity going on inside the apartment at the center of the investigation.

"It's a very quiet neighborhood, very quiet community, very safe community," said Lanette Tucker.

But Tucker is one of many who questioned their safety on Sunday when deputies swarmed the neighborhood and set up crime scene tape.

"It's very heartbreaking that you really don't know what goes on just one building away from you," she said.

Elizabeth Edwards said she worries about a young girl who lives in the apartment.

"Usually I take my dog out for a walk in the morning, there's a girl in the window and she wasn't there this morning so I'm kind of worried about what happened," Edwards said.

Neighbors said they don't know much about the man and woman who also live in the apartment.

"The people upstairs above them say they were awakened around four-thirty in the morning by the sound of the fighting that these people did downstairs, and then they heard 'bang bang,'" said Alex Calvert.
