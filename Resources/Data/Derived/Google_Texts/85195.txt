Michelle Obama is about to set Leslie Knope’s world on fire. The first lady will appear on the season finale of Parks And Recreation, which is scheduled to air on Thursday, April 24. Obama’s cameo was filmed this week in Miami. She’ll pop up in an episode titled “Moving Up,” which one can only assume has to do with Pawnee’s own Leslie Knope deciding what’s going on with her life and burgeoning political career.

Amy Poehler, who plays Knope, joined the first lady at a “Let’s Move!” event this week in Miami where she reminded the audience of journalists and rec center attendees that she’s “actually not a deputy director of parks and recreation.”

Obama is not the first politically connected person to appear on Parks. Past guests have included Vice President Joe Biden, Senator John McCain, Senator Barbara Boxer, and former Senator Olympia Snowe.
