The feds hope that millions of Americans add something different to their holiday shopping lists — Obamacare.

The Department of Health and Human Services on Wednesday announced agreements with malls, stores and websites to tout Obamacare enrollment on the three key shopping days after Thanksgiving — Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday.

The partnerships are with Westfield Shopping Centers, the National Community Pharmacists Association and the XO Group, parent company of websites like The Knot, The Nest and The Bump, which are designed for people who are planning a wedding, starting a home or having a baby.

Shoppers will be able to learn about affordable health insurance options that can be purchased through the state and federal Obamacare websites. Enrollment in plans for 2015 began Nov. 15 and ends Feb. 15.
