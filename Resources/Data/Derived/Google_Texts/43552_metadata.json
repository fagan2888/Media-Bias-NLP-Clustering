Perhaps the Jindo\u2019s absence from the greatest dog show in the world isn\u2019t a surprise\u2014introduced stateside by Korean immigrants in the 1980s, the Jindo is relatively unknown beyond its country of origin. I recall my first encounter with the breed: I was in the sixth grade, visiting my youth pastor David Chung\u2019s house. His Jindo\u2019s name was Dalgi\u2014Korean for \u201cstrawberry\u201d\u2014and she stood in the backyard, broad-shouldered, as dignified as an imperial guard. While our group met, Dalgi bared her sharp teeth and barked ceaselessly at the brick barrier separating the Chungs from their neighbors. I never saw her break free, but she tugged with a kind of cautionary force, pacing in clean arcs the full radial reach of her leash. Dalgi eventually breached the brick barrier to murder a litter of kittens belonging to my homeroom teacher, Mrs. Tietz, next door. When news broke in the classroom, I did not speak up, but a familiar pang of guilt flushed my belly. It was the same sour sensation triggered by any mention of Kim Jong-il, Reverend Sun-Myung Moon, or Soon-Yi Previn. Here was Dalgi\u2014another one of our own, botching it up in the Western world. For better or for worse, Korean Americans closely identify with this confident canine\u2014a medium-sized spitz-type dog with a curled tail, a fox-like head, and prick ears. These animals may occasionally murder kittens. In fact, they\u2019re descended from primitive dogs, much like the Australian dingo. For thousands of years, they roamed feral on uninhabited Jindo Island, located off the southwest coast of Korea. But they\u2019re known for their problem-solving skills, fierce loyalty to their owners, and overall toughness. (As my grandfather likes to say, \u201cThey can even eat rock.\u201d) In South Korea, the Jindo is a beloved national treasure. It ranks 53rd on the country\u2019s list of \u201cnatural monuments,\u201d just ahead of a Confucian Shrine\u2019s 400 year-old gingko tree. During the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, Jindos marched in the opening ceremony. Ask any Korean and you will likely hear the same thing: Jindos are the world\u2019s finest breed. And they are ready to take the spotlight at Westminster\u2014the dog world\u2019s equivalent of the Super Bowl and Academy Awards combined.\n\nJindo fans aren\u2019t the only group lobbying the American Kennel Club for inclusion of their favorite breed. This year, three new dogs made their debuts: the Chinook, the Portuguese podengo pequeno, and the rat terrier. In the dog world, this is hugely significant: It means that the arbiters of America\u2019s foremost dog registry have deemed these breeds to be of a trusted, rarefied lineage, worthy of standing alongside the French bulldog, the German shepherd, or the English setter. The Jindo has already gained this kind of acceptance on the world stage\u2014the United Kennel Club and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (World Canine Organization) have allowed the Jindo into their ranks. But the American Kennel Club remains unconvinced of the dog\u2019s merits. This matters to Korean Americans in a way that might sound comical to those outside our fold. The Westminster Dog Show is the longest-running continuously held sporting event in the country, second only to the Kentucky Derby. It began in 1877, prior to the invention of the light bulb or the building of the Washington Monument. It predates the admission of 12 states to the Union. In essence, Westminster is as American as it gets. Once a dog is crowned Best in Show, the winner becomes the canine equivalent of Miss America, fulfilling a year\u2019s worth of duties as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Dog.\u201d It appears on national morning chat show appearances, rings the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and visits the observation deck at the Empire State Building. A chance to compete at Westminster is a chance for a Korean to \u201cmake it\u201d in this country. Once a dog is crowned Best in Show, the winner becomes the canine equivalent of Miss America. So how can the Jindo earn a shot at this ultimate badge of acceptance? According to David Frei, Westminster\u2019s director of communications and the co-host of the show\u2019s television broadcast, there is no schedule or quota to fill when it comes to a breed\u2019s eligibility. Admittance guidelines mostly involve a dog\u2019s \u201cfollowing\u201d in America. As Frei details, the breed must have \u201can adequate population in this country, a geographical distribution (they can\u2019t all live in California), and a parent club (e.g., the Afghan Hound Club of America) that is advocating and overseeing the breed in this country.\u201d Once the parent club has \u201cdone the work\u201d promoting the breed, official AKC status is inevitable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A community fights to get its national breed onto the most elite stage in the nation", "author": "Jen Choi", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A community fights to get its national breed onto the most elite stage in the nation", "title": "Does a Korean Dog Deserve a Shot at the American Dream?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/jindo/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/02/does-a-korean-dog-deserve-a-shot-at-the-american-dream/283755/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccbc1\"", "article_summary": "The legendary Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show will soon draw to a close, and for the 138th time, the Korean Jindo was not among the competitors.\nThe Westminster Dog Show is the longest-running continuously held sporting event in the country, second only to the Kentucky Derby.\nBut the American Kennel Club remains unconvinced of the dog\u2019s merits.\nJindo fans aren\u2019t the only group lobbying the American Kennel Club for inclusion of their favorite breed.\nFor better or for worse, Korean Americans closely identify with this confident canine\u2014a medium-sized spitz-type dog with a curled tail, a fox-like head, and prick ears."}
