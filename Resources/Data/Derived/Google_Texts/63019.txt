Peak Rock Gobbles up Dakota Dips and Party Cheese, While Snacks Appeal

The PE firm owns Highline Mushrooms and Natural American Foods

The target produces packaged coffee, energy drinks, aerosol cheese, alfredo sauce and cheese dips that are sold in retail and grocery stores. Founded in 1943 and based in Dakota, Illinois, Berner owns the Dakota and Party Cheese brands.

“Under Peak Rock’s ownership, we will have the added resources to further grow the business and facilitate product expansion,” says Berner CEO Steve Kneubuehl.

Peak Rock, located in Austin, Texas, has experience investing in the food industry. The firm owns honey producer Natural American Foods and mushroom distributor Highline Mushrooms.
