It goes like this: \u201cOpponents of the \u2018Defund Obamacare\u2019 effort said it would do lasting damage, but we just won the Senate \u2014 so stuff it!\u201d (The reason this is once again relevant is that there Republican legislators have little recourse should President Obama unilaterally act on immigration. The \u201cpower of the purse\u201d is one of their few tools.)\n\nAside from the fact that it\u2019s hard to imagine how another government shutdown could provoke any salutary benefits for Republicans or their (in my estimation) noble effort to defend the balance of power and rule of law, I would question the premise of this nascent narrative. Maybe there were some people who argued the shutdown would doom Republicans in 2014 (okay, I\u2019m sure someone said that), but I certainly wasn\u2019t one of them. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure I have consistently said the Defund effort was a fool\u2019s errand, and that Republicans would win the Senate.\n\nThis is not to say that the shutdown didn\u2019t have significant consequences \u2014 it did. Gallup clearly demonstrates Republicans suffered a precipitous ten point collapse during this time. There were other, less easily quantifiable, opportunity costs, too. It is highly likely the incident cost conservative Ken Cuccinelli a gubernatorial seat in Virginia. And the controversy also overshadowed the disastrous Obamacare rollout (which started on October 1) for more than a month, postponing the weeks and months of bad news cycles for the president.\n\nBut now that Republicans have won, some want to revisit the shutdown, and this suggests a couple possible implications: Can we extrapolate that \u2014 because 2014 was a good year \u2014 that the shutdown either a). didn\u2019t matter, or b). might have helped Republicans?\n\nThe latter seems absurd. And I also reject the former. Suggesting the GOP\u2019s success in November of 2014 means that they weren\u2019t in danger in October of 2013 strikes me as a bit of revisionist history. Think about all the many scandals and controversies that have happened since the shutdown. As I implied above, the botched Obamacare website rollout wasn\u2019t even realized/appreciated until after shutdown ended. Think about what we were talking about in the days and weeks leading up to the midterms \u2014 Ebola and ISIS.\n\nThe fact that the patient survived 13 months after the virus does not indicate that the patient wasn\u2019t incredibly ill at the time. The expectation that anything would dog Republicans for more than a year seems a pretty high bar. With the pace of today\u2019s news cycle, the notion that any one story would dominate 13 months later would always be highly unlikely.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that nothing we do in an odd year matters. If you get thrown out trying to steal second base in the third inning, it\u2019s hard to say that event \u201ccost\u201d you the baseball game. You still have six innings left to play. And yet, sometimes you look back and say, \u201cYes, that was a huge mistake.\u201d Just because you win doesn\u2019t mean you played a perfect game \u2014 doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t learn from mistakes you made in the third inning.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Matt K.
