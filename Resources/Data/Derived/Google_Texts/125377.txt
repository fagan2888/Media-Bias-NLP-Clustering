COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -

It was a scary delivery for one Domino’s Pizza driver, early Sunday morning.

The driver was making a delivery in the 2000 block of Southgate Road. After exiting his vehicle, a suspect wearing a blue bandanna over his face pointed a pistol at the driver.

The suspect demanded the driver's money. The victim gave the suspect cash from his pocket.



After obtaining the victim’s money, the suspect told the victim to walk away. The victim did so and then ran to a nearby drug store, where he later called the police. The suspect was not located or identified.
