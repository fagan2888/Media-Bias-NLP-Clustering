Super Tuesday saw Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton dominate contests and rack up delegates. But Chris Christie\u2019s face may have stolen the show last night: http://bit.ly/21GHGei\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA quick few sum-up stories:\n\n-- \u201cSuper Trump Day,\u201d POLITICO http://politi.co/1L4L8v6\n\n-- \u201cNo Republican nominee has ever won all of the different states Donald Trump has,\u201d WaPo\u2019s The Fix blog: http://wapo.st/1T78tPo\n\n-- 'Establishment Republicans Are Furious With John Kasich,' by BuzzFeed News http://bzfd.it/1TmHNdI\n\n-- Six New Jersey newspapers are calling on Chris Christie to resign: http://bit.ly/1L4UPKc\n\nBack to Illinois. The \u201cStop Trump\u201d campaign was at work on Tuesday, even as he mopped up. A group of Republican business leaders -- including Todd Ricketts of Illinois\u2019 Ricketts family, which owns the Chicago Cubs -- pushed for funding of an anti-Trump political action committee.\n\nFrom the New York Times: \u201cA number of major Republican business leaders, all of whom have backed candidates running against Donald J. Trump, held a conference call on Tuesday afternoon to solicit funds for a \u2018super PAC\u2019 that\u2019s been singularly focused on stopping the rise of the real-estate developer as the Republican nominee ...\n\n50 donors on call: \u201cMeg Whitman, Todd Ricketts and Paul Singer, among others, all took part in the call with about 50 people, urging them to fund Our Principles PAC, which was funded largely by a member of the Ricketts family, and which started airing ads in Iowa before the caucuses to try to stop Mr. Trump ... Mr. Ricketts\u2019s mother, Marlene, funded the effort aggressively with $3 million ahead of Iowa out of fear of the situation that the party is in now, with Mr. Trump set for a strong showing in the 'Super Tuesday' contests. On the call, it was noted that 71 percent of the delegates are up for grabs after Tuesday, meaning it is impossible for Mr. Trump to lock up the nomination this week. People on the call discussed Mr. Trump\u2019s business record, among other issues they believe are potent lines of attack.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1L4XxPQ\n\nANTI-TRUMP ADS TO HIT ILLINOIS -- \u201cRicketts-funded group preps attack ads against Trump in Illinois,\u201d by Chicago Tribune\u2019s Rick Pearson: \u201cThe super political action committee primarily funded by Marlene Ricketts, the matriarch of the family that owns the Cubs, is preparing to run its anti-Donald Trump ads in Illinois. Ricketts has put $3 million into the Our Principles PAC, which has been criticizing Trump for not being a true conservative and over his use on building projects of people who live in the country illegally. But in the new ad, running nationally as well as in Illinois, Florida and Michigan, it is Trump University that comes under fire. On Tuesday, a New York appeals court revived a fraud claim that the state's attorney general had brought against Trump University. \u2018Donald Trump belongs in 3 a.m. infomercials,\" a narrator says in the ad, and not the White House.\u2019\u201d http://trib.in/1Qmr3iT\n\nON THE STATE SIDE \u2026\n\nLawmakers are in Springfield, and as Illinois Playbook told you on Tuesday, there are some behind-the-scenes workings for a higher ed stopgap solution. On Tuesday, discussions were underway between both sides to find an immediate, but temporary, fix. One proposal would resolve higher ed issues right now, including funding Chicago State, restoring Monetary Award Program funding and reopening streams to four-year higher ed institutions. (Without the governor\u2019s Turnaround Agenda items attached.) There was talk about emergency budget relief and \u201cflexibility with money management.\u201d No promises were made and a discussion is expected to reconvene today.\n\nFor those paying attention, a 3 p.m. press conference on Tuesday was supposed to feature GOP legislative leaders, who more than likely would have blasted Speaker Mike Madigan, blaming him for not coming forward on a deal. It was canceled. The fact that the press conference was shut down at the last minute (reporters were already waiting inside the Capitol Blue Room) was: \u201ca first sign of good faith,\u201d from Republicans, we\u2019re told. Will Democrats respond in kind by not calling an override vote of Gov. Bruce Rauner\u2019s vetoed MAP grant funding?\n\nReaching an agreement on anything in this pre-primary time is beyond a long shot and Madigan\u2019s spokesman on Tuesday was still predicting an override vote. Reconstructing trust that\u2019s been shattered into a million pieces will take time and likely come in baby steps.\n\nBUT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES -- From Western Illinois University: \u201cWith the budget impasse approaching nine months, Western Illinois University President Jack Thomas announced today (March 1) that mandatory furloughs and voluntary pay reduction programs will be implemented for all non-negotiated personnel (administrative/non-academic and civil service personnel not covered by unions). While the mandatory program will take place June 1-30, employees may voluntarily elect to spread out their furlough days or participate in the voluntary pay reduction program beginning April 2.\u201d The release: http://bit.ly/1Rm5MU9\n\nAND THIS LITTLE DISTRACTION -- \"Contribution Limits Lifted in the 22nd House (Mike Madigan),\" by Scott Kennedy: \u201cWith this latest independent expenditure disclosure Illinois United for Change has now spent more than $100,000 in the 22nd House race supporting Jason Gonzales/opposing Mike Madigan thereby exceeding the threshold needed to lift the campaign contribution limits for all candidates in this race for the remainder of the primary election cycle. This means that the Speaker\u2019s candidate committee, Friends of Michael J. Madigan, can now raise unlimited funds, an advantage not shared by the candidate committees of any of the other three legislative leaders. The affected timeframe may be brief, the primary election cycle ends in two weeks, but the impact of this may be significant.\u201d http://bit.ly/1oXW584\n\nWelcome to the POLITICO Illinois Playbook.

Cook County Circuit Court Judge Maureen Ward Kirby tossed the case on a technicality Tuesday. Kirby says the suburban Chicago attorney who filed the complaint, Lawrence Joyce, failed to give a copy of it to Cruz or state electoral board members, as required by Illinois law. Instead, Joyce served only lawyers representing Cruz and the board. Joyce says the Texas senator can't be president because he wasn\u2019t born in the U.S. Cruz and some legal experts say he's eligible because his mother was a U.S. citizen when he was born. Joyce backs Ben Carson but says he acted on his own.\u201d http://bit.ly/21GsZHX\n\nRAUNER ROLE IN PRIMARIES -- \u201cIn Illinois's Democratic primaries, it's the governor, stupid,\" by Chicago Reader's Ben Joravsky: \"As for the last left in Chicago, I'd like to offer the chieftains of the Democratic Party a few words of unsolicited advice as they prepare for the final stretch of the March 15 primary campaign: It's the governor, stupid! That's Bruce Rauner, our whacked-out Republican governor, who seems determined to eradicate unions and bankrupt public schools in the name of making Illinois more attractive to rich people.

The Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability also warned that it expects revenue this fiscal year to be $442 million less than it previously anticipated. The commission put much of the blame on weaker-than-expected corporate income and sales tax receipts. The state\u2019s new fiscal year begins July 1. The commission\u2019s revenue forecast for Illinois' basic checkbook account \u2013 less than 1 percent growth \u2013 is one of the weakest in years. Exceptions were the 2009-2010 recession when revenues actually decreased and the last two years when revenues dropped because a major portion of a state income tax increase was allowed to expire.\u201d http://bit.ly/1TmzE98\n\nOBAMACARE LOSSES -- \u201cIllinois Obamacare plan crippled by losses,\u201d by Crain's Kristen Schorsch: \"The operating losses continue to mount at struggling Land of Lincoln Health, totaling $90.8 million for the Obamacare health plan in 2015. That net loss is almost five times greater than the Chicago-based startup reported in 2014, when it totaled $17.7 million. The insurer lost about $40 million in just the last three months of 2015, according to a new financial statement filed with national insurance regulators.

Rauner ... Humphries says Rauner\u2019s plan ... doesn\u2019t fix the issue \u2026 \u2018Even if they have the money to fully fund all schools, the disparity between the \u2018haves and the have nots\u2019 continues to grow in the state of Illinois,\u2019 said Humphries. \u2018The formula is broken, it must be fixed.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1UxqOod\n\nDURBIN BLASTS ABBOTT OUTSOURCING -- \u201cAbbott's IT layoffs draw fire from Sen.

Times,\" by Ken Doctor for POLITICO Media: \"While old-fashioned investigative journalism took center stage in Los Angeles at the Oscars Sunday evening, hometown reporters for the L.A.

The Times had been allocated six passes for entry to the Dolby Theater \u2013 essential access to tell the story of the night by the big broadsheet located in America\u2019s entertainment capital \u2013 but until the last minute not one of them was allocated to a reporter ...\n\nGuess who got them instead? \u201cTribune Publishing Chairman Michael Ferro and CEO Justin Dearborn reportedly used the passes, each along with a guest. The last two were earmarked for publisher Tim Ryan, who was persuaded to do the right thing and gave up his seats after receiving a flabbergasted email from the Times\u2019 film desk. Those tickets \u2014 in the cheaper, mezzanine seats \u2014 allowed Times reporters Amy Kaufman and Steve Zeitchik into the theater to do their reporting.\u201d\n\nFrom the letter: \"To fail to send a single reporter on a year when the Oscars are at the center of a cultural debate over diversity is not only embarrassing, it\u2019s bad journalism.\" http://bit.ly/1TPN244\n\nFERRO ON MORNING EARNINGS CALL -- \u201cTribune Publishing's Michael Ferro expected to take center stage Wednesday,\u201d Chicago Business Journal\u2019s Lewis Lazare: \u201cTribune Publishing's (NYSE: TPUB) earnings call tomorrow hardly represents a normal situation ...

Still, police officials said Tuesday they\u2019re at last seeing progress from their frantic efforts to get cops back to work on the streets. Police work nearly ground to a halt in the first six weeks of 2016 because officers were worried about increased scrutiny of their stops following the November release of the video of Laquan McDonald\u2019s shooting. The video led to a murder charge against Officer Jason Van Dyke and a federal probe of the department.\u201d http://bit.ly/1T6EdEj\n\nMURDERS CLIMB, ILLEGAL GUN SEIZURES FALL -- \u201cChicago Homicides, Shootings Double Over Same Period in 2015,\u201d by AP\u2019s Don Babwin: \u201cHomicides and shootings have doubled in Chicago so far this year compared with the same period in 2015, and police have seized fewer illegal guns \u2014 more possible signals that officers have become less aggressive in the aftermath of a shooting video released last fall. Interim Police Superintendent John Escalante said Tuesday that he was so concerned about officers possibly holding back that he filmed a video for the entire department in which he encouraged them to do their jobs and assured them that a federal probe of the force was not aimed at individuals. \u2018We are aware that there is a concern among the rank and file about not wanting to be the next YouTube video that goes viral,\u2019 Escalante said in the video before introducing a segment of his own to remind viewers \u2018why we took this job and swore this oath of office.\u2019\u201d http://abcn.ws/1oNIZJM\n\nVIDEO POLICY ALREADY IN QUESTION -- \u201cLawyer Accuses Rahm Of \u2018Empty Promise\u2019 On Video Of CPD Custody Death,\u201d by Sun-Times Media Wire: \u201cTwo weeks after Mayor Rahm Emanuel embraced a new policy calling for the release of audio and video of police-involved shootings and other serious incidents within 60 days, an attorney is slamming City Hall for withholding video connected to a man\u2019s death in police custody last summer in Brighton Park. Meanwhile, the unit in the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office responsible for investigating police misconduct is looking into the July 20 death of 24-year-old Heriberto Godinez Jr., an official confirmed to the Chicago Sun-Times.\u201d http://cbsloc.al/1QK2jOH\n\nA MORGUE TAXPAYERS \u2018CAN BE PROUD OF\u2019 -- \u201cCook County Medical Examiner's Office now 'national leader,\u2019\u201d by Chicago Sun-Times' Stefano Esposito: \"With considerable fanfare, Cook County officials Tuesday declared the medical examiner\u2019s office a \u2018national leader\u2019 \u2014 four years after the Chicago Sun-Times reported that hundreds of bodies were piling up in the morgue.

Savills Studley's Live/Work Index study measures the combined costs of residential and office rentals per person per year, with the average total cost of accommodation per worker being $56,855.

As of last week, the Veterans Crisis Line reports to Matt Eitutis, the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s acting director for member services, according to a VA announcement. According to Gibson, Eitutis repaired the homeless veterans line after a 2014 VA inspector general report found a quarter of its calls went to an answering machine.
