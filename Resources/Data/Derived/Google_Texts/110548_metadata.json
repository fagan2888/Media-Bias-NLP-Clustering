Administration tries economy pivot again\n\nIt is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again for Team Obama. Monday\u2019s family and workplace summit, Julie Pace of The Associated Press told us, is part of the latest effort to change the focus to the domestic economic issues the administration hopes can help improve the midterm election climate.\n\n\u201cThey finally feel that they have turned the corner in the sense that they no longer need to have the president out talking about foreign policy almost on a daily basis,\u201d said Pace.\n\nProblem is the White House has tried such \u201cpivots\u201d several times already this year. And with the Iraq crisis front and center, there are skeptics that this effort to pivot or reset will gain traction either.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t try.\n\nA political carton from The Franklin Center making fun of a previous White House pivot:\n\n2. If they don\u2019t ask, you can\u2019t tell them you want Mitt\n\nMitt Romney has made it abundantly clear he does not believe a third time would be the charm. He is NOT going to make a third attempt to win the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nBut there has been a fair amount of Romney buzz, and some polling firms list him when they call voters and ask them their 2016 preferences. A Suffolk University-Boston Herald poll last week, for example, found Romney to be a more than 2 to 1 favorite.\n\nI\u2019m told some influential Romney insiders, who at times were amused, even curious, when such polling was conducted, are beginning to get annoyed and beginning to make clear they would prefer his name not be listed.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell for starters these Republicans say it makes it harder to get a true sense of how voters view the Republicans who ARE likely to run. Plus, they say it just gins up Mitt 2016 buzz.\n\n\u201cThe Mitt stuff is a tease and not going to happen,\u201d one veteran Romney insider says. \u201cAlthough it does spark a lot of phone calls and emails.\u201d\n\n3. Oklahoma GOP family feud\n\nJonathan Martin of The New York Times turns our attention to Oklahoma\u2019s GOP Senate primary, where the tea party is a bit more nervous about its chances than in the Mississippi race.\n\nA half African-American, half Native American candidate, former Oklahoma House Speaker T.W. Shannon, is backed by Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin and national conservative groups. But some are concerned now that he might not even make a run-off.\n\n\u201cJim Langford, who's the House member from Oklahoma City, has emerged as a pretty strong candidate,\u201d said Martin. \u201cHe\u2019s has had some kind words from Tom Coburn, which is a big deal in Oklahoma, and also benefits from a House primary that's very competitive in his old House seat in Oklahoma City, which is going to boost turnout.\u201d\n\nA Shannon tweet showcasing some of his prominent conservative friends:\n\n4. Pryor under fire in Arkansas\n\nPolitico\u2019s Manu Raju suggests the big Arkansas Senate race could be an important juncture.\n\nDemocrat Mark Pryor is the incumbent. GOP Rep. Tom Cotton is the Republican hoping voters promote him to the Senate, in a seat that factors big time into GOP hopes of taking the Senate majority.\n\nThe U.S. Army veteran, who had served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, was trying to sell his softer side on the trail but is now switching to a different strategy.\n\n\u201cThey believe that if they can start pivoting to define Pryor in the eyes of voters as an Obama acolyte, they can win this race and start to see some separation in the polls,\u201d said Raju.\n\nCotton\u2019s ad linking Pryor to President Obama:\n\n5. A legendary SC name faces a big ballot test\n\nSouth Carolina has a primary Tuesday, and CNN\u2019s Peter Hamby reminds us Republican voters have a chance to vote for an Atwater.\n\nSally Atwater, wife of the late controversial GOP strategist Lee Atwater, is running for state superintendent of education.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of fun South Carolina intrigue,\u201d said Hamby. \u201cAtwater is backed by the old Bush forces, the old McCain folks are against her opponent, Molly Spearman, and Common Core obviously a big issue in a Republican primary.\u201d\n\nSally\u2019s husband, Lee, was a key architect of the George H.W. Bush presidential win in 1992 and later served as Republican National Committee chairman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CNN's John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on \"Inside Politics\" to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "The \"Inside Politics\" Forecast: Obama tries to change the subject\u2026 again", "og": {"url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/22/the-inside-politics-forecast-obama-tries-to-change-the-subject-again/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140620223254-ip-obamas-iraq-dilemma-00022826-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "CNN's John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday on \"Inside Politics\" to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead.", "title": "The \"Inside Politics\" Forecast: Obama tries to change the subject\u2026 again"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "keywords": "inside politics, iraq, obama administration, syria, cnn chief national correspondent john king", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd294a\"", "article_summary": "Or was that DO forget about Mitt Romney?\nA half African-American, half Native American candidate, former Oklahoma House Speaker T.W.\nAnd don\u2019t forget about Mitt Romney.\nWashington (CNN) \u2013 A d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu moment for the Obama White House and a number of interesting 2014 election dynamics closed our Sunday Inside Politics discussion.\nOklahoma GOP family feudJonathan Martin of The New York Times turns our attention to Oklahoma\u2019s GOP Senate primary, where the tea party is a bit more nervous about its chances than in the Mississippi race."}
