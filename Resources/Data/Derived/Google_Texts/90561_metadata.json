And once you have sex with a kid, you have to toss them. Because people hate folks who have sex with kids, more than pretty much anything\u2026 So, here\u2019s the thing, if you have sex with a kid, you have to chuck them out because if the kid tells anybody, you\u2019re screwed. So I can\u2019t help but thinking that if we took down a few notches the hatred for kids-having-sex-people, at least you get the kid back.\u201d\n\nAfter grounding her case for the acceptability of the sexual assault of minors in the musings of a standup comedian, Karasik goes on to suggest that most sex between teachers and students is consensual and part of a \u201cnuanced continuum of sexual interactions.\u201d Ignoring completely the implicit power imbalance created by a teacher\u2019s discretionary authority over a student, Karasik says that, \u201cThroughout high school, college and law school, I knew students who had sexual relations with teachers. To the best of my knowledge, these situations were all consensual in every honest meaning of the word, even if society would like to embrace the fantasy that a high school student can\u2019t consent to sex.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Washington Post ran a \"hip\" and \"edgy\" editorial in defense of teachers who rape their students", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Washington Post ran a \"hip\" and \"edgy\" editorial in defense of teachers who rape their students", "title": "Washington Post column uses a Louis C.K. joke to defend statutory rape", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/01/washington_post_uses_a_louis_c_k_joke_to_defend_statutory_rape/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/11/louis_ck_slide.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Washington Post ran a \"hip\" and \"edgy\" editorial in defense of teachers who rape their students", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/11/louis_ck_slide.jpg", "title": "Washington Post column uses a Louis C.K. joke to defend statutory rape", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Washington Post column uses a Louis C.K. joke to defend statutory rape", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Louis C.K., Rape, Sexual assault, statutory rape", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08b6\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Louis C.K., Rape, Sexual assault, statutory rape, Life News, NewsThe Washington Post ran an editorial this weekend that uses a Louis C.K.\n\u201cWhy do kids disappear sometimes?,\u201d wonders Louis C.K.\njoke to come to the defense of Stacey Dean Rambold, the 49-year-old high school teacher who will serve a whopping 30 days in prison for the rape of a 14-year-old student.\nWriter Betsy Karasik argues that the \u201cutter hysteria with which society responds to these situations\u201d (\u201cthese situations\u201d being the rape of high school students) has \u201cconsequences,\u201d which, she suggests, can be neatly summarized by a Louis C.K.\nTo the best of my knowledge, these situations were all consensual in every honest meaning of the word, even if society would like to embrace the fantasy that a high school student can\u2019t consent to sex.\u201d"}
