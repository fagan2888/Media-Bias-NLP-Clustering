St. Augustine is marking its 450th anniversary with 16th century folk music.

Florida Times-Union reports that RareSong Renaissance Band is among the performers at a series of events marking 450 years since Spanish explorers founded the city.

Patricia De Witt, the band's artistic director, says the music was popular 450 years ago when the Spanish landed on Florida's east coast. She says modern-day listeners often notice that church music and popular music have some roots in the Renaissance-style music featuring drums, viols, and stringed instruments.

A parade, cake cutting, music festival and other events marking St. Augustine's 450th birthday are planned throughout the long Labor Day weekend.
