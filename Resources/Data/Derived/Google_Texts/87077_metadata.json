You might be eligible for a refundable tax credit. Taxpayers had the option of estimating their 2014 income to see if they qualified for the credit and then having it applied in advance to the cost of the premiums.\n\n\u201cWe have an opportunity in the 2014 filing season to educate taxpayers about what they need to do during the year to avoid problems during the 2015 filing season,\u201d National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson said.\n\nHer advice to those taxpayers: keep the exchanges advised if there are changes in your circumstances that could affect the subsidy.\n\n\u201cIt could increase if you have another child and you want to be able to get the benefit of that,\u201d she said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt could decrease if you have a significant pay increase, if your spouse gets a job, if a child is no longer covered on your plan.\u201d\n\nAs a result, some taxpayers could end up owing the U.S. Treasury money when they file their 2014 taxes next year.\n\n\u201cIt may mean that they would have a reduced refund, and many taxpayers depend on their refunds for various things,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThey\u2019ve used them for planning. They use them like savings, so that will be a rude surprise for these taxpayers. And we can avoid it by having them go into the exchanges throughout the year.\u201d\n\nBut what about those taxpayers who don\u2019t get refunds \u2014 between 75 percent and 85 percent do, she said \u2014 or those whose refunds aren\u2019t big enough to cover what is owed if the subsidy is reduced?\n\nIn that case, \u201cthe easiest thing is you\u2019ll have a refund the next year, and we\u2019ll take it out of the refund the next year,\u201d Olson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a debt on the books. It\u2019s an assessed tax, and we can collect it for 10 years and it\u2019s just a computer offset.\u201d\n\nWhile her job is to take on the Internal Revenue Service where necessary, Olson said the agency\u2019s role in verifying income for people applying for the health-care subsidy has been working well. \u201cThey have lessened the time in which they are able to give the answer to the exchange,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she said there needs to be more outreach and education does need to be done about the Affordable Care Act. She called on the IRS to make its website more informative by offering more examples \u201cso taxpayers can recognize themselves if you direct them to a page,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for her own role, Olson said she speaks for taxpayers, interceding in individual disputes with the IRS and pushing for tax reform. She said she understands the agency\u2019s constraints and won\u2019t propose changes that are unrealistic. \u201cBut,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to take as an answer, \u2018Oh, this is too heavy of a lift.'\u201d\n\nThere are 74 taxpayer advocates around the country \u2014 at least one in each state \u2014 who work with her, she said.\n\nTo qualify for taxpayer advocate assistance, you must show that you face a significant hardship \u2014 that the IRS is causing you economic harm, that its systems are not working or that your rights have been violated. \u201cThat gets you through the door,\u201d Olson said.\n\nAsk her what challenges taxpayers face and she answers emphatically, \u201cGetting assistance from the IRS, getting service from the IRS.\u201d\n\nIn fiscal year 2013, she said, nearly four out of 10 calls to the IRS did not get through to a live person who could help. The average wait time was 17.5 minutes.\n\nGetting IRS assistance is particularly an issue, she said, when it comes to identity theft, which remains a major issue, although the number of cases has declined since the IRS put \u201csignificant screens\u201d in place. When identify theft occurs, Olson said, the IRS needs to act more quickly and consistently to help victims.\n\n\u201cThe taxpayer has already gone through an enormous amount of angst and huge inconvenience \u2026 and we do not recognize that in our customer service to them,\u201d Olson said. Victims of identity theft typically speak to a different person each time they call the IRS, she complained, and \u201chave to explain their situation over again.\u201d\n\nShe said the agency should assign each case to one person who can see it all the way through.\n\nAs for electronic filing, Olson suggested that taxpayers look into the IRS\u2019 Free File program, which allows people whose adjusted gross income is under $58,000 to file their taxes for free through the IRS site. For people whose income is higher, the IRS has Free Fillable Forms, which do the basic math but don\u2019t walk you through filling out your returns.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I should have to pay to file electronically with the IRS,\u201d said Olson, who uses the Free Fillable Forms. \u201cThat\u2019s my duty as a taxpayer, and the IRS in the 21st century should make it available to me for free. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nShe urged taxpayers to check out tax preparers carefully before hiring one, and not to fall for promises of huge refunds. \u201cIt really becomes a \u2018consumer, beware\u2019 world,\u201d she said.\n\nIn dealing with tax preparers, she offered these tips:\n\n\u2013Get a copy of your return. \u201cIf the preparer then alters the return after you\u2019ve signed off on it, that\u2019s proof that it was a false return that was filed.\u201d\n\n\u2013Make sure the preparer\u2019s name, registration number and address are on the return.\n\n\u2013Check with the Better Business Bureau or state consumer affairs agency to see if there are any complaints against the preparation firm or preparer.\n\n\u201cEven though that seems like some work upfront, if you get sucked into one of these preparer issues it can take over a year to get it resolved, and that\u2019s just pain that nobody needs to go through,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/Home", "article_metadata": {"description": "Did you buy health insurance through one of the exchanges?", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Carole Feldman | Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/340446/taxpayer-advocate-avoid-health-care-tax-surprises.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/BC-US-SPE-Taxes-Health-Overhaul-ref.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Did you buy health insurance through one of the exchanges?", "title": "Taxpayer advocate: Avoid health-care tax surprises"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28d8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s my duty as a taxpayer, and the IRS in the 21st century should make it available to me for free.\n\u201cWe have an opportunity in the 2014 filing season to educate taxpayers about what they need to do during the year to avoid problems during the 2015 filing season,\u201d National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson said.\nAs for her own role, Olson said she speaks for taxpayers, interceding in individual disputes with the IRS and pushing for tax reform.\nIt\u2019s crazy.\u201dShe urged taxpayers to check out tax preparers carefully before hiring one, and not to fall for promises of huge refunds.\n'\u201dThere are 74 taxpayer advocates around the country \u2014 at least one in each state \u2014 who work with her, she said."}
