This is the last chance for residents to enroll before the Jan. 31 deadline. Coverage will begin March 1.\n\nBroward Regional Health Planning Council (BRHPC) and its partners are working hard to alert Broward County residents that it is important for them to sign up by Jan. 31. Signing up is quick and easy. Individuals and families, even if they have been denied insurance in the past, can log onto www.brhpc.org or www.coveringflorida.org, or call 2-1-1 for help in the enrollment process and to learn about potential financial assistance.\n\nAccording to the Health Insurance Marketplace, eight in 10 of the uninsured eligible for Marketplace coverage qualifies for savings via subsidies that will lower the cost of the monthly premiums. Under the Affordable Care Act, individuals who don\u2019t have medical insurance in 2016 will face a tax penalty of $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, or 2.5 percent of \u201ccountable income\u201d \u2014 whichever is greater. For many, the penalty will be more than what they will pay in monthly premiums.\n\n\u201cPeople need to understand that with the subsidies available to them, the cost of insurance can be much less than what the penalty, plus out-of-pocket medical expenses will be,\u201d said Michael DeLucca, president and CEO of Broward Regional Health Planning Council.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as of Jan. 7, approximately 11.3 million people had signed up for coverage: 8.6 million through HealthCare.gov in 38 states and another 2.7 million in 13 state-based Marketplaces. As of Jan. 2, 1,569,551 Floridians signed up through HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cWe still have many Broward residents to reach, and BRHPC and its partners will continue to do so through the deadline. It\u2019s important that these people realize that even though we are down to the wire, there are a lot of affordable plan options still available to them. Medical insurance is a safety net for the unpredictable and unexpected medical care and costs that can affect anyone at any time.\u201d\n\nBRHPC has partnered with several local community-based organizations \u2014 211-Broward, Hispanic Unity of Florida, Urban League of Broward County and Community Access Center \u2014 to help make sure individuals and families sign up and get access to the medical coverage they need.\n\nResidents who utilize BRHPC and its partners need to bring the following documentation with them to their appointment:\n\nEmail Address (an account can be set up at the appointment)\n\nSocial Security number\n\nAnnual Income\n\nNaturalization or Immigration Documentation\n\nTo learn how to enroll, or for more information, call 2-1-1, email getcovered@brhpc.org or log onto www.brhpc.org or www.coveringflorida.org.\n\nABOUT BROWARD REGIONAL HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL\n\nThe Broward partnership for enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplace is comprised of five (5) trusted local agencies brought together to help uninsured people find and enroll in health coverage that best meets their needs.
