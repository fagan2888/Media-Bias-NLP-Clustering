Okay, so here\u2019s where I\u2019m a little bit different. I don\u2019t want people dying on the streets. And I say this all the time.\u201d\n\nThe individual mandate of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to obtain and maintain health insurance or else each year pay a tax penalty.\n\nThe purpose of the mandate is to incentivize healthy people who might not otherwise purchase health insurance to get covered, spreading the cost of health care over more people.\n\nDuring the 2008 election, then-Senator Hillary Clinton supported a mandate. Then-Senator Barack Obama did not favor an individual mandate, though the Affordable Care Act in its final form includes it.\n\nThe mandate remains one of the most controversial aspects of the health care law. According to an October 2015 survey by Rasmussen Reports:\n\n32% of likely U.S. voters believe the government should require every American to buy or obtain health insurance, the lowest level of support since 2012.\n\n56% oppose Obamacare\u2019s insurance requirement, the highest level of opposition in nearly two years.\n\n12% are undecided.\n\nDespite running as a Republican candidate, Trump has spoken favorably of a government-run single payer health care system in the past.\n\nJust consider how different this cycle is from even four years ago.\n\nWhile Trump says \u201cI don\u2019t want people dying on the street,\u201d libertarian icon then-Texas Rep. Ron Paul was asked about that very scenario during the 2012 race.\n\nWhen CNN debate moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Paul if society should let a hypothetical young man without health insurance die, Paul demurred but the crowd cried \u201cyes\u201d:\n\nYet Friday, on the eve of the South Carolina primary, Trump leads the state by over 14 points, with 32.9% of the vote, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average. And nationally he leads by a similar margin.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "56% of Americans oppose it... or do they?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "56% of Americans oppose it... or do they?", "title": "Donald Trump Tells CNN He's a Fan of Obamacare Mandate So People Don't 'Die in the Streets'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-12.11.58-PM.png", "height": 303}, "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2016/02/541646-donald-trump-individual-mandate-obamacare-obama-health-care-affordable-care-act-cnn-town-hall/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "56% of Americans oppose it... or do they?", "title": "Donald Trump Tells CNN He's a Fan of Obamacare Mandate So People Don't 'Die in the Streets'", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-12.11.58-PM.png", "creator": "@injo", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kelsey Rupp", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-02-20T10:28:27-04:00", "wp-categories": "14101 27", "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "published_at": "2016-02-20T10:28:27+00:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2016/02/541646-donald-trump-individual-mandate-obamacare-obama-health-care-affordable-care-act-cnn-town-hall/", "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "wp-category-slugs": "editors-choice, elections", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Editor's Choice", "published_time": "2016-02-20T10:28:27-04:00"}, "post_id": 541646, "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-19-at-12.11.58-PM.png", "tags": "Independent Journal Politics", "is_https": 0}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e2f\"", "article_summary": "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During the CNN Republican town hall Thursday night, moderator Anderson Cooper asked presidential candidate and businessman Donald Trump about an individual mandate for health insurance.\nThen-Senator Barack Obama did not favor an individual mandate, though the Affordable Care Act in its final form includes it.\nDespite running as a Republican candidate, Trump has spoken favorably of a government-run single payer health care system in the past.\nThe purpose of the mandate is to incentivize healthy people who might not otherwise purchase health insurance to get covered, spreading the cost of health care over more people.\nThe mandate remains one of the most controversial aspects of the health care law."}
