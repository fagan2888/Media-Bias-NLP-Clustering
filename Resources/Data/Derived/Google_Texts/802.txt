Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district includes parts of Delaware, Chester, Montgomery, Berks and Lancaster counties.In this election cycle, a political newcomer hopes to kick out a veteran politician.Republican Pat Meehan is in his second term in a GOP-leaning district, and has never lost an election.The former US Attorney says he has the political experience you just can't beat."I'd like to hope that I'm in a good position because people believe that I pay attention to the things that they care about," said Congressman Meehan.Democrat Mary Ellen Balchunis is a La Salle University political science professor who has never held public office.She has struggled to match Meehan's huge fundraising advantage but is putting hopes in a poll by Lake Research Partners. It found only one in three voters in the district even know Meehan is their congressman."The people that his votes have helped are many people outside the district - millionaires and billionaires.I feel like the people in this district are really hurting," said Balchunis.Congressman Meehan says preventing cybercrimes, like the data breach at Acme, is a priorityHe hopes to change provisions in the Affordable Care Act and hold the line on income taxes."It's not always a question of more taxes but the real key to generating more revenue is to create a growth economy," said Congressman Meehan.Balchunis would seek to reduce gun violence, raise taxes for "wealthier" Americans, raise the federal minimum wage, and fight for gender equality."Experts are saying I could be the only woman, I have the best chance of being the only woman in the Pennsylvania delegation. That's pretty pitiful, out of 18 house members," said Balchunis.Only time will tell who will come out victorious. Election Day is on Tuesday, November 4th.
