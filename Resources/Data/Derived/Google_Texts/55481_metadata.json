Swan Mountain provided a steep ascent beyond the morning sun\u2019s reach before a speedy descent into Keystone. This only preceded the sixth of six mountain passes conquered during the tour, which saw approximately 30,000 feet of elevation gain overall.\n\nAs cyclists made their slow, steady climb of Loveland Pass, the sun shone over the peaks like a spotlight from the rafters, highlighting the tour\u2019s last great act of collective endurance and grit.\n\nTerrific winds in most every direction harried riders from the summit through the descent to Loveland Ski Area, from which the route took a variety of bike trails and frontage roads to Idaho Springs, before a triple threat of climbs completed the tour.\n\nFirst came Floyd Hill, which went like rotisserie chicken \u2014 a slow roaster as the temperatures climbed as rapidly as the grade. Next came an Interstate 70 cameo, with a gradual climb through a pair of exits.\n\nThe tour\u2019s final climb: Lookout Mountain, which provided panoramic views of the Denver area before leading riders down 6 miles to downtown Golden and the finish line under its iconic arch.\n\n\n\nBryan Boyle: 303-954-1311, @boyle or bboyle@denverpost.com\n\n\u2014 For more news, analysis, photos and video from the 2014 Ride The Rockies, visit The Denver Post\u2019s Ride The Rockies blog.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ride the Rockies Day 6: A finish under the arch in Golden", "title": "Ride the Rockies Day 6: A finish under the arch in Golden", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/13/ride-the-rockies-day-6-a-finish-under-the-arch-in-golden/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613__20140614_A8_CD14RTR1p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140613__20140614_A8_CD14RTR1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-13T20:40:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:46:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd83\"", "article_summary": "The tour\u2019s final climb: Lookout Mountain, which provided panoramic views of the Denver area before leading riders down 6 miles to downtown Golden and the finish line under its iconic arch.\nSwan Mountain provided a steep ascent beyond the morning sun\u2019s reach before a speedy descent into Keystone.\nBryan Boyle: 303-954-1311, @boyle or bboyle@denverpost.com\u2014 For more news, analysis, photos and video from the 2014 Ride The Rockies, visit The Denver Post\u2019s Ride The Rockies blog.\nGOLDEN \u2014 The sixth and final day of the 29th annual Ride The Rockies cycling tour got underway Friday beneath a cloudless sky in Breckenridge for a 77-mile journey to Golden.\nThis only preceded the sixth of six mountain passes conquered during the tour, which saw approximately 30,000 feet of elevation gain overall."}
