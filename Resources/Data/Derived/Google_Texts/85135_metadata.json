Bill Flores, is demanding the half dozen or so candidates vying to lead the party fill out surveys that put in stone their positions on issues ranging from Obamacare (spoiler: they all oppose it) to how they plan to run the People\u2019s House (spoiler: \u201cNot like Boehner\u201d will be the resounding theme).\n\nFlores, however, denies the conservative group is holding the party\u2019s future leaders ransom.\n\n\u201cThose are simple questions I mean that\u2019s not a purity test, and I expect everybody to answer them honestly,\u201d Flores said before adding that his members will remember this new pledge. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re going to hold them accountable to.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday the candidates for leadership posts will address the group at a \u2018candidates forum\u2019 and they\u2019re expected to deliver the completed questionnaire to Flores by Monday afternoon so he can send them out to his members ahead of the in-person grilling.\n\nAs for the inter-party fight?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big family and sometimes it has a fistfight,\u201d Flores quipped with a telling smile as he walked back onto the House floor where leadership contestants were jockeying for support from the disparate factions of the Grand Ole Party.\n\nWhile Flores denies his purity test is a purity test, other Republicans are less subtle.\n\nRep. Dave Brat (R-VA), aka the man who unseated former Majority Leader Eric Cantor, wants leaders to sign a contract.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to support whoever puts their principles down on paper ahead of time and those principles have to be the big deal: Balance budget, no amnesty, get rid of Obamacare, and then all of the procedural rules to help run this House in order to achieve these objectives,\u201d the Cantor slayer said.\n\nBrat is a member of the tea-party-centric House Freedom Caucus. Moderates are demanding that the party\u2019s rank and file members unanimously support the party picks to be speaker when they come before the full House for a vote.\n\nBut Brat said he would withhold his support from any candidate who fails to check off the boxes on his laundry list of conservative principles. If that means he loses a committee position for not supporting the winner, so be it.\n\nThat complicates things for the Republican Party. Rep. Kevin McCarthy (CA) is next in line to wield the speaker\u2019s gavel, but his new, dark horse challenger, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (UT), is trying to syphon off McCarthy supporters by raising the specter that the tea party opposes McCarthy.\n\n\"[T]here's really a math problem,\u201d Chaffetz said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cYou need 218 votes on the floor of the House. There's 246 Republicans that will vote, but there are nearly 50 people and a growing number that will not and cannot vote for Kevin McCarthy as the speaker on the floor. He's going to fall short of the 218 votes on the floor of House.\"\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Not anymore. Renegade lawmakers now fundraise and gain cable TV fame by bucking their party establishment. The incentive system has been reversed: It now pays to be an ass.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus was the biggest thorn in Speaker Boehner\u2019s side and it looks to be the biggest impediment to whoever his proceeds him.\n\nTheir defiance is angering the more moderate\u2014though highly conservative\u2014wing of the GOP.\n\n\u201cThe members of the Freedom Caucus have set unrealistic expectations for House Republicans,\u201d said a visibly angry freshman Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL). \u201cThey do it every time they speak to the media. They do it every time they return to their districts. When they have not succeeded in meeting those expectations they have decided to blame our leaders.\u201d\n\nCurbelo likens recent closed door party meetings to \u201ctherapy sessions.\u201d He too opposes Obamacare, but he argues people like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) mislead the party\u2019s conservative base by over promising on repealing the controversial law because a Democrat with a veto pen is in the White House.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that some of our colleagues have over promised back home,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come back, they realize they can\u2019t deliver and blame it on our leadership. That\u2019s just not fair.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also been some splintering in the Freedom Caucus. California Rep. Tom McClintock is one of the more conservative members of the House, but he recently left the tea party group in protest.\n\n\u201cI think their tactics were counterproductive to enacting conservative policy,\u201d McClintock said. \u201cNot only were they not advancing the conservative agenda, they have been an acting impediment to that agenda, unwittingly albeit, but an impediment none the less.\u201d\n\nMcClintock was no fan of Speaker Boehner, but he accuses the Freedom Caucus of treating him unfairly. As for a potential Speaker McCarthy? McClintock sees hope because of the difference in their styles.\n\n\u201cI think that Kevin McCarthy has proven himself as Majority Leader. He will be a great Speaker because he is a great listener, which is one of John Boehner\u2019s big failings,\u201d McClintock said.\n\nIf you look at chatter in the Twitter-verse you see many Democratic voters and progressive activists celebrating the Republican on Republican violence that\u2019s on full display at the Capitol. But some Democrats in Congress are cautioning against that response.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mattlaslo"}, "keywords": "Kevin McCarthy, u.s. poli, Politics-Congress, Jason Chaffetz, John Boehner", "publicationDate": 201510050500, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "As leadership elections approach this week, Republicans from different factions are readying for an all out internal brawl about the future of the GOP.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Republicans Ready for Family Fight Club", "tags": "entity:person/kevin_mccarthy,topic:politics,article:politics-congress,entity:person/jason-chaffetz,entity:person/john_boehner", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Republicans Ready for Family Fight Club \",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/05/republicans-ready-for-family-fight-club.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/05/republicans-ready-for-family-fight-club/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/48134053.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/05/republicans-ready-for-family-fight-club\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-05T05:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Matt Laslo\",\"tags\":[\"kevin_mccarthy\",\"politics\",\"politics-congress\",\"jason-chaffetz\",\"john_boehner\"]}", "news_keywords": "Kevin McCarthy, US Politics, PoliticsCongress, Jason Chaffetz, John Boehner", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Matt Laslo", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-10-05T05:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/matt-laslohtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/05/republicans-ready-for-family-fight-club", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "As leadership elections approach this week, Republicans from different factions are readying for an all out internal brawl about the future of the GOP.", "title": "Republicans Ready for Family Fight Club", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/05/republicans-ready-for-family-fight-club.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/10/05/republicans-ready-for-family-fight-club/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1444021603256.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/m/matt-laslo", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2422\"", "article_summary": "Brat is a member of the tea-party-centric House Freedom Caucus.\nAs for a potential Speaker McCarthy?\n\u201cThe members of the Freedom Caucus have set unrealistic expectations for House Republicans,\u201d said a visibly angry freshman Rep.
