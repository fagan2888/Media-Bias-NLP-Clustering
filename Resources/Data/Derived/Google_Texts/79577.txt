Last year was a good year for owners of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, medical office buildings and other properties in the health care sector.

But will the party continue in 2015? That was the subject of the Health Care Real Estate Investment Opportunities Summit at the Park Lane hotel in Manhattan Thursday that was sponsored by iGlobal Forum.

The consensus was largely: yes. Major changes in the health care industry in the wake of the Affordable Care Act are creating less demand for space in traditional hospitals and more demand for space in a wide range of other health care properties.

That’s driving up prices and sparking development, panelists said.

Values also are expected to stay high thanks to the low interest rate environment and money flowing into the sector from private equity firms, foreign investors, real estate investment trusts and others, according to participants at the conference.

Here are some of the highlights from the sessions:

– Prices have been going up particularly for medical office buildings. In 2008, investors buying such properties were getting initial yields from the buildings’ net income in the 8% to 9% range, panelists said. But today, because prices have risen, those returns have dropped to below 6%.

– Because prices for medical office buildings have risen, investors are increasingly looking at other types of health care properties that are considered more risky, like skilled nursing facilities. “Investors are going up the risk curve,” said Michael Bennett, a managing director at HFF.

– Hospitals and health care systems have been reluctant to sell the massive amounts of properties they own on their campuses. That’s one of the reasons prices are high for medical office buildings. “The hospitals are not releasing their portfolios of properties,” said John Marshall, a vice president with Duke Realty.

– But as prices rise, hospitals might begin to change their mind about selling. “We’re going to see more on-campus property coming onto the market,” predicted Jay Miele, managing director with Hammond Hanlon Camp LLC.

– New types of health care properties are being created as traditional hospitals face increasing pressure to discharge patients earlier. Last year, for example, Mainstreet, a Carmel, Ind. real estate company, developed about 20 properties for patients who are discharged from hospitals but still need medical care, according to Scott White, executive vice president. Mainstreet expects to develop about 50 such facilities in 2015, he said.
