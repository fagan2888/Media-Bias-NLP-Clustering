(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque)\n\n3926332\n\nPresident Barack Obama used a Monday Rose Garden ceremony to showcase a woman who got healthcare services via Obamacare \u2014 but both hid the fact that the woman had bypassed his website\u2019s defective subsidy software.\n\nThe woman, Janice Baker, is wealthy enough to pay for her gold-level plan without applying for subsidies that are central to the Obamacare program.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to apply for any subsidies,\u201d she told The Daily Caller. Her income exceeded the law\u2019s caps, and so she used the website to connect with her new healthcare company, she told TheDC Oct. 23.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy\u201d with the healthcare plan, said Baker, age 59. who runs the \u201cHeavenly Hound Hotel\u201d in Selbyville, Del., with her spouse.\n\nHer gold plan costs between $8,772 to $9,924 per year in premiums..\n\nHer husband, who does not have a preexisting condition, bought private insurance outside the Obamacare site, she said.\n\nBaker testified at Obama\u2019s Rose Garden ceremony that she had enrolled in a defined-benefit plan via the troubled website, but she didn\u2019t reveal that she had bypassed the flawed subsidy software.\n\nThe subsidy software has proved to be a critical problem on the website, because it is complicated and must be verified via complex links to multiple other government databases.\n\nThe subsidy software is also politically vital because it reduces voters\u2019 sticker-shock once they see the monthly premiums, co-pays and deductibles of each, government-approved benefit plan.\n\nThe software is also needed to allow poor Americans to buy the expensive, government-designed benefit plans now being presented by the healthcare companies.\n\nSince the exchanges opened on Oct. 1, the administration has downplayed problems and has hidden data about the number of people who have enrolled in private sector benefit plans.\n\nThe data has not been published, or even released to supportive Democratic legislators on the Hill.\n\nIn his speech \u2014 which was widely panned as a crude TV-pitch \u2014 Obama also obscured Brown\u2019s ability to bypass the troubled software.\n\nWhen the president walked into the garden, he simply invited her to speak, without making any introduction or description.\n\n\u201cHello. My name is Janice Baker,\u201d Baker began.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the first person in the state of Delaware to enroll for health insurance through the new marketplace\u2026 it took me a number of frustrating attempts before I could apply for and select my plan\u2026 I was able to find a policy I am thrilled with, saving $150 a month, and much lower deductibles than my previous policy that I held through my small business,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here today to encourage other people like me who needs access to quality, affordable insurance, and to tell them to have patience with such a new system,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThank you all. And I am now honored to introduce the President of the United States,\u201d she ended.\n\n\u201cThank you, Janice,\u201d Obama replied. \u201cMany Americans with a preexisting condition, like Janice, are discovering that they can finally get health insurance like everybody else,\u201d he continued.\n\nBaker was part of a group of 13 people showcased by the president. Only three, however, had actually completed the sign-up process via the website. The other two people were David Hall, and Zohre Abolfazli, who had not selected a plan.

However, Obamacare regulations have forced many companies to cancel current insurance plans.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "Obama's star witness in the Rose Garden pitch couldn't use troubled subsidy software.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "President Barack Obama used a Monday Rose Garden ceremony to showcase a woman who got healthcare services via Obamacare --- but both hid the fact that the woman had bypassed his website\u2019s defective", "title": "Obama\u2019s ShamWow speech showcased misleading witness [VIDEO]", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/23/obamas-shamwow-speech-showcased-misleading-witness-video/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-21T160255Z_1_CBRE99K18L000_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1382563972742.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama's star witness in the Rose Garden pitch couldn't use troubled subsidy software", "title": "Obama\u2019s ShamWow speech showcased misleading witness [VIDEO] Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/23/obamas-shamwow-speech-showcased-misleading-witness-video/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-21T160255Z_1_CBRE99K18L000_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1382563972742.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-23 17:33:28", "sailthru.title": "Obama's ShamWow speech showcased misleading witness [VIDEO]", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,neil-munro", "sailthru.description": "President Barack Obama used a Monday Rose Garden ceremony to showcase a woman who got healthcare services via Obamacare --- but both hid the fact that the woman had bypassed his website\u2019s defective", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-21T160255Z_1_CBRE99K18L000_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1382563972742.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd12c\"", "article_summary": "My name is Janice Baker,\u201d Baker began.\nPrior to the plan, Baker was insured by a plan from United Health.\nPresident Barack Obama speaks about health care from the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington Oct. 21, 2013.\n(RELATED: Group behind Obama at Rose Garden speech includes only 3 Obamacare registrents)Baker\u2019s gold plan is offered by Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy\u201d with the healthcare plan, said Baker, age 59. who runs the \u201cHeavenly Hound Hotel\u201d in Selbyville, Del., with her spouse."}
