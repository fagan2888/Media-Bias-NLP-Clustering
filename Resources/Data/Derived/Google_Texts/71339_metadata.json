Mike Pence\u2019s favorite charities is Midwest Food Bank, a faith-based alternative to Gleaners, the region\u2019s dominant player in hunger relief.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Pence, an evangelical Christian, would support a faith-based food bank, but there\u2019s more setting Midwest apart than a Bible verse (Matthew 25:35) emblazoned on the wall.\n\n\n\nPrayer is integral to Midwest, which steers clear of a federal program supplying meat and produce to most food banks. That approach offers a window into Pence\u2019s decision last month to forgo up to $80 million in federal funds to expand access to preschool for low-income families\u2014a move many observers found puzzling.\n\n\n\nIf the hunger-relief world is any indication, specific instances of federal intrusion don\u2019t matter so much as the perception that government funding hamstrings religious expression. And many preschools are run by churches.\n\n\n\nPence\u2019s decision disappointed and surprised champions of Indiana\u2019s foray into preschool funding, a $10 million pilot program that passed the Legislature at Pence\u2019s urging. The governor, who initially rejected Obamacare money to expand Medicaid in Indiana, consistently resists federal intrusion, but that\u2019s not enough of an explanation for Indiana Chamber of Commerce education lobbyist Derek Redelman.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat are the specifics?\u201d he wondered.\n\n\n\nPence did not respond to questions from IBJ about his particular objection to the federal government\u2019s preschool development grant, and he also declined to discuss his support for Midwest Food Bank.\n\n\n\nAfter his election, Pence used inaugural activities as food drives for Midwest, gathering 1,475 pounds of food and raising $2,521. For the past two years, he and state employees have held a pumpkin sale on the Statehouse lawn to benefit the food bank.\n\nPence has supported Midwest Food Bank since his election. Pence has supported Midwest Food Bank since his election.\n\nObservers are surprised by Pence\u2019s rejection of federal dollars for preschool in part because Pence has been vague about his rationale. In a letter to the Indianapolis Star, he said the federal program required Indiana to expand its preschool pilot even before it was up and running.\n\n\n\n\u201cIndiana\u2019s program is based on parental choice and includes the flexibility and accountability needed to ensure children are in programs that get real results,\u201d Pence wrote. \u201cIt is important not to allow the lure of federal grant dollars to define our state\u2019s mission and programs. More federal dollars do not necessarily equal success, especially when those dollars come with requirements and conditions that will not help\u2014and may even hinder\u2014running a successful program of our own making.\u201d\n\n\n\nFederal food\n\n\n\nJohn Whitaker, executive director of Midwest Food Bank in Indianapolis, acknowledges that the meat and produce supplied by The Emergency Food Assistance Program, or TEFAP, is \u201cgood food.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut, Whitaker said, \u201ca lot of agencies we serve don\u2019t take TEFAP food because they\u2019re not allowed to share the Gospel along with the giving of the food.\u201d\n\n\n\nA program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, TEFAP is administered by the Indiana State Department of Health, which works with Gleaners and 10 other food banks in defined territories.\n\n\n\nWhitaker said Midwest has its own sources of fresh food, including a small farm planted beside its warehouse along State Road 37 South.\n\n\n\nMidwest\u2019s Indianapolis division has grown quickly since opening in 2008. It serves 300 food pantries and other charities in 53 Indiana counties. Because it\u2019s not part of the TEFAP program, Midwest isn\u2019t constrained to territorial boundaries, and Whitaker thinks that contributes to the food bank\u2019s financial efficiency.\n\n\n\nThe Indianapolis division distributed 16 million pounds of food on a budget of $560,000 last year, Whitaker said. With a staff just short of five full-time people and 3,500 volunteers, Midwest\u2019s overhead is about 1 percent, even less than Gleaners\u2019, though both receive a four-star rating from Charity Navigator. Based in Bloomington, Illinois, Midwest has five locations.\n\n\n\nCovering 21 counties in central and eastern Indiana, Gleaners handled 5.3 million pounds of TEFAP food in its most recent fiscal year ended Sept. 30. That was 17 percent of Gleaners\u2019 total distribution, 31 million pounds.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe other thing you need to know about the TEFAP program, it\u2019s great food,\u201d Gleaners CEO Cindy Hubert said. \u201cIt\u2019s chicken. It\u2019s sliced apples.\u201d\n\n\n\nMost of the 250 charities that get food from Gleaners are faith-based, and 60 of them participate in TEFAP. To Hubert, the federal restriction on prayer is a minor impediment, considering the nutritional value of the food.\n\n\n\nGleaners runs government-required civil rights training for charities taking TEFAP food. The charities send representatives to the annual training, which lasts less than an hour, Hubert said.\n\n\n\nPrayer can\u2019t be a requirement for receiving food, she said. So the way to avoid breaking the rule\u2014or being perceived as breaking the rule\u2014is to pray before or after handing out the food. Not during.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that simple,\u201d Hubert said. \u201cThose regulations to distribute the government food are very minimal, quite frankly.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not the way Whitaker describes it: \u201cThere\u2019s lots and lots of strings attached to that food,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nOn mission\n\n\n\nIt would be difficult to understate the importance of prayer to Midwest\u2019s operation.\n\nWhitaker Whitaker\n\nWhen volunteers from pantries arrive for distribution day, Whitaker said, he and his crew ask whether they\u2019d like to pray.\n\n\n\nSometimes the prayer is for problems in the ministries, but it can also be for personal struggles, Whitaker said.\n\n\n\n\u201cA lot of these pantries are in needy areas, where the people actually serving are needy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so they\u2019re just really sacrificially giving, so they really appreciate a word of encouragement.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne of Midwest\u2019s major suppliers is PepsiCo because of Whitaker\u2019s connection to an employee at the Plainfield plant. After the death of her son in 2008, the employee asked for donations to Midwest in his memory. Whitaker went to pick up the food, and when he met the woman and heard her story, he asked whether he could pray with her. They prayed for 45 minutes, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here,\u201d Whitaker said. \u201cTo me, it makes no sense to just feed someone for a day when you can give them hope for an eternity.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere are other differences between Midwest and Gleaners. Midwest doesn\u2019t charge partner agencies a fee for food. Midwest specializes in disaster relief, while Gleaners works closely with schools to send kids home for the weekend with backpacks full of food.\n\n\n\nWhitaker, a former grocery-chain manager, said he sees a lot of inefficiency in the food bank system. He also thinks it would be impossible to feed all hungry people without some form of government assistance.\n\n\n\nHe and Hubert insist that the two food banks, which serve many of the same agencies, complement each other\u2019s work toward the same goal.\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of Gov.
