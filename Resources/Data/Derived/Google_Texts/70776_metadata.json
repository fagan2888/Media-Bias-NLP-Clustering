But parents can still offer their adult children a leg up by lending smaller amounts.\n\nThis week, the Republican presidential candidate explained that he had used the \u201csmall loan\u201d \u2014 which would now be worth many times the original amount due to inflation -- to start buying properties in Manhattan. Trump also said that he had to pay his father back with interest.\n\nCharging interest is among the many tips experts give parents considering similar arrangements, but for amounts with fewer zeroes. A handshake and a check aren\u2019t enough to keep family relations intact \u2013 and stay on the right side of the IRS.\n\nRelated: Crushed by Student Loans, Millennials Start Saving for Their Kids\n\n\u201cIt can be a great way for parents who are earning low interest to increase their return and for kids to get a lower interest-rate loan,\u201d says Mitchell Kraus, owner of Capital Intelligence Associates, a wealth management firm in Los Angeles. \u201cBut it needs to be well thought out.\u201d\n\nGet it in writing\n\nFinancial planners largely agree that the best way to avoid fractured relationships down the road is to put the details of the loan in ink.\n\n\u201cWhat I find with these loans, because they\u2019re friends or family, they don\u2019t spell out the terms of the loan and problems come up later,\u201d says Tim Watters, principal of Watters Financial Services in Paramus, New Jersey.\n\nThe loan document should include basic information like the borrowed amount, the interest rate, the length of the loan and terms of repayment. Include minute details like when each payment is due, the amount of each payment and if the payment includes both principal and interest.\n\nRelated: FBI Warns of a New Student Loan Scam\n\nThe document should also explain what will happen if the loan is not paid back. If the loan was for real estate, do the parents foreclose on the child\u2019s house? Is the outstanding amount deducted from the child\u2019s inheritance if the parent dies? These scenarios must be ironed out to prevent misunderstanding and conflict, Watters says.\n\nThis needs to be a formal document with a promissory note or deed of trust for real estate-secured loans, says Elizabeth Grahsl, a vice president at Prosperity Bank. Loan forms can be drawn up by a lawyer or downloaded online.\n\n\u201cProper documentation enables the borrower to deduct loan interest if funds are used for business or real estate purposes,\u201d Grahsl wrote in an email. \u201cAnd it can also can enable the lender to deduct losses if the loan is not repaid.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t mess with the IRS\n\nParents lending the money are required to report any interest income from the loan to the IRS. Almost two-thirds of Americans aged 45 and over aren\u2019t familiar with that obligation, according to a 2012 survey from National Family Mortgage.\n\nThe consequences of not reporting the loan income are the same as any other form of tax evasion: steep penalties, interest and possible prosecution, Grahsl says.\n\nRelated: Taxpayers Lose $23 Million in IRS Phone Scam\n\nAdditionally, the interest rate on these loans must comply with IRS rules to be considered a taxable event. The IRS every month publishes the Applicable Federal Rate (AFR), which is the minimum rate that loans must carry, says Thomas Scanlon, a certified financial planner in Manchester, Connecticut.\n\n\u201cThe rate depends on the loan duration and the payment cycle,\u201d Scanlon says. \u201cRight now, these rates are very modest. Family members can certainly charge more if they want.\u201d\n\nIf the loan rate falls below the AFR, then the IRS would consider the loan a gift, which could trigger tax penalties if the amount is large enough.\n\nRecognize the pitfalls\n\nDespite even the best preparation, loans between family members and friends can go wrong. First, parents should never lend money that they can't afford to lose.\n\n\u201cEssentially we tell our clients that many family loans turn into grants. If the parent can financially handle this loss, no issue,\u201d he says. \u201cIf, however, they are counting on being paid back and they aren\u2019t, that\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nParents need to honestly assess the riskiness of the borrower and not be clouded by love. For instance, if a child needs the money to get out of credit card debt, ask why he owes so much in the first place. Debt from unrestrained spending is a red flag, whereas debt from a medical emergency or temporary job loss probably is not, Watters says.\n\nAs lenders, parents should avoid attaching \u201cnon-financial strings\u201d to the loan such as dictating family trips or grandchildren\u2019s schooling, Grahsl says.\n\nThe biggest drawback for these loans can be the emotional toll, experts say. For example, a spouse may feel uncomfortable being in debt to in-laws. Siblings may wonder why they didn\u2019t get the same deal. Unpaid loans could cause resentment for parents, especially if their children are spending frivolously, while forced payments could breed similar feelings among children.\n\n\u201cLoans should not take place where the family isn\u2019t already close or there are other relationship issues,\u201d Kraus recommends. \u201cThe loan can aggravate these already tender issues.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Not many people are as lucky as Donald Trump, who recently revealed that he got a $1 m", "title": "Just Like Trump: How to Borrow Money from Family", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/29/Just-Trump-How-Borrow-Money-Family", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08212015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/29/Just-Trump-How-Borrow-Money-Family", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/08212015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Not many people are as lucky as Donald Trump, who recently revealed that he got a $1 m", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf068\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEssentially we tell our clients that many family loans turn into grants.\nThe loan document should include basic information like the borrowed amount, the interest rate, the length of the loan and terms of repayment.\nA handshake and a check aren\u2019t enough to keep family relations intact \u2013 and stay on the right side of the IRS.\nAs lenders, parents should avoid attaching \u201cnon-financial strings\u201d to the loan such as dictating family trips or grandchildren\u2019s schooling, Grahsl says.\n\u201cLoans should not take place where the family isn\u2019t already close or there are other relationship issues,\u201d Kraus recommends."}
