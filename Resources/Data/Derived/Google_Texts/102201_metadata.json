But it is facing a cash crunch and will struggle with scheduled repayment of its debts.\n\nAthens wouldn\u2019t ask for a delay in repayment in its ECB obligations, the minister noted, but rather something that would make the repayments easier to achieve.\n\n\u201cI do not believe the ECB would accept a delay, but what we can do is we can package a deal that makes these repayments palatable and reasonably doable as part of our overall negotiation regarding the Greek debt, and the next \u2026 contract for growth for the Greek economy between us and the partners.\u201d\n\nLast week, Greece won a four-month extension to its 240 billion-euro ($270 billion) international loan agreement earlier this month in a deal with the other members of the 19-nation eurozone. In return, Athens has pledged a series of budget reforms, which for now contain no details but will have to be turned into concrete measures by April.\n\nThose measures, Varoufakis said, were Greece\u2019s priority, but tackling the country\u2019s oversize debt was also necessary.\n\n\u201cThe April agreement concerns reforms. And this is our imperative,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, and independently of the April agreement \u2026 we intend to begin the conversation with our partners and institutions regarding debt sustainability and debt rescheduling.\u201d\n\nFor this, Athens will make proposals with the aim of helping nominal gross domestic product grow and to maximize its repayments in real terms, Varoufakis said.\n\n\u201cWe will be proposing a menu of swaps between new instruments, new public financially engineered instruments and segments of our debt.\u201d\n\nGreece\u2019s debt currently stands at 315 billion euros, or 176 percent of GDP \u2014 a level many say is unsustainable and can never be paid back in full.\n\nThe new left-wing government was elected on Jan. 25 on promises of cancelling the austerity measures that accompanied Greece\u2019s international bailout and seeking forgiveness for most of the country\u2019s debt.\n\nBut to win the agreement for Greece\u2019s four-month loan extension, the country committed to honoring its financial obligations \u201cfully and timely.\u201d\n\nThe agreement also stipulates Athens will not receive any of the pending 7.5 billion euros in the last bailout installment it is due until it submits all its reforms and passes a review by its creditors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AP Interview: Greece\u2019s repayments to ECB need discussion", "title": "AP Interview: Greece\u2019s repayments to ECB need discussion", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "AP Interview: Greece\u2019s repayments to ECB need discussion", "title": "AP Interview: Greece\u2019s repayments to ECB need discussion", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/01/ap_interview_greeces_repayments_to_ecb_need_discussion/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/greece-varoufakis-interview.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AP Interview: Greece\u2019s repayments to ECB need discussion", "title": "AP Interview: Greece\u2019s repayments to ECB need discussion", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/greece-varoufakis-interview.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elena Becatoros", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22cd\"", "article_summary": "Greece faces IMF repayments in March of about 1.5 billion euros ($1.69 billion), and about 6.7 billion euros ($7.5 billion) to the ECB in the summer.\nThose measures, Varoufakis said, were Greece\u2019s priority, but tackling the country\u2019s oversize debt was also necessary.\nTopics: From the Wires, News, Politics NewsATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 Greece will prioritize debt repayments to the International Monetary Fund, some of which come due in March, but repayments to the European Central Bank are \u201cin a different league\u201d and will need discussion with Greece\u2019s creditors, the country\u2019s finance minister said.\nThe new left-wing government was elected on Jan. 25 on promises of cancelling the austerity measures that accompanied Greece\u2019s international bailout and seeking forgiveness for most of the country\u2019s debt.\nAthens wouldn\u2019t ask for a delay in repayment in its ECB obligations, the minister noted, but rather something that would make the repayments easier to achieve."}
