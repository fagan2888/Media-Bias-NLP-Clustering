Last year\u2019s floods were a catalyst for a larger mosquito population this year, said Master Community Association executive director Kevin Burnett.\n\nHe said his group has heard the complaints and is active in using larvicide as a prevention tool.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a larger issue than just Stapleton. It\u2019s a City of Denver issue,\u201d he said.\n\nDenver\u2019s Department of Environmental Health is responsible for the city\u2019s policy on dealing with the mosquito population.\n\nManager of the air, water and climate section, Gregg Thomas, said his group does weekly surveillance. If workers see high larvae population in an area, they drop a larvicide puck into the water, but the city does not spray to kill adult mosquitoes.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t spray because there are public and environmental impacts,\u201d he said, adding that spraying is a temporary solution and the department would have to spray every week to keep up.\n\nWhile some feel that this year is worse, Stapleton United Neighbors board president Mark Mehringer said the issue comes up every year. The organization is preparing a survey to try and get more feedback from residents.\n\nOne Stapleton resident said he was unaware of the petition and that he likely wouldn\u2019t sign if asked because he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been outside plenty and really haven\u2019t noticed anything crazy. I think what the city is doing is fine,\u201d Justin Blue said.\n\nAnother resident, Amanda Allshouse, said she thinks the problem is bad this year and understands the frustration of the residents.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s frustration if you go outside and are attacked by 30 mosquitoes in 20 seconds,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the answer is, but people are working on it.\u201d\n\nJoe Vaccarelli: 303-954-2396, jvaccarelli@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joe_vacc", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Stapleton residents send Denver a petition complaining of mosquitoes", "title": "Stapleton residents send Denver a petition complaining of mosquitoes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/14/stapleton-residents-send-denver-a-petition-complaining-of-mosquitoes/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140714__brighton_mosquitosp1.jpg", "height": 404}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140714__brighton_mosquitosp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-14T10:49:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:49:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "One Stapleton resident said he was unaware of the petition and that he likely wouldn\u2019t sign if asked because he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal.\nAnother resident, Amanda Allshouse, said she thinks the problem is bad this year and understands the frustration of the residents.\nStapleton is well known for its abundant open space, giving residents a chance to escape from the urban feel of Denver, but some residents are upset over another thing the neighborhood has a lot of: mosquitoes.\nWhile some feel that this year is worse, Stapleton United Neighbors board president Mark Mehringer said the issue comes up every year.\nMore than 1,100 people have signed a petition started by a Stapleton resident, urging the city and the Stapleton Master Community Association to find both immediate and long-terms solutions to the mosquito problem they says the neighborhood is having this summer."}
