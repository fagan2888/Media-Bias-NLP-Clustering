Erika Gauthier, who has been its president for two years and worked with membership for four years before that, has accepted a job with Progressive Insurance.\n\n\u201cI got my MBA last year and want to get out of my comfort zone,\u201d said Gautheir. Working for a big company, she said, will allow her to work her way up. Her new job is in the medical department, investigating claims.\n\nHer last day at the Guilderland Chamber of Commerce will be Friday, Feb. 19.\n\nThe office will be managed by Briana Lampman, membership associate, who began work at the chamber six weeks ago. \u201cShe\u2019ll answer the phone,\u201d said Steven Wacksman, the chairman of the chamber\u2019s board of directors. \u201cThe chamber is going to remain open; all events will go on.\u201d\n\nBoard members will assume various duties over the next several months, Wacksman said, until a new president is hired. The salary will be in the \u201cmid-forties,\u201d said Wacksman, whose wife, Katherine Burbank, was the chamber president before Gauthier.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for someone to work strongly with local businesses and build a partnership with the town,\u201d said Wacksman. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for the face of the chamber.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate Erica\u2019s tenure at the chamber. We\u2019ll continue getting stronger,\u201d said Wacksman.\n\nGauthier said one of the challenges the new president will face is time management. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly planning events,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a five-month-old and was in grad school,\u201d she said, when she became president. She earned her master\u2019s degree in business administration from Excelsior College.\n\nThe biggest struggle, she said, has been \u201cgrowing membership.\u201d Three or four years ago, she said, the Guilderland Chamber of Commerce had 500 members; many joined in order to get affordable health care.\n\nOnce the Affordable Care Act took effect, chamber membership plummeted, she said. Membership is stable now at about 350, she said. \u201cWe had a grant to help individuals and families with the Affordable Care Act. Businesses were really blindsided.\u201d\n\nOne of the things Gauthier is proudest of during her presidency is surveying members \u2014 \u201cwe did market research, starting in November 2014,\u201d she said \u2014 to develop a strategic plan. \u201cWe talked to members about concerns and worries,\u201d she said. \u201cThey wanted us to focus on local business.\u201d\n\nThis led to the development of the \u201cGuilderlocal\u201d campaign and on \u201ccash mobs,\u201d similar to flash mobs, where a local business is targeted for a rush of customers.\n\nGauthier is also pleased with the chamber\u2019s current finances. \u201cEven though the membership has dropped, we\u2019ve managed to build a fund balance for the first time in years,\u201d she said.\n\nThe chamber is financed by its fundraising events and by member dues. A business with one to 10 employees pays $250 annually; dues increase incrementally with the number of workers.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; minimum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The salary will be in the \u201cmid-forties,\u201d said Wacksman, whose wife, Katherine Burbank, was the chamber president before Gauthier.\nHer last day at the Guilderland Chamber of Commerce will be Friday, Feb. 19.\nOnce the Affordable Care Act took effect, chamber membership plummeted, she said.\nGUILDERLAND \u2014 The chamber of commerce here is looking for a new leader.\nThe office will be managed by Briana Lampman, membership associate, who began work at the chamber six weeks ago."}
