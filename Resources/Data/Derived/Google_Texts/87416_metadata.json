More established and serious awards shows tend to be resistant to change, but if the producers want to make a show that is actually worth watching, they should take some hints from MTV.\n\nGoing into last year, I was disheartened by how much the awards ceremony seemed to lose its currency; the 2012 VMAs had been little-watched and stocked with stars who felt like nostalgia acts (Green Day, Alicia Keys, Pink), and there was no reason to believe 2013\u2019s awards show \u2014 which was promoted largely around a reunion for Justin Timberlake\u2019s \u201990s boy band *NSync and a performance by Lady Gaga two years after her commercial peak \u2014 would be any different. Then the Miley Cyrus performance happened.\n\nCyrus\u2019 performance is emblematic of what the VMAs, at their best, can do. The awards ceremony is scheduled in late summer, when little else is generally happening on TV; it\u2019s the perfect time for well-executed trolling or spectacle. Cyrus\u2019 dance with Robin Thicke and a foam finger \u2014 in addition to provoking uncomfortable discussions about sexuality, cultural appropriation and her treatment of her dancers \u2014 was proof positive that pop stars can still move the culture. Cyrus\u2019 reputation, today, as a controversial and notorious star is based largely on that five-minute performance; without it, she\u2019d be successful, but she wouldn\u2019t be Miley, one of the most entertaining figures of the past 12 months.\n\nWhat the Video Music Awards do best is provide ultra-contemporary stars the opportunity to cement their images via meticulously planned stunts. Cyrus has described her VMA mien as \u201cstrategic hot mess,\u201d an act of cartoonish sexuality as self-aware as Britney Spears\u2019 2001 snake-dancing, designed to prove she had grown out of her Mouseketeer days, or Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2011 announcement of her pregnancy onstage, which was more the story than her music. These are the sorts of defining performances the show used to produce at least once a year \u2014 but they\u2019d grown more sporadic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Video Music Awards have figured out--and cleverly exploited--what our celebrity-obsessed culture really wants", "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Video Music Awards have figured out--and cleverly exploited--what our celebrity-obsessed culture really wants", "title": "Why the VMAs are the best awards show ever created", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/24/why_the_vmas_are_the_best_awards_show_ever_created/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/miley_cyrus_vma2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Video Music Awards have figured out--and cleverly exploited--what our celebrity-obsessed culture really wants", "creator": "@dpd_", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/miley_cyrus_vma2.jpg", "title": "Why the VMAs are the best awards show ever created", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why the VMAs are the best awards show ever created", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, ariana grande, Beyonce, Britney Spears, Editor's Picks, Miley Cyrus, MTV, video music awards", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4b4e\"", "article_summary": "What the Video Music Awards do best is provide ultra-contemporary stars the opportunity to cement their images via meticulously planned stunts.\nTopics: ariana grande, Beyonce, Britney Spears, Editor's Picks, Miley Cyrus, MTV, video music awards, Entertainment NewsAfter a long stretch of off-years, MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards are finally back to their rightful place in the culture \u2014 as the best awards show out there, not despite, but because of, the utter irrelevance of the awards themselves.\nCyrus\u2019 performance is emblematic of what the VMAs, at their best, can do.\nThen the Miley Cyrus performance happened.\nThe awards ceremony is scheduled in late summer, when little else is generally happening on TV; it\u2019s the perfect time for well-executed trolling or spectacle."}
