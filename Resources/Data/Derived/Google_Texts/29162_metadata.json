He can be a bloodless monster who will sacrifice lives to protect himself politically (see: Benghazi), or an overly sensitive softie (see: this stupid column).\n\nIf you\u2019ve been paying attention to some of the commentary over the past month or so, you\u2019ve probably hit upon another caricature: Obama the checked-out, disengaged pseudo-president who does nothing but vacation and play golf \u201cwhile the world burns.\u201d Late last month, the Daily Caller\u2019s Matt Lewis wrote a column arguing that Obama \u201cseems to be prematurely packing his bags in hopes for an early departure.\u201d Fox News even conducted a poll asking respondents: \u201cDo you think Barack Obama wants to be president anymore?\u201d (Forty-one percent said \u201cno.\u201d)\n\nWell, Obama\u2019s vacation has come to an end, and he\u2019s transitioned from a golf-crazy layabout who doesn\u2019t even want to preside over the nation into a tyrannical pseudo-king who is ramming his socialist policies down the national gullet.\n\nThe socialist tyranny in question is \u201ca sweeping international climate change agreement to compel nations to cut their planet-warming fossil fuel emissions,\u201d as reported by the New York Times. Conservatives, who tend to believe that climate change is a scam and international cooperation undermines \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism,\u201d lost their minds. \u201cObama\u2019s Lawless, Heartless Climate Treaty\u201d was the headline at Commentary. \u201cObama\u2019s new power grab: A climate change treaty without Senate ratification,\u201d screamed Hot Air.\n\nThe accusations of \u201clawlessness\u201d come from the novel approach the administration has to take in order to make progress on climate policy independently of Republicans in Congress. When it comes to slowing or reversing the impact of climate change, nothing can be done without the United States taking the lead role. The entire world realizes this, but, according to the Times, they also know that the U.S. will never ratify any sort of binding treaty on climate change because doing so would require a supermajority of the U.S. Senate, where there are more than enough Republicans to make sure that never happens:", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a month of calling Obama a lazy checked-out president, conservatives are now angry that he's doing things", "author": "Simon Maloy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After a month of calling Obama a lazy checked-out president, conservatives are now angry that he's doing things", "title": "The right\u2019s \u201ctyranny\u201d paranoia: Why climate deniers are so afraid of Obama now", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/29/the_rights_tyranny_paranoia_why_climate_deniers_are_so_afraid_of_obama_now/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/cruz_obama_paul.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a month of calling Obama a lazy checked-out president, conservatives are now angry that he's doing things", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/cruz_obama_paul.jpg", "title": "The right\u2019s \u201ctyranny\u201d paranoia: Why climate deniers are so afraid of Obama now", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The right\u2019s \u201ctyranny\u201d paranoia: Why climate deniers are so afraid of Obama now", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, carbon dioxide emissions, Climate Change, Conservatives, Daily Caller, Editor's Picks, fossil fuel, Global Warming, Republicans, Senate Republicans, treaties, U.S. Senate", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f9a\"", "article_summary": "Conservatives, who tend to believe that climate change is a scam and international cooperation undermines \u201cAmerican Exceptionalism,\u201d lost their minds.\nWhen it comes to slowing or reversing the impact of climate change, nothing can be done without the United States taking the lead role.\nThe socialist tyranny in question is \u201ca sweeping international climate change agreement to compel nations to cut their planet-warming fossil fuel emissions,\u201d as reported by the New York Times.\n\u201cObama\u2019s new power grab: A climate change treaty without Senate ratification,\u201d screamed Hot Air.\n\u201cObama\u2019s Lawless, Heartless Climate Treaty\u201d was the headline at Commentary."}
