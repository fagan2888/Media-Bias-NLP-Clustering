VIDEO: Writing her own success story

• Lodi teenager already has one book published • The business of writing can start young

LODINovember 17, 2013 9:00pmAt 18 years of age, Cassie Dickson of Lodi is already running her own one-woman business. And a few pesky vampires should, perhaps, just be considered part of the staff.

While battling chronic headaches for several years, Ms. Dickson began writing as a way to entertain herself. She channels those experiences into one of the main characters, who battles night terrors.

Ms. Dickson is now working on the second in the planned four-book series and has several other book projects underway, she says.
