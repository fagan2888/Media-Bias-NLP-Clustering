Aviles had to stop physical therapy and medication for her osteoarthritis.

“Simple things like even brushing my teeth or putting moisturizer on my face is uncomfortable,” she told Diamond.

But Aviles said she knew from what she read that the Affordable Care Act could help.

She reached out to the Community Service Society of New York, which is helping residents of the state navigate the online exchanges.

“Based on my income and my criteria, the government is probably going to subsidize about 90 percent. I will only be responsible for about $994,” said Aviles.

The federal program will mirror what her former employer’s insurance plan covered, Diamond reported.

In Part 4 on Thursday, Diamond will find out what’s being done in New Jersey to get people enrolled.
