More than a dozen executives make more than $200,000 a year. Some make more than double that.\n\nSome people swoon at the big salaries paid to school superintendents in Connecticut. But, really, it\u2019s small change compared to what the health care kings are taking home.\n\nThen there is the king\u2019s gold hoard at L+M, tens of millions of dollars in endowment money, a lot of it stashed away in offshore accounts.\n\nMuch of this is the product of donors who gave generously over the years to guarantee a sound and responsible community hospital, a history of philanthropy for L+M that goes back to the accumulation of the city\u2019s great whaling fortunes.\n\nAll that money could be in play as the hospital landscape in Connecticut changes, with out-of-state for-profit hospitals looking at acquiring nonprofits here and some big nonprofits looking at expanding.\n\nThe General Assembly this year, at the urging of Gov. Dannel Malloy, is looking at this dynamic, especially how hospital executives could profit from mergers and acquisitions of their nonprofit institutions.\n\nA bill that is heading toward passage would require executives of nonprofits to disclose their potential financial gain if their institution is bought or converted to a for-profit company.\n\nIt would specifically require these disclosures in advance of the transaction, so that it could be reviewed by state regulators and the attorney general as part of the approval process.\n\nHearings on the bill generated positive comments from union leaders and Attorney General George Jepsen, who would be in a position to review the material.\n\nJepsen testified in a public hearing on the bill that the proposal is sensible because it would enable him to more accurately determine if there is a conflict of interest in the transaction.\n\nAnother strong voice in favor of the bill came during hearings from freshman state Sen. Ted Kennedy Jr., who seems to be acclimating quickly to life in the General Assembly.\n\nKennedy noted in strong terms that people in the state have the right to know if executives of nonprofit hospitals stand to make a lot of money from a conversion.\n\nMelodie Peters, a one-time legislator for Waterford who is now president of AFT of Connecticut, which represents 7,000 health care workers in the state at 10 acute care hospitals, including L+M, also testified on behalf of the disclosure bill.\n\nPeters also complained in her testimony about hospital executive pay in general, which she called \"astronomically high\" and which appears to have \"no link whatsoever to patient or hospital outcomes.\"\n\nPeters reviewed some proposals aimed at limiting high hospital executive pay at nonprofits around the country, including salary-capping ideas in Oregon, Maine, Massachusetts and California.\n\nSome of the proposals that have surfaced in those states, she said, would limit, for instance, hospital CEO pay to the salary of the governor of the state or to 100 times the salary of the lowest paid employee.\n\nOnce the General Assembly is finished with the business of requiring more transparency in the conversion of nonprofits, they might look at the issue of nonprofit hospital executive pay in general here in Connecticut, as President Peters suggests.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of gold being mined in those executive suites on Montauk Avenue.\n\nThis is the opinion of David Collins\n\nd.collins@theday\n\nTwitter: @DavidCollinsct", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yes, it\u2019s true that L+M Hospital\u2019s parent corporation closed its books in the red the last two years, especially bogged down by the $14.", "og": {"site_name": "The Day", "description": "Yes, it\u2019s true that L+M Hospital\u2019s parent corporation closed its books in the red the last two years, especially bogged down by the $14.", "title": "Following the money at L+M and other nonprofit hospitals", "url": "http://www.theday.com/article/20150404/NWS05/150409692", "image": "http://www.theday.com/Assets/images/facebook/day_logo_291.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yes, it\u2019s true that L+M Hospital\u2019s parent corporation closed its books in the red the last two years, especially bogged down by the $14.", "title": "Following the money at L+M and other nonprofit hospitals", "url": "http://www.theday.com/article/20150404/NWS05/150409692", "image": "http://www.theday.com/Assets/images/facebook/dayD_300x300.png", "site": "@thedayct", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Following the money at L+M and other nonprofit hospitals, Local Columns, New London CT,Lawrence & Memorial Hospital,The Day", "article": {"published_time": 20150404171000, "modified_time": 201504041801}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Following the money at L+M and other nonprofit hospitals, Local Columns, New London CT,Lawrence & Memorial Hospital,The Day"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddfe1\"", "article_summary": "Kennedy noted in strong terms that people in the state have the right to know if executives of nonprofit hospitals stand to make a lot of money from a conversion.\nYes, it\u2019s true that L+M Hospital\u2019s parent corporation closed its books in the red the last two years, especially bogged down by the $14.3 million lost in a strike and union lockout in 2013.\nDannel Malloy, is looking at this dynamic, especially how hospital executives could profit from mergers and acquisitions of their nonprofit institutions.\nPeters reviewed some proposals aimed at limiting high hospital executive pay at nonprofits around the country, including salary-capping ideas in Oregon, Maine, Massachusetts and California.\nThis is the nonprofit institution that pays a little army of executives salaries fit for modern day health care kings."}
