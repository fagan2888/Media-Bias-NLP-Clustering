By now you’ve noticed that your morning Tampa Tribune looks bolder and more colorful.

We hope you find it visually engaging, easy to read and enjoyable.

The main difference you will notice each day is bolder type and a more visually striking front page with larger color photographs.

And we’re not sacrificing any content to create this dynamic look. In fact, we’re adding features.

In addition to the new front-page design, we’re increasing the size of the Metro section each day to provide more space for local and state news. During annual legislative sessions, we will set aside space for coverage of our Florida lawmakers.

The Metro expansion gives us more room to cover everything from the inner workings of city hall to news about the hometown heroes who make our community better.

We will also use the expanded space to highlight the goings on across the bay from where you live.

For reader convenience, we are providing a quick scan of the day’s headlines in a small box, outlined in red on the front page, called “Below the Fold.’’ This gives readers who purchase the Tribune in shops and from newspaper racks an easy way to scan what the paper is offering beneath the fold in the middle of the page.

We hope you enjoy our bold new look.
