Other states, such as Washington, have also adapted this mandate.\n\nOn the other side of the fence, Reps. Diane Black, John Fleming and Jeff Fortenberry have introduced the Health Care Conscience Rights Act (H.R. 940) which would protect individuals from purchasing health insurance when they have a moral or religious objection to what it covers.\n\nThis bill, which boasts bi-partisan support, would also incorporate a conscience clause into the Affordable Care Act, providing an option to deny the items in the health care plan which violate moral or religious values. The bishops believe Congress acting to support this bill is an obvious step in protecting basic civil rights of conscience.\n\nSimilar to the H.R. 940 bill is the Weldon amendment, which prevents the government from using received federal funds to discriminate against individuals who do not want to participate in health care that violates a religious belief.\n\nThis bill has been successfully approved in Congress for the past ten years, although it does not provide the right of private action.\n\n\n\nThis is especially significant, because if the Weldon amendment merged with the H.R. 940 bill, it would also provide the right to go to court to individuals who reject health care coverage on moral grounds.\n\n\u201cWe hope Congress will agree that people whose civil rights on this point are violated have a right to go to court,\u201d the bishops noted.\n\nIn fact, President Obama has expressed support for the Weldon amendment, maintaining that on a federal level at least, individuals have a protected civil right to choose not to be involved in an abortion when it comes to health insurance.\n\nThe issue is likely to get more heated before it cools down, given that California believes the penalty of funding withdrawal in the Weldon amendment is subject to challenge. Even if the mandate violates federal law, it will have to receive the red light from Congress before dying down, which is why the bishops are pleading with Congress to take heed.\n\n\u201cWe strongly urge you to support and co-sponsor the Health Care Conscience Rights Act,\u201d the bishops continued, urging legislators to stand against the mandates that would deny health coverage to those with conscientious objections.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Catholic News Agency", "description": "Just because you may oppose abortion doesn\u2019t mean you should be denied comprehensive health care coverage, according to Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore and Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley of Boston.", "title": "Bishops push for Congress to support conscience rights in health care act", "url": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/bishops-push-for-congress-to-support-conscience-rights-in-health-care-act-47729/", "image": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Capitol_at_Sunset_Credit_vgm8383_via_Flickr_CC_BY_NC_20_CNA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just because you may oppose abortion doesn\u2019t mean you should be denied comprehensive health care coverage, according to Archbishop William Lori of Baltimore and Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley of Boston.", "title": "Bishops push for Congress to support conscience rights in health care act", "image": {"src": "http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/images/Capitol_at_Sunset_Credit_vgm8383_via_Flickr_CC_BY_NC_20_CNA.jpg"}, "creator": "@cnalive", "site": "@cnalive", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 32422915}, "fb": {"app_id": 1502824986641800}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The two spoke last Friday, urging Congress to support the Health Care Conscience Rights Act in defense of conscientious objection.\nOn the other side of the fence, Reps.
