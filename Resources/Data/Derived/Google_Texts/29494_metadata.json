His four co-defendants, convicted in Great Britain, were sentenced to less time combined\u2014the longest sentence was 32 months\u2014than the 120-month sentence meted out to Hammond. The 5 million email exchanges, once made public, exposed the private security firm\u2019s infiltration, monitoring, and surveillance of protesters and dissidents on behalf of corporations and the national security state. And perhaps most importantly, the information provided chilling evidence that antiterrorism laws are being routinely used by the state to criminalize nonviolent, democratic dissent and falsely link dissidents to international terrorist organizations. Hammond sought no financial gain. He got none.\n\nThe email exchanges Hammond provided to the public were entered as evidence in my lawsuit against Barack Obama over Section 1021(b (2) of the National Defense Authorization Act. One of my co-plaintiffs was Alexa O\u2019Brien, a journalist and content strategist who cofounded the U.S. Day of Rage, an organization created to reform the election process. Because of the Hammond leaks, we know that Stratfor officials attempted to falsely link her and her organization to Islamic radicals and websites as well as jihadist ideology, setting her up for detention under the new law. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest ruled, in part because of the leak, that we did as plaintiffs have a credible fear, and she nullified the law, a ruling that the higher appellate court overturned when the Obama administration appealed her ruling.\n\nHammond\u2019s 10-year sentence was one of the longest in U.S. history for hacking. It was the maximum the judge could impose under a plea agreement in the case. It was wildly disproportionate to the crime\u2014an act of nonviolent civil disobedience that championed the public good by exposing abuses of power by the government and a security firm. But the excessive sentence was the point.\n\nI met Hammond in Manhattan\u2019s Metropolitan Correctional Center about a week and a half before his sentencing. He was wearing an oversized brown prison jumpsuit that fell over his shoes. He had long brown hair and a wispy beard. He had been held for 20 months.\n\n\u201cPeople have a right to know what governments and corporations are doing behind closed doors,\u201d he said.\n\nJudge Preska, who sentenced Hammond with the same venom she displayed in sentencing Syed Fahad Hashmi, is a member of the right- wing Federalist Society. And the hack into Stratfor disclosed the email address and password for a business account of Preska\u2019s husband, Thomas Kavaler, a partner at the law firm Cahill Gordon & Reindel.\n\nSome emails of the firm\u2019s corporate clients, including Merrill Lynch, also were exposed. The National Lawyers Guild, because the judge\u2019s husband was a victim of the hack, filed a recusal motion. Preska, as chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and therefore the final authority, was able to deny it. Her refusal to recuse herself allowed her to oversee a trial in which she had allegedly a huge conflict of interest.\n\nThe judge, who herself was once employed at Cahill Gordon & Reindel, fulminated from the bench about Hammond\u2019s \u201ctotal lack of respect for the law.\u201d She read a laundry list of his arrests for acts of civil disobedience. She damned what she called his \u201cunrepentant recidivism.\u201d She said: \u201cThese are not the actions of Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela . . . or even Daniel Ellsberg\u201d\u2014an odd analogy given that Mandela founded the armed wing of the African National Congress, was considered a terrorist by South Africa\u2019s apartheid government and the U.S. government, and was vilified, along with King and Ellsberg, by the U.S. government. Preska said that there was a \u201cdesperate need to promote respect for the law\u201d and a \u201cneed for adequate public deterrence.\u201d She read from transcripts of Hammond\u2019s conversations in Anonymous chat rooms in which he described the goal of hacking into Stratfor as \u201cdestroying the target, hoping for bankruptcy, collapse,\u201d and called for \u201cmaximum mayhem.\u201d She admonished him for releasing the unlisted phone number of a retired Arizona police official who allegedly received threatening phone calls afterward.\n\nThe judge, in addition to the 10-year sentence, imposed equally harsh measures for after Hammond\u2019s release from prison. She ordered that he be placed under three years of supervised control, be forbidden to use encryption or aliases online, and submit to random searches of his computer equipment, person, and home by police and any internal security agency without the necessity of a warrant. The judge said that Hammond was legally banned from having any contact with \u201celectronic civil disobedience websites or organizations.\u201d\n\nThe sentence required the judge to demonstrate a callous disregard for transparency and our right to privacy. It required her to ignore the disturbing information Hammond released showing that the government and Stratfor had attempted to link nonviolent dissident groups, including some within Occupy, to terrorist organizations so that peaceful dissidents could be prosecuted as terrorists. It required her to accept the frightening fact that intelligence agencies now work on behalf of corporations as well as the state. She also had to sidestep the fact that Hammond made no financial gain from the leak.\n\nHammond\u2019s draconian sentence, like the draconian sentences of other whistle-blowers, will fan open defiance of the state. It will solidify the growing understanding that we must resort, if we want to effect real change, to unconventional and illegal tactics to thwart the mounting abuses by the corporate state. There is no hope, this sentencing showed, for redress from the judicial system, elected officials, or the executive branch.\n\nWhy should we respect a court system, or a governmental system, that does not respect us? Why should we abide by laws that protect only criminals like Wall Street thieves while leaving the rest of us exposed to abuse? Why should we continue to have faith in structures of power that deny us our most basic rights and civil liberties? Why should we be impoverished so that the profits of big banks, corporations, and hedge funds can swell?\n\nHammond, six feet tall and wiry, defined himself when we met in jail as \u201can anarchist communist.\u201d He said he had dedicated his life to destroying capitalism and the centralized power of the corporate state and that he embraced the classic tools of revolt, including mass protests, general strikes, and boycotts. And he saw hacking and leaking as critical tools of this resistance, to be used not only to reveal the truths about systems of corporate power but to \u201cdisrupt/destroy these systems entirely.\u201d\n\nLike Assange and Chelsea Manning, Jeremy Hammond had an unconventional childhood. He and his twin brother Jason were raised by their single father, Jack, in Glendale Heights, Illinois, a working-class suburb in western Chicago. His mother, Rose, left the family when the twins were three; while she provided some financial support, she left most of the child rearing to Jack. Hammond\u2019s father was an aspiring punk rock musician who dropped out of high school and earned about $35,000 a year giving guitar lessons.\n\nJeremy showed an early and precocious talent for computers, as well as politics. He responded to the war jingoism that enveloped the country after the 9/11 attacks by organizing school protests against the calls to invade Iraq. He founded an underground newspaper that was designed, as he wrote in the first editor\u2019s letter, to get students to \u201cmost of all think.\u201d \u201cWAKE UP . . . Your mind is programmable\u2014if you\u2019re not programming your mind, someone else will program it for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy first memories of American politics was when Bush stole the election in 2000,\u201d he told me, \u201cand then how Bush used the wave of nationalism after 9/11 to launch unprovoked, preemptive wars against Afghanistan and Iraq. In high school, I was involved in publishing \u2018underground\u2019 newsletters criticizing the Patriot Act, the wars, and other Bush-era policies. I attended many antiwar protests in the city [Chicago] and was introduced to other local struggles and the larger anti-corporate globalization movement. I began identifying as an anarchist, started to travel around the country to various mobilizations and conferences, and began getting arrested for various acts.\u201d\n\nHe said that his experience of street protest, especially against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, was seminal, for he saw that the state had little interest in heeding the voices of protesters and other public voices. \u201cInstead, we were labeled as traitors, beaten and arrested.\u201d\n\nHammond was living at home in Chicago in 2010 under a curfew from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. for a variety of acts of civil disobedience when Manning was arrested. Like Manning, he had shown an astonishing aptitude for science, math, and the language of computers from a very young age. He hacked into the computers at a local Apple store when he was sixteen and then showed the stunned sales staff how he had done it. When he hacked into the computer science department\u2019s website at the University of Illinois\u2013Chicago as a freshman, the university responded to this prank by refusing to allow him to return for his sophomore year. He was an early backer of \u201ccyber-liberation\u201d and in 2004 started an \u201celectronic-disobedience journal\u201d he named Hack This Zine.\n\nThat same year, Hammond called on hackers in a speech at the DefCon convention in Las Vegas\u2014the largest and best-known underground hacking conference\u2014to use their skills to disrupt the upcoming Republican National Convention. By the time of his arrest, Hammond was one of the shadowy stars of the hacktivist underground. He was also the FBI\u2019s No. 1 most wanted cybercriminal in the world. It was Manning\u2019s courage that prompted Hammond to commit his own act of cyber civil disobedience, although he knew the chances of being caught were high.\n\n\u201cI saw what Chelsea Manning did,\u201d he said when we spoke, seated at a metal table in a tiny room reserved for attorney-client visits. \u201cThrough her hacking, she became a contender, a world changer. She took tremendous risks to show the ugly truth about war. I asked myself, If she could make that risk, shouldn\u2019t I make that risk? Wasn\u2019t it wrong to sit comfortably by, working on the websites of Food Not Bombs, while I had the skills to do something similar? I too could make a difference. It was her courage that prompted me to act.\u201d\n\nHammond, with black tattoos on each forearm\u2014one a gridlike \u201cGlider\u201d symbol that was proposed by computer programmer Eric S. Raymond as a symbol for the hacker subculture, and the other the shi hexagram from the I Ching, meaning \u201cleading\u201d or \u201carmy\u201d or \u201ctroops\u201d\u2014 is steeped in radical thought. He swiftly migrated politically as a young teenager from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party to the militancy of Black Bloc anarchists. He was an avid reader in high school of material put out by CrimethInc, an anarchist collective that publishes anarchist literature and manifestos, including \u201cThe Anarchist Cookbook.\u201d Hammond is steeped in the work of old radicals, from Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman to black revolutionaries such as George Jackson, Elaine Brown, and Assata Shakur.
