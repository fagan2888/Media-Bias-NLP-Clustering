Phil English (R-Pa.), a Ways and Means member. Following his graduation from San Diego State University in 2000, Stewart returned to English\u2019s office and worked there until the congressman lost his reelection bid in 2008.\n\n\u201cI worked for Mr. English for many years, holding pretty much every position from that first internship all the way up to deputy chief of staff, and got to work on a lot of the Ways and Means policy issues,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a result, Stewart said, he \u201creally developed an understanding of those issues but also a really strong interest in pursuing those policies and trying to make a difference in those areas.\u201d\n\nStewart later went to work for Boehner John BoehnerHouse GOP faces dilemma on spending bills Overnight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief fears sequestration's return MORE, who was then the House minority leader.\n\n\u201cThat was great, because at the time, the minority leader\u2019s office didn\u2019t have a dedicated Ways and Means-type portfolio person, so I was able to fill that role, doing all those kinds-of Ways and Means issues except for healthcare for the minority leader,\u201d he said.\n\nStewart continued to work for Boehner after the Republican became Speaker in 2011. He took a leave of absence to work on Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign and became policy director for his vice presidential candidate, Ryan.\n\nFollowing Romney and Ryan\u2019s White House loss, Stewart returned to Boehner\u2019s office and became his policy director. He stayed there until Boehner left office last fall, and then moved to the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nIn his new position, Stewart said, his foremost responsibility is to listen to the priorities of Brady, other committee members and House Republicans and to work on designing and coordinating legislative and oversight priorities to help the members achieve their goals.\n\nHe is also responsible for focusing the resources of the committee and its staff on the members\u2019 objectives.\n\nElection-year politics and a shortened session pose significant obstacles to Congress passing any major legislation.\n\nBut Stewart said people should not have \u201cunreasonably low expectations just because of those conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cChairman Brady, I think, assumes that a lot can be accomplished this year, and it\u2019s not a time to sit by and idly wait for those things to come to a conclusion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a time to continue doing the necessary work to be ready, to achieve these big things when the opportunity arises.\u201d\n\nBrady is working to engage lawmakers on and off the committee about tax reform. The Ways and Means tax policy subcommittee is holding a series of hearings on proposals, and Brady is also leading a House task force on tax reform.\n\n\u201cI think consensus does continue to emerge, and it\u2019s really important to have that member-to-member engagement to achieve it,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nOn trade, Brady hopes that there can be a vote on Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) this year but has acknowledged that many lawmakers have substantive concerns about the 12-nation deal.\n\n\u201cThose are issues that are important to deal with because they\u2019re important issues to members\u2019 constituencies that have concerns about those things,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cAnd so, the pace of TPP, as the chairman frequently says, is going to be governed by the support and substance of the agreement.\u201d\n\nStewart praised Brady for bringing a \u201creal transparency\u201d to the committee.\n\n\u201cChairman Brady, I think, brings a very inclusive and open approach to being a legislator and being a chairman,\u201d he said. That style, Stewart said, has already been reflected in Brady\u2019s achievements, which include legislation that ended the annual \u201cdoc fix\u201d for Medicare even before becoming chairman and a massive package of tax breaks in December, just after taking the reins of the committee.\n\n\u201c[Brady] has an expectation that legislators ought to do the work of being legislators and build the support and build the coalitions for what it is that they want to do,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cAnd working for Chairman Brady, who has and embodies that process, has been a real rewarding experience.\u201d\n\nBrady had kind words about his committee\u2019s staff director.\n\n\u201cDavid is an excellent leader, a talented manager and a trusted policy adviser,\u201d the chairman said. \u201cHe\u2019s just the person I needed when I was filling this important position, and I\u2019m so glad he is leading our team.\u201d\n\nStewart is not the only recent hire on the committee. Some members of the Ways and Means staff have worked for the committee for a long time, but a lot of Ryan\u2019s staffers went with him to the Speaker\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI think the chairman went out and set out to recruit the best staff he could at the committee, and I think we\u2019re all quite pleased with the team that the chairman has assembled,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nWhen asked how many hours he works per week, Stewart replied, \u201ca lot.\u201d When he does have free time, he likes to spend it outdoors. He also has an interest in barbecue cooking.\n\nHe used to compete in the Giant National Capital Barbecue Battle and placed twice, for chicken and beef brisket.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m not here, it\u2019s nice to just disconnect a little bit,\u201d he said.\n\nThose on both sides of the aisle who\u2019ve worked closely with Stewart praised his knowledge, tenacity and interpersonal skills.\n\nAt the end of Boehner\u2019s tenure as Speaker, Stewart was heavily involved in the negotiations for a budget deal.\n\n\u201cThat would not have gotten done if not for David\u2019s commitment to put it to bed,\u201d said Mike Sommers, Boehner\u2019s chief of staff at the time.\n\nObama personally called Stewart to thank him for his work after the deal was reached.\n\n\u201cWe need more David Stewarts in this town, in my opinion,\u201d said Katie Beirne Fallon, who until recently was Obama\u2019s director of legislative affairs.\n\nSharon Soderstrom, the chief of staff for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnellOvernight Healthcare: Momentum on mental health? | Zika bills head to conference | Only 10 ObamaCare co-ops left Trump outlines \u2018America First\u2019 energy plan Senators hope for deal soon on mental health bill MORE (R-Ky.), said Brady was smart to hire Stewart.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an all-star,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "David Stewart has a long history with the powerful panel.", "description": "David Stewart has a long history with the powerful panel.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Naomi Jagoda", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "David Stewart has a long history with the powerful panel.", "title": "Feeling at home with Ways and Means", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/275914-feeling-at-home-with-ways-and-means", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/stewartdavid_040616gn2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-12T11:26:56-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-12T11:26-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/275914-feeling-at-home-with-ways-and-means", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-12T06:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Dickson", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-12T06:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-12T11:26:56-04:00"}, "keywords": ",Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, Kevin Brady, Paul Ryan, Boehner,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/275914-feeling-at-home-with-ways-and-means", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "David Stewart has a long history with the powerful panel.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feeling at home with Ways and Means"}, "dcterms.title": "Feeling at home with Ways and Means"}, "article_summary": "He stayed there until Boehner left office last fall, and then moved to the Ways and Means Committee.\nDavid Stewart, the new staff director for the House Ways and Means Committee, has a long history with the powerful panel.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cI\u2019ve always liked Ways and Means because it is the epitome of the institution within the institution,\u201d he said.\nWhile still in college, Stewart, who \u201cgrew up mostly in California,\u201d interned for then-Rep.
