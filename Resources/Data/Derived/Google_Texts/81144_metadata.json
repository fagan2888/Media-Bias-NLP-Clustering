The post read like this:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nProgram Schedule:\n\nBarack Obama 12:00-12:15\n\nHope and Change: Recalling all those empty promises and false hopes\n\nBarack Obama 12:15-12:25\n\nEducation Subsidies: I know the more we subsidize our education, the higher the tuition gets-but come on, we can\u2019t stop now!\n\nBarack Obama 12:25-12:35\n\nLet Me Be Clear: If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your healthcare plan. Period \u2026 I mean \u2026 asterisk.\n\nBarack Obama 12:35-12:50\n\nMy Commitment to Change: My change to support spying on you with the PATRIOT ACT/NSA, Guantanamo Bay torturing, deporting more people than George W. Bush, continuing the war on drugs, spending your future away, and bailing out my cronies and the ones on Wall Street \u2026 but wait, there\u2019s more!\n\nBarack Obama 12:50-1:00\n\nNation Building: How I continued George W. Bush\u2019s policy and got you to love it.\n\nP.S. Watch out for that drone hovering above! Americans were killed without trial along with many children- and I have a Nobel Peace Prize too!\n\nA second post featured a picture of Obama with a mock message to the graduates which read:\n\nDear UC Irvine Graduate:\n\nCongratulations on completing your education from this prestigious institute of higher learning! You truly all have a bright future ahead of yourselves as leaders of this great state and nation!\n\nGood luck on landing your first job! Only 47% of you will be able to find a job in your preferred field. So make no mistake, I hope you\u2019re still on good terms with your parents. While at home, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to pick up on some new skills.\n\nOnce you get that job, you better start saving. Let me be clear, as a new taxpayer, your share of the new debt is well over $150,000! Politicians have spent decades making lavish promises to American workers and you\u2019ll have to chip in your fair share to pay for their retirement!\n\nPresident Barack Obama\n\nCongratulations Graduate!\n\nYoung Americans for Liberty At University of California-Irvine", "article_metadata": {"description": "The UC Irvine chapter of Young Americans for Liberty was unimpressed by the fact that Barack Obama gave the university's Saturday commencement address at Angel Stadium, creating a mock", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The UC Irvine chapter of Young Americans for Liberty was unimpressed by the fact that Barack Obama gave the university's Saturday commencement address at Angel Stadium, creating a mock", "title": "UC Irvine Republicans Mock Obama - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/06/14/Obama-Speaks-Irvine-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2014/06/15/uc-irvine-republicans-mock-obama/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The UC Irvine chapter of Young Americans for Liberty was unimpressed by the fact that Barack Obama gave the university's Saturday commencement address at Angel Stadium, creating a mock", "title": "UC Irvine Republicans Mock Obama - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-California/2014/06/14/Obama-Speaks-Irvine-AP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Breitbart California,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "published_time": "2014-06-15T12:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde431\"", "article_summary": "A second post featured a picture of Obama with a mock message to the graduates which read:Dear UC Irvine Graduate:Congratulations on completing your education from this prestigious institute of higher learning!\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe UC Irvine chapter of Young Americans for Liberty was unimpressed by the fact that Barack Obama gave the university\u2019s Saturday commencement address at Angel Stadium, creating a mock \u201cprogram schedule\u201d for the event.\nBarack Obama 12:25-12:35Let Me Be Clear: If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep your healthcare plan.\nBarack Obama 12:50-1:00Nation Building: How I continued George W.
