NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Former TV judge Joe Brown is expected to surrender to Tennessee deputies to begin serving a five-day jail term for contempt of court.

Shelby County Juvenile Court Chief Administrative Officer Larry Scroggs tells local media that Brown is expected to report to the county’s sheriff’s office at noon on Thursday.

Brown was charged with contempt after an outburst in Juvenile Court in March 2014. In a ruling issued Aug. 14, the Tennessee Supreme Court denied Brown’s application to appeal a Court of Appeals ruling that had upheld the sentence handed down by Magistrate Judge Harold Horne following a verbal exchange with Brown.

In appeal earlier this year, Brown said the audio recording of the contentious exchange was manipulated. The Shelby County Juvenile Court Clerk said the only edit made was inconsequential.
