Nor was it the football gods mourning the end of Tony Romo\u2019s first half of the season after the Cowboys\u2019 QB broke his left clavicle. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, and my nerves, it was just another earthquake \u2014 the latest to rattle Irving since they started swarming at the beginning of the year.\n\nUnlike last week\u2019s quakes, all of which measured 2.5M or smaller, Sunday evening\u2019s temblor showed up immediately on the USGS\u2019s radar.\n\nPer the USGS, Sunday\u2019s quake at 6:25 p.m. measured 2.6M on the Richter scale. And it was located right where you\u2019d expect it at this point \u2014 just south of the former Texas Stadium site and along the two-mile fault that, according to SMU seismologists, stretches from Irving to Dallas. This one was far deeper than most: 6.8 miles beneath the earth\u2019s surface, about twice the average depth of most of our quakes in the past year.\n\nAnd now, this footnote note that we\u2019ll stick with all quake items until we\u2019re told otherwise:\n\nSMU researchers believe the quakes are caused by humans working in the oil and gas industry. Humans in the oil and gas industry, as well as those who regulate them, disagree.
