Any details at all, really, would be more detail than the billionaire Republican presidential frontrunner has already provided. But on Sunday, he promised ABC\u2019s George Stephanopolous that he would lay out his vision of what a good solution would be for Israel when he speaks to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2019s annual Policy Conference.\n\nRelated: Once Again, Trump Blames the Protester for Getting Punched and Kicked\n\nTrump has so far coasted through much of his campaign without being seriously challenged on complex issues. He stands up before large crowds and whips them into a frenzy by excoriating ethnic and religious minorities and complaining about how awful the United States has become before spewing vague assurances about how wonderful everything will be in a Trump administration.\n\nWhile this works with a football stadium packed with angry voters, and even with television audiences tuned in to the Republican presidential debates, it\u2019s not going to fly \u2013 at all \u2013 with the people in the room tonight.\n\nAIPAC is a controversial organization. It wields outsized power in Washington, and while many see it as simply a staunch defender of America\u2019s greatest ally in the Middle East, others question whether it sometimes pushes policies that serve Israel\u2019s interests at the expense of the interests of the United States.\n\nBut one thing nobody questions is that AIPAC is deadly serious about defending Israel, and that its members are as well versed in the complexities of Middle East foreign policy as anyone in Washington. If Trump thinks he can drag his usual shtick into tonight\u2019s speech and buffalo his way through a conversation about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he is wildly mistaken.\n\nRelated: Hopes for Trump\u2019s Foreign Policy Debut Are\u2026Not High\n\nHowever, judging from his appearance on ABC yesterday morning, unless he pulled an all-nighter with a team of Middle East experts, Trump probably isn\u2019t going to stun the crowd with the depth of his understanding tonight.\n\nAsked if he would stand by his statement that he would be neutral in an effort to reach a deal between Israel and the Palestinians, he fell back on his claim, \u201cThere\u2019s nobody more pro-Israel than I am.\u201d Surprisingly, he failed to mention that he was once the grand marshal of an Israel Day parade in New York, which has been his go-to piece of proof that he supports the Jewish state in the past.\n\nStephanopolous asked Trump what kind of deal would serve Israel\u2019s interests.\n\n\u201cI think making a deal would be in Israel\u2019s interest,\u201d Trump began, before serving up a content-free salad of words that utterly failed to address the question. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I don\u2019t know one Jewish person that doesn\u2019t want to have a deal, a good deal, a proper deal, but a really good deal.\n\nRelated: Could a Trump Candidacy Flip the House to Democrats?\n\n\u201cI would say it\u2019s probably one of the toughest deals, me being a dealmaker, it\u2019s probably one of the toughest deals in the world to make because there\u2019s just so many decades of hatred between the two sides. It\u2019s probably one of the toughest deals to make. It you\u2019re a person that prides yourself on being able to get people together\u2026I think it\u2019s something that we should try very hard to get.\u201d\n\nGamely, Stephanopolous tried once again. \u201cDefine \u2018a good deal,\u2019\u201d he prompted Trump.\n\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll define it tomorrow, because I\u2019ll be defining it tomorrow,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cI\u2019m not going to define it now. I\u2019m going to define it tomorrow.\u201d\n\nGot that? He\u2019ll define it tomorrow because he\u2019ll define it tomorrow, not today, because he\u2019ll do it tomorrow.\n\nWell, tomorrow is here, and Trump has promised to deliver, and the crowd at AIPAC, expecting a serious contender for the presidency to address an issue that is vitally important to them, is not going to be put off for another day.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a speech tonight before the most powerful, pro-Israel lobbying group in the country", "title": "Trump Promises to Broker a \u2018Good Deal\u2019 for Israel and the Palestinians", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/21/Trump-Promises-Broker-Good-Deal-Israel-and-Palestinians", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/21/Trump-Promises-Broker-Good-Deal-Israel-and-Palestinians", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In a speech tonight before the most powerful, pro-Israel lobbying group in the country", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd733b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I don\u2019t know one Jewish person that doesn\u2019t want to have a deal, a good deal, a proper deal, but a really good deal.\n\u201cDefine \u2018a good deal,\u2019\u201d he prompted Trump.\n\u201cWell I\u2019ll define it tomorrow, because I\u2019ll be defining it tomorrow,\u201d Trump replied.\nHe\u2019ll define it tomorrow because he\u2019ll define it tomorrow, not today, because he\u2019ll do it tomorrow.\nStephanopolous asked Trump what kind of deal would serve Israel\u2019s interests."}
