Ruling party-backed candidates swept to victory in acrimonious city council elections after their opponents withdrew in protest, underscoring the deep divisions that remain between the government and the country’s main opposition party.

In polls marred by allegations of irregularities, vote-rigging and intimidation of voters and the press, Awami League candidates Annisul Huq and Sayeed Khokon were elected mayor of Dhaka North and Dhaka South councils, respectively. Nasir Uddin, another ruling party-backed candidate, won the race for mayor of Chittagong city, election officials said Wednesday.

The mayoral races in Dhaka and Chittagong—Bangladesh’s biggest cities—had taken on added significance after the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party nominated candidates to challenge the ruling Awami League party. Opposition groups, led by the BNP, boycotted national elections last year and have been waging often-violent street protests to unseat the government.

However, on Tuesday, as balloting was going on, the BNP announced it was withdrawing from the elections, citing polling irregularities. At a news conference, opposition-backed candidates said ruling-party activists had “taken control of polling centers” and had forced out opposition polling agents.

Election officials said they had witnessed no irregularities. Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmad, the chief election commissioner, said the election had been “largely free and fair.”

Awami League officials denied accusations of intimidation and said the BNP was trying to undermine the elections.

But in both Dhaka and Chittagong, independent election observers reported acts of intimidation, multiple voting and ballot-box stuffing at some polling stations.
