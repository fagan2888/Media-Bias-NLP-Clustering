Alexandria Cremer | The SUN\n\nFargo businessman Doug Burgum said he can\u2019t predict the price of future commodities, but he can control spending, and if elected the next governor of North Dakota, he will rightsize the government to help pull the state out of a projected $1.1 billion revenue shortfall.\n\n\u201cI feel like it takes a business leader who has budgeted this scale to go in and really understand how to make those trade-offs,\u201d Burgum said in Jamestown Monday evening. \u201c \u2026 we\u2019re going to have to really reprioritize what we\u2019re doing and rethink how we do it, to make sure that we are still delivering the essential services.\u201d\n\nBurgum said he is also running for governor to help his opposing candidate, Wayne Stenehjem, complete his term as attorney general, a position he\u2019s held since 2001.\n\nA member of the audience asked Burgum to defend his endorsement of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, to which he said:\n\n\u201cDo I want my kids to grow up and behave like him? No,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Burgum said he endorsed Trump because he thinks he\u2019s the best choice to benefit North Dakota citizens, citing Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as a threat to the coal, oil and gas industry.\n\nBurgum also spoke about his opinion on the Affordable Care Act. He said that he thinks the ability to have pre-existing conditions covered by insurance is good, but that the act doesn\u2019t outline affordability of care, only affordability of insurance.\n\nBurgum also criticized the act for not detailing how to innovate the health care system.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a word in there that\u2019s about making the care better,\u201d he said.\n\nThe solution for health care is to stray away from a federally centralized approach, Burgum said.\n\nBurgum was also asked about his stance on transgender bathrooms, a rising political issue in America.\n\nBurgum said he would do as Dennis Daugaard, South Dakota\u2019s governor did, and veto a bill pledging for a statewide policy. Instead, Burgum said he would support the issue being handled by local community discretion.\n\nacremer@jamestownsun.com | (701) 952-8453", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,local,Politics", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Alexandria Cremer", "og": {"site_name": "Jamestown Sun", "description": "Fargo businessman Doug Burgum said he can\u2019t predict the price of future commodities, but he can control spending, and if elected the next governor of North Dakota, he will rightsize the government to help pull the state out of a projected $1.1 billion revenue shortfall. \u201cI feel like it takes a ...", "title": "Burgum makes stop in Jamestown", "url": "http://www.jamestownsun.com/news/local/4034303-burgum-makes-stop-jamestown", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.jamestownsun.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/Burgum-3.gif?itok=3J84_OIq", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fargo businessman Doug Burgum said he can\u2019t predict the price of future commodities, but he can control spending, and if elected the next governor of North Dakota, he will rightsize the government to help pull the state out of a projected $1.1 billion revenue shortfall. \u201cI feel like it takes a ...", "title": "Burgum makes stop in Jamestown", "url": "http://www.jamestownsun.com/news/local/4034303-burgum-makes-stop-jamestown", "image": "http://www.jamestownsun.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/Burgum-3.gif?itok=KzF0jbgp", "site": "jamestownsun", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1442014432688469}, "keywords": "News,local,Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheJamestownSun", "tag": "News,local,Politics", "modified_time": "2016-05-17T11:14:41-05:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Gubernatorial candidate Doug Burgum addresses a crowd of about 50 people at Sabir's Buffalo Grille in Jamestown Monday evening.
