Kay Hagan, tendered a resignation letter to the town\u2019s mayor this week written in the Klingon language of the \u201cStar Trek\u201d universe. Waddell said he included an English translation of the text via Bing.com with the original Klingon.\n\nTeach (the) city (the) constitution\n\nI will return next time to (witness) victory.\n\nResignation occurs in 2014 the 31st of January.\n\nPerhaps today is a good day (to) resign.\n\nThe last line is a play on the phrase \u201cPerhaps today is a good day to die,\u201d which was uttered in one of the series\u2019 movies, and possibly at a Deaton Halloween party sometime in the 1990s when Chris and his best friend dressed up as a couple of the show\u2019s characters. Photographic evidence exists in a drawer somewhere and will not be featured in a #TBT coming to a social media feed near you.\n\nA copy of the Klingon text is available at the Charlotte Observer, which also quoted Indian Trail Mayor Michael Alvarez as not being\n\ntoo amused by the stunt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassment for Indian Trail, and it\u2019s an embarrassment for North Carolina,\u201d he said.\n\nWaddell said that part of his motivation for resigning the seat was so he could focus more time on his planned write-in campaign on the\n\nConstitution Party ticket against Hagan, a first-term Democrat who has come under criticism for her support of Obamacare. He could not be reached for further comment at time of publication.\n\nScotty is busy repairing the universal translator, anyway.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Hopefully this won't photon torpedo the guy's reputation too much.", "title": "Senate hopeful writes resignation letter from town council in...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 533, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/01/star-trek-enterprise-533x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/01/03/senate-hopeful-writes-resignation-letter-from-town-council-in-klingon/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "resigns-in-klingon", "published_time": "2014-01-03T12:43:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-03T12:58:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "A copy of the Klingon text is available at the Charlotte Observer, which also quoted Indian Trail Mayor Michael Alvarez as not beingtoo amused by the stunt.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassment for Indian Trail, and it\u2019s an embarrassment for North Carolina,\u201d he said.\nDavid Waddell, a town councilman from Indian Trail, N.C., and prospective third-party challenger to Sen.
