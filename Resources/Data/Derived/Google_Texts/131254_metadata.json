Your healthcare law is. Welcome, everybody, I'm Neil Cavuto. And excuse this departure from form. But I think this is just poor form. So, it's time we set some things straight.\n\n\n\nMr. President, we at Fox News are not the problem. I hate to break it to you, sir. You are. Your words are. Your promises are. We didn't sell this healthcare law. Sir, you did. Remember this?\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period.\n\n\n\nMr. President, tell that to tens of thousands of retirees at IBM and Time Warner and dozens of others, who've been dumped from their coverage and told to find their own coverage. Fox News didn't break that news to them, Mr. President. Their companies did.\n\n\n\nFox News didn't push more of those firms to hire part-time workers. Your healthcare law did. Fox News didn't incentivize fast food restaurants to scale back their benefits. Your healthcare law did. Fox News didn't make doctors want to opt out. Your healthcare law did. Fox News didn't make insurance premiums sky rocket. Your healthcare law did. Just like Fox News didn't grant hundreds of exemptions to companies that needed them. You did. And Fox News didn't delay one key provision after another, including online enrollment for those small business exchanges. You did.\n\n\n\nJust like it wasn't Fox News that said we had to pass this to see what was in this. You did. Or was that Nancy Pelosi? Sometimes I'm confused. But of this I am not. Fox News didn't re-do basic math. Sir, you did. Fox News didn't say you can cover 30 million more Americans and not see a hit in premiums. You did. Fox News didn't say you could throw in those with pre-existing conditions and not have to pay for it. You did. Fox News didn't all but say you could get something for nothing. You did. Fox News didn't come back years later and say, oh yea, we did raise some taxes. You did.\n\n\n\nHere's where you are right about Fox News, however, Mr. President. We can do math. And did. You cannot. And did not. We said it, and proved it. You didn't. And we're all suffering for it. Take it from the numbers guy at Fox. Numbers don't lie. The number of Americans working part-time and nervous. The number of retirees days away from being dumped on exchanges and anxious. The number of company bosses with any news to pass along on those exchanges, but still clueless. The number of doctors who want out. The number of congressmen now opting out. No, Mr. President, none of those numbers lie.\n\n\n\nBut with all due respect sir, I can only conclude you do know; I know, I know you hate us at Fox. But please take a look in a mirror, and fast. You think we're the skunk at your picnic. But that doesn't mean we're the ones that stink. Because that smell isn't coming from the folks reporting on your law. Mr. President, that smell is your law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEIL CAVUTO:  This just in.\r\n\r\nThis has just got to stop.\r\n\r\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\r\n\r\nPresident Barack Obama: If you've talked to someone who said, I don't know, I was watching Fox News and they said it was horrible.\r\n\r\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\r\n\r\nMr. President, Fox News isn't what's making Americans sick about your healthcare law.\r\n\r\n Your healthcare law is.\r\n\r\nWelcome, everybody, I'm Neil Cavuto.\r\n\r\nAnd excuse this departure from form.\r\n\r\nBut I think this is just poor form.\r\n\r\nSo, it's time we set some things straight.\r\n\r\nMr. President, we at Fox News are not the problem.\r\n\r\nI hate to break it to you, sir.\r\n\r\nYou are.\r\n\r\nYour words are.\r\n\r\nYour promises are.\r\n\r\nWe didn't sell this healthcare law.\r\n\r\nSir, you did.
