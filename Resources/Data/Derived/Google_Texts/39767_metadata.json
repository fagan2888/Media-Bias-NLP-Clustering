Moments after Riley Chase took a sip of his milkshake, he knew something wasn\u2019t right due to the taste and bubbling sensation on his tongue.\n\n\"He took a drink of it and then he said, 'mom this shake tastes disgusting,'\" Riley\u2019s mother Lisa Chase told 9NEWS. \"I took a drink of it, and instantly you knew that was not a vanilla shake. It burned my mouth and my throat. You could feel it burn all the way down to your stomach.\"\n\nWhen the concerned mother entered the Thornton, Colo., Dairy Queen after tasting her son\u2019s tainted beverage, she reported that employees did not provide her with an explanation. However, when she called the restaurant upon returning home, she was informed by a manager that an empty bottle of vanilla syrup had been placed next to a sink and was accidently refilled with floor cleaner and degreaser.\n\n\u201cThey could\u2019ve cost people their lives with this,\u201d Chase told FOX8. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even taste the ice cream in it. It tasted like you were drinking a very strong cleanser. Then the burn started instantly. They need to be held accountable for what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nBoth mother and son were rushed to a local hospital once Chase discovered they had ingested dangerous chemicals. They were released after being treated for internal burns. Chase would later learn that two other customers of the Dairy Queen required medical attention as a result of chemical-laced milkshakes. Two workers have been written up as a result of the incident.\n\n\u201cThis was an accidental and isolated incident,\u201d read a statement by Dairy Queen that was issued to ABC News. \u201cThe employees responsible have been reprimanded. The rest of the staff is getting new training.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dairy, queen, milkshake", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Colorado Dairy Queen served a chemical-laced milkshake to a 7-year-old boy that landed both him and his mother in a local hospital.", "title": "DQ Serves 7-Year-Old Vanilla Shake Laced With Chemical Cleaner [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dairy-queen-milk-shake-laced-chemical-cleaner-sends-7-year-old-rushing-hospital-300158", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/27/dq-milkshake.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Colorado Dairy Queen served a chemical-laced milkshake to a 7-year-old boy that landed both him and his mother in a local hospital.", "title": "DQ Serves 7-Year-Old Vanilla Shake Laced With Chemical Cleaner [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dairy-queen-milk-shake-laced-chemical-cleaner-sends-7-year-old-rushing-hospital-300158", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/27/dq-milkshake.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/27/dq-milkshake.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-08-27T17:21:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-27T17:26:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Colorado Dairy Queen served a chemical-laced milkshake to a 7-year-old boy that landed both him and his mother in a local hospital."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf53\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis was an accidental and isolated incident,\u201d read a statement by Dairy Queen that was issued to ABC News.\nChase would later learn that two other customers of the Dairy Queen required medical attention as a result of chemical-laced milkshakes.\n\"He took a drink of it and then he said, 'mom this shake tastes disgusting,'\" Riley\u2019s mother Lisa Chase told 9NEWS.\nA careless mistake made by workers at a Dairy Queen in Colorado sent a 7-year-old boy to the hospital after his mother discovered that a vanilla shake she purchased from the fast food restaurant had been laced with chemical cleaner.\n\"I took a drink of it, and instantly you knew that was not a vanilla shake."}
