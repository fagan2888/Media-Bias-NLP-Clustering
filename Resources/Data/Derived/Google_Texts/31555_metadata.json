He wants the international community to know the horrors he suffered in North Korea and spoke to The Daily Signal about his daring 2005 escape from a prison camp there.\n\nIn the video, Shin reveals the scars that he suffered as he squeezed through the highly electrified fence that was designed to block him from the outside world since his birth in prison in 1982.\n\nThe video was filmed at the Demilitarized Zone, with Shin\u2019s homeland of North Korea looming behind him.\n\n\u201cMy companion and I tried to escape together,\u201d Shin says in the video. \u201cHe got to the fence first, unfortunately getting caught on the fence and making a way for me. I went over his back and made it through.\n\n\u201cAs I went through the fence, my two legs did touch the electric wire, which badly burned my shins. The skin on my legs was peeling and bleeding,\u201d he explains as video is shown of his scars, which remain visible a decade after his escape.\n\nShin hopes his story will spur action against North Korea to save others from the fate he suffered.\n\n\u201cIf the U.N. or anyone in the international community cares about the human-rights issue in North Korea \u2026 if you have any worries or concerns at all for the North Koreans who are suffering and dying right now, I strongly plead for some sort of direct action to be taken for them,\u201d Shin said.\n\nLast month, several nations urged the U.N. Security Council to \u201crefer the situation in [North Korea] to the International Criminal Court\u201d for legal action.\n\n>>> He Escaped From a North Korean Prison Camp.
