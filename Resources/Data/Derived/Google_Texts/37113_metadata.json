These plans are particularly key in the construction, retail and transportation sectors.\n\nSome unions also object to the law\u2019s penalties that they say are compelling employers to limit workers\u2019 hours to less than 30 per week, eroding the traditional 40-hour week.\n\nThe AFL-CIO was a strong supporter of the health reform effort in President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, and the resolution also reaffirmed the unions\u2019 commitment to the \u201cgoals\u201d of the Affordable Care Act including reducing health care costs and expanding coverage.\n\nThe House Education and Workforce Committee sent out a statement Thursday saying, \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see those who strongly endorsed the health care law finally recognize its fundamental problems.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The group says small employers may currently be able to take away health care without penalty.", "title": "AFL-CIO demands changes to ACA", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/afl-cio-obamacare-changes-96718.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2012/04/120412_afl-cio_shinkle_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare (372),Richard Trumka (50),AFL-CIO (105)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The group says small employers may currently be able to take away health care without penalty.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc262\"", "article_summary": "| John Shinkle/POLITICO AFL-CIO demands changes to ACAThe AFL-CIO has approved a resolution calling Obamacare \u201chighly disruptive\u201d for some union health plans and seeking changes to key provisions of the health law that affect these plans, known as Taft-Hartley plans.\nThe organization wants to see changes to how the ACA affects multi-employer plans.\nThe House Education and Workforce Committee sent out a statement Thursday saying, \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see those who strongly endorsed the health care law finally recognize its fundamental problems.\u201dAuthors:\nSome unions have demanded that the subsidies available to those buying insurance on the exchanges also be provided to those who receive insurance through multi-employer plans, even though those plans already receive the same tax breaks that other employer-sponsored plans do.\nThe AFL-CIO was a strong supporter of the health reform effort in President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, and the resolution also reaffirmed the unions\u2019 commitment to the \u201cgoals\u201d of the Affordable Care Act including reducing health care costs and expanding coverage."}
