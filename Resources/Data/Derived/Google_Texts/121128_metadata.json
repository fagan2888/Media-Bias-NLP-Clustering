The lower-earning spouse can then claim spousal benefits at his or her own full retirement age, and later shift to their own full benefit, if it is larger. (A spousal benefit is half of the primary earner's benefit.)\n\nThe Center for Retirement Research has estimated that file-and-suspend adds $9.5 billion in annual benefit costs to the program.\n\nThe White House targeted it for elimination in the budget plan issued last year, calling it an \"aggressive\" move used by high-income households to \"manipulate\" benefits. The budget deal approved by the House this week would clamp down on the practice for anyone who turns age 62 after calendar year 2015.\n\nFile-and-suspend has been at the top of the list for reform over the past year - and it was thrown into this deal as part of the political horse trading that yielded the crucial agreement to beef up Social Security\u2019s disability insurance trust fund.\n\nThat fund is on track to run out of money next year, which would have produced an immediate 19 percent cut in disability benefits; that problem has now been pushed down the road to 2022.\n\nThe budget deal reallocates funds from Social Security\u2019s retirement trust fund - a move pressed for by disability advocates and the White House but resisted by Republicans.\n\nFOLLOW THE MONEY\n\nThe original bill language also implied that benefits would be ended for spouses who already were receiving benefits under a spouse\u2019s suspended filing.\n\nThat would have been a damaging, unwise move since it would have pulled the rug out from people relying on benefits - and it would have been an administrative nightmare for the Social Security Administration.\n\nCongressional sources say that was never the intent, and that the language in the bill is being revised to clarify that only new file-and-suspends are disallowed, beginning 180 days after the bill is signed into law. That opens a window for six more months for people to file and suspend, if they choose that strategy.\n\nMore routine spousal strategies will remain in place, and couples should study them carefully. It still makes sense for higher-earning spouses to delay their filing, and some lower-earning spouses may want to file for the 50 percent spousal benefit ahead of their own full retirement ages, if that benefit is greater than their own full benefit.
