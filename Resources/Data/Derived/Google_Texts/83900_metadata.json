This year, as the country struggles to come out of an economic downturn, has seen many.\n\nTraffic disruption, damage to public property and injuries to police officers have gone hand-in-hand with a spate of demonstrations by farmers, taxi drivers, ferry workers and even tobacconists.\n\nHowever, unlike the headline makers in some other disputes, pilots lack sympathy among the general public and the Socialist government.\n\nMinisters have queued up in recent days to put pressure on pilots to strike a deal, and a Sept. 26 opinion poll for Le Parisien newspaper found 71 percent of people see them as a privileged group, with 64 percent believing they complain too much.\n\nGround staff trade unions long ago accepted the company's original, less draconian, cost-saving regime, in contrast to the pilots, who staged a strike a year ago that cost the company 500 million euros ($560 million).\n\nThe main airline industry union FNAM also condemned the attack on Broseta calling it \"outdated behavior\".\n\nAir France CEO Gagey had already left the room on Monday before the works council meeting near Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris was interrupted about an hour after it had begun.\n\nParent Air France-KLM said it planned to take legal action over \"aggravated violence\" carried out against its managers.\n\nAir France confirmed in the meeting, which will not resume on Monday, that it planned to cut 2,900 jobs by 2017 and shed 14 aircraft from its long-haul fleet, two union sources said.\n\nThe cuts include 1,700 ground staff, 900 cabin crew and 300 pilots, the sources said. The long-haul business would be reduced by 10 percent.\n\nThe French airline also wants to cancel its order for Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft, the sources added. Air France-KLM has 19 787-9 and six 787-10 jets on order.\n\nIndustry sources said Boeing would be keen to keep the order on its books, possibly by agreeing to defer delivery.\n\nAir France-KLM is seeking to cope with growing competition. It has been at loggerheads with its main pilots union, the SNPL, over its plans.\n\nEurope's big three flag carriers, which also include British Airways owner IAG and Germany's Lufthansa, have been squeezed between low-cost competition inside Europe and fast-expanding long-haul airlines in the Gulf, as well as Turkish Airlines (THY).\n\nTurkish Airlines is set to become the largest carrier on routes to and from Europe by the end of this year, ahead of British Airways, aircraft financiers gathered in Prague were told on Monday. Dubai's Emirates would be in third place.\n\nThe data treats Air France and KLM separately.\n\nLufthansa, which is also battling with union opposition to cost-cutting, has managed to push forward plans for a revamped low-cost unit, Eurowings.\n\n(With additional reporting by Jacky Naegelen in Paris, Tim Hepher in Prague and Victoria Bryan in Berlin; Writing by James Regan; Editing by Andrew Callus and Mark Potter)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "ROISSY, France (Reuters) - Air France managers fled a meeting on Monday about mass job", "title": "Air France managers flee as staff storm meeting on job cuts", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/05/Air-France-managers-flee-staff-storm-meeting-job-cuts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/airfrance-employment_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/05/Air-France-managers-flee-staff-storm-meeting-job-cuts", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/airfrance-employment_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "ROISSY, France (Reuters) - Air France managers fled a meeting on Monday about mass job", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "ROISSY, France (Reuters) - Air France managers fled a meeting on Monday about mass job cuts after angry staff waving banners and flags stormed the room, according to Reuters journalists at the scene.\nThe data treats Air France and KLM separately.\nIt has been at loggerheads with its main pilots union, the SNPL, over its plans.\nAir France CEO Gagey had already left the room on Monday before the works council meeting near Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris was interrupted about an hour after it had begun.\nAir France confirmed in the meeting, which will not resume on Monday, that it planned to cut 2,900 jobs by 2017 and shed 14 aircraft from its long-haul fleet, two union sources said."}
