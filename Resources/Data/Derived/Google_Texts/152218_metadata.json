The CBS Evening News gave that just 9 seconds on August 13, part of a round-up of delays with the law. [House Speaker John Boehner also brought this up, unprompted by moderator Bob Schieffer, on the July 21 Face the Nation.]\n\n\n\n\u25a0 On August 1, Politico reported that the Office of Personnel Management had decided to issue new regulations this week to protect members of Congress and their staffs from seeing their health care premiums skyrocket. ABC and NBC have completely skipped this news, while CBS This Morning gave it a grand total of 18 seconds on Friday, August 2 (nothing on the Evening News.)\n\n\n\n\u25a0 As for the one-year delay in ObamaCare\u2019s promised cost caps: the CBS Evening News ran a full story on August 13; other than that, the broadcast networks have skipped that deficiency in the law, too.\n\n\n\n\u25a0 On September 11 Big Labor came out against ObamaCare. Terry O'Sullivan, President of the Laborers' International Union of America, railed: \u201cBut we will be damned if we are going to lose our health insurance because of unintended consequences in the law. It needs to be changed. It needs to be fixed. And it needs to be fixed now.\u201d Both CBS and NBC ignored the news. Only ABC mentioned Big Labor\u2019s opposition offering just a 24-second brief, on September 12, from Good Morning America\u2019s Josh Elliot who reported: \u201cAt its convention in Los Angeles, the AFL-CIO outlined flaws the group says that will drive the cost of union-sponsored health plans so high, workers and employers will both be forced to abandon them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "With the ObamaCare exchanges set to take effect today, and polls showing the President\u2019s health care law as unpopular as ever (a September 25 poll from CBS News/New York Times found 51% \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cstrongly\u201d disapproved of the law), the Big Three (ABC, CBS, NBC) news networks have been reluctant to report the multiple fiascos surrounding its implementation: \u25a0 On July 2 and 3, all three broadcast networks covered the one-year postponement of the ObamaCare employer mandate as a \u201csurprising,\u201d \u201csignificant setback\u201d for the President.
