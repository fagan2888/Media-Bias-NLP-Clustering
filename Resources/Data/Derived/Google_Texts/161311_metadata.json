It ranks higher than any social issue, gun rights or immigration. If Florida voters are anything like voters elsewhere, it\u2019s the economy that is the big issue as early voting in the state's presidential preference primary begins.\n\nElections are about a lot of things, but for voters, elections are about paychecks, jobs, and the economy. Sure, national security and terrorism rank high on the list of voter concerns this presidential election cycle, but the economy is identified by voters as their most important issue time and time again.\n\nWith that in mind, the Sunshine Economy brought together a panel of business owners and operators from banking, technology and healthcare and construction to hear how politics impacts their businesses, and by extension the South Florida economy.\n\nListen to the entire episode of The Sunshine Economy.\n\nEconomic backdrop to the election\n\nMark Vitner, Senior Economist, Wells Fargo\n\n\u2022 There's a general sense that the conditions should have been better with the economy than they have been.\n\n\u2022 I think there's a real sense of anxiety across the country, across the southeast and in South Florida that with the global economy slowing somehow this is going to come back and bite us a lot harder than than the consensus view.\n\nAdrian Foster, Pres. & CEO, Foster Construction of South Florida\n\n\u2022 In the public sector, public school construction bonds have given our industry a real boost, particularly for small contractors.\n\n\u2022 The real opportunities are right in our backyard.\n\n\u2022 There's a lot of hope that we will be able to grow our business.\n\n\u2022 I'm focused on the local market because there's a lot of work here.\n\nJay Pelham, President, TotalBank\n\n\u2022 I'm still very encouraged about the South Florida real estate economy in general.\n\n\u2022 I think you're going to see condo prices fail to appreciate as much.\n\nRoberto Estrada, Pres. & CEO, HolaDoctor\n\n\u2022 We focus on the Hispanic market and help and Hispanics buy products and services. We see a lot of big opportunities with Obamacare or without Obamacare.\n\nHector Figuero, President, 32BJ Service Employees International Union\n\n\u2022 We have seen the country become more and more preoccupied with the gap between the rich and the poor. The middle class is under incredible financial economic stress.\n\nHow do politics play into the business cycle?\n\nMark Vitner, Senior Economic, Wells Fargo\n\n\u2022 Typically in a presidential election year we see economic activity pull back a little bit in the second half of the year because people want to wait and see how the election is going to play out.\n\nJay Pelham, President, TotalBank\n\n\u2022 There's a school of thought that political parties are becoming less relevant.\n\nHow the economy is playing as an election issue?\n\nHector Figuero, President, 32BJ Service Employees International Union\n\n\u2022 We have seen in both the Democratic primary and the Republican primary that is anger and anxiety among voters, particularly working class voters who feel that the economy is no longer working for them. They're looking for solutions.\n\n\u2022 Workers feel corporations were bailed out during the financial collapse. Rightly or wrongly, they see other groups gaming the system and being able to move ahead. They feel that the system has been unfair when they've been playing by the rules, working hard, paying taxes and trying to be responsible.\n\n\u2022 Working people are less concerned with the wealth of an individual candidate. They're asking, 'Is this person somebody who's been part of the status quo? Is this person too close to the political decisions and economic initiatives that have not really worked for me?'\n\nAdrian Foster, Pres. & CEO, Foster Construction of South Florida\n\n\u2022 I'm not sure that what I'm seeing right now warrants me to make any major changes in my business.\n\n\u2022 I am more concerned about a candidate focusing on changing Obamacare. Obamacare has allowed us to have the ability to attract more quality candidates by having the opportunity to offer health care insurance that is affordable.\n\nMark Vitner, Senior Economic, Wells Fargo\n\n\u2022 I really think it's economic anxiety.\n\n\u2022 It has a lot to do with the middle class and a lot of folks feeling that their their income has not grown significantly since the economy came out of the recession.\n\n\u2022 No one really knows what who to blame and so typically it's very easy to blame it on some global competitors.\n\n\u2022 People are looking for people to blame and that's why these nontraditional candidates seem to be doing well.\n\nWhat would you ask a presidential candidate?\n\nMark Vitner, Senior Economic, Wells Fargo\n\n\u2022 What specifically are you going to do to help generate stronger job and income growth?\n\nAdrian Foster, Pres. & CEO, Foster Construction of South Florida\n\n\u2022 As business owners, we sit down and at the table and negotiate issues all the time for the simple purpose of coming to an agreement so that we can move forward. What will you put in place to ensure that on Capitol Hill we're all working cohesively for the betterment of the American people?\n\nRoberto Estrada, Pres. & CEO, HolaDoctor\n\n\u2022 How are you going to balance the budget and pay down the debt? I think that's a big problem that we need to fix before too long.\n\nJay Pelham, President, TotalBank\n\n\u2022 We've got a political gridlock issue.
