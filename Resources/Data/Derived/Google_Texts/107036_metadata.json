He was working for Merrimack-based Kollsman Inc. to help the Saudis with thermal optical devices, part of the country\u2019s missile systems.\n\nFamily and friends said just before he died, the 50-year-old Cramer sent a text message to his roommate in Milford saying he thought something bad was going to happen and asking him to contact the State Department.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe death was first reported as a suicide by Saudi Arabian officials. Cramer\u2019s family later hired Dr. Michael Baden, the recently retired medical examiner for New York State Police, to perform an autopsy, and he determined it was a homicide. He suggests Cramer was severely beaten before he fell or was pushed off the balcony.\n\n\u201cA person could stab himself and then jump,\u201d but to damage his body the way Cramer\u2019s body was damaged was not possible, Baden told The Telegraph of Nashua in a story published Friday. \u201cHe had suffered fractures before the fall.\u201d\n\nThe Telegraph reported a toxicology report showed there were no sign of drugs or alcohol in Cramer\u2019s body.\n\nU.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen first wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry in March asking for an investigation and a briefing. She also recently contacted the White House, spokesman Ryan Nickel said.\n\n\u201cThis recent autopsy is further confirmation that Christopher Cramer\u2019s death needs a thorough investigation,\u201d Nickel said in a statement Friday.\n\nU.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte and U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster have been in touch with the Cramer family, Kollsman and the State Department.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Katherine Pfaff said it has offered to assist Saudi authorities with any investigation into Cramer\u2019s death but can\u2019t investigate an incident overseas without the permission of the host government. As of Friday, the U.S. had not received a request for assistance, she said.\n\n\u201cWe continue to engage with the Saudis on this case, and our offer of assistance stands,\u201d Pfaff said in an emailed statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congresswomen Urges US government To Probe Suspicious Death Of American Man In Saudi Arabia", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "AP", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Congresswomen Urges US government To Probe Suspicious Death Of American Man In Saudi Arabia", "title": "Congresswomen Urges US Government To Probe Suspicious Death Of American Man In Saudi Arabia", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/congresswomen-urges-us-government-to-probe-suspicious-death-of-american-man-in-saudi-arabia/207467/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cramer-4.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-10T13:44:30-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congresswomen Urges US government To Probe Suspicious Death Of American Man In Saudi Arabia", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/cramer-4.jpg", "title": "Congresswomen Urges US Government To Probe Suspicious Death Of American Man In Saudi Arabia", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Saudi Arabia", "published_time": "2015-07-11T05:00:38-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-10T13:44:30-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ce9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis recent autopsy is further confirmation that Christopher Cramer\u2019s death needs a thorough investigation,\u201d Nickel said in a statement Friday.\nCONCORD, N.H.\u2014 New Hampshire congressional delegation members are urging the U.S. State Department to investigate the death of an American in Saudi Arabia.\n\u201cHe had suffered fractures before the fall.\u201dThe Telegraph reported a toxicology report showed there were no sign of drugs or alcohol in Cramer\u2019s body.\nThe body of Christopher Cramer, of Milford, New Hampshire, was found beneath the third-floor balcony of the Sahara Makarim Hotel in Tabuk on Jan. 15.\nCongresswomen Urges US Government To Probe Suspicious Death Of American Man In Saudi Arabiajust before he died, Christopher Cramer sent a text message to his roommate in Milford saying he thought something bad was going to happen and asking him to contact the State Department."}
