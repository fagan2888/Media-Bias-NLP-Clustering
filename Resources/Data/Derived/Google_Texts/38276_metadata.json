A television ad for Microsoft\u2019s gaming console featuring Aaron Paul is accidentally turning on their Xboxes and starting up their games. And it\u2019s driving them crazy.\n\nSeriously \u2014 Daily Dot has the story, but you can also just go to Reddit and search for Aaron Paul and you will find anguished complaints. It seems that the Xbox voice-activated Kinect controller works too well! When Aaron Paul, sitting on his couch, says \u201cXbox on\u201d \u2014 all over the world, Xboxes are going on. When he says \u201cXbox \u2014 Go to Titanfall,\u201d the game \u201cTitanfall\u201d starts running. And so on.\n\nThe concept of a \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d star\u2019s television endorsement running amok is innately hilarious. We can expect to see it as a plotline on \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d within weeks. But it also is a little worrisome. Our phones are already voice-activated. If the Internet of Things manifests as it is supposed to, pretty soon just about everything in our home will be waiting for our voice commands. We\u2019re supposed to be happily adjusting thermostats and ordering our coffee-makers around without ever lifting a finger.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When television commercials run amok, Skynet's takeover of civilization can't be far behind VIDEO", "title": "\u201cBreaking Bad\u2019s\u201d Aaron Paul just turned on your Xbox", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "When television commercials run amok, Skynet's takeover of civilization can't be far behind VIDEO", "title": "\u201cBreaking Bad\u2019s\u201d Aaron Paul just turned on your Xbox", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/13/breaking_bads_aaron_paul_just_turned_on_your_xbox/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/aaron_paul_xbox.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When television commercials run amok, Skynet's takeover of civilization can't be far behind VIDEO", "title": "\u201cBreaking Bad\u2019s\u201d Aaron Paul just turned on your Xbox", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/aaron_paul_xbox.jpg", "creator": "@koxinga21", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew Leonard", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aaron paul, Breaking Bad, gamers, Gaming, Titanfall, Video, videogames, xbox", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc422\"", "article_summary": "Topics: aaron paul, Breaking Bad, gamers, Gaming, Titanfall, Video, videogames, xbox, Technology News, Business News, Entertainment NewsAt first, the outraged cries of aggrieved Xbox gamers just sound funny.\nWhen Aaron Paul, sitting on his couch, says \u201cXbox on\u201d \u2014 all over the world, Xboxes are going on.\nSeriously \u2014 Daily Dot has the story, but you can also just go to Reddit and search for Aaron Paul and you will find anguished complaints.\nA television ad for Microsoft\u2019s gaming console featuring Aaron Paul is accidentally turning on their Xboxes and starting up their games.\nIt seems that the Xbox voice-activated Kinect controller works too well!"}
