Russett)\n\nJust five weeks in to a new school year and the Red Wing High School is set to deliver the fall play. \u201cOnce Upon a Pandora\u2019s Box\u201d debuts Wednesday Oct. 8 at 5:30 p.m. The play continues Friday Oct. 10 with a final performance Sunday Oct. 12.\n\nDescribed as clever and cute by director Tim Bowes, the children\u2019s comedy written by Monica Flory dabbles into the mythical characters of fairytales \u2013 all coming to life through a child\u2019s perspective.\n\n\u201cPandora\u2019s Box, if you will, is where the characters come to life,\u201d Bowes said.\n\nOnce upon a time in New York City, a young girl named Tabitha and her brother, Louis, discover a box sitting in the hall of their apartment. Curious, she opens the box allowing five imprisoned fairy tale villains to escape.\n\nFree at last, the dastardly villains begin to wreck the apartment, but when they discover that writing in Tabitha\u2019s notebook will give them control of other fictional characters, things get really dicey.\n\nIn charge of the play are Bowes and directing partner Greg Grinager. The two high school English teachers are tag-teaming the production. The play marks their directing debut.\n\nBowes has a background in theater, working with both the Sheldon and Phoenix Theatres. This play marks the first time Grinager has done anything with theater, Bowes said, noting directing the fall play was Grinager\u2019s idea in the first place ; he wanted to try something new.\n\n\u201cWe picked it up and ran with it,\u201d Bowes said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty vibrant, it\u2019s alive and well.\u201d\n\nThrilled with the play choice, Bowes said the experience has been hilarious and just a lot of fun amongst the chaos of a new school year.\n\n\u201cYou may know Grinager as the mythology instructor,\u201d Bowes said. \u201cThat obviously tapped a vain for us.\u201d\n\nThe story is about a little girl writing stories, he explained. \u201cAs English teachers we liked the concept about children writing stories.\u201d\n\nWithin the dialogue there is commentary about what makes a good story and Bowes added it just fit the English teacher concept pretty well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a witty play,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m well over 50 and a children\u2019s play is making Grinager and I laugh at every rehearsal.\u201d\n\nSixteen students auditioned the second week into the school year and 16 students complete the cast. \u201cThe performance will be fantastic with the dedication of some of our seniors that are in this production,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are wonderful.\u201d\n\nTickets are $2 for adults, $1 for students.\n\nCast List:\n\nTabitha- Jessica Scheerer\n\nLouis- Jack Staley\n\nBig Bad Wolf- Foster Johnson\n\nEvil Queen- Maria Pearson\n\nWicked Witch- Alice Bygd\n\nRumplestiltskin- Calli Owens\n\nFairy- Krista Emery\n\nEsperella- Mandie Gade\n\nAngella- Emma Cory\n\nBeautella- Erin Jezierski\n\nTranslator/Reporter- Kennedy Kerins\n\nChorus- Rachel Jacobsen, Lexie Christianson, Zoey Adams, Dakota Erickson\n\nIf you go...\n\nWhat: The Red Wing High School present the fall play \u201cOnce Upon a Pandora\u2019s Box.\u201d\n\nWhen: Wednesday Oct. 8 at 5:30 p.m.; Friday Oct. 10 at 7 p.m. and Sunday Oct. 12 at 1:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Red Wing High School Little Theater\n\nCost: $2 adults, $1 students", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Stacy Bengs-Silverberg", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "Just five weeks in to a new school year and the Red Wing High School is set to deliver the fall play. \u201cOnce Upon a Pandora\u2019s Box\u201d debuts Wednesday Oct. 8 at 5:30 p.m. The play continues Friday Oct. 10 with a final performance Sunday Oct. 12.\r\nDescribed as clever and cute by director Tim Bowes,...", "title": "They open the box", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/content/they-open-box", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/100414.N.RE_.FallPlay2.jpg?itok=Aaugk_CV", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just five weeks in to a new school year and the Red Wing High School is set to deliver the fall play. \u201cOnce Upon a Pandora\u2019s Box\u201d debuts Wednesday Oct. 8 at 5:30 p.m. The play continues Friday Oct. 10 with a final performance Sunday Oct. 12.\r\nDescribed as clever and cute by director Tim Bowes,...", "title": "They open the box", "url": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/content/they-open-box", "image": "http://www.republican-eagle.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/100414.N.RE_.FallPlay2.jpg?itok=GiZm9rbf", "site": "republicaneagle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 243322109167890}, "keywords": "News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/redwingrepublicaneagle", "tag": "News", "modified_time": "2014-10-05T15:00:49-05:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Jessica Scheerer and Jack Staley discuss their woes in \"Once Upon a Pandora's Box.\" (Republican Eagle photos by John R.
