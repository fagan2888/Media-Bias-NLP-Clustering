For instance, testing people with melanomas for mutations in their BRAF genes can influence treatment. But it\u2019s unclear how many people would benefit from sequencing all the genes in a tumor; it, like full germ line sequencing, remains mainly a research tool.\n\nPhoto\n\nBoth tumor and full germ line sequencing suffer from the same problem: The whole genome doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to us yet. We have a very limited understanding of which variations in DNA contribute to disease development. Most of your genome sequence looks the way Shakespeare does to a toddler \u2014 incomprehensible.\n\nConscientious doctors won\u2019t order a lab test that they can\u2019t understand, so they\u2019re unlikely to say yes to a patient\u2019s request for full genome sequencing. And insurance companies shouldn\u2019t pay for a test if there isn\u2019t research backing up its use.\n\nThe genetic tests that are clearly valuable at this point for predicting cancer risk are those for the specific mutations that we understand. But even then there can be other mutations in the same genes that are of unknown clinical significance. So the best results come from sequencing the subset of genes that could potentially explain patterns of disease observed in the family tree. If your family shows an increased incidence of certain cancers, it makes sense to look for known mutations that increase the risk of those cancers.\n\nFor example, we recently saw a 25-year-old patient at our clinic with a strong family history of colon cancer. His father had colon cancer, but had refused any kind of genetic testing. When the son tested positive for a broken colon cancer gene, the rest of his family followed. Those who tested positive now know they need to have frequent colonoscopies. And most people with strong family histories of breast cancer should consider getting genetic counseling and, if recommended, testing for mutations in genes such as PALB2, BRCA1 and BRCA2.\n\nFamily history doesn\u2019t just help us decide where to look for broken genes; if we find a mutation that could lead to cancer, the number of cancers in the family helps us determine what kind of risk that mutation might carry. Some patients with BRCA mutations have a 40 percent chance of developing breast cancer by age 70, but for others, the chance has been estimated to be as high as 87 percent. It looks as if this is the case for PALB2 mutations as well. According to the New England Journal of Medicine study, by Marc Tischkowitz at the University of Cambridge and others, patients with a broken PALB2 gene and no family history of breast cancer have a 35 percent chance of developing breast cancer, but if they had two or more family members with cancer, the risk rises to 58 percent. This is significant when you\u2019re considering life-altering preventive surgery or screenings.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGenetic testing is a process for many patients, not a one-time event. In the coming weeks, in light of the report on PALB2, as well as the emergence of sophisticated tests that can now analyze many cancer genes at one time, we\u2019ll advise former patients who tested negative for the BRCA or other specific genes to return for more genetic counseling and potentially further testing.\n\nOne patient, who is now healthy but who dealt with a breast cancer diagnosis in her early 30s, emailed to ask if she\u2019d been tested for the PALB2 gene when she had the BRCA test in 2007. We\u2019d found no mutations, and she seemed to be a genetic mystery. My reply was easy: She hadn\u2019t been tested for PALB2, but she should be now, along with any other new cancer genes. If she tests positive, we\u2019ll know more about the risk of her having a second cancer, and be able to test her family members.\n\nFor any patient who still wants to get his or her full genome sequenced, there is one good reason to do it: scientific curiosity. Something of interest could come of it as the technology improves over time. But it\u2019s worth doing only if a clinical trial is paying for it, or if you can easily afford it. Getting the data can cost under $2,000, but having the data interpreted can cost in the tens or hundreds of thousands. It\u2019s a fine purchase, but definitely a luxury. And bear in mind that the data that come back will raise more questions than they answer. There is a good chance that mutations of unknown clinical significance will be found that will increase anxiety without illuminating any known risks.\n\nWe have to have patience with the pace of research. We can now use genetic information to prevent breast, ovarian and colon cancer in many patients, and we will get better at this. In the meantime, most people should focus less on the high-tech future of genetic testing and more on the low-tech history of their family trees. Those who don\u2019t know their own family histories, because of adoption, secrecy, loss or estrangement, should take comfort in the fact that we are one big family. Data in aggregate from many families, gathered together in studies like Dr. Tischkowitz\u2019s, will eventually teach us how to manage our risks, how to treat disease and how to save lives.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140816153858, "twitter": {"description": "We don\u2019t know enough about which variations lead to disease.", "title": "Cancer and the Secrets of Your Genes", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/cancer-and-the-secrets-of-your-genes.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003058941"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/17/sunday-review/0817CANCER/0817CANCER-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/cancer-and-the-secrets-of-your-genes.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003058941", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/cancer-and-the-secrets-of-your-genes.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "hdl_p": "Cancer and the Secrets of Your Genes", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Aug. 16, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Genetics and Heredity,Cancer,Tests (Medical),Research,Colon and Colorectal Cancer,Jolie  Angelina", "news_keywords": "Cancer,Research", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Theodora Ross", "SCG": "sunday", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Jolie, Angelina", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THEODORA ROSS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "We don\u2019t know enough about which variations lead to disease.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/17/sunday-review/0817CANCER/0817CANCER-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/17/sunday-review/0817CANCER/0817CANCER-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "We don\u2019t know enough about which variations lead to disease.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Aug. 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "modified": "2014-08-21", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Jolie, Angelina", "published": "2014-08-16", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "17cancer", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140821162749, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/opinion/sunday/cancer-and-the-secrets-of-your-genes.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/17/sunday-review/0817CANCER/0817CANCER-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "We don\u2019t know enough about which variations lead to disease.", "title": "Cancer and the Secrets of Your Genes"}, "pdate": 20140816, "des": "Colon and Colorectal Cancer", "articleid": 100000003058941, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Cancer and the Secrets of Your Genes", "col": "Opinion", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "My reply was easy: She hadn\u2019t been tested for PALB2, but she should be now, along with any other new cancer genes.\nAnd most people with strong family histories of breast cancer should consider getting genetic counseling and, if recommended, testing for mutations in genes such as PALB2, BRCA1 and BRCA2.\nHis father had colon cancer, but had refused any kind of genetic testing.\nWe can now use genetic information to prevent breast, ovarian and colon cancer in many patients, and we will get better at this.\nIt looks as if this is the case for PALB2 mutations as well."}
