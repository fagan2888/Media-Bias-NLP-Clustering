The owners of Ralls are both employed by the Sany Group, a Chinese firm that manufactures wind turbines. The plan was to use the Sany Group\u2019s equipment on the farms as a sort of demonstration project, in order to help market the firm\u2019s products in the U.S.\n\nRelated: An Unprecedented Loss for the Obama Administration in Court\n\nAt least, that was the plan until Ralls was contacted by a little-known agency of the Executive Branch known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. CFIUS (pronounced Siffy-us) informed the company that because of its foreign ownership, its purchase of the wind farms was being examined. After a short review process, CFIUS informed owners of Ralls that their wind farms \u2013 just four out of dozens in the area around Hermiston \u2013 presented a national security threat to the United States and needed to be dismantled.\n\nWhat threat they posed and why, Ralls was never told. No evidence was presented, no accusation made, no charge filed. Despite having legal ownership of the four farms, Ralls officials were barred from accessing the property. Not only that, they were told to arrange to have all of their equipment removed from the four wind farms, down to and including the concrete pads the turbines stood on, and to sell the company\u2019s interest in the land.\n\nThis kind of order is not uncommon from CFIUS, but last week, the little-known agency got an unexpected dose of publicity because Ralls did what most companies faced with an adverse ruling from the committee don\u2019t \u2013 it fought back. The company won a ruling in Federal Appeals Court in D.C. that found the process under which its wind farms were shut down violated its right to due process.\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat ironic that the Ralls suit should arise now at a time when members of Congress are actually considering filing a lawsuit against the president for executive overreach. CFIUS is, in fact, a creature of Congress \u2013 created in the 1970s by lawmakers in response to worries that foreign companies were buying up access to technology and manufacturing interests vital to U.S. security. It was substantially expanded - again by Congress - in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nRelated: Wages Rise and \u2013 Surprise \u2013 Skilled Workers Are Easier to Find\n\nThe committee has the power to review foreign purchases of U.S. firms, and to disallow them \u2013 retroactively, if necessary \u2013 if it finds they compromise national security.\n\nBy direction of Congress, the decisions made through the CFIUS program are not even subject to judicial review. The D.C. court got around the ban on judicial review by specifically ruling that it was in denying Ralls the opportunity to respond to the government\u2019s concerns in advance of the president\u2019s ruling that CFUIS violated the company\u2019s due process rights.\n\nThe ruling requires CFIUS to share non-classified information with Ralls, allowing the company at least a potential opportunity to address whatever issues CFIUS has with its wind farms.\n\nAccording to attorneys who deal with CFIUS on a regular basis, the ruling represents what could be a sea change in the functioning of one of the government\u2019s most secretive agencies.\n\nRelated: Dump Terror Insurance Bill, Lose Investment and Jobs\n\n\u201cCompanies have long been hesitant to challenge CFIUS because of the broad discretion given to the executive branch on issues of national security,\u201d attorneys Farhad Jalinous, Karalyn Meany Mildorf and Keith Schomig wrote on the website Law360.\n\nWhile the ruling doesn\u2019t do anything to restrict the executive\u2019s power, said the three attorneys, all of whom work for the Kaye Scholer firm in Washington, \u201c[I]t could open the door to other such challenges.\u201d\n\nIf they\u2019re correct, it would be a marked shift in the way companies usually deal with CFIUS.\n\nThe way the process works is that the committee, made up of the heads of various executive branch agencies including the Treasury Department, the Defense Departments and others, has a 30-day review period to examine a transaction, followed by a 45-day investigation period if necessary.\n\nRelated: The Long-Term Unemployed May Finally Get a Break\n\nIn the event a company is determined to be a national security threat, a recommendation is sent to the president, who makes an official finding \u2013 again, not subject to judicial review \u2013 on the existence of that national security threat.\n\nIn the five years between 2008 and 2012, 538 companies went through the review process, and 168 progressed to the examination stage. Exactly one company was subject to a presidential decision. Seventy companies, including 22 in 2012 alone, withdrew their applications voluntarily, before a presidential decision was made.\n\nAvailable research suggests that a significant number of the companies targeted simply withdraw from the process early on - an untold number not because they actually mean harm to the United States, but because the possible fallout of being labeled a national security threat outweighs the potential benefits of the transaction being examined.\n\nIn a report for the Congressional Research Service earlier this year, James K. Jackson noted that, among other things, the committee\u2019s ability to brand a company as a national security threat, even without presenting evidence, leads to skewed economic decision-making.\n\nRelated: How Congress Is \u201cKilling Our Transportation System\n\n\u201c[A] CFIUS investigation of an investment transaction may have been perceived by some firms and by some in the financial markets as a negative factor that added to uncertainty and may have spurred firms to engage in behavior that may not have been optimal for the economy as a whole\u201d he wrote.\n\nNow, to be sure, it\u2019s likely that some, or even most, of the companies targeted by CFIUS presented a legitimate national security threat. For instance, between 2010 and 2012, CFIUS examined 39 transactions involving firms from China \u2013 a country widely believed to engage in extensive espionage against the U.S. But because of the committee\u2019s secrecy, there\u2019s no way of knowing what the charges were against any individual firm.\n\nIt\u2019s not only companies with connections to potentially hostile governments that find themselves facing off with CFIUS. Over the past three years, companies from staunch U.S. allies including Canada and the United Kingdom have been among the most frequently examined by the agency.\n\nIt\u2019s a situation that frustrates good government activists.\n\nRelated: The Case of the Missing IRS Emails \u2013 An $18M Whodunit\n\n\u201cWhat do I know about CFIUS? Less than I\u2019d like to,\u201d said Steven Aftergood, who runs the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists.\n\nIt\u2019s a common complaint from advocates of open government, who acknowledge that the agency confronts real threats to the U.S., but are troubled by its lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n\u201cThe CFIUS approach was devised as an attempt to defend national interests in technology leadership,\u201d said Aftergood. \u201cBut it is clumsy and imperfect both in what it does and what it fails to do.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear how far-reaching the effects of the Ralls ruling will be, but it seems likely to shed at least a little light on one of the U.S. government\u2019s more shadowy programs.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Can a government agency target a foreign company doing business in the US and without offering evidence, accuse them of being a national security threat and make them pack up and leave?
