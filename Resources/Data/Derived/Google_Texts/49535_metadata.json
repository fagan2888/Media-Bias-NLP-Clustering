But you\u2019d never know that given the linguistic fog the DOJ has conjured up.\n\nA press release issued earlier this week describes a new $1.75 million grant program as designed \u201cto help young people involved in the justice system find jobs and housing.\u201d\n\nWait, you ask, if these young people are \u201cinvolved\u201d in the justice system, doesn\u2019t that mean they already have jobs? Like, say, as a trainee in the dispatcher\u2019s office, or a desk clerk in the attorney general\u2019s office, or maybe a janitor at the local courthouse?\n\nNot exactly. In this case, \u201cjustice-involved youth\u201d is what we\u2019re now supposed to call juvenile delinquents, also known as young criminals.\n\nThis is not a euphemism run amok as much as it is an exercise in obfuscation. After all, euphemisms at least try to convey the same meaning, just in a less harsh way, as the words they replace. Such as: \u201csubstandard housing\u201d for slum, or \u201cdifferently abled\u201d for crippled. But being \u201cinvolved\u201d in something can mean anything. An arsonist could be described as a person who is \u201cinvolved in the home building industry.\u201d A drunk driver will likely end up \u201cinvolved in traffic enforcement.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, the administration didn\u2019t, as some have claimed, coin the \u201cjustice-involved youth\u201d term. It\u2019s been tossed around academic circles for years. But this administration has embraced this sort of verbal legerdemain.\n\nOne of the first things Obama did as president was relabel the \u201cwar on terror\u201d as an \u201coverseas contingency operation,\u201d which can literally mean anything, so long as the operation takes place overseas and is contingent on something.\n\nThen there were ObamaCare\u2019s much-hated insurance mandate penalties, which were rechristened as \u201cindividual shared responsibility payments.\u201d Who could object to that?\n\nThe problem is Obama\u2019s people aren\u2019t aggressive enough in their renaming project. So, as a public service, we offer our help.\n\nThose committing voter fraud could be termed \u201cabundantly enthusiastic political participants.\u201d\n\nLooters? How about \u201cnon-banked retail consumers.\u201d\n\nEx-convicts? Try \u201creturning citizens.\u201d\n\nWhat about illegal immigrants? A better label would be \u201cundocumented workers.\u201d Oh, right, that\u2019s already in use.\n\nThe problem with euphemisms is that in short order they end up as a pejorative. Then again, a pejorative word can also turn into a euphemism.\n\nSo don\u2019t be surprised if someday down the road a politician is excoriated for calling someone a \u201cjustice-involved youth\u201d when everyone knows the proper term is \u201cthug.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PC: The Justice Department announced a plan to throw $1.75 million at young criminals in hopes that they don\u2019t become adult criminals.
