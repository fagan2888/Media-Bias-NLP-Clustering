The \u201cit\u201d is the slowdown in national health spending.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2013, health spending grew roughly 4 percent a year, which was less than half the 9 percent average of the three decades before the Great Recession. Because the 4 percent rate matched the economy\u2019s overall growth, health spending stabilized at 17.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). There was some hope that an era of sizable increases was over.\n\nForget it. Government actuaries from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) last week reported that health spending in 2014 rose 5.5 percent to $3.1 trillion. Worse, spending is projected to increase 5.8 percent annually between now and 2024. That\u2019s faster than the economy\u2019s expected growth, so health costs would rise to 19.6 percent of GDP by 2024. The gain in GDP share (from 17.4 percent to 19.6 percent) may seem small. Not so. It\u2019s worth almost $400 billion a year. (All these dollar and GDP figures are unadjusted for inflation.)\n\nSo it\u2019s back to the future. Health spending will silently shape the nation\u2019s priorities. It will squeeze take-home pay, as employers devote more of their compensation to insurance and high deductibles raise workers\u2019 out-of-pocket expenses. Government will spend more on Medicare (government insurance for the aged) and Medicaid (insurance for the poor). Other programs will compete for a smaller pot \u2014 or taxes will rise. The only good news, assuming the actuaries\u2019 projections come true, is that spending has slowed from its pre-recession trajectory.\n\nAll this poses intriguing questions: What caused the spending slowdown? Why has it stopped?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great debate about how much [of the slowdown] is due to the economy and how much is from health system changes,\u201d says Drew Altman, head of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health-care think tank. Altman figures that the weak economy was the main cause, explaining about 60 percent of the slowdown, as people \u201cput off care that they [could].\u201d\n\nBut when the economy recovers, the trend reverses. Not surprisingly, the CMS actuaries cite improving economic conditions as one factor fueling the rebound in health spending last year and in the future. Another factor in 2014 was an 8.4 million surge in Americans with health insurance, mostly reflecting the Affordable Care Act (ACA). People with insurance use more health services than people without.\n\nLooking ahead, the CMS actuaries say that the aging population will boost spending as more people move into Medicare (up 19 million by 2024, or 37 percent) and Medicaid (also up 19 million, 33 percent). As people age, their health costs rise. Medicaid is hit both by an aging population \u2014 it covers nursing home care for the poor elderly and disabled \u2014 and liberalized eligibility requirements under the ACA.\n\nCushioning these increases are changes in the health-care payments system. As part of the ACA, Congress reduced Medicare reimbursement rates for hospitals and some other providers. There has also been a surge in high-deductible insurance policies provided by employers. Higher deductibles are thought to discourage spending by shifting some costs to patients. In the past five years, reports Kaiser, the average deductible in employer-provided insurance has risen from $826 to $1,217. The share of single workers covered by a deductible exceeding $1,000 has doubled from 22 percent to 41 percent over the same period.\n\nStill, Altman doubts that higher costs will trigger a broad debate over controlling spending. \u201cIt\u2019s just too tough,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are too many interests at stake. We don\u2019t even agree what the problem is. If you ask the public, it\u2019s fraud and abuse \u2014 \u2018we\u2019re being ripped off.\u2019 If you ask experts, you get a whole different answer.\u201d Experts tend to blame the fee-for-service reimbursement (which rewards providers for doing more), weak regulation or expensive new technologies.\n\nThat\u2019s why the spending slowdown seems dead: It can\u2019t be stopped by markets or politics.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson\u2019s archive.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Robert Samuelson, heatlh spending, health care spending, Affordable Care Act, health spending rebounds", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Look for health spending to silently shape the nation\u2019s priorities.", "title": "Why did health spending rebound?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-did-health-spending-rebound/2015/08/05/bae2716e-3b83-11e5-8e98-115a3cf7d7ae_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/08/05/Editorial-Opinion/Images/bigstock-Female-Doctor-Holding-Stethosc-24252278.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-did-health-spending-rebound/2015/08/05/bae2716e-3b83-11e5-8e98-115a3cf7d7ae_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Robert Samuelson, heatlh spending, health care spending, Affordable Care Act, health spending rebounds", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "bae2716e-3b83-11e5-8e98-115a3cf7d7ae", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Look for health spending to silently shape the nation\u2019s priorities."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce27c\"", "article_summary": "Not surprisingly, the CMS actuaries cite improving economic conditions as one factor fueling the rebound in health spending last year and in the future.\nBecause the 4 percent rate matched the economy\u2019s overall growth, health spending stabilized at 17.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).\nFrom 2008 to 2013, health spending grew roughly 4 percent a year, which was less than half the 9 percent average of the three decades before the Great Recession.\nHealth spending will silently shape the nation\u2019s priorities.\nThe \u201cit\u201d is the slowdown in national health spending."}
