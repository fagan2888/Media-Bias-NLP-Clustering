At one point, the Rams had a 16-13 lead in the game \u2013 after scoring five consecutive points \u2013 riding the play of Marchitto, who had eight of his 14 points in the first quarter.\n\nHowever, a 27-2 run quickly put out that hot start and from there, it was an uphill battle for Dickinson, who was unable to hold on down the stretch.\n\nUnion City was led by Steven Sanchez, who had 21 points, and Daiquan Kelly, who had 12. Johnny Sanchez also chipped in with 11 points, while Luis Solorzano produced a 10-point performance.\n\nFor Dickinson, Marchitto was complemented by Williams, who finished with 13 points, along with Isaiah Epps and Troy Lopez, who combined to score 17.\n\nDickinson (0-1) 16 9 16 17 \u2013 58\n\nUnion City (1-0) 21 21 14 14 \u2013 70\n\nUnion City 70: Dickinson: Antwand Williams 5-0-3-13, Anthony Florence 4-1-1-12, Carmine Marchitto 2-3-4-14, Terry Taylor 0-0-0-0, Ronald Washington 0-0-0-0, Juan Munoz 0-0-0-0, Rodney Oguku 0-0-0-0, Isaiah Epps 3-0-2-8, Marc Crespo 0-0-0-0, Deven Herbet 0-0-0-0, Devaughn Fishburne, 1-0-0-2, Troy Lopez 2-0-5-9 Jonathan Alfonseca 0-0-0-0, Neftaly Lantigua 0-0-0-0, Aditya Patel 0-0-0-0, Patrick Austin 0-0-0-0,\n\nUnion City: Johnny Sanchez 2-2-1-11, Elvis Michelli 0-0-2-2, Brandon Martinez 0-0-0-0, Luis Solorzano 4-0-2-10, Jon Bejar 3-0-1-7, Wesley Remigio) 0-0-0-0, Daiquan Kelly 5-0-2-12, Tyreek Ridley 0-0-0-0, Anthony Gomez 0-2-1-7, Steven Sanchez 8-1-2-21, Steven David 0-0-0-0, Adrian Diaz 0-0-0-0, Steven Urra 0-0-0-0, Kenneth Aviles 0-0-0-0.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "sports", "title": "Union City downs Jersey City's Ferris in boys basketball season opener", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Union City downs Jersey City\\u0027s Ferris in boys basketball season opener\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/12/union_city_downs_jersey_citys.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2013/12/13973490-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11863957\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-21T08:00:58Z\", \"author\": \"Brandon Gould/The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"sports\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2013/12/13973490-small.jpg", "description": "UNION CITY - If game No. 1 is any indication, it's going to be quite a ride for the Union City boys basketball team, which started its season with a 70-58 victory over Dickinson last night.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, December 21, 2013,  3:00 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2013/12/13973490-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"gould9tcnj\", \"author_nickname\": \"Brandon Gould/The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"10907171\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "UNION CITY - If game No. 1 is any indication, it's going to be quite a ride for the Union City boys basketball team, which started its season with a 70-58 victory over Dickinson last night.", "title": "Union City downs Jersey City's Ferris in boys basketball season opener", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/12/union_city_downs_jersey_citys.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, December 21, 2013,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "Brandon Gould/The Jersey Journal", "Description": "UNION CITY - If game No. 1 is any indication, it's going to be quite a ride for the Union City boys basketball team, which started its season with a 70-58 victory over Dickinson last night."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd32bd\"", "article_summary": "1 is any indication, it\u2019s going to be quite a ride for the Union City boys basketball team, which started its season with a 70-58 victory over Dickinson last night.\nUnion City was led by Steven Sanchez, who had 21 points, and Daiquan Kelly, who had 12.\nUNION CITY \u2014 If game No.\nFrom that moment on, it would be all Union City as the Soaring Eagles scored 14 of the game\u2019s final 19 points.\nFor Dickinson, Marchitto was complemented by Williams, who finished with 13 points, along with Isaiah Epps and Troy Lopez, who combined to score 17."}
