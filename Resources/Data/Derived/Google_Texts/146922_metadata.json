Terry Branstad (Photo: Special to the Des Moines Register)\n\nGov. Terry Branstad has rebuffed a request to delay penalties for hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers that don't soon sign contracts with private companies set to manage the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nDemocratic senators asked the Republican governor Monday to delay a Jan. 1 deadline for health care providers to sign contracts with four national managed care companies. The senators noted that the hospitals, clinics and nursing homes are slated to face a 10 percent reduction in their Medicaid payments if they don\u2019t meet the deadline.\n\n\u201cThis policy is not only punitive and predatory, it will put many health care providers out of business and further reduce access to affordable, quality health care for tens of thousands of vulnerable Iowans,\u201d according to the letter. It was signed by state Sens. Amanda Ragan, Liz Mathis and Joe Bolkcom, who are among the Democrats\u2019 leaders on health care issues.\n\nThe senators and other Branstad critics have complained that his administration is rushing to turn over Iowa's $4 billion Medicaid program to private companies. They have repeatedly urged him and federal officials to slow the transition.\n\nBranstad told reporters Monday morning that he would not grant the senators\u2019 request to delay the deadline for health care providers to sign managed-care contracts.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019ve been working on this and they know we\u2019ve been working on this diligently from January,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing what 25 other states have already done.\u201d\n\nRELATED:\n\nHe reiterated the controversial claim that the shift to private management would save money by better coordinating health care services, and he denied allegations that the transition is being rushed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no speed to this. It\u2019s being phased in over a period of years. And we started working on this in January so we\u2019re looking at almost a whole year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd basically I know there are people that want to protect their funding stream and are afraid of change. But the truth is, this has proven to be effective in other states at improving medical outcomes. That\u2019s what we want to do. We also think that it is something that will make it possible for us to provide better services to people and do it at less cost.\u201d\n\nIowa Hospital Association spokesman Scott McIntyre said Monday that the association does not believe state officials have the authority to impose the 10 percent penalty on providers that fail to sign managed care contracts. He said such a penalty was not mentioned in government documents that set up the new arrangements.\n\n\"What we do know from the state\u2019s own information is that the state is required to pay current rates for the first six months \u2014 the penalty obviously conflicts with that commitment,\u201d he wrote in an email to the Register.\n\nBranstad contended that health care providers expressed similar fears in 2013 about Iowa\u2019s version of Medicaid expansion, called the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan. \u201cThe providers were up in arms. They were: \u2018It\u2019s terrible, we\u2019re afraid of this!\u2019 And you know what? Today, we have more people insured than we\u2019ve ever had insured. Providers are making more money than they ever have. The charity care at hospitals has gone down significantly,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the hospitals that strongly objected to that have now seen it\u2019s really worked effectively. And we believe that given the opportunity, the managed care for Medicaid has the same potential to really provide better services, increase the beneficial outcomes and not damage the income stream for the providers.\u201d\n\nKirk Norris, president of the Iowa Hospital Association, disputed the governor\u2019s recollection that hospital leaders opposed the overall Iowa Health and Wellness Plan in 2013. Norris wrote in an email Monday that the hospital association consistently supported expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, as the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan effectively did.\n\nNorris added that although some other groups opposed Branstad\u2019s proposal to require many participants to have wellness screenings and to share costs, the hospital association helped lobby federal officials to approve those changes.\n\n\u201cThe irony of the governor\u2019s position on Medicaid managed care is that if enacted, the very benefits of the (Iowa Health and Wellness Plan) that he touts, beneficiary responsibility, accountable care organizations and reductions in charity care, will be lost,\" Norris wrote.\n\nDepartment of Human Services officials declined at a hearing last week to tell legislators how many health care providers had signed managed care contracts. However, the managed care companies acknowledged that no major hospitals had done so yet.\n\nThe plan still needs approval from federal officials, because Medicaid is jointly financed by the federal and state governments.\n\nDes Moines Register staff writer Brianne Pfannenstiel contributed to this article.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1NFcreC", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Democratic senators want to delay a penalty for hospitals and nursing homes that haven't signed managed-care contracts.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Democratic senators want to delay a penalty for hospitals and nursing homes that haven't signed managed-care contracts.", "title": "Branstad rebuffs request to slow Medicaid shift", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2015/11/09/branstad-rebuffs-request-slow-medicaid-shift/75461850/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democratic senators want to delay a penalty for hospitals and nursing homes that haven't signed managed-care contracts.", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c9bcd3d0eafa6e104b0bc0cca8427d96310637ea/c=0-62-317-379&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820595268529531-Branstad-Iowa.jpg", "title": "Branstad rebuffs request to slow Medicaid shift", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Nursing", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Nursing", "title": "Branstad rebuffs request to slow Medicaid shift", "author": "Tony Leys", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ede088ebf4d5f495133f430328b7dd5b8546119/c=20-54-280-400/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820595268529531-Branstad-Iowa.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/086d26659ae534421239c1e1e95ac1a821e333f6/c=0-62-317-379/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820595268529531-Branstad-Iowa.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6e77a590e21ffa49291d24f367e640d1c9c2ca68/c=0-63-317-301/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820595268529531-Branstad-Iowa.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/beeccfdb3ff6e79d1d9ee58540a9206b92307580/c=0-91-317-270&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820595268529531-Branstad-Iowa.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-11-09T18:21:24.513000-06:00", "shorthed": "Branstad won't slow Medicaid shift", "articleid": 75461850, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/49d8f62103fd3f8f04bd1b43bf7c58008c6163da/c=0-91-317-270/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820595268529531-Branstad-Iowa.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/38965b59834fa49df00f8dd39aeeddc057f37bc1/c=31-47-264-463/local/-/media/2015/11/02/IAGroup/DesMoines/635820595268529531-Branstad-Iowa.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Branstad told reporters Monday morning that he would not grant the senators\u2019 request to delay the deadline for health care providers to sign managed-care contracts.\nBranstad contended that health care providers expressed similar fears in 2013 about Iowa\u2019s version of Medicaid expansion, called the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan.\nTerry Branstad has rebuffed a request to delay penalties for hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers that don't soon sign contracts with private companies set to manage the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\nDemocratic senators asked the Republican governor Monday to delay a Jan. 1 deadline for health care providers to sign contracts with four national managed care companies.\nAmanda Ragan, Liz Mathis and Joe Bolkcom, who are among the Democrats\u2019 leaders on health care issues."}
