During high school she\u2019d been paralyzed by fear and anxiety. She had trouble making and keeping friends and thought about suicide. Though she knew something was wrong, she didn\u2019t do anything about it until college, when she learned her school offered free counseling.\n\nShe figured she\u2019d see the counselor for a few weeks or months. But \u201chere I am seven years later, still doing it,\u201d Bekkelien says.\n\nDuring that time Bekkelien has been in and out of college\u2014taking breaks whenever her depression gets too serious. If she\u2019s on a hiatus from school, she has to pay for therapy.\n\nOne doctor charged $100 per appointment, which meant she could only afford to go once a month. What was worse, the woman wasn\u2019t a good match for Bekkelien and kept insisting that what she needed was more female friends. \u201cI\u2019m introverted and had no interest,\u201d Bekkelien says.\n\nA different therapist might have been a better match. \u201cSince then I\u2019ve learned that there are ways you can look things up, and there are community resources,\u201d she says.\n\nThese early experiences seeking care inspired Bekkelien to create Mental Health Consumer, a website where about 2,000 visitors a month come to read lists about mental health myths, advice for healing from trauma, and tips on getting the most out of talk therapy. One therapist she knows even recommends her site to his patients. Bekkelien is careful not to present herself as a professional, but she thinks being just another patient sharing her experience can be \u201cpowerful.\u201d\n\nWhile there are things Bekkelien won\u2019t discuss on the site, she feels obliged to talk publicly about recovering from mental illness. Treatment is \u201cnot as mystical as people think,\u201d she says. It\u2019s about \u201cdeveloping a relationship\u201d that can help you navigate life and recovery.\n\nPeople between the ages of 18 and 30, often known as millennials, are more likely to be diagnosed with mental illnesses such as depression, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder and less likely to seek treatment. Three-quarters of all mental health conditions emerge by the age of 24. Across the country, growing wealth disparity, federal mandates to extend insurance coverage for adult sons and daughters under Obamacare, and shifting attitudes about the origin and nature of mental illness have had a significant impact on the ways that young people get and keep care.\n\nNow that children can stay on their parents\u2019 insurance until they\u2019re 26, rather than 23, it \u201ceases some of the burden for some people,\u201d says Victor Schwartz, a psychiatry professor at New York University and the medical director of the Jed Foundation, a nonprofit organization for suicide prevention among college students. But still, the \u201cbaseline is not that good,\u201d Schwartz says.\n\nBetween October 2013 and April 2014, 28 percent of those signed up for an insurance plan as part of the Affordable Care Act were between the ages of 18 and 34. Of the 48 million who were uninsured in 2012, nineteen million were in that age range, and a recent poll from Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics found that less than one-third of millennials plan to sign up for health insurance as part of the new law. Though Obamacare mandates that insurance companies cover mental health, therapists who accept insurance may struggle to adapt to the new bureaucracies, and many states are still trying to opt out of the law.\n\nNow that she has a new therapist whom she thinks is amazing, Bekkelien is very focused on her treatment. Because she\u2019s only in school part-time and doesn\u2019t have insurance, her family helps pay for her medication. If it couldn\u2019t, she would ask her boyfriend. \u201cNot being on medication would not be an option,\u201d she says.\n\nLindsey Bekkelien.\n\nAt one point, Bekkelien considered applying for disability insurance, but she found the paperwork overwhelming. In 2012, one-third of the 10 million people who received social security disability benefits qualified because of mental disorders.\n\nIf you feel comfortable with your doctor or therapist, treatment outcomes are better, as Bekkelien learned. Those able to become advocates for their own care may gain even more long-term benefits.\n\nWhen Katrina Gay\u2019s son went through what she calls a \u201cmajor depressive episode,\u201d he had just turned 26 and been dropped from her insurance. He was working part-time, so he didn\u2019t have his own coverage. Gay, who is the national director of communications for the National Alliance on Mental Illness, told him to call her organization\u2019s help line.\n\nIt\u2019s possible she could have helped him herself, but Gay believes that up to a certain point, \u201cthe more you figure out how to do this on your own, the less fragile you\u2019re going to feel.\u201d Through a lot of sleuthing, her son found a provider with a sliding scale, prescription assistance, and a program to affordably monitor the levels of medication in his blood.\n\nThis quest for mental health care was empowering and had a \u201cgood outcome,\u201d says Gay. She thinks catching depression early, before it gets to be debilitating, can make a big difference.\n\n\u201cFor a kid who has a chronic condition, the time to understand that is not when you\u2019re in the midst of your struggle,\u201d Gay says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re well, you need to have a crisis plan for yourself so you can activate it when you need it.\u201d\n\nNAMI has a thriving online community for young people dealing with mental illness called OK2TALK, which overflows with photos, GIFs, and poetry. People younger than 30 need a separate space; they\u2019re \u201cvery open,\u201d says Gay, and more willing than adults to talk about the bad times while they\u2019re happening.\n\nTeenagers and people in their 20s who have more severe symptoms\u2014those who hear voices, have been hospitalized, or are self-medicating with drugs or alcohol\u2014can be reluctant to join programs with older adults.\n\nYoung adults \u201cgo to a group with 45-year-olds, look around, and say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with this.\u2019 They feel like it\u2019s contagious, that they\u2019re going to catch what the old people have,\u201d says Marc Fagan, a psychologist and the vice president of clinical operations and youth services at Thresholds, a mental health facility in Chicago.\n\nFagan is an expert on the transition between youth mental health services and adult care. He runs the Emerge program at Thresholds, which guides 18- to 26-year-olds as they enter the adult mental health care system.\n\nMany in Emerge are on public assistance and struggle with serious mental illness, so providing therapy and medication is key. But it\u2019s just the beginning. Staff members meet with young adults at their homes or at school and help them find jobs, reenroll in school, and manage family relationships. Most of the staff is young, and Fagan says that while the model isn\u2019t that different from the one used to treat adults, young adults sometimes take a bit longer to warm up.\n\nDerisha Rouse is 19 and has been cutting herself since the seventh grade. Rouse, who is on Medicaid and has a therapist through the Chicago Housing Authority, encountered staffers from Thresholds last December while she was hospitalized in the psychiatric ward of Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center.\n\nShe was anxious when staff from Thresholds showed up. It wasn\u2019t the first time she\u2019d been suicidal, but it was the first time she\u2019d been hospitalized. Last winter, Rouse started to see \u201cvivid images\u201d of white snow with a patch of red, \u201cand my mind was telling me nobody needs you, you\u2019re useless, what are you here for?\u201d During an appointment, she told her therapist she wasn\u2019t going to make it home safely and instead went to the emergency room.\n\nDerisha Rouse.\n\nThough she was skeptical about Thresholds, Rouse didn't like to feel alone and appreciated that the program had an art therapist. She liked to channel her feelings through drawing, and while in the hospital she made a picture of a dark cloud overshadowing happiness. \u201cIt was pretty intense, but it felt really good once I got it on paper,\u201d she says.\n\nTypically someone with private insurance gets an allotted number of therapy sessions a year. That\u2019s not enough for people with more complex needs. Recent Medicaid expansion in Illinois has made it possible for more low-income people to get comprehensive mental health care, but many still don\u2019t get help early enough and don\u2019t know that they can get Medicaid coverage for mental illness.\n\nRouse has been able to bounce back. Her hospitalization was the tipping point, \u201cand I broke,\u201d she explains. Now she\u2019s on medication and heading to college in the fall. She thinks that if she\u2019d seen a psychiatrist earlier, it might have prevented things from getting so bad.\n\nRouse and Bekkelien learned the value of individualized care and early intervention the hard way, but they learned it nonetheless. Rouse wants to study early childhood education and pass on these lessons. Mental illness isn\u2019t who you are, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a label.\u201d\n\nThe article was published in connection with Please Like Me, a comedy about 27-year-old Australian comedian Josh Thomas, his quarter-life crisis, and his eccentric family and friends.
