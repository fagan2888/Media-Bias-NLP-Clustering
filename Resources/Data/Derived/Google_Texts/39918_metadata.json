The ongoing meltdown of the permanently frozen ground that covers nearly a quarter of land in the Northern Hemisphere has caused a host of surprising arctic phenomena.\n\nTemperatures across the Arctic are warming roughly twice as fast as the rest of the globe, largely due to the reduction in the amount of sunlight reflecting off of white, snow-covered ground. \u201cAt some point, we might get into a state of permafrost that is not comparable to what we know for 100 years or so, some new processes that never happened before,\u201d says geologist Guido Grosse of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Germany.\n\nThe mysterious craters in far northern Russia are just such an example. \u201cThere is nothing described in the scientific literature than can really, fully explain those craters,\u201d says Grosse, who is headed to the Lena River Delta in Siberia this summer, which hosts a joint German-Russian research station. The most likely explanation for the newly discovered craters in Russia is an accumulation of methane over centuries or more that then burst out of the thawing ground sometime in the last few years. \u201cHigh pressure built up and [the ground] literally popped open,\u201d explains biogeochemist Kevin Schaefer of the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center. \u201cIf it is indeed caused by melting methane ice, we should expect to see more.\u201d\n\nThese craters will then become lakes, which further thaw the permafrost around and beneath them as the water traps yet more heat from the sun. Similar new lakes are forming in depressions in the newly thawing lumpy landscape across the Arctic known as thermokarst. Such thermokarst lakes and surrounding marshes create the muddy conditions favoring microbes that break dead plant material down into methane. That methane then bubbles out of the lakes and ground and, where concentrated, can even be lit on fire, leading to cases of flames dancing above the ice.\n\nEven more widespread than blast craters or burning ice are drunken trees. Whenpermafrost thaws, soil that was once as solid as concrete becomes mud, due to the fact that ice makes up as much as 80 percent of the ground in some parts of the Arctic. And because ice takes up more space than water, the ground subsides, causing trees that grew upright to lean as the ground liquefies beneath them. Whole forests have listed like an army of drunkards as a result. This is also bad news for modern infrastructure in the Arctic as well: Roads, pipelines and building foundations sink into mud and crack or entire landscapes subside. \u201cLong term, there are huge economic and social impacts to permafrost degrading,\u201d Schaefer notes.\n\nWhere the ground slopes, even worse can occur: slumps, which are like slow-moving mudslides that can undermine areas of 40 hectares or more and stretch more than a kilometer across. The largest megaslumps can eat into the landscape at rates of a kilometer per decade and seem to show no signs of stopping. One slump in Russia that has mystified scientists extends more than 70 meters deep into the permafrost and is still growing after starting in the 1970s, Grosse says.\n\nPerhaps the biggest concern of thawing permafrost is a massive and sudden release of methane from the Arctic Ocean and/or permafrost. Methane traps at least eight times more heat than carbon dioxide over decades, driving global warming even faster. The bad news on the belch front are noticeable upticks in the amount of methane produced in the Arctic\u2014an increase of roughly 8 percent over 30 years at the Canada\u2019s Alert Station in the Northwest Territories. And ocean expeditions have observed methane bubbling out of methane ice at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean. The good news is that satellite data encompassing broad swathes of the Arctic and stretching back for decades now shows little change in atmospheric concentrations of the potent greenhouse gas. \u201cWhy that is, we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Grosse says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Temperatures across the polar region are warming, yielding a host of surprising -- and unsettling -- phenomena", "author": "David Biello", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Temperatures across the polar region are warming, yielding a host of surprising -- and unsettling -- phenomena", "title": "Mysterious craters are just the beginning of Arctic surprises", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/06/mysterious_craters_are_just_the_beginning_of_arctic_surprises_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/russia-siberia-crater.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Temperatures across the polar region are warming, yielding a host of surprising -- and unsettling -- phenomena", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/russia-siberia-crater.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Mysterious craters are just the beginning of Arctic surprises", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Mysterious craters are just the beginning of Arctic surprises", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Arctic, Climate Change, Global Warming, permafrost, Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc65c\"", "article_summary": "And ocean expeditions have observed methane bubbling out of methane ice at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean.\nTopics: Arctic, Climate Change, Global Warming, permafrost, Scientific AmericanIt\u2019s not just craters purportedly dug by aliens in Russia, it\u2019s also megaslumps, ice that burns and drunken trees.\nThe mysterious craters in far northern Russia are just such an example.\nPerhaps the biggest concern of thawing permafrost is a massive and sudden release of methane from the Arctic Ocean and/or permafrost.\nSimilar new lakes are forming in depressions in the newly thawing lumpy landscape across the Arctic known as thermokarst."}
