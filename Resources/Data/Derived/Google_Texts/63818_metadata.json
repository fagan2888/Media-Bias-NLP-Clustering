The Daily Caller News Foundation reports:\n\n\u201cPolicy-wise, it\u2019s probably a toss-up,\u201d he told Wagner. \u201cI actually think what the White House is doing is to say, \u2018Look, there\u2019s a lot of unrest about it. It\u2019s distracting. If we extend it, it really doesn\u2019t have that big an effect.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThey think, \u2018well, for the political gain, it\u2019s worth it to do that,\u2019\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd it certainly isn\u2019t a big deal. I keep saying \u2014 you know, they seem to be very strategic at the White House \u2014 do some of these things that are good politically but really don\u2019t affect the underlying policy \u2014 that defend the underlying policy. Like, no chance, no way are we going to roll back the individual mandate or anything like that. And so I think that\u2019s part of the strategy.\u201d\n\nWagner seemed a little stunned. \u201cWell, I guess I gotta play devil\u2019s advocate for a second here, Zeke,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause to be honest, it does seem, sort of, transparently political that they would do this ahead of the midterm elections when we know the White House is very concerned about Democrats holding on to their Senate seats.\u201d She also expressed concern over Americans who would be stuck with substandard plans because of the delay.\n\n\u201cI agree with you, Alex,\u201d Emanuel claimed. \u201cI don\u2019t like these substandard plans, I\u2019ve been a very big critic of them. I was a critic of the initial delay. I\u2019m not advocating this delay. I think it\u2019s understandable, and I also think it doesn\u2019t go to the heart of the Affordable Care Act and making sure it really impacts the American healthcare system. But you know, I agree.\u201d\n\nThanks, Zeke.
