The Bonnie Doon plant has closed and one of the two restaurants left won't reopen as planned this year.

The warehouse in Elkhart that makes Bonnie Doon ice cream closed last Friday and is now for sale.

Newscenter 16 has also learned the Bonnie Doon restaurant on Fourth Street in Mishawaka, which was closed due to road construction, won't re-open this year.

As for the Lincolnway location in Mishawaka, the owner says he has enough ice cream to stay open through the end of the season until November.

He also plans to re-open next spring as scheduled. He may have to switch to a different type of ice cream next year but still plans to call the restaurant "Bonnie Doon."
