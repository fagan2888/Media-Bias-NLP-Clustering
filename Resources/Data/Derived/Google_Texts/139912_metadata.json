Rand Paul (R-KY) said his rival Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was \u201cdespicable\u201d for \u201cbuying access to the Clintons.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nPaul said, \u201cOne of the things the Tea Party was upset about is fake conservatives. We were concerned about fake Republicans. People who said they were for one thing but really weren\u2019t. I think that is a real concern with Trump\u2014is he real or is he fake? It\u2019s a reality TV show\u2014is he acting? He used to be for Obamacare. He was for the bank bailouts. He used to be for gun control. He said the Democrats are better at running the economy than the Republicans. I wonder if he is in the right primary or not. He has given a hundred-grand to Clinton recently. Most of us think it is despicable to buy access to a politician. But isn\u2019t it equally despicable to be the one paying. It\u2019s despicable to receive the access, but it\u2019s despicable to be buying access to the Clintons.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd when you ask him why he gives to politicians he says \u2018I give to them so they will do what ever the hell I want them to.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, really? That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with politics that people are buying politicians and then they will do what ever the hell you want them to. That\u2019s whats wrong with government.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul: Trump 'Despicable' For Buying Access To The Clintons", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rand Paul: Trump 'Despicable' For Buying Access To The Clintons", "title": "Rand Paul: Trump 'Despicable' for Buying Access to the Clintons - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/randpaul.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/08/12/rand-paul-trump-despicable-for-buying-access-to-the-clintons/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rand Paul: Trump 'Despicable' For Buying Access To The Clintons", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/randpaul.jpg", "title": "Rand Paul: Trump 'Despicable' for Buying Access to the Clintons - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Rand Paul,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Hillary Clinton,Rand Paul", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Rand Paul", "published_time": "2015-08-12T08:54:06-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with politics that people are buying politicians and then they will do what ever the hell you want them to.\nThat\u2019s whats wrong with government.\u201dFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\nWe were concerned about fake Republicans.\nMost of us think it is despicable to buy access to a politician.\nIt\u2019s despicable to receive the access, but it\u2019s despicable to be buying access to the Clintons.\u201dHe added, \u201cAnd when you ask him why he gives to politicians he says \u2018I give to them so they will do what ever the hell I want them to.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, really?"}
