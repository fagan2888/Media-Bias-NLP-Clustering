Limbaugh: How to dodge ACA tax\n\nConservative commentator Rush Limbaugh says he\u2019s discovered a sure-fire way to skirt Obamacare\u2019s penalties for failing to obtain health coverage next year \u2013 but you\u2019d have to give up a fat tax refund.\n\nThe fine for failing to obtain insurance under the so-called \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d which starts at $95 or one percent of taxable income next year, will automatically be collected by the IRS from tax refunds. But if you make sure you don\u2019t get a refund, the agency won\u2019t be able to collect the penalty, Limbaugh told listeners.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201c[I]f you structure your taxes so that you do not get a refund, you do not have to buy insurance and you do not have to pay a fine \u2018cause they can\u2019t collect it from you if you don\u2019t have a refund due \u2014 and that is just another nail in the coffin of Obamacare imploding on itself,\u201d Limbaugh said on his show Thursday night, according to a transcript.\n\nProblems have plagued the website for individuals to sign up for coverage since it went live on Oct. 1 , a controversy now consuming Obama administration officials.\n\n( Understanding Obamacare: POLITICO's guide to the Affordable Care Act)\n\nExperts say Limbaugh is correct on one point: The IRS lacks teeth in enforcing the individual mandate. The Affordable Care Act prohibits it from using liens or levies to collect the penalties, tools the agency regularly employs to collect other unpaid taxes. Nor can it criminally prosecute anyone for failing to pay up.\n\n\u201cOne would need to make sure that he/she is not due a refund \u2026 [T]he point Limbaugh makes about refund filers, while a bit coarse, is true,\u201d said Robert Kerr, senior director of government relations at the National Association of Enrolled Agents.\n\nBut the fines can build up, with interest, so ignoring the penalties could come back to haunt negligent taxpayers, some experts said.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t pay your penalty\u2014which grows to $695 or 2.5 percent of income by 2016\u2014the IRS can\u2019t come banging on your door. Some Republicans have claimed otherwise, like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who said last month that individuals will \u201cgo to jail\u201d if you don\u2019t pay the fine.\n\n( PHOTOS: 10 Sebelius quotes about the Obamacare website)\n\nThe issue would be moot for many if trends continue: about 75 percent of Americans actually overpay their taxes and receive average refunds of $2,700 each year. The agency can just deduct the penalty out of refund checks, like it does for single fathers who owe child support.\n\nTaxpayers could, however, personally estimate how much they owe Uncle Sam, giving them control over whether they owe taxes for paying too little throughout the year, are due a refund for paying too much, or are spot-on.\n\nMost taxpayers don\u2019t go through the trouble as it requires a chunk of time and calculations. Taxpayers can also adjust their withholding allowances, but that is less precise. And they\u2019d have to be careful to not underestimate their tax liability by more than 10 percent, or they would be charged a fine.\n\nBut if they don\u2019t get a tax refund check, the uninsured won\u2019t have to worry about the feds deducting the individual mandate from their pay.\n\n( PHOTOS: Obamacare online glitches: 25 great quotes)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way for the IRS to collect the penalty,\u201d said an industry source working with the IRS on implementing the law.\n\nLimbaugh\u2019s epiphany on penalty collection restrictions isn\u2019t new. Then-IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman in 2010 said the most obvious way to enforce the fees would be to use tax refunds.\n\n\u201cIt is true there will not be a lien or other collection action taken against the taxpayer if they owe the penalty and are not getting an income tax refund,\u201d said Gene King at H&R Block.\n\nThe penalties won\u2019t disappear\u2014they\u2019ll simply add up at the IRS over the years. They could start being collected out of any refunds the taxpayer is owed in any subsequent year, King said.\n\nPlus, overdue charges will accrue interest.\n\n( WATCH: Website contractors grilled at Obamacare hearing)\n\nThe IRS does intend to collect interest on any unpaid penalties, according to industry sources familiar with the issue, although the agency hasn\u2019t issued any official guidance yet. So the sum of the unpaid penalty will keep accruing interest and the liability won\u2019t go away.\n\nAt least at first, the agency isn\u2019t worrying too much about the unpaid penalties, since it\u2019s dealing with all sorts of other complicated components of the law within its jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cThe administration in general is really de-prioritizing the penalty collection,\u201d said the IRS source. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be doing a lot of enforcement there. Wherever they can have a loose and easy interpretation of things, that\u2019s advantageous to the taxpayer.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: \u2018Glitches\u2019 hit Obamacare paper, phone applications too)\n\nSince the penalty will be assessed along with all other unpaid taxes\u2014which are subject to liens and levies\u2014things could get complicated. If someone owes a penalty along with other back taxes, the IRS can only use traditional collection methods on part of the sum.\n\nBrian Haile, senior vice president for health policy at Jackson Hewitt, says Limbaugh\u2019s assertion \u201cmay have limited relevance for many Americans\u201d \u2014 not only because most Americans get a tax refund but because those most likely to be hit with the penalty are also more likely to get some sort of tax credit from the government, such as the earned income tax credit for the working poor.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the proportion receiving refunds is even higher among taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes between $15,000 and $50,000, which is a demographic that is disproportionately likely to be uninsured,\u201d he said.\n\nKim Dixon contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Experts say he's correct on one point: The IRS lacks teeth in enforcing the individual mandate.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Experts say he's correct on one point: The IRS lacks teeth in enforcing the individual mandate.", "title": "Limbaugh: How to dodge ACA tax", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/rush-limbaugh-guide-dodging-obamacare-affordable-care-act-tax-penalty-98869.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/06/06/130606_rush_limbaugh_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Obamacare (770),IRS (350),Health Care (1666),Affordable Care Act (514),Individual Mandate (54),Rush Limbaugh (397)", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/rachael.bade.9"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe54b5\"", "article_summary": "Limbaugh: How to dodge ACA taxConservative commentator Rush Limbaugh says he\u2019s discovered a sure-fire way to skirt Obamacare\u2019s penalties for failing to obtain health coverage next year \u2013 but you\u2019d have to give up a fat tax refund.\nLimbaugh says you can avoid the fines but at the cost of a tax refund.\nBut if you make sure you don\u2019t get a refund, the agency won\u2019t be able to collect the penalty, Limbaugh told listeners.\nSo the sum of the unpaid penalty will keep accruing interest and the liability won\u2019t go away.\nBut if they don\u2019t get a tax refund check, the uninsured won\u2019t have to worry about the feds deducting the individual mandate from their pay."}
