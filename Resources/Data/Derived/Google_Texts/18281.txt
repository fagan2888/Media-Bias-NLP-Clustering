WatchCut Video, a weekly series on YouTube, recently featured Native Americans in five episodes. The participants in the videos were asked to do word associations. They were asked to describe the R-word, Christopher Columbus, Reservation, Thanksgiving, and Language using just one word.

The first video has Natives respond to the R-word. Responses included “derogatory,” “outdated,” “profiling,” and “racist.
