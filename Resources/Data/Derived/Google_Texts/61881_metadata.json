Darcy Reber, family medicine provider at Mayo Clinic Health System in Cannon Falls, Minn., recommends aquatic exercise because:\n\n\u25a0 Water's buoyancy supports your weight. When you're submersed up to your neck, the water cancels out about 90 percent of your body weight, significantly reducing stress on your weight-bearing joints, bones and muscles. Instead of landing on a hard surface with the impact of your full weight, you land with only 10 percent of your body weight. This reduces risk of injury.\n\n\u25a0 It's good for the heart. When you're submerged in water, your circulation may increase, improving your cardiovascular health.\n\n\u25a0 It's easy on the injuries. The pressure of the water on your body can reduce swelling.\n\n\u25a0 It tones your muscles. Water offers resistance, which strengthens your muscles as you push against it.\n\n\u25a0 It gives you superpowers. Since the effects of gravity diminish in water, you can do stretching exercises that you may not be able to do on land.\n\nYou may want to start with water walking. In water that's about waist high, walk across the pool swinging your arms like you do when walking on land. Avoid walking on your tiptoes, and keep your back straight. Tighten your abdominal muscles to avoid leaning too far forward or to the side.\n\nTo increase resistance as your hands and arms move through the water, wear hand webs or other resistance devices. Water shoes can help you maintain traction on the bottom of the pool.\n\nOnce you're comfortable walking in waist-high water, try walking in deeper water. As you walk, swing your arms. For a more intense workout, consider jogging in deep water.\n\nWater workouts can help you reach your fitness goals without pain or injury. They can add cross-training variety to your existing exercise routine or offer a safe and fun way to start an exercise program. So, jump on in \u2014 the water's fine.\n\nIf you live with a chronic health condition such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease, talk to your health care provider about aquatic exercise.\n\n\u2014 Mayo Clinic News Network", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/07/1003246535-FL_SAR_HFTIPS28.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd062\"", "article_summary": "When you're submersed up to your neck, the water cancels out about 90 percent of your body weight, significantly reducing stress on your weight-bearing joints, bones and muscles.\nInstead of landing on a hard surface with the impact of your full weight, you land with only 10 percent of your body weight.\nDarcy Reber, family medicine provider at Mayo Clinic Health System in Cannon Falls, Minn., recommends aquatic exercise because:\u25a0 Water's buoyancy supports your weight.\nIf you live with a chronic health condition such as asthma, diabetes or heart disease, talk to your health care provider about aquatic exercise.\nYou may want to start with water walking."}
