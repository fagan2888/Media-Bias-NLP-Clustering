Avalanche rookie goalie has allowed just two goals in his last 10 (regulation) periods:



DETROIT — Please see the previous blog about the Avalanche goaltending situation. After this 2-1 win at Detroit, Calvin Pickard has established himself as one of the NHL’s best goaltenders or just one of the luckiest. In nearly 758 minutes played, Pickard has the NHL’s second-highest save percentage (.939) and seventh-lowest goals-against average (2.06). He’s really become a big national story, but a treasure that will step aside for the Avs upon Semyon Varlamov’s likely return Tuesday.

The evolving game story looks at Pickard’s 34 regulation/OT saves and five sudden-death stops (seven total) in the nine-round shootout.

The Avs only score one regulation goal in two games on this three-game road trip, but come away with five of six points (including 1-0 OT loss at Pittsburgh, 5-1 win at Buffalo).



“In the end, it was a three-game trip, and if anybody would have told you you’ll get five of six (points), you’ll take it,” defenseman Erik Johnson said. “It’s a step in the right direction.”
