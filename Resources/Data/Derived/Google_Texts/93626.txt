Grade school students at The Independent School celebrate Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month.

Students from kindergarten to third-grade have been learning Chinese-Mandarin and Spanish as part of their curriculum.

During the year-end celebration, students performed in Chinese and celebrated Chinese culture.

"It's really fun to watch them progress and listen to their pronunciation come along. it's just so exciting to see them excited about this culture," said Khristi Bates, Lower School Head at The Independent School.

This is the third year that the Mandarin-Chinese program has been offered at the school.
