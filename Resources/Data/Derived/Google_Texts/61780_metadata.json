But McConnell and Boxer, the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, say they are tired of kicking the can down the road and want a long-term solution before Congress leaves for its August recess.\n\nRelated: Congress Uses Accounting Gimmicks to Fund Highway Bill\n\nBoxer had earlier proposed a far more ambitious program covering transportation spending for an entire six-year span, but apparently will settle for half a loaf. Since 2009, Congress has passed 34 short-term bills to keep the highway program afloat.\n\nThe long-troubled federal highway program has been largely funded by gasoline tax revenues from the federal Highway Trust Fund. But McConnell made it loud and clear over the weekend that a boost in the 18.4-cents per gallon federal gas tax is out of the question. Many Republican lawmakers view an increase in the gas tax as a violation of their solemn vow not to raise taxes, although the gas tax hasn\u2019t been increased or adjusted for inflation in two decades.\n\n\"Read my lips,\" McConnell said at a Bullitt County Chamber of Commerce luncheon in Kentucky. \"We're not raising the gas tax.\"\n\nFinding a way to fund a new highway program has always been the major stumbling block. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Paul Ryan (R-WI), Senate Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch (R-UT), President Obama and others have kicked around a number of ideas, including rewriting corporate tax law to tap into the hundreds of billions of dollars of profits stashed overseas by U.S. multi-national corporations.\n\nRelated: Why Congress Can\u2019t Make a Deal on Highway Spending\n\nBut with major tax reform unlikely before the 2016 election, McConnell, Boxer and others are eying a number of one-time only budget gimmicks and maneuvers to keep federal funds flowing to state and local governments to address the nation\u2019s crumbling infrastructure.\n\nThe largest single source of fresh revenue, $17 billion, would come from cutting dividends paid by the Federal Reserve to member banks, according to Morning Consult. Another $7 billion would come from the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\nIt gets even better: Increases in fees paid to the Transportation Security Administration, customs fees, and the elimination of Social Security benefits for people with outstanding warrants for their arrest would all contribute a few billion dollars toward the new program. Altogether, changes in nearly a dozen programs would generate savings of $48.7 billion.\n\nBut McConnell and Boxer will be racing the clock, with many obstacles to passage of a final deal before the end of the month. The Senate is scheduled to take an important procedural vote Tuesday afternoon to launch the debate on the floor, while intense negotiations take place away from the chamber.\n\nRelated: Highway Funding Could Be Backdoor to Corporate Tax Reform\n\nConservatives are spoiling for a fight if McConnell attempts to attach the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank to the highway bill, as McConnell suggested he would try. Although he opposes extending the bank\u2019s charter, McConnell has promised Republican and Democratic supporters of a vote on reauthorization.\n\nAnd some conservatives don\u2019t like the idea of funding highways with budget gimmicks. Heritage Foundation research associate Michael Sargent today called the deal \u201cbad policy that contributes to a tax-and-spend agenda and the growth of government.\u201d\n\nSargent said there has been \u201cno serious talk\u201d of addressing the Highway Trust Fund\u2019s chronic overspending. \u201cEven if Congress beefs up revenues to fund this new deal\u2014that diverts money away for new programs\u2014it will face a shortfall again in two to three years,\u201d he said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With new highway funding legislation as muddled as ever, Senate Majority Leader Mitch", "title": "McConnell and Boxer Offer a Grab Bag of Gimmicks to Pay for Highways", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/21/McConnell-and-Boxer-Offer-Grab-Bag-Gimmicks-Pay-Highways", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/Traffic%20Jams.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/21/McConnell-and-Boxer-Offer-Grab-Bag-Gimmicks-Pay-Highways", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/Traffic%20Jams.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With new highway funding legislation as muddled as ever, Senate Majority Leader Mitch", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The long-troubled federal highway program has been largely funded by gasoline tax revenues from the federal Highway Trust Fund.\nMany Republican lawmakers view an increase in the gas tax as a violation of their solemn vow not to raise taxes, although the gas tax hasn\u2019t been increased or adjusted for inflation in two decades.\nBut McConnell made it loud and clear over the weekend that a boost in the 18.4-cents per gallon federal gas tax is out of the question.\nFinding a way to fund a new highway program has always been the major stumbling block.\nSince 2009, Congress has passed 34 short-term bills to keep the highway program afloat."}
