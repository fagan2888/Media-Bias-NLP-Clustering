This is only the latest in a series of bills, executive actions or manifestos that are couched as a \u201cBill of Rights.\u201d A cursory search turned up these other BoRs:\n\n\u00b7 The Taxpayer Bill of Rights (courtesy of the Internal Revenue Service)\n\n\u00b7 The Airline Passengers Bill of Rights\n\n\u00b7 The Parents Bill of Rights (legislation in Colorado to give parents more authority over medical decisions involving their kids)\n\n\u00b7 The Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights (part of the Affordable Care Act)\n\n\u00b7 The Children\u2019s Bill of Rights (which, alas, does not include the right to remain silent)\n\n\u00b7 The Pets Bill of Rights\n\n\u00b7 The Secondary School Student Athletes\u2019 Bill of Rights\n\nAnd that's really the problem with the proliferation of Bills of Rights. Often these \"rights\" are just pragmatic concessions.\n\n\u00b7 The Retail Workers\u2019 Bill of Rights (approved by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors)\n\n\u00b7 The Actors Bill of Rights (including \u201cYou Are Entitled to Unquestioned Respect,\u201d which will come as news to Mel Gibson)\n\nObviously these and other ersatz Bills of Rights are so described in an attempt to derive reflected glory from the real Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nYet these \u201crights\u201d are usually prosaic in the extreme. Take those guaranteed by Obama\u2019s \u201cStudent Aid Bill of Rights\u201d:\n\nI. Every student deserves access to a quality, affordable education at a college that\u2019s cutting costs and increasing learning.\n\nII. Every student should be able to access the resources needed to pay for college.\n\nIII. Every borrower has the right to an affordable repayment plan.\n\nIV. And every borrower has the right to quality customer service, reliable information and fair treatment, even if they struggle to repay their loans.\n\nArticle IV -- \u201cEvery borrower has the right to quality customer service\u201d -- somehow lacks the poetry of the 4th Amendment in the real Bill of Rights: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d\n\nAnd that's really the problem with the proliferation of Bills of Rights. Often these \u201crights\u201d are just pragmatic concessions that a legislative body or government agency has decided to provide in response to (often legitimate) political pressure. Dressing them up in the grandiose language of a \u201cBill of Rights\u201d trivializes the concept of fundamental rights.\n\nIn fact, forcing people like me to recycle these inflated descriptions is a violation of the Political Commentators' Bill of Rights.\n\nFollow Michael McGough on Twitter @MichaelMcGough3", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Spare us from another ersatz Bill of Rights", "date": "2015-03-11", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "This week President Obama announced a series of measures to make it easier for Americans to repay their student loans.
