Taking a break from his program’s usual steady diet of smart takes from Ann Coulter and Sarah Palin, Cliven Bundy super-fan Sean Hannity had Yousef Munayyer, the Palestinian-American executive director of the Jerusalem Fund, as a guest on his Thursday night show.

Munayyer, who is frequently invited on other cable network shows to provide the Palestinian perspective, likely thought his appearance would involve a discussion of the ongoing fighting in Gaza; but it turned out that Hannity had other plans.

After struggling slightly to pronounce Munayyer’s name during his introduction, Hannity immediately started berating Munayyer, asking him, “What are you going to do!?” after presenting a hypothetical in which Munayyer himself is receiving rocket fire from a hostile force.

When Munayyer tried to answer by noting that the roots of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict go back decades, Hannity repeatedly cut him off, repeating, “What are you going to do!?” He then interrupted Munayyer some more by claiming he was “making a rationalization” for Hamas’ aggression.
