In Iowa, factional candidates excel and extremists find ground to run.\n\nIn 1988, Pat Robertson took a strong second in the Iowa caucuses. In 1996, another Pat\u2014Pat Buchanan\u2014came close to toppling Bob Dole. In 2008, Mike Huckabee won the contest, and in 2012, Rick Santorum won a slim victory over Mitt Romney.\n\nAnd ahead of the 2016 Republican presidential contest, Iowa Republicans are poised to give their votes to retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\nBloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Iowa Register asked respondents which views were \u201cvery attractive,\u201d \u201cmostly attractive,\u201d \u201cmostly unattractive,\u201d and \u201cvery unattractive.\u201d It starts off as you would expect. Eighty-five percent of respondents say Carson\u2019s lack of experience is mostly or very attractive; 88 percent say the same for his skill as a neurosurgeon, while 49 percent say it\u2019s unattractive that he has little experience with foreign policy. Routine, so far.\n\nBut then it goes off the rails. Two years ago, at the Values Voter Summit, Carson said that the Affordable Care Act\u2014designed to increase health coverage for millions of uninsured Americans\u2014was the \u201cworst thing that has happened in this country since slavery,\u201d which trapped millions of people in brutal hereditary bondage for more than two centuries. American slavery was a disgraceful chapter in our history that still shapes the structure of our society. Obamacare, by contrast, has delivered insurance and health services to 17.6 million people.\n\nWhat do Iowa Republicans think? Eighty-one percent say this makes him a \u201cmostly\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d attractive candidate.\n\nLast month, Carson voiced opposition to a hypothetical Muslim president. \u201cI would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation. I absolutely would not agree with that,\u201d he said. This, despite the Constitution\u2019s clear dictate on religious tests\u2014they\u2019re verboten. What do Iowa Republicans think? Seventy-seven percent say this makes him a \u201cmostly\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d attractive candidate. Two weeks ago, Carson said that guns\u2014in the hands of German Jews\u2014could have slowed Adolf Hitler and even stopped the Holocaust. \u201cI think the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people have been armed,\u201d he said.\n\nHistorians think this is ludicrous. \u201cI can think of no serious work of scholarship on the Nazi dictatorship or the causes of the Holocaust in which Nazi gun control measures feature as a significant factor,\u201d wrote Alan Steinweis for the New York Times. Armed Jews, especially in the years before the war, might have stopped some Nazi violence, but given Kristallnacht\u2014whose pretext was the assassination of a German diplomat by a German-born Jewish refugee in France\u2014it\u2019s just as possible that it would have led to more and worse reprisals for German Jews. Above all, the possibility of more guns does nothing for the vast majority of Jewish victims\u2014Russians, Poles, Hungarians, and others\u2014who were trapped between the Nazi war machine and the Soviet army. What do Iowa Republicans think? A whopping 77 percent say that Carson\u2019s statement makes him \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cmostly\u201d attractive. Overall\u2014presumably based on his beliefs and opinions\u201496 percent of Iowa Republicans are attracted by \u201ccommon sense\u201d-based approach to issues. If there\u2019s an area where respondents were unhappy, it\u2019s with Carson\u2019s fetal tissue research as a neurosurgeon. Forty-eight percent find it \u201cmostly\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d unattractive. Still, the retired doctor is stunningly popular with Iowa Republicans\u201484 percent have a favorable view of him. None of this means Carson will win. The vast majority of Iowa Republicans are still undecided. As the caucus comes closer, their preference might change. And other candidates, like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, are also popular with GOP voters in the state. What it does mean, if anything, is that Carson speaks the language of Iowa Republicans. They like his rhetoric, whether it\u2019s absurd, ignorant, or genuinely offensive. With that said, Carson will fade; he has cash, but he doesn\u2019t have a campaign. His money, for the most part, goes to raising more money, not to staffers, offices, or an infrastructure. But when he does, it will be because Republican voters got serious, not because of what he said. And that\u2014if you care about the outcomes of American politics, and not just the spectacle\u2014is troubling.\n\nRead the original article on Slate. Copyright 2015.
