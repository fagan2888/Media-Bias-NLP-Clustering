It was the first of the game for his team, but the last for Ben.\n\n\u201cI remember the play. It was kickoff return after he\u2019d scored their only touchdown,\u201d Jacob Hamm said. \u201cHe found the ball carrier around the 30 yard line and just smacked right into him. After that the other guy popped right back up, but he was really slow to stand back up. When he did, you could see he knew he was in trouble.\u201d\n\nBen staggered off the field, and his legs shook.\n\n\u201cThey waved my dad down there,\u201d Jacob Hamm said. \u201cHe said, 'Ben, look at me. Do you know who I am?\u2019 He looked at my dad and said, \u2018Yeah, Dad. I know who you are.\u2019\u201d\n\nBen soon started to fade.\n\n\u201cHe just started seizing up on the bench, and we saw him fall from the stands,\u201d Jacob Hamm said.\n\nBen was put in a medically induced coma for more than a week as doctors monitored his brain pressure. He held on until Sept. 19; a battle he just couldn't win.\n\n\u201cHe loved the game,\u201d Jacob Hamm said. \u201cHe was just the best.\"\n\nBen's parents have announced a service for Ben Hamm will be Saturday, September 26 at 10 a.m. at the Wesleyan Christian School gym in Bartlesville.\n\nDonations are being accepted at Lighthouse Fitness, 3333 West Hefner Road in Oklahoma City.
