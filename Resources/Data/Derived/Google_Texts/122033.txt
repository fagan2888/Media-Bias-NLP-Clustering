× Body recovered from Snohomish County lake

SNOHOMISH, Wash. (AP) — Authorities in Snohomish County say they’ve recovered a man’s body from Blackmans Lake, where a fisherman went missing more than a month ago.

The 38-year-old Lake Forest Park man was last seen wearing a yellow rain jacket and fishing on the lake Dec. 6.

Two nearby residents called authorities Sunday morning to say they had seen something floating in the water, and the Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office says it turned out to be the body of a man in a yellow rain jacket.

The sheriff’s office says the county medical examiner will identify the body and investigate the cause of the death.
