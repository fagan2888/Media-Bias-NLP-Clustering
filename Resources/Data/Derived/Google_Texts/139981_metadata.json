Ted Cruz offered a bold response.\n\n\u201cTake it out in a back alley and put two bullets in the back of its head.\u201d\n\nThis forum was stationed in Columbia which included other conservative candidates.\n\nHis response against the Affordable Care Act follows a week when the political theater among conservatives has taken a dramatic turn, with the highest polling candidates Ted Cruz and Donald Trump not only redirecting their focus on each other, but also ramping up their attacks right before the Republican party decides on their nominee.\n\nAccording to CNN politics the conflict between both contenders took place hours before both candidates were scheduled to make an appearance at a Tea Party event in South Carolina.\n\nThis is the first weekend of campaigning after the final GOP debate where Ted Cruz went after New Yorkers and their liberal mayor, as reported by the Inquisitr.\n\nAs mentioned in the article, Donald Trump did not hesitate to defend New York.\n\nEven more according to the New York Post, Ted Cruz did not actually apologize to New Yorkers for what he said but rather, apologized to them for having liberal leaders.\n\nEven celebrity interviewer Larry King got on Twitter to respond to Ted Cruz\u2019s fake \u201capology.\u201d\n\nSomeone tell @tedcruz his \"apology\" to New Yorkers missed the mark \u2013 by a Texas Mile. https://t.co/kPTJIDbkiG \u2014 Larry King (@kingsthings) January 16, 2016\n\nRegarding Ted Cruz\u2019s statement on doing away with the Affordable Care Act, there is no doubt that his analogy as executioner also has a lot to do with the president\u2019s standing on gun reform, which he enforced by executive order, as the Inquisitr also covered.\n\nMedia waiting on @tedcruz at #clp2016 in Columbia with @AGAlanWilson @WSPA7 pic.twitter.com/Mt6C3qSduB \u2014 Dawn Logg (@dawnlogg) January 15, 2016\n\nThe site Factivists has posted a response to Ted Cruz apparently made by the DNC spokesperson Eric Walker.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz has confirmed there just isn\u2019t much difference between any of the extremists running for President in the Republican Party this year, and none of them are worthy of the office they seek.\u201d\n\nAs the campaign cycle narrows down to its final year, the media has offered various views about the candidates and very recently conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks put out an op-ed which described Ted Cruz as satanic. The article has gone viral which referred to how Ted Cruz was all doom and gloom on his campaign trail where he calls for things to be destroyed and annihilated, rather than offer detailed solutions.\n\nDays before the piece was published, Brooks made the same comments on the PBS Newshour.\n\nThe response from New Yorkers continue under the hashtag #NewYorkValues, where even the pundit opposite Brooks in the video shown, tweeted out his view on the potential scandal with Ted Cruz and Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe Cruz family got well off with his wife working for a New York investment firm. No worries about #NewYorkValues. https://t.co/zj7QX60M7K \u2014 David Corn (@DavidCornDC) January 16, 2016\n\nThe heated exchange only works if there\u2019s a second party involved and so the accusations of Ted Cruz not being a natural-born citizen has been Donald Trump\u2019s latest position, which is very much like it was when President Obama was his target when he was campaigning in 2012, when he was spreading doubts that the president\u2019s birth certificate was even real.\n\nTrump even said that Democrats were likely to sue to solve the issue of Ted Cruz\u2019s right to the presidency. Thus far, according to a new report published by the Associated Press, he was correct.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Lubbock-Avalanche Journal ran with the AP story saying that a lawyer out of Houston has filed a lawsuit against Ted Cruz.\n\nAs the Inquisitr reported last year, Houston has remained a largely liberal city for 30 years, and continues to be one with the recent electoral win of a Democratic mayor, Sylvester Turner.\n\nEven so there\u2019s reason to believe that at the most, Ted Cruz will have something to say about that as well, or at least his father will, as he\u2019s already gone after a Houston mayor before. An article on Mother Jones refers to when the pastor said it was \u201cappalling\u201d that Houston had elected a gay mayor after Anise Parker was voted into office.\n\nTed Cruz had also already made his stance against the Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as Obamacare, long ago when he single-handedly shut down the government in 2013, which CNN points out he isn\u2019t bringing up on his campaign trail.\n\n\u201cBut on his six-day Iowa tour last week, Cruz didn\u2019t mention the shutdown once. It hasn\u2019t come up in the debates. Undecided voters don\u2019t ask about it in town halls.\u201d\n\nThe article goes even further to show that the reason people didn\u2019t ask about the Ted Cruz shutdown is because they weren\u2019t following him prior to the last year, at the very least, long after October, 2013, so they didn\u2019t know about it.\n\nGreeville-Online provides more details on the conservative leadership forum where Ted Cruz promised to rip the Iran deal to shreds, get rid of every one of President Obama\u2019s executive orders, reinstate Supreme Court Justices that were faithful to the constitution, and other promises along with his vow to \u201ckill\u201d Obamacare.\n\n[Featured image by Jamelle Bouie via Flickr / CC BY 2.0]", "article_metadata": {"description": "During the Conservative Leadership Project on Friday night, Ted Cruz was being interviewed by South Carolina's Attorney General, Alan Wilson, who asked him what", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "During the Conservative Leadership Project on Friday night, Ted Cruz was being interviewed by South Carolina\u2019s Attorney General, Alan Wilson, who asked him what", "title": "Ted Cruz Wants To Literally \u2018Kill\u2019 Obamacare", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2713185/ted-cruz-wants-to-literally-kill-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/23035700811_9ad4d38445_k-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T19:25:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-16T20:56:00+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/23035700811_9ad4d38445_k-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2016-01-16T19:25:43+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,2016 election campaign,donald trump,houston,mayor,new york,ted cruz,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/23035700811_9ad4d38445_k-900x440.jpg", "height": 440, "width": 900}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "During the Conservative Leadership Project on Friday night, Ted Cruz was being interviewed by South Carolina\u2019s Attorney General, Alan Wilson, who asked him what"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "During the Conservative Leadership Project on Friday night, Ted Cruz was being interviewed by South Carolina\u2019s Attorney General, Alan Wilson, who asked him what he would do about Obamacare.\nTed Cruz offered a bold response.\nThis is the first weekend of campaigning after the final GOP debate where Ted Cruz went after New Yorkers and their liberal mayor, as reported by the Inquisitr.\nAs a matter of fact, the Lubbock-Avalanche Journal ran with the AP story saying that a lawyer out of Houston has filed a lawsuit against Ted Cruz.\nEven more according to the New York Post, Ted Cruz did not actually apologize to New Yorkers for what he said but rather, apologized to them for having liberal leaders."}
