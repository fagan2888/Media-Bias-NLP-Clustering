The audit, released in February, uncovered about $2 million in dubious spending by UW over the three-year period. The vast majority occurred in the form of excessive salaries paid out to various administrators, but some of the expenditures were of a more absurd bent.\n\nSpecifically, auditors identified $8,821 in \u201cunreasonable and unallowable\u201d spending by UW. Of that amount, a whopping $1,179 was spent to purchase specially embroidered Snuggies, the popular infomercial fixture that combines a robe and a blanket while making one resemble a wizard. In addition, over $4,000 was spent on sundry consumer goods including canvas bags, tablecloths and even more custom Snuggies.\n\nUW was also faulted for spending thousands to purchase equipment, such as personal computers, just days before its grants expired, apparently in an effort to spend as much as possible before the gravy train ran dry. A $23,000 trip to Hawaii was also categorized as an unjustified use of NSF funds, because UW employees defended it solely on the grounds that they used \u201cfree research time to work on the NSF award while in Hawaii.\u201d\n\nThe audit notes that the improper spending was handled by having the school \u201ctransfer the costs\u201d in question, presumably by reclassifying the expenses to have them financed from some other source.\n\nThe bizarre expenditure was first noticed by The Washington Free Beacon, which noted that with embroidered Snuggies costing about $60 apiece, the school appears to have purchased quite a few of them.\n\nSend tips to blake@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.\n\nClick here for reuse options!
