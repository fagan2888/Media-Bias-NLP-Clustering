Larry Hines

President

Hines Corp.

Spring Lake

Hines was instrumental in the launch last February of the Muskegon Angels, an angel investment group with an initial $550,000 fund to support local startup companies. His family-owned Hines Corp., an industrial holding company, employs about 700 people across North America.

“Hines Corporation is planning on modest growth in the economy during 2014. Our best guess would be in the 2 percent to 3 percent growth range for GNP. This assumes no major change in direction or approach on the part of the current administration. As the Affordable Care Act kicks in, this could drive growth to the low end of the projected range. If the Affordable Care Act should be delayed for a year or so, we might see growth move toward the top of the range at 3 percent.

"If the administration, along with Congress, came up with a budget-balancing solution, which makes good business sense, I think growth could move up to 3 percent to 5 percent. Business leaders are prepared to invest for additional growth if they feel comfortable with the future direction of our country. We need 4-percent-plus growth if we wish to put our citizens back to work.”
