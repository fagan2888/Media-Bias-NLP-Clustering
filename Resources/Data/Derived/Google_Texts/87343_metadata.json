The first line of the post, \u201cKids will be Kids?\u201d immediately triggered a storm of criticism and negative feedback on Twitter.\n\nAt the time of his death, Rice was playing with a toy gun that was missing the orange warning tip that is supposed to identify it as fake. The St. Louis PD tweet, which linked to a longer post (that has since been deleted) from the St. Louis County Police City of Fenton Precinct Facebook page zeroed in on this detail, arguing that airsoft guns, despite being toys, resemble real guns and thus don\u2019t impact how \u201cofficers are trained to respond.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolice will respond as though it is a real gun until it can be confirmed one way or the other,\u201d read the post. \u201cIf an Airsoft pistol is tucked in your pants like a holster then obviously the orange tip is no longer visible. The police will respond lights and sirens and come to a screeching halt in the area where your child is playing with the gun.\u201d The post (replete with grammatical errors) then offered advice for parents: \u201cDo not run away. They need to no longer have the gun in their hands, throw it away from them. They need to comply with officers instructions. They may be ordered to lie down on the ground.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook post couldn\u2019t have been more poorly timed. It comes on the heels of a string of recent incidents of police brutality against black men \u2014 including the non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown, which sparked widespread protests throughout Ferguson, Missouri, and the rest of the country; and a grand jury decision in Staten Island yesterday that refused to indict NYPD Officer David Pantaleo in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, an unarmed man stopped for selling untaxed cigarettes.\n\nThe post, however, declined to address allegations of police brutality or a shoot-first culture within law enforcement. \u201cThis article is not about a boy losing his life, whether this was a justified shooting, or whether the cops acted too fast,\u201d it read. \u201cKids will be kids\u201d, and your children will continue playing war in the common grounds.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "If your 12-year-old son is holding a toy gun, a Facebook post instructs, \u201colice will respond as though it is a real gun until it can be confirmed one way or the other.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "If your 12-year-old son is holding a toy gun, a Facebook post instructs, \u201c[p]olice will respond as though it is a real gun until it can be confirmed one way or the other.\"", "title": "The St. Louis County Police\u2019s Shockingly Insensitive Tweet About A 12-Year-Old Gunned Down By Cops", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/12/04/3599576/st-louis-county-police-department-on-tamir-rice-kids-will-be-kids/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP504731934423.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If your 12-year-old son is holding a toy gun, a Facebook post instructs, \u201c[p]olice will respond as though it is a real gun until it can be confirmed one way or the other.\"", "creator": "@E_Hellerstein", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP504731934423-321x214.jpg", "title": "The St. Louis County Police\u2019s Shockingly Insensitive Tweet About A 12-Year-Old Gunned Down By Cops", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP504731934423.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP504731934423.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-04T11:22:29+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ericalhellerstein"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1f5\"", "article_summary": "Justice The St. Louis County Police\u2019s Shockingly Insensitive Tweet About A 12-Year-Old Gunned Down By Cops CREDIT: AP Photo/Mark Duncan Activist Art McCoy holds a photo of Tamir Rice before a protest.\nThe first line of the post, \u201cKids will be Kids?\u201d immediately triggered a storm of criticism and negative feedback on Twitter.\nThis morning, the St. Louis County Police Department published a shockingly insensitive tweet about Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old boy fatally gunned down by Cleveland police on November 22 for holding a toy gun \u2014 and then denied first aid for minutes.\nAt the time of his death, Rice was playing with a toy gun that was missing the orange warning tip that is supposed to identify it as fake.\n\u201cKids will be kids\u201d, and your children will continue playing war in the common grounds.\u201d"}
