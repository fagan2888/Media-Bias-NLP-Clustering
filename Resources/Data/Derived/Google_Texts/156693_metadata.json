Inevitably, some of these jokes rub his followers (and the rest of Twitter) the wrong way.\n\nFriday evening, O\u2019Brien posted a joke about Marvel\u2019s new Muslim female superhero that has caused a major backlash and brought out accusations of racism against the comedian.\n\nThe tweet received a barrage of angry responses from people who not only pointed out to O\u2019Brien that his comment was prejudiced towards Muslims but also that the character being introduced by Marvel is a teenage girl from Jersey City, not a housewife from Saudi Arabia. In other words, there\u2019s more than one type of Muslim woman.\n\nA sampling of the backlash is below:\n\nAfter ABC and Jimmy Kimmel were forced to apologize for a young boy who suggested \u201ckilling all the people in China\u201d during an on-air segment about the debt crisis, it would not be surprising if TBS and O\u2019Brien end up retracting this joke and issuing an apology, even though it didn\u2019t even appear on the Conan show. ]\n\nBut just as Kimmel wasn\u2019t the one who wanted to kill everyone in China, you have to wonder whether it was actually Conan O\u2019Brien who wrote and posted this joke on Twitter. As some have suggested, perhaps there was an over-eager intern running the account.\n\nBut even if O\u2019Brien didn\u2019t personally come up with this off-base joke, you have to think he approves messages that get sent out to 9 million of his closest friends.\n\nUPDATE (5:15pm ET): Conan O\u2019Brien has deleted the offending tweet and as of Saturday afternoon has not posted any comment about or apology for it to his Twitter account.\n\n[h/t TheBlaze]\n\n[photo via Twitter, Marvel]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conan O'Brien uses his influential Twitter account almost exclusively to share jokes on the latest news with his more than 9 million followers that may or may", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CC.jpg", "title": "Twitter Goes After Conan O\u2019Brien for \u2018Racist\u2019 Muslim Female Superhero Joke (UPDATED)"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conan O'Brien uses his influential Twitter account almost exclusively to share jokes on the latest news with his more than 9 million followers that may or may not end up in his late night monologue.
