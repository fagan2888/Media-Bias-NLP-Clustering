Ariana Del Negro is wife and caregiver to her husband, Char Gatlin, a retired Army Infantry Captain who was wounded in 2006 by a vehicle-borne IED while dismounted in Iraq. For the past eight years, Ariana has tended to Char’s needs stemming from the moderate TBI he sustained in the blast and they have both learned and grown a great deal along the way.

Faced with a military medical system and a VA benefits system unprepared to manage and assess TBI, Ariana successfully advocated for her husband to receive proper treatment and benefits. She not only has fought for him but is also an advocate for other wounded service members, veterans and their families. As an Elizabeth Dole Fellow for the state of Montana, Ariana is committed to promoting change at both state and national levels to ensure proper screening and diagnosis of TBI, appropriate training and credentialing of clinicians, and continued access to resources to support military caregivers and veterans.

Originally from Bethesda, Maryland, Ariana holds a Bachelor’s Degree from Haverford College. She works as a freelance medical writer, editor and business strategist in the field of continuing medical education.
