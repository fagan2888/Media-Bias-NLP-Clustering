In the more polarized Northern Ireland, popular sentiment, as found in opinion polls, was likewise positive, and the legislative assembly, after heated opposition, gave way to gradually shifting positions and voted earlier this month to approve gay marriage equality by a single vote.\n\nInstantly, the Democratic Unionist Party in the Northern Ireland Assembly scuttled marriage equality through a mean-spirited abuse of the power-sharing agreement that had achieved peace in the North after the violent struggles between unionist and nationalist communities. The party, which has strong Protestant roots and a significant number of evangelical members, invoked the peace agreement\u2019s \u201cpetition of concern\u201d clause, which can be used to block legislative measures during political emergencies to protect community and minority rights.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOf course, there is no emergency, and the abuse here is the Unionist Party\u2019s devious subversion of legislatively approved rights for gay, lesbian and transgender minorities. Amnesty International condemned the move as contrary to the peace agreement.\n\nUnionist political leaders chose to obstruct an advancement of human rights that was championed by the rival Sinn Fein and Social Democratic and Labor parties. Court challenges are underway, with Northern Ireland remaining the only part of the United Kingdom that does not allow civil marriages for all citizens.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt seems inevitable that the Unionists will ultimately fade or be overcome by the popular will on this issue. Meanwhile, the people in the North, ever resourceful, are heading south to obtain civil unions. One of the first same-sex marriages last week in the Irish Republic was for a Northern Irish couple who crossed the border to go down the aisle \u2014 Tony Day and his husband, Darren Day. \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, we\u2019re married \u2014 we got married on this island,\u201d Darren Day said, proclaiming Irish unification in his heart at least.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20151121143003, "twitter": {"description": "A motion to legalize same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland is blocked, causing a disconnect along the border.", "title": "Gay Marriage Derailed in Northern Ireland", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/opinion/sunday/gay-marriage-derailed-in-northern-ireland.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004047378"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/22/opinion/22sun2web/22sun2web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/opinion/sunday/gay-marriage-derailed-in-northern-ireland.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004047378", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/opinion/sunday/gay-marriage-derailed-in-northern-ireland.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/sunday", "hdl_p": "Gay Marriage Derailed in Northern Ireland", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 21, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Democratic Unionist Party (Northern Ireland)", "keywords": "Editorials,Northern Ireland,Ireland,Democratic Unionist Party (Northern Ireland),Same-Sex Marriage  Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships", "news_keywords": "Editorial,Ireland", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "SCG": "sunday", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A motion to legalize same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland is blocked, causing a disconnect along the border.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/22/opinion/22sun2web/22sun2web-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/22/opinion/22sun2web/22sun2web-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "A motion to legalize same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland is blocked, causing a disconnect along the border.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 21, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-11-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships", "published": "2015-11-21", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Ireland", "slug": "22sun2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151124113903, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/opinion/sunday/gay-marriage-derailed-in-northern-ireland.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/22/opinion/22sun2web/22sun2web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A motion to legalize same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland is blocked, causing a disconnect along the border.", "title": "Gay Marriage Derailed in Northern Ireland"}, "pdate": 20151121, "des": "Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships", "articleid": 100000004047378, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Gay Marriage Derailed in Northern Ireland", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "article_summary": "Court challenges are underway, with Northern Ireland remaining the only part of the United Kingdom that does not allow civil marriages for all citizens.\nIn the more polarized Northern Ireland, popular sentiment, as found in opinion polls, was likewise positive, and the legislative assembly, after heated opposition, gave way to gradually shifting positions and voted earlier this month to approve gay marriage equality by a single vote.\nThe celebratory rites by gay couples and clans in Ireland were hardly a surprise;
