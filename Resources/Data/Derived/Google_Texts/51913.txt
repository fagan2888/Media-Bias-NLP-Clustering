A man’s body was pulled from the Arkansas River in western Fremont County on Monday, marking the fourth death on the river in the past 13 days.

A motorist on U.S. 50 spotted the body near Wellsville, according to Capt. Don Pinover of the Fremont County Sheriff’s Office.

The man, whom Pinover said authorities believe to be a kayaker, was wearing a life vest and a helmet.

“We don’t know where he came from or where he went in,” Pinover said.

An inflatable kayak was found near the man’s body.

Detectives from the sheriff’s office recovered the keys to a vehicle on the man, and they were searching the riverbank for his car.

The sheriff’s office has not yet identified the man.

Last week, a Cañon City angler was swept away in the river while trying to rescue his dog from the high waters.

His body was found more than a mile downstream.

More than a dozen people have died in raging Colorado rivers this spring as an above-average snowpack melts.
