She has even compared GOP candidates\u2019 stances on women\u2019s reproductive rights to those of \u201cterrorist groups,\u201d saying they back policies on contraception and health care access that are out of date.\n\nSeveral Republican candidates have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Clinton promises to make sure it remains on the books. But she wants to lower the costs of health care co-pays and deductibles under the Affordable Care Act and cap the costs of prescription drugs.\n\nBernie Sanders, Clinton\u2019s principal rival, falls further to the left when it comes to abortion rights. Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, has unequivocally backed women\u2019s abortion rights and access to all forms of birth control. \u201cThe decision about abortion must remain a decision for the woman and her doctor to make, not the government,\u201d Sanders says on his website.\n\nHe wants to expand funding to Planned Parenthood to provide more testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), cancer screenings and primary care services to women. Sanders supported \u201cObamacare\u201d in the Senate. As a candidate, Sanders has proposed a Medicare-for-all plan, in which he would expand Medicare, which insures the nation\u2019s senior citizens, into a single-payer national health care system. That way, he has said, health insurance coverage would be available to the millions of uninsured low- and middle-income people who live in states that chose not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe remaining three candidates \u2014 not counting an 11th hour debate appearance by Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 have not been as vocal in staking out positions on reproductive rights and health care, but their past policy moves may offer some insight into their views.\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, for example, signed the Family Planning Works Act in 2012, which provided more low-income women with free pregnancy counseling in addition to contraception, STI testing and cervical cancer screenings funded by Medicaid.\n\nO\u2019Malley is Catholic, but he is also pro\u2013abortion rights. In a 2012 interview, he accused the Catholic Church of \u201chyperventilating\u201d over Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act regulations requiring employers and insurers cover reproductive health benefits for women.\n\nJim Webb, a Vietnam veteran and former secretary of the Navy under President Ronald Reagan, voted as a senator to support Planned Parenthood funding in 2011, but he has remained silent on the recent congressional investigation into the videos.\n\nWomen\u2019s reproductive rights have not been a prominent part of the former Virginia senator's campaign, but he supports Roe v. Wade. Webb also voted against the 2012 Blunt Amendment to the ACA, which would have allowed employers to opt out of covering contraceptives under employee health plans based on moral or religious beliefs.\n\nLincoln Chafee, an ex-Republican who served as governor of Rhode Island, also supports abortion rights. He said that \u201ca woman should make her own reproductive decisions\u201d and as a U.S. senator he co-sponsored the Family Planning State Empowerment Act, which would have eliminated red tape for women to get access to planning services under Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While all are pro-choice, there are some key differences among Democratic contenders on women's health, reproductive rights", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/10/13/democratic-candidates-on-health-care-abortion.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/10/13/democratic-candidates-on-health-care-abortion/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Debates_Vegas_101315.1444840272353.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "While all are pro-choice, there are some key differences among Democratic contenders on women's health, reproductive rights", "title": "Democratic candidates have varied positions on health care, abortion"}, "LastModifiedDate": "Wed, 14 Oct 2015 16:31:38 GMT", "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/10/13/democratic-candidates-on-health-care-abortion/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Debates_Vegas_101315.1444840272353.jpg", "description": "While all Democratic contenders are pro\u2013abortion rights, some key differences on women's health, reproductive rights", "card": "summary", "title": "Democratic candidates have varied positions on health care, abortion"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Women's Rights, Politics, Presidency of the United States, Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, Health Care, Election 2016, U.S., Bernie Sanders", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But there are key differences among the Democratic contenders when it comes to health care and women\u2019s reproductive rights.\nBut she wants to lower the costs of health care co-pays and deductibles under the Affordable Care Act and cap the costs of prescription drugs.\nSeveral Republican candidates have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Clinton promises to make sure it remains on the books.\nShe has even compared GOP candidates\u2019 stances on women\u2019s reproductive rights to those of \u201cterrorist groups,\u201d saying they back policies on contraception and health care access that are out of date.\nWomen\u2019s reproductive rights have not been a prominent part of the former Virginia senator's campaign, but he supports Roe v.
