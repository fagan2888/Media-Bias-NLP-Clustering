The State and Defense departments would each receive just over $100 million.\n\nThe White House has said the funds are \u201cnecessary to combat the spread of Ebola and reduce the potential for future outbreaks of infectious diseases,\u201d according to a statement last month.\n\nThe GOP had been torn on the request, with several lawmakers scrutinizing the need for a $1.5 billion contingency fund.\n\nA White House spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Obama would continue to ask for the remaining funding.\n\nEbola, which dominated headlines in early fall, when a Dallas hospital reported several infections, has since lost steam as a political issue. Ten patients have been treated for Ebola in the U.S., nine of whom survived.\n\nThe American Hospital Association released a statement Wednesday that said it is \"pleased\" with the funding level, which will help prepare for additional cases of Ebola.\n\n\"This bill is a good first step to ensure that hospitals have the resources necessary to properly respond to this crisis. We urge the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Health and Human Services to expeditiously distribute the funds to hospitals so they may continue their preparedness efforts,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe House Rules Committee will meet Wednesday to comb through the bill, dubbed the \u201ccromnibus.\u201d\n\n\u2014 This post was updated at 11:59 a.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Ebola funding in 'cromnibus' falls just short of Obama request", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Ebola funding in 'cromnibus' falls just short of Obama request", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/226605-ebola-funding-in-cromnibus-falls-just-short-of-obama-request", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/226605-ebola-funding-in-cromnibus-falls-just-short-of-obama-request", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-10T10:40-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-10T10:40:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/226605-ebola-funding-in-cromnibus-falls-just-short-of-obama-request", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Ebola funding in 'cromnibus' falls just short of Obama request"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd609c\"", "article_summary": "The funding falls just short of the funding request issued by the president last month as a crucial step to curbing outbreak, which has infected more than 16,000 people overseas.\nThe $1.1 trillion spending bill unveiled Tuesday night includes nearly all of President Obama\u2019s massive $6.2 billion emergency funding request to fight the Ebola outbreak.\nA White House spokeswoman declined to comment on whether Obama would continue to ask for the remaining funding.\nLawmakers have agreed to spend $5.4 billion on Ebola treatment and prevention measures in the U.S. and West Africa.\nThe House Rules Committee will meet Wednesday to comb through the bill, dubbed the \u201ccromnibus.\u201d\u2014 This post was updated at 11:59 a.m."}
