It has become a made-for-TV event, drawing on the unquenchable thirsts of college and NFL fans. The combine helps NFL executives verify what they\u2019ve seen on film.\n\nThe combine can crush dreams. Pro days can revive them. Broncos general manager John Elway said he understands when quarterbacks only participate in limited drills at the combine.\n\n\u201cBecause you can do the rest at your pro day,\u201d Elway said.\n\nFor Colorado State players, it arrives on Wednesday. Rams quarterback Garrett Grayson, arguably the highest-rated prospect, is not expected to participate in Fort Collins. According to Colorado State, Grayson will work out for scouts on March 23, allowing time for his hamstring to heal. Grayson suffered the injury on Feb. 10 running a 40-yard dash, preventing him from throwing in Indianapolis.\n\nHowever, Grayson, the 2014 Mountain West Offensive Player of the Year, continues to climb in mock drafts. ESPN\u2019s Mel Kiper Jr. predicted last week that Grayson could be the third quarterback picked after Florida State\u2019s Jameis Winston and Oregon\u2019s Marcus Mariota. Kiper said that Grayson could be a late first-round selection. Other mock drafts have Grayson pegged as a second-to-third-round pick, ranked fifth behind Baylor\u2019s Bryce Petty and UCLA\u2019s Brett Hundley. ESPN analyst Jon Gruden recently invited Grayson to his quarterback camp, a televised production which features the players breaking down plays.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all competing to be the (No.) 1 guy. We obviously know, one and two guys are kind of at the top of this class, but as a competitor, you\u2019re always trying to be that No. 1 guy. So every one of us \u2014 none of us are working to be the third guy, we\u2019re all working for that No. 1 spot,\u201d said Grayson, who did well in his combine interviews with interested teams. \u201cYou set out your goals and every day you go to the gym and every single one of us is working to be that No. 1 guy taken.\u2019\u2019\n\nEven without Grayson, CSU\u2019s pro day will feature seven scheduled participants: offensive lineman Ty Sambrailo, cornerback Bernard Blake, linebacker Aaron Davis, defensive lineman LaRyan King, wide receiver Charles Lovett, linebacker Max Morgan and kicker Jared Roberts.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Garrett Gray,Jameis Winston,Jared Roberts,John Elway,Marcus Mariota,son,Ty Sambrailo", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "CSU is holding its pro day on on Wednesday, when seven Rams are scheduled to participate, but not quarterback Garrett Grayson because of injury.", "title": "Garrett Grayson pushes pro day back to let hamstring heal", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/03/10/colorado-state-cu-hold-pro-days-garrett-grayson-pushes-workout-back/32816/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/03/garrett-grayson-csu-qb.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "CSU is holding its pro day on on Wednesday, when seven Rams are scheduled to participate, but not quarterback Garrett Grayson because of injury.", "title": "Colorado State holds pro day Wednesday; Garrett Grayson pushes workout back", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/03/10/colorado-state-cu-hold-pro-days-garrett-grayson-pushes-workout-back/32816/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/03/garrett-grayson-csu-qb.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "CSU is holding its pro day on on Wednesday, when seven Rams are scheduled to participate, but not quarterback Garrett Grayson because of injury."}, "article_summary": "According to Colorado State, Grayson will work out for scouts on March 23, allowing time for his hamstring to heal.\n\u201cBecause you can do the rest at your pro day,\u201d Elway said.\nThe NFL combine boasts tremendous ratings.\nFor Colorado State players, it arrives on Wednesday.\nRams quarterback Garrett Grayson, arguably the highest-rated prospect, is not expected to participate in Fort Collins."}
