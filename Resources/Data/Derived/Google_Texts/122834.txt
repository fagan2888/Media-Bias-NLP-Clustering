The University of Notre Dame has refiled a lawsuit that challenges the constitutionality of portions of the Affordable Care Act. The suit claims the current law violates the university’s right to religious freedom in its provisions regarding coverage for contraceptives.

In a statement, Notre Dame’s president said the refiling represents the University’s right to “to live out a religious freedom.”

“We have sought neither to prevent women from having access to services, nor even to prevent the government from providing them,” said Notre Dame President Rev. John Jenkins.

Jenkins says officials from Notre Dame have been in discussions with government officials about the Affordable Care Act for more than a year. Jenkins says while he thinks the discussions were in good faith, ultimately the healthcare mandate still would require Notre Dame to forfeit its religious rights.

Notre Dame filed the suit against Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and their departments.

A federal judge dismissed the first lawsuit earlier this year saying the regulation was not ready for judicial review.
