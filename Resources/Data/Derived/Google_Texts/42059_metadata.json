But Goodlatte wants to pursue \u201ccomprehensive reform\u201d that would also address location privacy rules \u2014 like when law enforcement could access GPS information tied to a person\u2019s cell phone \u2014 a committee aide told MT Friday.\n\nThat could complicate the otherwise noncontroversial push to update the law, because while most of Congress is in agreement on the email privacy update, the location update is seen as more difficult to pass (and it\u2019s not a component of the Senate Judiciary-passed ECPA reform bill.)\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014BUT, A LOT OF CO-SPONSORS: The ECPA reform bill from Reps. Kevin Yoder and Tom Graves, though, now has 181 co-sponsors. \u201cIt is definitely on Goodlatte\u2019s radar,\u201d Yoder told us. \u201cWe\u2019d love the Judiciary Committee to be able to take it up this year. What we\u2019re trying to do is make it easier for them to move it to the top of the agenda and to support their efforts by showing the amount of support from members in the House,\u201d he said, adding that he thinks the measure could potentially be a suspension candidate, especially if Goodlatte gives his blessing.\n\nBut count Yoder in the camp of not wanting to complicate a potential email privacy update by adding in location issues. Even Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a location privacy crusader and sponsor of the GPS Act that would require a warrant for location information, said Friday he wouldn\u2019t be opposed to separating the issues. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to do device,\u201d he said, referring to location privacy. \u201cI think we should do both \u2014 but should it be combined, should it be separate? It\u2019s procedural.\u201d\n\nHILL DRAWS CRITICISM FOR NSA OVERSIGHT \u2014 Darren Samuelsohn has the story: \u201cCries of lax Capitol Hill oversight are piling up as Snowden-inspired stories continue to explode in the media, casting doubt on whether the legislative watchdogs can be trusted to oversee national security agencies that they\u2019ve long defended.Intelligence Committee leaders from the House and Senate insist they\u2019ve done their due diligence but acknowledge that lawmakers can glean only as much information as the president and his team will share. And even then, anything of such a highly classified nature can\u2019t be legally disclosed anyway. Still, a \u2018trust us\u2019 promise from the lawmakers with the highest of high-security clearances isn\u2019t satisfying critics.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany members of Congress have revolted out of frustration that the Obama administration and their fellow lawmakers haven\u2019t done enough to address concerns about overreach in U.S. surveillance programs. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) sued the president. The House last summer came within a dozen votes of passing legislation to curb the NSA\u2019s powers. And turf be damned, multiple House and Senate panels that share jurisdiction over intelligence and national security issues are forging ahead with their own inquiries.\u201d MORE: http://politi.co/1cn4JFx\n\nGOOD MONDAY MORNING and welcome to Morning Tech, where we slapped together an 86 at East Potomac Park yesterday before the rain started. We\u2019re taking all comers \u2014 hit us up at abyers@politico.com and @byersalex, and catch the rest of the team\u2019s contact info after speed read.\n\n** We need a clean STELA reauthorization, not another vehicle to hike consumers\u2019 cable bills. Pay-TV is trying to gouge consumers by taking the channels they watch most out of their basic package. They are ripping people off to boost record profits. **\n\nMARK PENN GETS MSFT PROMOTION \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s Dina Bass: \u201cMicrosoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who replaced Steve Ballmer last month, is realigning management and appointing Executive Vice President Mark Penn to the new role of chief strategy officer, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\u201d http://bloom.bg/1oioXzT\n\nFRIDAY NEWS DUMP: FCC CANCELS CONTROVERSIAL MEDIA STUDY \u2014 Brooks has the story: \u201cThe Federal Communications Commission is pulling the plug on a controversial survey of TV newsroom activities that sparked a firestorm of criticism from Republicans. \u2018The FCC will not move forward with the Critical Information Needs study,\u2019 an FCC spokesman said Friday. \u2018The Commission will reassess the best way to fulfill its obligation to Congress to identify barriers to entry into the communications marketplace faced by entrepreneurs and other small businesses.\u2019 The study was to start this spring with a pilot test in Columbia, S.C., and it included questions about how TV stations determine what news stories to cover. It also sought insight into debates between journalists and management over news coverage.\u201d http://politi.co/ORRu56\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE WATCHING TODAY \u2014 The snow\u2019s already shutdown most of D.C., but don\u2019t forget the first of three big data workshops being hosted by the White House as part of the John Podesta-led review. That\u2019s up in Massachusetts today, and we expect it to go on. Podesta\u2019s supposed to keynote in the 9 a.m. hour, with Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker speaking at 12:45. Webcast and full agenda here, which also includes former W.H. tech aide Danny Weitzner, Intel\u2019s David Hoffman, and FTC\u2019s Latanya Sweeney: http://bit.ly/1ju0BmM\n\nANOTHER COMCAST ACQUISITION \u2014 The WSJ\u2019s Shalini Ramachandran and Mike Shields: \u201cComcast Corp. is near a deal to acquire FreeWheel Media Inc., a Web-video company for about $320 million, a person familiar with the matter said.FreeWheel helps media companies deliver ads in Web video. The company's technology, which is used by traditional TV networks' websites and online-only outlets, ensures that ads are seen by viewers they are aimed at, taking into account such variables as a person's location and recent viewing history.The acquisition is part of Comcast's effort to expand in online video. In recent years, the cable operator has invested in creating online video portals and applications to give its cable-TV subscribers ways to stream TV programming on devices such as computers, tablets and smartphones. Comcast also has been an advocate of an industrywide effort to offer cable-TV subscribers access to cable programming online.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1oins51\n\nMORE DATA SECURITY WORK TEED UP FOR HILL \u2014 If you didn\u2019t get enough from the first four hearings, the data security debate is back on Capitol Hill this week. Two House subcommittees on Tuesday will examine how technology might protect Americans against international cybercriminals, and a House Financial Services subcommittee on Wednesday will look at data security and efforts to protect financial information. Lawmakers, eager to show movement in an immobile Congress, demanded hearings and dusted off legislation soon after the well-publicized breaches at Target and Neiman Marcus. And they show little sign of stopping \u2014 expect another hearing announcement from Senate Commerce in coming weeks.\n\n\u2014BTW, TARGET INKS VENABLE LOBBY CONTRACT: As it continues to interface with Washington in the wake of its highly publicized security flap late last year, Target\u2019s signed on Venable to work on \u201cissues relating to data breach,\u201d according to a filing made late last week. Robert Smith and William Norwind will work on the deal, which has been active since mid-January.\n\nICYMI: MICROSOFT V.

Republican Pedro Celis, a retired Microsoft software engineer from Redmond...The swing district is the state\u2019s most evenly divided between Republican- and Democratic-leaning voters. As such, it\u2019s likely the GOP\u2019s best shot at flipping a congressional seat in the state in this year\u2019s midterm elections. Celis cited DelBene\u2019s support for policies such as the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obama\u00adcare, as a major reason he\u2019s running.\u201d http://bit.ly/Nldlkq\n\nSPEED READ\n\nREPORT: BETTER CYBER PROTECTIONS NEEDED FOR POWER GRID: Companies don\u2019t like to share information with one another, the New York Times reports: http://nyti.ms/ORRC4O\n\nSTARTUPS\u2019 SECURITY FOCUS, OR LACK THEREOF: The focus early on is often on raising cash, not protecting data, the NYT reports: http://nyti.ms/ORSTsr\n\nIMMIGRATION DEBATE COMES HOME FOR GOODLATTE: The HJC chairman faces daunting demographics, the Washington Post reports: http://wapo.st/ORSYfJ\n\nTips, comments, suggestions?
