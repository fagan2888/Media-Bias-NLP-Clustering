Ryan told Republican members that Capitol Hill negotiators and the White House had reached the agreement on the $1.1 trillion spending bill after working into the night on which policy add-ons to include in the package, according to members who emerged from the closed-door meeting.\n\nLawmakers said a parallel deal on tax breaks would delay a pair of unpopular Obamacare levies for two years.\n\nMeanwhile, the spending portion continues to hamstring an Obamacare program that was supposed to protect insurers against heavy losses during the first three years of the program.\n\nMembers said they expected the bills to be posted by midnight Tuesday, though some details trickled out early.\n\nThe package includes funding for workers who responded to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and it would not allow Puerto Rico to leverage U.S. bankruptcy laws, as the island territory navigates its way out of a fiscal morass.\n\nSeveral House Republicans who emerged from a closed-door meeting said the bill amounted to a true compromise that would let them to put a tumultuous year behind them.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s move past 2015 and move on to 2016,\u201d said Rep. John Kline, Ohio Republican.\n\nThe congressman said he planned to support both pillars of the deal, despite his disappointment with the spending portion.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of riders that we had \u2014 a lot of them important to me \u2014 that are not, apparently, going to be in there,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats said they\u2019d already won the biggest fight by preventing Republicans from clamping down on President Obama\u2019s pledge to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees for resettlement in the U.S. in fiscal year 2016.\n\nThe oil exports ban had been a key question throughout Tuesday, as Democrats insisted that any such move be coupled with more action on green energy and a commitment that the U.S. pony up billions of dollars to pay other countries to adjust to global warming.\n\nYet the oil exports ban had been the key question throughout Tuesday, as Democrats insisted on \u2014 and received \u2014 a five-year extension of tax credits for solar- and wind-energy producers.\n\nDemocrats said any boost to the energy sector should be even-handed and in line with vows they made to fight climate change as part of an international accord struck in Paris over the weekend.\n\n\u201cIn negotiations like this you win some, you lose some. Democrats won some, they lost some. We won some, we lost some,\u201d Mr. Ryan, Wisconsin Republican, said earlier in the day at a breakfast hosted by Politico. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re going to get this done.\u201d\n\nWhile House GOP leaders got a head start, Senate leaders planned meetings Wednesday to inform their colleagues about the details, which had been written behind closed doors by a select handful of people.\n\nThe negotiations had taken longer than expected, as both sides grappled with the GOP policy add-ons, or \u201criders,\u201d that attacked various aspects of Mr. Obama\u2019s agenda, while Democrats demanded an end to the federal ban on research into the causes of gun violence.\n\nTop Republicans were already looking ahead to next year, saying they agreed to Democrats\u2019 spending levels for 2017 and will expect them to cooperate earlier next year in writing the dozen spending bills that are supposed to be passed each year to fund the government.\n\nThe process ground to a halt this year after Senate Democrats filibustered, and internal fights within the GOP short-circuited House action.\n\nThat left Congress with the option of a catch-all \u201comnibus,\u201d where all 12 bills are wrapped into a massive measure and lawmakers are forced to take it or leave it \u2014 with the threat of a government shutdown if they don\u2019t approve it.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be doing things like this,\u201d Mr. Ryan said.\n\nThough the deal wouldn\u2019t dent Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to accept more Syrian refugees \u2014 conservatives wanted to pause the program in the wake of the Nov. 13 terror attacks in Paris \u2014 it would tighten up the visa waiver program that now makes it easier for citizens of 38 countries to travel to the U.S., a policy that has much more bipartisan support.\n\nAnother point of contention is the Puerto Rico fiscal crisis. Democrats want to give the territory the power to declare bankruptcy, but Republicans insisted on finding another solution for a $1 billion debt payment due Jan. 1.\n\nThe bill ponies up new funding for the Zadroga Act, a Sept. 11 first-responder health-care bill that was first authorized in 2010 and will expire by the end of the month.\n\nOn the tax side, Democrats wanted to permanently extend the child tax credit, saying families deserved tax relief alongside business interests favored by the GOP.\n\nRepublican members late Tuesday said they already grabbed a two-year delay to Obamacare\u2019s 2.3-percent excise on medical device sales, which took effect in 2013 and would disappear in 2016 and 2017, and its \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on generous health plans offers by some plans.\n\nThe latter levy, which was set to take effect in 2018, has been a key target for both parties, including Democrats who support the Affordable Care Act overall but worry about labor unions\u2019 vociferous opposition to the tax.\n\nThe administration opposes a delay to the Cadillac tax, saying it\u2019s designed to tamp down on overly generous benefits that encourage the overuse of health care, raising costs for everyone.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said the administration objects to lifting the oil exports ban, though he stopped short of saying it would prompt a presidential veto.\n\n\u201cOur position on the export ban is pretty clear. We do not support legislation that would lift it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have also acknowledged that an omnibus bill is going to have to be a compromised proposal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congressional leaders agreed Tuesday to a sweeping deal that would fund the government through October, extend a package of popular tax breaks and lift the decades-old ban on U.S. oil exports -- a key policy win for GOP lawmakers who nonetheless said they didn't get everything they wanted out of the deal.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Congressional leaders agreed Tuesday to a sweeping deal that would fund the government through October, extend a package of popular tax breaks and lift the decades-old ban on U.S. oil exports \u2014 a key policy win for GOP lawmakers who nonetheless said they didn\u2019t get everything they wanted out of the deal.", "title": "Congress closes in on budget deal to fund government", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/15/congress-closes-in-on-budget-deal-to-fund-governme/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/15/12152015_ap-6677977414318201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/15/12152015_ap-6677977414318201.jpg", "description": "Congressional leaders agreed Tuesday to a sweeping deal that would fund the government through October, extend a package of popular tax breaks and lift the decades-old ban on U.S. oil exports -- a key", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress closes in on budget deal to fund government"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr. and Anjali Shastry", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Politics, White House, Republican Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb04\"", "article_summary": "Lawmakers said a parallel deal on tax breaks would delay a pair of unpopular Obamacare levies for two years.\nThe administration opposes a delay to the Cadillac tax, saying it\u2019s designed to tamp down on overly generous benefits that encourage the overuse of health care, raising costs for everyone.\nSeveral House Republicans who emerged from a closed-door meeting said the bill amounted to a true compromise that would let them to put a tumultuous year behind them.\nThe congressman said he planned to support both pillars of the deal, despite his disappointment with the spending portion.\nOn the tax side, Democrats wanted to permanently extend the child tax credit, saying families deserved tax relief alongside business interests favored by the GOP."}
