Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) is not shy in his criticism of President Obama’s abuse of executive power.

The GOP congressman compared Obama to socialist Karl Marx, famous for penning “The Communist Manifesto,” during a conversation with conservative commentator Glenn Beck on his radio program, according to audio captured by BuzzFeed.

“The president has contempt for Congress; he ignores Congress. He has taught the Constitution but he defies his own words,” King alleged. “He hasn’t yet in a clear way defied the courts. If he gets a bad decision — well, one he disagrees with — on Obamacare, if he gets a bad decision on immigration and defies the courts, who knows how the public will respond to this.”

The Iowa congressman said that Obama would reach “emperor status” if he gets away with defying the Supreme Court’s authority.

“His calculation is not what’s true and just and right or even good for America,” King expanded. “It’s how can he exploit his power base and move our country to the left toward the ideology of Karl Marx. How far can he go and get away with it.”

“There’s no conscience involved in this,” he continued. “There’s no sense of duty to the Constitution or his oath to it. He has kicked that completely sideways.”

King went on to declare that voters have been “too apathetic” to Obama’s executive overreach, pointing in particular to the president’s executive action on immigration last November.

“I thought we’d all be ready to surround the White House when the president issued his November 20th orders,” King said.

“We need a new president,” he concluded.
