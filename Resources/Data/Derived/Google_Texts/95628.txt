PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. — Groundhog Day coincides Sunday with the Super Bowl for the first time, but Punxsutawney Phil’s peeps don’t expect the big game to steal his early-morning spotlight.

Rather, the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club expects about 20,000 revelers to gather around Gobbler’s Knob when western Pennsylvania’s world-famous rodent emerges from his lair just after dawn Sunday to “predict” the weather, said executive director Katie Donald.

“We really don’t think it will be too much of a factor for us because Phil does his prognostication so early in the morning and people have all day to get to wherever they’re going to watch it that evening,” McDonald said.

Phil has seen his shadow 100 times and hasn’t seen it 17 times, according to the Groundhog Club’s Inner Circle, the top-hatted gents who handle the animal and translate his forecast. There are no records from many of the early years. Phil has been predicting the weather since 1886.

In Boulder, according to his posted schedule, Flatiron Freddy — a stuffed marmot — will make his annual appearance at 8 a.m. at the Chautauqua Ranger Cottage at 900 Baseline Road.
