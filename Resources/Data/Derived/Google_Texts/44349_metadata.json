(Republican Eagle photo by Joe Brown)\n\nROCHESTER \u2013 Cannon Falls had to run through the gantlet of the best teams in Section 1AA-West. The Bombers already took out No. 3 seed Dover-Eyota and No. 2 seed Byron, and for 24 minutes of Saturday\u2019s West sub-section championship, Cannon Falls was tied with top-seeded Rochester Lourdes.\n\nBut after battling with the sub-section\u2019s best for the past week, the Bombers finally ran out of steam. With the duo of James Ustby and Nick Hanson pounding the ball inside, the Eagles advanced to the section final with a 49-42 victory at the Mayo Civic Auditorium.\n\n\u201cWe were a little bit out of gas,\u201d said Cannon Falls head coach Josh Davisson. \u201cThe guys have played hard the last week-and-a-half, and they competed well today.\u201d\n\nEven with Lourdes controlling the pace of the first half with its strong defense, Cannon Falls managed to nearly go shot-for-shot, trailing 21-18 at the half.\n\n\u201cYou know what to expect with Rochester Lourdes. Against them, you have to take care of the basketball,\u201d Davisson said. \u201cThey make you work for everything you get.\u201d\n\nThe Bombers managed to tie the game at 31-31 with 12 minutes, 25 seconds to play following a three-point play from freshman guard Ryan Dirckx, who had eight of his team-high 12 points in the second half.\n\n\u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t play like a freshman,\u201d Davisson said of Dirckx. \u201cHe\u2019s come a long way this year.\u201d\n\nLourdes\u2019 inside presence proved invaluable in helping the Eagles pull for a 38-33 lead. The Bombers never got closer than four the rest of the way. Ustby provided a game-high 19 points while Hanson scored 15 in the victory.\n\n\u201cThey did a nice job with their roll guys Nick and James. Both guys can get to the hoop when they want to and they\u2019re like a bull in a china shop,\u201d Davisson said. \u201cWe had a hard time matching up with that. They were a little much for us.\u201d\n\nTanner Carlson had 10 points and five rebounds for the Bombers, who finish the year at 10-18 overall. Jordon Flemmons finished with six points. Kyler Banks and Zach Siebenaler each tallied five points, with Banks hauling in four rebounds.\n\n\u201cWe found a path to get here (to the sub-section final), it\u2019s just not the one you\u2019d want to choose,\u201d Davisson said. \u201cCredit to (the players) for not getting down when we were losing earlier in the year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,high school,boys basketball,cannon falls bombers", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Joe Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "ROCHESTER \u2013 Cannon Falls had to run through the gantlet of the best teams in Section 1AA-West.
