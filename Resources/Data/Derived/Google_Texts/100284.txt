MADISON, Wis. -

While many take their driver’s license for granted, there are people who can’t afford the education that goes into getting it.

Jessica Williams at the YWCA helps people like that nearly daily. She says of the several dozen people who have been through her License Recovery program, about 25 percent of them never had a license to begin with.

Madison schools don’t offer driver’s education, and private classes cost upward of $400, so Williams says many teens living in poverty don’t ever go through with them. Then, later, when they’re driving to make it to work or school, the tickets rack up.

"It kind of spirals into - as young adults, people having thousands of dollars in tickets and fines,” she said.

That makes it even harder to get a valid license.

While the program helps many work through the fines with payment programs, Williams says more needs to be done to make drivers education more affordable.
