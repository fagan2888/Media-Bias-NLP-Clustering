Smokers inflict increased expenses overall and expose nonsmokers to a variety of risks. By deciding to quit, the smoker won't pay more or pose a threat to others.\n\nThe year 2015 will see countless smokers fuming as many are expected to pay up to 50% more than non-smokers for the same health plans. As quoted by Obamacarefacts.com, which provides unbiased information on ObamaCare. Government subsidies to assist enrollees are calculated before the \"tobacco surcharges\" are put into effect. What this means for smokers is increased financial pressure making insurance unaffordable for many.\n\nThe terms of the new Affordable Care Act mean that if a smoker continues lighting up, it will cost them more for future health care. The Affordable Care Act prevents insurers from charging people higher premiums for costly health conditions. This benefits patients with serious illnesses, like cancer or diabetes, as they will pay the same fees as healthy people of the same age. However, for the 19% of American adults who smoke: Insurance companies can charge premiums as much as 50 percent higher than what nonsmokers will pay.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg Businessweek who reported that, \"Thus far 10 states, with health plan quotes available for review at this time, have charged smokers at least 15 percent more than non-smokers.\" Although some states, California included, have chosen to reject the surcharges on the grounds that costs to individuals who smoke are an ineffective deterrent given what they already spend on cigarettes or that smoking is a \u201cpre-existing\u201d condition. Many states are imposing a premium on smokers, and so far, at least 8 states plan to charge the maximum 50%.\n\nOn May 16th, 2013, a Bloomberg Businessweek article pointed out that those individuals obtaining insurance through their employers might be facing additional fees from their employers by way of \u201cwellness screenings.\u201d This serves as a means of assessing those whose behaviors are unhealthy and raise the costs of group policies for their employers. Such anti-smoker policies are reflected by CVS Caremark Corporation, who in March 2013 announced that \u201ctheir employees would have to submit to yearly health screenings or pay $50 more a month for insurance.\u201d The Washington Post reported on February 5th, CVS also announced earlier this month that they would remove all cigarettes and tobacco products from their shelves, suffering a $2 billion dollar annual loss in sales. CVS expressed that it\u2019s something the company felt necessary as they work to reduce any negative influences that might affect their direct relationship with the pharmaceutical and health care industries. In essence, keep lighting up\u2026 and you'll pay up.\n\nCorporate Information\n\nFreedom Laser Therapy, established in 2003, has treated tens of thousands of smokers and helped them overcome their nicotine addiction.
