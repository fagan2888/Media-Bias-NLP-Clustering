(The Blue Devils covered, losing by the mere margin of 52-22.)\n\nPurely for entertainment purposes, OddsShark.com tracks team\u2019s betting archives in a database going back to 1996. In those 20 years of records, Clemson has won all 14 games in which it was a 30-point favorite home or on the road, but is 7-7 against the spread.\n\nAs far as being a double-digit favorite on the road, Clemson is 17-2 straight-up. The Tigers stumbled 24-21 at Maryland on Oct. 3, 2009 (as a 12.5-point favorite) and lost 16-13 at Duke on Nov. 13, 2004 as a 12-point favorite.\n\nSince the 2000 game at Duke, Clemson had not closed as a 20-point favorite on the road until last season at Wake Forest, a game which Clemson won 34-20 behind then-quarterback Cole Stoudt.\n\nAnd one last point spread note: this is the first ACC opponent that has served as a 30-point underdog to Clemson since Maryland in 2012. The time before that? Maryland, in 2000. Both those games were at Memorial Stadium, and the Tigers won them by 35 (\u201812) and 21 (\u201800.)\n\nAll that matters to the Tigers, of course, is victory, and not margin of victory. Two years ago in their previous trip to the Carrier Dome, the Tigers racked up 283 yards in the first quarter alone (allowing 35 on defense) and led 21-0.\n\nThe roster turnover has been dramatic since that day 25 months ago. Only three Clemson starters on Oct. 3, 2013 \u2013 center Ryan Norton, tight end Stanton Seckinger and then-safety Travis Blanks \u2013 are still on the team, and a total of 18 players who checked into the 2013 game are on the travel roster.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "One Hour to Kickoff: Clemson favored by more than four touchdowns at Syracuse, Clemson, \r\nClemsonFP LatestNews, \r\nVideos, \r\nBlogs, \r\nTiger Tracks, \r\nTiger Tracks, Clemson-Syracuse,Ray-Ray McCloud,Ryan Norton,Stanton Seckinger,Travis Blanks,Trevion Thompson,Tyrone Crowder", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "SYRACUSE, N.Y. \u2013 Few, if any, sane prognosticators believe Clemson will leave its unbeaten record in central New York today.", "title": "One Hour to Kickoff: Clemson favored by more than four touchdowns at Syracuse", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151114/151119545/one-hour-to-kickoff-clemson-favored-by-more-than-four-touchdowns-at-syracuse", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151114/PC0312/151119545/AR/0/AR-151119545.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151114/PC0312/151119545/AR/0/AR-151119545.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "SYRACUSE, N.Y. \u2013 Few, if any, sane prognosticators believe Clemson will leave its unbeaten record in central New York today.", "title": "One Hour to Kickoff: Clemson favored by more than four touchdowns at Syracuse", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151114/PC0312/151119545/AR/0/AR-151119545.jpg?201511141437", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151119545}}, "keywords": "One Hour to Kickoff: Clemson favored by more than four touchdowns at Syracuse , Clemson, \r\nClemsonFP LatestNews, \r\nVideos, \r\nBlogs, \r\nTiger Tracks, \r\nTiger Tracks, Clemson-Syracuse,Ray-Ray McCloud,Ryan Norton,Stanton Seckinger,Travis Blanks,Trevion Thompson,Tyrone Crowder", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-14T14:10:23Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-14T14:37:00Z", "author": "Aaron Brenner"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "SYRACUSE, N.Y. \u2013 Few, if any, sane prognosticators believe Clemson will leave its unbeaten record in central New York today."}, "article_summary": "Both those games were at Memorial Stadium, and the Tigers won them by 35 (\u201812) and 21 (\u201800.)\nAs far as being a double-digit favorite on the road, Clemson is 17-2 straight-up.\nSince the 2000 game at Duke, Clemson had not closed as a 20-point favorite on the road until last season at Wake Forest, a game which Clemson won 34-20 behind then-quarterback Cole Stoudt.\nThe top-ranked Tigers are a 30.5-point favorite over host Syracuse today, the largest point spread by which Clemson has been favored in a road game since Sept. 30, 2000, when the Tigers were favored by 36.5 points at Duke.\nSYRACUSE, N.Y. \u2013 Few, if any, sane prognosticators believe Clemson will leave its unbeaten record in central New York today."}
