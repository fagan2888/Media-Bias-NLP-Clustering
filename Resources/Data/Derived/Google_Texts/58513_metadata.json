He is driving a 2012 white Suzuki sedan with Pennsylvania license plate HPL4745, police said.\n\nKathleen Davidson, 64, said her husband is diabetic. He uses a cane because half of one foot has been removed and three toes have been removed from the other foot, she said. He failed to take his medications or walker with him, she said.\n\nJames Davidson received some bad news from his doctor Monday, his wife said. She declined to provide specifics.\n\nWhen he got home, he said he was going on a trip Tuesday.\n\nDavidson went as planned to visit her daughter in Washington. They decided to return to talk James Davidson out of the trip. When they arrived, he and Alli were gone.\n\nPolice stopped Davidson in Gainesville, Fla., Wednesday morning. They did not detain him because he was not reported missing until later that day.\n\n\u201cI waited until Wednesday (to) give him time to call us, thinking he's been on the road, maybe he'll call,\u201d Kathleen Davidson said.\n\nShe believes he might be heading possibly to the Everglades to release Alli.\n\nHer husband bought the gator at a reptile show in Waynesburg a few years ago, and he had mentioned returning the gator to the wild.\n\nThey have frequently visited the Everglades, but the release plan is \u201conly what we're assuming,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI hope Alli's playing in the water somewhere and that he's heading back,\u201d she said.\n\nDavidson said her husband owned his own veterinary practice in Uniontown for 35 years. He used to bring animals home for care, and he once patched a seagull's wing and put a cast on a fawn's leg.\n\nShe said James Davidson had two baby alligators \u2014 Bonnie and Clyde \u2014 flown from New Orleans to Pennsylvania several years ago, nursed them back to health and released them in North Carolina.\n\nAnyone with information can call state police Trooper Thomas Carter at 724-439-7111.\n\nKari Andren is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
