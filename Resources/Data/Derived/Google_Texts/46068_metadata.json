Rather, the development of complex life might not have hinged on rising levels of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThough life remains a mystery, a small sea sponge found in a Danish fjord has overturned one of science\u2019s most basic presumptions about our genesis \u2014 the need for modern levels of oxygen in the earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nRather, some forms of animal life on the planet may develop and grow in environments with only 0.5 percent of the oxygen found in today\u2019s atmosphere. For many years, scientists had thought that newly gushing supplies of oxygen on a changing planet had spurred the development of complex life some 630-635 million years ago. Rather, the development of life beyond single-cell organisms might have occurred even without the terrestrial metamorphosis.\n\n\"Our studies suggest that the origin of animals was not prevented by low oxygen levels,\u201d Daniel Mills, of University of Southern Denmark, said in a statement. \"But nobody has ever tested how much oxygen animals need \u2014 at least not to my knowledge. Therefore we decided to find out.\u201d\n\nA small common sea sponge may have changed minds about the beginning of life with regard to requirements for oxygen. Mills\n\nMills and a colleague from the California Institute of Technology chose to study the common sea sponge for its similarity to simpler forms of life during that time. \u201cWhen we placed the sponges in our lab, they continued to breathe and grow even when the oxygen levels reached 0.5 percent of present day atmospheric levels,\u201d Mills said.\n\nHowever, the study leaves a big question now for other scientists. Assuming the development of complex life had nothing to do with rising levels of oxygen in the Earth\u2019s past, scientists are left with a big question. Why did life on earth for billions of years consist only of single-celled bacteria and amoebae, before a sudden start?\n\n\"There must have been other ecological and evolutionary mechanisms at play. Maybe life remained microbial for so long because it took a while to develop the biological machinery required to construct an animal. Perhaps the ancient Earth lacked animals because complex, many-celled bodies are simply hard to evolve,\u201d Mills said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "complex life, development of complex life and oxygen, complex life and oxygen, life and low-oxygen", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A small sea sponge found off the coast of Denmark might have just overturned one of science's basic presumptions about the beginning of complex life on Earth.", "title": "Small Sea Sponge Shows Complex Life Doesn't Require Much Oxygen", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sea-sponge-shows-complex-life-doesnt-require-high-oxygen-levels-survive-269499", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/17/adamandsteve.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A small sea sponge found off the coast of Denmark might have just overturned one of science's basic presumptions about the beginning of complex life on Earth.", "title": "Small Sea Sponge Shows Complex Life Doesn't Require Much Oxygen", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/sea-sponge-shows-complex-life-doesnt-require-high-oxygen-levels-survive-269499", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/17/adamandsteve.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/17/adamandsteve.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-02-17T18:03:25-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-17T18:04:03-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A small sea sponge found off the coast of Denmark might have just overturned one of science's basic presumptions about the beginning of complex life on Earth."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfbb\"", "article_summary": "Rather, the development of complex life might not have hinged on rising levels of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.\nA small sea sponge might have just overturned a major presumption.\n\u201cWhen we placed the sponges in our lab, they continued to breathe and grow even when the oxygen levels reached 0.5 percent of present day atmospheric levels,\u201d Mills said.\nTherefore we decided to find out.\u201dA small common sea sponge may have changed minds about the beginning of life with regard to requirements for oxygen.\nAssuming the development of complex life had nothing to do with rising levels of oxygen in the Earth\u2019s past, scientists are left with a big question."}
