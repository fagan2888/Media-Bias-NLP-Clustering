Only 19% of American part- and full-time employees are concerned about being laid off, a 10% improvement from last year, according to a Gallup survey.

Though the survey showed consistent improvement this year in each category of career worries, they still have not returned to the low worry-levels of before the recession in 2008.

As of August 7-10, 2014 when this survey was issued, the biggest worry of American employees was having their benefits reduced.

Thirty-four percent of respondents were worried about benefit changes, down from an average of 42% from 2009-2013 and up from an average of 30% from 1997-2008.

Another common worry from 24% of U.S. employees was that their wages may be reduced. The average number of people who worried about losing wages from 2009-2013 was higher (30%), but from 1997-2008 the average number was lower (16%).

Losing hours was another concern for 23% of respondents. From 2009-2013 an average of 27% of American workers worried about getting their hours cut. The average number of American workers who worried about losing work hours from 1997-2008 was 14%.

Though getting laid off was the least worried about topic for respondents, the results varied by age.

Younger employees (18- to 34-year-olds) were more worried about being laid off, with 29% of younger respondents expressing concern about losing their jobs compared to 15% of 35- to 54-year-olds and 13% of respondents 55 years old and older.

In almost every category of the Gallup survey, the younger employees were the most concerned about their careers. The only category that the 18- to 34-year-olds were not the most concerned about was having their benefits reduced.

The 35- to 54-year-olds were the most worried about losing benefits, with 40% of respondents in that age bracket worrying about potential benefit loss.
