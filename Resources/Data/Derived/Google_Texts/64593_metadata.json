At worst, they're considered health freaks. Unless there is something visibly jarring about their appearance, their healthy habits are rarely a cause for concern \u2014 but they should be. These behaviors, as well as overeating, may be hallmark signs of someone who suffers from disordered eating.\n\nDieting or an otherwise preoccupation with food and weight is nothing new. Some might say those who do it aspire others to live a healthier lifestyle. However, innocent attempts at eating healthfully can lead to disordered eating behaviors that don\u2019t necessarily fall under anorexia or bulimia nervosa \u2014 two of the most common forms of eating disorders. Full-blown conditions are relatively easier to spot than more subtle forms of abnormal eating patterns. While eating disorders can arise from a variety of causes, dieting and even excessive exercising are usually precursors to this dangerous condition. So, when does this obsession with healthy eating become a major health concern?\n\nA slippery slope\n\nDisordered eating\u2014 a descriptive phrase, not a diagnosis \u2014 is marked by restrictive eating patterns, including restrained dieting, yo-yo dieting, diet pill use, skipping meals and the act of abstaining from major food groups such as fats or carbohydrates, according to the National Eating Disorders Collaboration. These habits may not be severe enough to be labeled an eating disorder, but it's still a slippery slope.\n\nIn a 2008 survey, SELF found that 60 percent of American women between the ages of 25 and 45 have had some unhealthy thoughts, feelings or behaviors related to food or their bodies. Psychology Today reports that up to 50 percent of the U.S. population have had some disordered relationship with food, body and exercise. Society\u2019s diet mentality, or inclinication to bombard people with the next best fad diet and generally unsolicited weight loss advice, contributes to the rise of disordered eating and eating disorders, Elyse Resch, co-author of Intuitive Eating, told Medical Daily. In fact, she argues that dieting in and of it self is disordered eating.\n\n\u201cAnything that takes you away from your body\u2019s signals of hunger and fullness is disordered eating,\u201d Resch said. \u201cAnything that\u2019s externalized where you\u2019re not listening to your body\u2019s wisdom about when you\u2019re hungry, what you really want to eat, how your body feels, your choice of food and when you\u2019re full is disordered eating.\u201d She even goes as far as to compare compulsive exercise to purging, saying people who frequently work out are \u201cbasically getting rid of calories,\u201d which is similar to bulimia.\n\nShared, but different criteria\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for anorexia includes persistent restriction of food or energy intake leading to low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and denial of the seriousness of their low body weight. The criteria for bulimia include episodes of binge eating followed by self-induced vomiting at least once a week. People with abnormal eating behaviors who don\u2019t fit either of these categories, or the recently identified binge eating disorder, are usually tossed into the \"other specific feeding or eating disorders\" (OSFEDS) category.\n\nAs stated earlier, this kind of behavior often starts off as a way to lose pounds or get in shape, but it can lead to rigid eating and exercise habits that jeopardize one\u2019s health. The term disordered eating covers a wide range of abnormal eating behaviors that are shared with diagnosed eating conditions, but it does \u201cnot warrant a diagnosis of a specific eating disorder.\" This is primarily due to the lower severity and frequency level, according to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND). That said, similar to the diagnostic criteria for anorexia and bulimia nervosa, disordered eating-patients must meet specific criteria in order to receive an official diagnosis. The line between restrictive or disordered eating and eating disorders is blurry, but it seems the only way to discern between the two is to determine whether or not someone\u2019s symptoms align with the diagnostic criteria as defined by the APA, the AND said.\n\nIt\u2019s all on a continuum, Resch said, but eating disorders take it to the extreme and have dangerous side effects, including death.\n\nSeek help either way\n\nAlthough it's not considered as severe as an eating disorder, disordered eating comes with several adverse health outcomes, including gastrointestinal disturbances, fluid imbalances, low heart rate and blood pressure, and increased anxiety and depression, according to the AND.\n\nSome research suggests people are predisposed to unhealthy eating patterns, tracing anorexia and overeating back to the brain. This means brain stimulation could soon be a viable treatment option for at-risk people. But until researchers confirm their hypothesis, there are effective treatments in place for both conditions.\n\nFor people suffering from disordered eating, Resch suggests talk therapy, preferably \"with someone who understands the dangers of dieting\" and is against the diet mentality. And for those who find themselves over the line, the National Eating Disorders Association suggests psychotherapy or psychological counseling. So far, it's proven to be one of the most effective and long-lasting treatments for eating disorders.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "blurry, line, between, disordered, eating, and, eating, disorders, when, does, one, become, other", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "They're similar conditions, but experts believe disordered eating is a precursor to a full-blown disorder.", "title": "The Blurry Line Between Disordered Eating And Eating Disorders", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/disordered-eating-eating-disorders-differences-diagnostic-criteria-381271", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/09/belly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "They're similar conditions, but experts believe disordered eating is a precursor to a full-blown disorder.", "title": "The Blurry Line Between Disordered Eating And Eating Disorders", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/disordered-eating-eating-disorders-differences-diagnostic-criteria-381271", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/09/belly.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/09/belly.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2016-04-10T13:31:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-10T13:31:55-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "They're similar conditions, but experts believe disordered eating is a precursor to a full-blown disorder."}, "article_summary": "However, innocent attempts at eating healthfully can lead to disordered eating behaviors that don\u2019t necessarily fall under anorexia or bulimia nervosa \u2014 two of the most common forms of eating disorders.\nThe term disordered eating covers a wide range of abnormal eating behaviors that are shared with diagnosed eating conditions, but it does \u201cnot warrant a diagnosis of a specific eating disorder.\"\nAnd for those who find themselves over the line, the National Eating Disorders Association suggests psychotherapy or psychological counseling.\nPeople with abnormal eating behaviors who don\u2019t fit either of these categories, or the recently identified binge eating disorder, are usually tossed into the \"other specific feeding or eating disorders\" (OSFEDS) category.\n\u201cAnything that takes you away from your body\u2019s signals of hunger and fullness is disordered eating,\u201d Resch said."}
