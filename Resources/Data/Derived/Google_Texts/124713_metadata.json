In fact, he's interested in working with Democrats to improve the law, rather than repeal it outright.\n\nDavid Perdue, the former CEO of Dollar General, was critical of Dodd-Frank Wednesday at a Thomas County Republican Party meeting, claiming it prevents banks from lending.\n\n\u201cI could not borrow money from my local bank like I used to, just for operating capital,\u201d Perdue said, according to the Thomasville Times-Enterprise.\n\nBut Perdue told voters at a Coweta County Republican meeting in January that he would work with Democrats to reform Dodd-Frank rather than repeal it, according ABC News.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to go up there and tell you I\u2019m going to repeal Dodd-Frank,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cI will tell you I\u2019m going to fight to amend it. And to do that, I think I can find some Democratic senators who will join in with logic and be led into a reasonable solution.\u201d\n\nAs ABC News noted, Perdue's plan on Dodd-Frank stands out in the state's crowded Republican primary and among Republicans nationally. The three Republican members of Georgia's congressional delegation who are running in the primary -- Reps. Paul Broun, Phil Gingrey and Jack Kingston -- all want to repeal the law. The GOP's 2012 presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, promised to \"repeal and replace\" the Wall Street reform law if elected.\n\nPerdue has campaigned as a conservative but has attacked his opponents for their unwillingness to work across the aisle. At the January meeting, Perdue emphasized his experience in business as evidence he can get things done in Washington.\n\n\"Generating real revenue teaches you how to collaborate without giving away your principles. The problem with the Republican Party says, 'Well, wait a minute. If you talk to anyone on the other side that means you\u2019re giving up your principles,'\" Perdue said.\n\nWorking with Democrats on issues like Dodd-Frank is the only way to improve policy, according to Perdue. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way out of this box, frankly,\" he said. \"This gridlock is not working. We've proven that. And just saying no doesn't work either, by the way.\"\n\nWhile Perdue intends to work with Democrats on the Wall Street reform law, he is campaigning for a \"full repeal\" of the Affordable Care Act -- despite having argued for a federal solution to the nation's high uninsured rate when he was a corporate executive.\n\nA poll released Wednesday by SurveyUSA found Perdue leading the Republican primary field, though the race may go a runoff. Michelle Nunn, the daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), will likely be the Democratic nominee.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: U.S. State Capitol Buildings U.S. State Capitol Buildings\n\n1 of 50 Alabama State Capitol (Montgomery, Ala.)
