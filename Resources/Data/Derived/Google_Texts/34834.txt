The assistant band director for Columbus High School has been found dead in a dorm room on the Mississippi University for Women campus.

Lowndes County Coroner Greg Merchant says 32-year-old Leshawn Dewayne Orr was found dead in a dormitory room at Columbus Hall. The Commercial Dispatch reports (http://bit.ly/1lnbR2c ) Orr's body was discovered by a friend at about 5 p.m. Monday.

Merchant says Orr, who had been sick for several days prior to his death, died of natural causes but wouldn't elaborate further. He says an autopsy would not be conducted.

MUW officials say Orr started classes in January and was pursuing an undergraduate degree in English.

Columbus Municipal School District interim superintendent Edna McGill says Orr had worked for the district since August 2012.
