Scientific Games Corp., a gambling and lottery company based in Las Vegas, will promote Michael Quartieri to finance chief after it files its year-end regulatory filings. He will succeed Scott Schweinfurth, after having joined the company last month as controller. He was previously the accounting chief and controller for casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp. Mr. Quartieri will receive a salary of $600,000 in his new role, with an opportunity for a bonus of up to 75% of that based on achieving financial targets. He could earn double that if the company hits its “maximum level performance goals.”

Mr. Seidel was most recently CAO of Five Star, which is a former subsidiary of Senior Housing. An investor relations spokeswoman for both companies didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
