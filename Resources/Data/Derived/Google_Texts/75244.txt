Detectives arrested five men Friday for soliciting lewd acts in Saddle Creek Park in Lakeland, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said.

The sheriff’s office said it conducted an undercover operation after recent complaints about indecent activity going on in the park.

Michael Seawell, 54, of Lakeland, Eric Witte, 50, of Riverview, James Dudley Fretwell, 70, of Lakeland, Dennis Hice, 55, of Lakeland and Thomas Bly, 53, of Lakeland, were arrested during the operation.

Seawell was charged with soliciting another to commit a lewd act after he was observed rubbing his crotch in a lewd manner, and solicited an undercover detective to commit a lewd act, deputies said. Detectives said Seawell told them he is a terminal manager at CSX and was on duty at the time.

Witte was charged with soliciting another to commit lewdness, second offense, after he solicited an undercover detective to commit a lewd act in a park bathroom, deputies said. He told detectives he is a cook with the Merchant Marines.

Fretwell was charged with soliciting another to commit a lewd act after he solicited an undercover detective, deputies said.

Hice was charged with soliciting another to commit a lewd act after he solicited an undercover detective out in the open, deputies said. Hice told detectives he is married and works for Publix Corporate, and that he volunteers at the Lakeland Public Library and Circle B Bar Reserve.

Bly was charged with soliciting another to commit lewdness and indecent exposure in public after he solicited an undercover detective out in the open and exposed himself to the detective. Bly told detectives he works at Florida Southern College as a groundskeeper.

All five of the men were booked into the Polk County Jail.
