ILIFF â€” Students at Caliche Elementary School celebrated their final day of school before Christmas break with a "Polar Express" Day Friday.

Students and staff came to school dressed in their pajamas, ready for a day full of fun holiday activities.

The day started with a train scavenger hunt throughout the school. Each group of students had to find parts of their eight piece train using clues given to them. As they were searching for clues, the groups had to walk around as a train and take pieces to the gym.

Additionally, each child created a silhouette of themselves, which now line the halls of the school in the form of a train.

Following lunch, the students got to watch "The Polar Express" movie. During intermission everyone enjoyed hot chocolate and after the move was finished, each child found a bell on their desk to signify "they believe," like in the movie.
