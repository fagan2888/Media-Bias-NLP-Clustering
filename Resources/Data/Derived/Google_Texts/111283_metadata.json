It is noon on Saturday, and everyone \u2014 coders, press and staffers \u2014 is getting restless.\n\nRestless enough that MSNBC\u2019s Ronan Farrow spots an acoustic guitar leaning against a wall, and begins playing an impromptu sing-along a couple of feet away from a life-size Rand Paul cardboard cutout. The set list includes Taylor Swift and Avril Lavigne. Campaign staff and press folks gather around to watch, but most of the hackathon participants stay put. They eased into the zone.\n\n.@RonanFarrow making a Rand Paul campaign event feel like Jewish summer camp pic.twitter.com/AQIIiI1iwk \u2014 noah kulwin (@nkulw) June 27, 2015\n\nIt should be said up front that Rand Paul hates net neutrality. He has taken a position of deafening silence on same-sex marriage and so-called \u201creligious freedom\u201d laws, and he believes that the Uber-endorsed Affordable Care Act will send America into economic ruin. These are not views shared by most of Silicon Valley, whose most prominent figures gravitate toward elite Democratic circles.\n\nPaul, the junior Republican senator from Kentucky, is also perhaps Congress\u2019s best-known advocate against bulk NSA surveillance. You might remember his 11-hour filibuster last month in protest of the Patriot Act, or his condemnation of the prison system as \u201cthe new Jim Crow.\u201d He has also introduced criminal justice reform legislation with New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker, and he is attached to a pro-medical marijuana bill. He likes to talk up his libertarian-leaning brand of conservatism, an earthier version of the traditional \u201cless government is better government\u201d Republican line.\n\nThese innovation-friendly, anti-establishment politics, so the thinking goes, play well in Silicon Valley. Virtually everyone at #HackForRand brings up privacy rights and the NSA within ten seconds of explaining why they\u2019re here, and the goal of the hackathon \u2014 a 24-hour marathon competition of programming judged by a three-person panel \u2014 is to work on building an app that advances \u201cliberty and privacy.\u201d The \u201cliberty and privacy\u201d directive comes from Ron Schnell, the CTO of Rand Paul\u2019s campaign, whose job it is to build a tech-soaked Republican political machine that even Silicon Valley can get behind.\n\n\u201cI know all of you care about privacy, and that\u2019s why the theme of this hackathon is privacy and liberty,\u201d Schnell, also a competition judge, told the couple-dozen attendees as the event kicked off. \u201cWe know the Valley cares a lot about privacy, we don\u2019t want to see the government building backdoors into our systems.\u201d\n\nI asked Schnell how he plans to build a tech-minded campaign around a candidate whose politics aren\u2019t in alignment with much of the tech industry on issues like, say, net neutrality.\n\n\u201cBeing tech-savvy and against net neutrality are not opposed,\u201d Schnell said. \u201cWhen Rand talks to people, he talks about something tech people can relate to, which is that you don\u2019t want the FCC in control of the Internet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a sentiment shared by the self-described \u201cfiercely libertarian\u201d Elissa Shevinsky, one of the hackathon judges, CEO of Jekudo Privacy Company and a member of Rand Paul\u2019s tech advisory council.\n\n\u201cThe hackathon is non-partisan. Not necessarily Democrat or Republican, but about liberty and privacy.\u201d\n\nOkay, sure. But why Paul specifically? What makes him a palatable alternative to other candidates?\n\n\u201cHe has tremendous integrity,\u201d Shevinsky continued. \u201cOrdinary politicians, their point of view seems to be determined by polling. Rand Paul is guided by a consistent ethics; his stand on the NSA was admirable.\u201d\n\nMany of the hackathon participants, a dude-heavy mishmash of high schoolers, college students and other coding enthusiasts, also feel the Rand love, albeit less acutely. For example, Team Electorep \u2014 incoming Georgia Tech freshman Sujeeth Jinesh, UC Davis student David Chen and UC Santa Cruz student Nathan Mueller \u2014 all agreed that Rand Paul is pretty chill, but the opportunity to hone their skills is primarily why they\u2019re here.\n\n\u201cHackathons are really fun to come to, it\u2019s a fun way to spend the weekend. You always learn a lot of new things about coding, and for someone who works as a programmer that\u2019s really helpful,\u201d Muller said. \u201cEven if you don\u2019t win, it\u2019s really cool to be able to build something that could be really useful.\u201d\n\nThe troika built a tool to assist constituents in figuring out the positions of their elected representatives, the kind of project that could just as easily come from places like the EFF or the Sunlight Foundation. Working under signs on the wall blaring slogans like \u201cUNLEASH THE AMERICAN DREAM\u201d and \u201cDEFEAT THE WASHINGTON MACHINE,\u201d the team was optimistic that events like this one can draw out other young programmers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wanna speak for everyone, but a lot of the people I\u2019m near are libertarian. They have, say, a pro-choice view, but they also love hacking,\u201d Jinesh told me. \u201cAnd then they\u2019re going to turn 18, and they\u2019re going to vote in 2016, and I\u2019ve gone to hackathons with them, and I feel like it would be really effective for a young audience.\u201d\n\nOn the whole, the #HackForRand attendees skewed pretty young. They also skewed almost uniformly male, white and, given that the event was held during the weekend of San Francisco Pride, the day after the Supreme Court\u2019s historic marriage ruling \u2013probably pretty straight, too.\n\nLibertarian hacker fuel pic.twitter.com/PZSacN4Ulb \u2014 noah kulwin (@nkulw) June 27, 2015\n\nAlmost 24 hours after Farrow\u2019s summer-camp-style serenade, the hackathon teams were in the home stretch. Empty cans of Rockstar were everywhere and a lightly touched spread of Noah\u2019s Bagels was located thoughtfully on a central table. Everyone looked tired, but it appeared no one had fallen asleep on a keyboard. Eventually the third and final judge arrived, TechCrunch writer Alex Wilhelm, and the pitches began.\n\nEach team gave a roughly two-minute spiel on how their project advanced either liberty and/or privacy. The projects included a Twitter bot that tracked when politicians\u2019 positions changed on their websites, an app called Ballot that helps voters make decisions in the booth and a campaign contribution system that didn\u2019t rely on passwords.\n\nAfter a brief recess, the judges announced the winners. First, Schnell went over the prizes: The first-place team would be whisked away to an undisclosed location (later on, someone told me Monterey) to meet the Senator in person, and both first- and second-place winners would receive copies of the Constitution signed by Rand Paul himself (also presumably signed by the Founding Fathers). Then, after congratulating the attendees one last time, Schnell announced the results.\n\nThe grand prize went to Team Checkmate, a trio of French aerospace software engineers who had driven up from Orange County the day before. Schnell said their secure payments system, a nifty tool that uses biometric authentication (i.e. a fingerprint) instead of a password, couldn\u2019t be used on the Paul campaign because of regulations. Still, he and the other two judges were impressed with the \u201cinnovative\u201d hack.\n\nAlthough he had spent the previous night in a motel room with a couple other folks, Team Checkmate\u2019s Julien Brissonneau was proud and excited as he spoke about why he believed in technology as a political tool.\n\n\u201cIt demonstrates how to rely on the individual dream and individual initiative, that innovation is the blood of the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish every politician was for organizing such events. The tech world has a lot to offer.\u201d\n\nUnsolicited, Brissonneau asked if I\u2019d like to hear his thoughts on the Uber-France tumult. I said sure.\n\n\u201cThe Uber riots were very sad, how some people don\u2019t understand the opportunities the world of tomorrow has to offer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#ed2b23", "description": "The goal of the 24-hour programming competition, judged by a three-person panel, is to build an app that advances \"liberty and privacy.\"", "author": "Noah Kulwin", "og": {"site_name": "Recode", "description": "The goal of the 24-hour programming competition, judged by a three-person panel, is to build an app that advances \"liberty and privacy.\"", "title": "Coding for Liberty: On the Ground at Rand Paul's Presidential Hackathon", "url": "http://www.recode.net/2015/6/29/11563954/coding-for-liberty-on-the-ground-at-rand-pauls-presidential-hackathon", "image": "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cYuIwqp_LdiA6Ke_aWyb29qvMCE=/0x120:1280x840/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49525955/img_4122.0.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The goal of the 24-hour programming competition, judged by a three-person panel, is to build an app that advances \"liberty and privacy.\"", "title": "Coding for Liberty: On the Ground at Rand Paul's Presidential Hackathon", "url": "http://www.recode.net/2015/6/29/11563954/coding-for-liberty-on-the-ground-at-rand-pauls-presidential-hackathon", "image": {"src": "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cYuIwqp_LdiA6Ke_aWyb29qvMCE=/0x120:1280x840/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49525955/img_4122.0.jpeg"}, "site": "Recode", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-29", "sailthru.title": "Coding for Liberty: On the Ground at Rand Paul's Presidential Hackathon", "fb": {"app_id": 186672874861631}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6397045/recode_favicon-144.0.png", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-29T14:39:45Z"}, "sailthru.tags": "general,recode", "google-site-verification": "hjxK0n4cwDZzIl6phvogE8im4UEcc5HKC14Tl5HI-Jk", "style-tools": "/style/544b8f43cb1469523be0f2c1310c5b15/tools.css", "sailthru.description": "The goal of the 24-hour programming competition, judged by a three-person panel, is to build an app that advances \"liberty and privacy.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1436\"", "article_summary": "@RonanFarrow making a Rand Paul campaign event feel like Jewish summer camp pic.twitter.com/AQIIiI1iwk \u2014 noah kulwin (@nkulw) June 27, 2015It should be said up front that Rand Paul hates net neutrality.\n#HackForRand, the first-ever hackathon of Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign, is running late.\na fingerprint) instead of a password, couldn\u2019t be used on the Paul campaign because of regulations.\nRestless enough that MSNBC\u2019s Ronan Farrow spots an acoustic guitar leaning against a wall, and begins playing an impromptu sing-along a couple of feet away from a life-size Rand Paul cardboard cutout.\nRand Paul is guided by a consistent ethics; his stand on the NSA was admirable.\u201dMany of the hackathon participants, a dude-heavy mishmash of high schoolers, college students and other coding enthusiasts, also feel the Rand love, albeit less acutely."}
