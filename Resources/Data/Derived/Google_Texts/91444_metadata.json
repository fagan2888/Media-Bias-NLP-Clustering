It also re\u00adpeals the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act\u2019s Pre\u00adven\u00adtion and Pub\u00adlic Health fund, which saves about $12 bil\u00adlion, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to seni\u00ador com\u00admit\u00adtee staff.\n\nThe Ways and Means bill elim\u00adin\u00adates ma\u00adjor pieces of the ACA, ren\u00adder\u00ading it es\u00adsen\u00adtially moot. In\u00adcluded are re\u00adpeals of all of Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans\u2019 most-hated pieces of the law: the in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal man\u00addate, the em\u00adploy\u00ader man\u00addate, the med\u00adic\u00adal-device tax, the \u201cCa\u00addillac\u201d tax on high-cost health care plans, and the In\u00adde\u00adpend\u00adent Pay\u00adment Ad\u00advis\u00adory Board.\n\nA third House com\u00admit\u00adtee, Edu\u00adca\u00adtion and Work\u00adforce, will also con\u00adtrib\u00adute a piece to the re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation pack\u00adage. The two Sen\u00adate com\u00admit\u00adtees with jur\u00adis\u00addic\u00adtion are Fin\u00adance and Health, Edu\u00adca\u00adtion, Labor and Pen\u00adsions.\n\n\u201cWe \u2026 will take steps to pro\u00adtect tax\u00adpay\u00ader dol\u00adlars from pro\u00adgrams and or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtions that do not live up to the stand\u00adards and pri\u00ador\u00adit\u00adies of the Amer\u00adic\u00adan people,\u201d said En\u00adergy and Com\u00admerce Chair\u00adman Fred Up\u00adton in a state\u00adment. \u201cAs this com\u00admit\u00adtee con\u00adtin\u00adues to in\u00advest\u00adig\u00adate Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood and its af\u00adfil\u00adi\u00adates, the flow of tax\u00adpay\u00ader dol\u00adlars should end.\u201d\n\nBudget rules al\u00adlow for a re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation bill to con\u00adtain mul\u00adtiple pro\u00advi\u00adsions in dif\u00adfer\u00adent areas, as long as they all fall with\u00adin the jur\u00adis\u00addic\u00adtion of the five rel\u00adev\u00adant com\u00admit\u00adtees.\n\nSev\u00ader\u00adal steps of the re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation pro\u00adcess re\u00admain, but it seems that as the dust is set\u00adtling, the the fu\u00adture is be\u00adcom\u00ading more clear: Con\u00adgress will pass a con\u00adtinu\u00ading res\u00adol\u00adu\u00adtion that funds both the gov\u00adern\u00adment and Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood un\u00adtil Decem\u00adber, and then at some point it will pass a bill that both re\u00adpeals ma\u00adjor pieces of the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act and de\u00adfunds Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood. Obama, of course, will veto the bill.\n\nSpe\u00adcif\u00adics aside, the pro\u00adced\u00adur\u00adal tool will be used as a way for con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans to gain a small, if largely sym\u00adbol\u00adic, vic\u00adtory after a long sum\u00admer of fall\u00ading on the los\u00ading side of in\u00adtense par\u00adtis\u00adan de\u00adbates in the health care arena. If all goes ac\u00adcord\u00ading to plan, it will al\u00adlow the GOP to point to con\u00adcrete ex\u00adamples of what it has done as the ma\u00adjor\u00adity party in both cham\u00adbers of Con\u00adgress, but also of what could be\u00adcome law un\u00adder a new pres\u00adid\u00adent with dif\u00adfer\u00adent val\u00adues in 2017.\n\nRe\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation first be\u00adcame a sub\u00adject of fierce de\u00adbate as Con\u00adgress waited for the Su\u00adpreme Court to de\u00adcide King v. Bur\u00adwell, a case chal\u00adlen\u00adging sub\u00adsidies giv\u00aden un\u00adder the ACA on fed\u00ader\u00adal ex\u00adchanges. Had the Court ruled against the Obama ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion, it would have blown a hole in the law and threatened the health cov\u00ader\u00adage of thou\u00adsands. Sev\u00ader\u00adal plans to tem\u00adpor\u00adar\u00adily ex\u00adtend sub\u00adsidies while re\u00adpeal\u00ading big pieces of the law began emer\u00adging in the Sen\u00adate, in\u00adtro\u00adduced by Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans but dis\u00admissed as non\u00adstarters by Demo\u00adcrats. Re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation came up as a way to put the \u201cKing fixes\u201d on the pres\u00adid\u00adent\u2019s desk without the as\u00adsist\u00adance of Demo\u00adcrats.\n\nBut the Su\u00adpreme Court sided with the ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion and the law was left in\u00adtact, leav\u00ading Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans with the sud\u00adden di\u00adlemma of what came next\u2014if any\u00adthing\u2014in their re\u00adlent\u00adless quest against Obama\u00adcare. The an\u00adswer quickly emerged: The GOP, for the most part, punted to 2017 and the pos\u00adsib\u00adil\u00adity of a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan pres\u00adid\u00adent who will sign a re\u00adpeal bill.\n\nBut be\u00adfore that, they said, re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation could be used to put an Obama\u00adcare re\u00adpeal in front of the pres\u00adid\u00adent, as con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans had prom\u00adised the voters who sent them to Wash\u00ading\u00adton they would. While it seemed widely un\u00adder\u00adstood that this was the most likely use of the budget tool, however, lead\u00ader\u00adship re\u00adpeatedly em\u00adphas\u00adized that there was no rush to use it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still open. No fi\u00adnal de\u00adcision has been made,\u201d Sen. John Bar\u00adrasso told re\u00adport\u00adersin early Ju\u00adly. \u201cHad the Su\u00adpreme Court ruled the oth\u00ader way, there would have been an im\u00adme\u00addi\u00adacy to have to use re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation with re\u00adgard to a King de\u00adcision, but since the de\u00adcision went the oth\u00ader way, that im\u00adme\u00addi\u00adacy isn\u2019t there. So re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation is still a use\u00adful tool, and I ex\u00adpect it to be used.\u201d\n\nAnd then came a new con\u00adtro\u00adversy: fed\u00ader\u00adal fund\u00ading of Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood. Less than a month after the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act sur\u00advived its second Su\u00adpreme Court chal\u00adlenge, a series of sting videos tar\u00adget\u00ading the wo\u00admen\u2019s health care or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion stirred an\u00adoth\u00ader bit\u00adterly par\u00adtis\u00adan fight on Cap\u00adit\u00adol Hill. The videos al\u00adlegedly show Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood selling fetal tis\u00adsue, which is il\u00adleg\u00adal. The or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion denies the al\u00adleg\u00ada\u00adtions, say\u00ading that it only donates the tis\u00adsue for med\u00adic\u00adal re\u00adsearch and is re\u00adim\u00adbursed for over\u00adhead costs. Sev\u00ader\u00adal con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal in\u00advest\u00adig\u00ada\u00adtions are un\u00adder\u00adway.\n\nBut simply in\u00advest\u00adig\u00adat\u00ading the or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion and its activ\u00adit\u00adies is not enough for most Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans, who want to see the or\u00adgan\u00adiz\u00ada\u00adtion lose its fed\u00ader\u00adal fund\u00ading. A group of right-wing con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives in the House, joined by pres\u00adid\u00aden\u00adtial can\u00addid\u00adate Sen. Ted Cruz, began call\u00ading for a de\u00adfund pro\u00advi\u00adsion to be in\u00adcluded in a must-pass spend\u00ading bill, even if that led to a gov\u00adern\u00adment shut\u00addown.\n\nGOP lead\u00ader\u00adship, on the oth\u00ader hand, learned from the shut\u00addown in 2013, in which Cruz played a lead\u00ading role as well. Not only was the party suc\u00adcess\u00adful in its at\u00adtack against the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act, but it also shouldered the blame for a 16-day shut\u00addown that en\u00adraged many Amer\u00adic\u00adans. Both House and Sen\u00adate lead\u00aders have in\u00adsisted the gov\u00adern\u00adment will not shut down again this year.\n\nTo pla\u00adcate con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives, however, lead\u00ader\u00adship said a strip\u00adping of Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood fund\u00ading should in\u00adstead be put in a re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation bill. House Speak\u00ader John Boehner dis\u00adcussed this al\u00adtern\u00adat\u00adive with House lead\u00ader\u00adship in a meet\u00ading just a day be\u00adfore he an\u00adnounced his resig\u00adna\u00adtion last week. He resigned amid pres\u00adsure from the House Free\u00addom Caucus, whose mem\u00adbers were threat\u00aden\u00ading to try to oust him as speak\u00ader if the spend\u00ading bill pro\u00adcess didn\u2019t go their way. His resig\u00adna\u00adtion re\u00admoves that threat, clear\u00ading the way for a short-term, clean spend\u00ading bill to pass through the House and thus avert\u00ading a shut\u00addown.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caitlin Owens", "description": "Republicans will deploy the budget tool to try to put legislation on the president\u2019s desk stripping Planned Parenthood funding and killing key parts of the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "Republicans will deploy the budget tool to try to put legislation on the president\u2019s desk stripping Planned Parenthood funding and killing key parts of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "GOP Picks Reconciliation Targets: Obamacare and Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/oversight/2015/09/gop-picks-reconciliation-targets-obamacare-and-planned-parenthood/122255/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/28/092815fredupton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@govexec", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/28/092815fredupton/open-graph.jpg", "description": "Republicans will deploy the budget tool to try to put legislation on the president\u2019s desk stripping Planned Parenthood funding and killing key parts of the Affordable Care Act.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "GOP Picks Reconciliation Targets: Obamacare and Planned Parenthood"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-28T20:14:44Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/28/092815fredupton.jpg", "sailthru.title": "GOP Picks Reconciliation Targets: Obamacare and Planned Parenthood", "keywords": "paul ryan, shutdown, obamacare, planned parenthood", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/28/092815fredupton/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "paul-ryan,shutdown,obamacare,channel-oversight,type-story,length-long,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "Republicans will deploy the budget tool to try to put legislation on the president\u2019s desk stripping Planned Parenthood funding and killing key parts of the Affordable Care Act."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda29f\"", "article_summary": "To pla\u00adcate con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adives, however, lead\u00ader\u00adship said a strip\u00adping of Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood fund\u00ading should in\u00adstead be put in a re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation bill.\nSo re\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation is still a use\u00adful tool, and I ex\u00adpect it to be used.\u201dAnd then came a new con\u00adtro\u00adversy: fed\u00ader\u00adal fund\u00ading of Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood.\nThe En\u00adergy and Com\u00admerce bill con\u00adtains a pro\u00advi\u00adsion de\u00adfund\u00ading Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood for one year, re\u00addir\u00adect\u00ading the $230 mil\u00adlion in sav\u00adings to com\u00admunity-health cen\u00adters.\nThe videos al\u00adlegedly show Planned Par\u00adent\u00adhood selling fetal tis\u00adsue, which is il\u00adleg\u00adal.\nRe\u00adcon\u00adcili\u00adation came up as a way to put the \u201cKing fixes\u201d on the pres\u00adid\u00adent\u2019s desk without the as\u00adsist\u00adance of Demo\u00adcrats."}
