Rapper DJ Khaled, who gained enormous notoriety in recent months for his outlandish stories on Snapchat, has endorsed President Barack Obama's signature healthcare plan.

"Major key alert," says Khaled. "They don't want us to have healthcare. They don't want us to have Obamacare, so what we gonna do is care about our life and get that healthcare, get that Obamacare."

Khaled then tells viewers to sign up by Jan. 31 to enroll in their healthcare plans.
