But one of the most lauded benefits has been the introduction of no co-pay birth control, which means that women can obtain long lasting (and expensive) reversible contraception like IUDs and implants, or get their tubes tied, without massive out of pocket expenses. It also was supposed to allow those who want or need hormonal birth control to be able to get it without paying a monthly co-pay, which often was $15 to $40 per pack, which would end up costing hundreds of dollars a year.\n\nUnfortunately, not every pharmacy has been following the rules.\n\nAccording to news reports, CVS pharmacy, one of the country\u2019s biggest pharmacy chains, has continued to collect co-pays despite them being eliminated under the ACA\u2019s new rules. \u201cOne of the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy chains has admitted it illegally charged thousands of women a co-pay for their birth control, and a San Diego 6 investigation has uncovered another instance that appears to be improper,\u201d reports the local San Diego news station. \u201cCVS Health acknowledged Monday it charged about 11,000 women for generic contraceptives that should have been provided at no out-of-pocket cost.\u201d\n\nCVS isn\u2019t the only one illegally charging these co-pays, either. San Diego 6 reports \u201canother large grocery store chain\u201d was also doing the same.\n\nThe illegal co-pays likely resulted in hundred of thousands of dollars for the pharmacy.\n\nAccording to Congresswomen Jackie Speier, the California Democrat who investigated complaints against CVS, the company states that the issue was a coding problem, and that it will be resolved and the money reimbursed. But Congresswoman Speier also announced that there are other companies she has received similar reports on, including Target and Walgreens, and that customers need to research if they have been illegally charged, and pharmacists must be retrained to ensure it no longer occurs.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman Speier is also recommending other companies that she received complaints about, such as Walgreens and Target, although they were not the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) in these cases, provide training to their retail pharmacists to know and apply the basic principles of the Affordable Care Act so that they can help identify and rectify these illegal co-pay charges for customers who frequent their stores,\u201d read a statement from her office.\n\nUnfortunately, it looks as if for now, the onus is on the patient herself to be positive she isn\u2019t being scammed by her own pharmacist. \u201cWomen should know that if they are charged a co-pay for their birth control, they need to ask why. And they need to call their insurance company and ask why if the pharmacy doesn\u2019t know,\u201d recommends Judy Waxman of the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\n\nCVS has stated that it will begin reimbursing those who have been overcharged, and that they were already addressing the issue even before Congresswoman Speier began her investigation.\n\n\u201cRefund checks will be [sent] to affected plan members by September 26,\u201d CVS\u2019s head of federal affairs Sol J. Ross wrote in response to the Congresswoman. \u201cIn fact, refund checks have already started to go out and all should be received by October 1.\u201d According to Huffington post, CVS said it was already aware of the error and working on reimbursement before Congresswoman Speier\u2019s inquiry.\n\nRefund checks are helpful, of course, but not everyone may be aware that they are coming and, even more so, a number of people may still be confused about whether they should be paying a co-pay at all. The National Women\u2019s Law Center provides sample letters for those who believe they have been paying illegal co-pays, as well as step by step instructions on how to proceed to either address the issue with your pharmacist or plan manager, or go about collecting the funds that should never have been taken from you in the first place.\n\nPhoto credit: Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite the fact that the Affordable Care Act mandated no copay birth control, some companies are still asking for one.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3113/3112988.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "affordable care act,aca,birth control,birth control mandate,copays", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0626\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWomen should know that if they are charged a co-pay for their birth control, they need to ask why.\nAccording to news reports, CVS pharmacy, one of the country\u2019s biggest pharmacy chains, has continued to collect co-pays despite them being eliminated under the ACA\u2019s new rules.\nIt also was supposed to allow those who want or need hormonal birth control to be able to get it without paying a monthly co-pay, which often was $15 to $40 per pack, which would end up costing hundreds of dollars a year.\nCVS has stated that it will begin reimbursing those who have been overcharged, and that they were already addressing the issue even before Congresswoman Speier began her investigation.\nThe illegal co-pays likely resulted in hundred of thousands of dollars for the pharmacy."}
