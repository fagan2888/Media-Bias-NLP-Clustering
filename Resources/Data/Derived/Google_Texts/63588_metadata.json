And wiping out Obamacare featured prominently in the budget proposal rolled out Tuesday by House Speaker John Boehner.\n\nWhen Boehner called his umpteenth repeal vote last month, freshman Syracuse-area Rep. John Katko was one of only three Republicans who bucked the party line by voting \u201cno.\u201d\n\nNor are profiles in courage arising among the Republican field for President.\n\nJeb Bush \u2014 who has stood up to his party\u2019s base by advocating comprehensive immigration reform and defending the Common Core standards \u2014 still panders to it by labeling Obamacare a \u201cmonstrosity.\u201d\n\nHe should have known better, having served on the board of Tenet Healthcare, which actively encouraged people to enroll in Obamacare and credited the law for dramatically boosting its revenues.\n\nAlso predictably in the anti-Obamacare camp is early front-runner Scott Walker of Wisconsin, one of the many Republican governors who turned down the chance to expand his state\u2019s Medicaid plan for the poor at federal expense.\n\nIn fact, Walker rolled back eligibility to push thousands of Wisconsinites off the Medicaid rolls \u2014 arguing they could now afford to buy their own coverage through Obamacare. How\u2019s that for having it both ways?\n\nAt least this isn\u2019t 2009, when Sarah Palin spouted off about \u201cdeath panels\u201d \u2014 which was her purely demagogic spin on an ACA provision that sensibly encouraged doctors to talk to their patients about end-of-life issues, such as living wills and advance directives.\n\nAnd at least this isn\u2019t 2010, when McConnell, John McCain and others were ranting about 16,500 agents the IRS would supposedly be hiring to enforce the law \u2014 which some in the conservative media ominously portrayed as a paramilitary force.\n\nAt least this isn\u2019t 2012, when GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney campaigned against the health law \u2014 even though Obama had modeled it on one Romney proudly pioneered as governor of Massachusetts.\n\nYes, Obama spread misinformation about the law, too \u2014 by repeatedly vowing that, \u201cIf you like your health plan, you can keep it.\u201d That wasn\u2019t true for some percentage of Americans, and he knew it.\n\nBut his far more important promise \u2014 to make affordable health coverage available to those who need it without breaking the bank \u2014 is being kept.\n\nTo be fair to doubters of good faith, the odds were long.\n\nIt\u2019s succeeding in spite of the ugly sausage-making of its trip through Congress.\n\nIt\u2019s succeeding in spite of the hash job that the Obama administration made with its original website.\n\nIt\u2019s succeeding in spite of Republican rhetoric that stoked fear and misunderstanding in the public.\n\nIt\u2019s succeeding in spite of Congress\u2019 perverse refusal to fix technical glitches large or small \u2014 including the ambiguous wording behind an opportunistic legal challenge currently before the Supreme Court.\n\nBarring a bad ruling from the court \u2014 which could deal a huge setback \u2014 the ACA\u2019s much-mocked hundreds of pages of legislation and thousands of pages of regulations are working better than Obama himself had any right to expect.\n\nRepublicans used to support the goal of universal coverage. Some of them used to support the ACA\u2019s core concept of requiring Americans to be insured \u2014 the so-called individual mandate \u2014 as a market-based way to move toward universal coverage .\n\nNow they only seem know what they\u2019re against.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Bill Hammond", "twitter": {"description": "Rhis week brought the good news that 16.4 million Americans have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act", "title": "Bill Hammond: Breaking news: Obamacare works", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/bill-hammond-breaking-news-obamacare-works-article-1.2152882", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2152881.1426629956!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-obama-sebelius.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "obamacare, barack obama, congress, affordable care act, mitch mcconnell,", "parsely-author": "Bill Hammond", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "obamacare, barack obama, congress, affordable care act, mitch mcconnell,", "nydn_tags": "obamacare, barack obama, congress", "news_keywords": "obamacare, barack obama, congress, affordable care act, mitch mcconnell,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/bill-hammond-breaking-news-obamacare-works-article-1.2152882", "parsely-title": "Bill Hammond: Breaking news: Obamacare works", "sailthru.date": "2015-03-18T04:22:04-0400", "sailthru.title": "Bill Hammond: Breaking news: Obamacare works", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-03-18T08:22:04", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2152881.1426629956!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-obama-sebelius.jpg", "description": "Rhis week brought the good news that 16.4 million Americans have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Rhis week brought the good news that 16.4 million Americans have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Rhis week brought the good news that 16.4 million Americans have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act", "title": "Bill Hammond: Breaking news: Obamacare works", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/bill-hammond-breaking-news-obamacare-works-article-1.2152882", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2152881.1426629956!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-obama-sebelius.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "obamacare, barack obama, congress", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2152881.1426629956!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/usa-obama-sebelius.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Bill Hammond", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce96c\"", "article_summary": "But his far more important promise \u2014 to make affordable health coverage available to those who need it without breaking the bank \u2014 is being kept.\nRepublicans used to support the goal of universal coverage.\nSome of them used to support the ACA\u2019s core concept of requiring Americans to be insured \u2014 the so-called individual mandate \u2014 as a market-based way to move toward universal coverage .\nIt\u2019s increasingly obvious, in other words, that the ACA, aka Obamacare, is beating expectations \u2014 not just of its critics, but also its supporters \u2014 and moving the country toward the sanity and security of universal health coverage.\nSo who will be the first major Republican to admit that Obamacare is working?"}
