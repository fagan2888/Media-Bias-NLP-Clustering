The actress has introduced him at campaign rallies and lavished praise on his uber progressive agenda for the country. She also has not been afraid to speak out against power couple Hillary and Bill Clinton. At one of Sanders\u2019 campaign events this weekend, Dawson reminded voters how the political duo likes to bully people, even invoking the infamous name of Monica Lewinsky to prove her point.\n\n\"We are literally under attack \u2014 not just for supporting the other candidate,\" the actress told a crowd in Wilmington, Delaware, as she introduced the senator, adding, \"I\u2019m with Monica Lewinsky on this \u2026 bullying is bad.\" Dawson also called it a Clinton \"campaign strategy.\"\n\nAfter the rally, CNN asked Sanders whether Dawson\u2019s comments were appropriate. He deferred, instead choosing to talk about her impressive acting and \u201cpassion\u201d for fighting for progressive causes. He also claimed not to be aware of the \u201ccontext\u201d of her remarks.\n\n\n\nAnother one of Sanders\u2019 famous female fans, Susan Sarandon, has no problem telling voters what she thinks of the Clintons. In an interview with MSNBC's Chris Hayes, Sarandon suggested Donald Trump may even be a better fit for the White House than Hillary. Clinton is the \u201cstatus quo\u201d and her history with Wall Street proves she is not sincere when she claims to be a champion for the middle class, the actress insisted.\n\nWe may not all agree with Bernie Sanders and his celebrity surrogates on policy, but we can agree he is more sincere than Hillary when it comes to their policy platforms. (When exactly is she going to release those Wall Street transcripts?)\n\nWe can also probably find some common ground and agree that the Clintons are indeed guilty of engaging in aggressive and bullying political tactics.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hollywood actresses sound off on the Clintons..05/27/2016 9:55:10AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Hollywood actresses sound off on the Clintons.", "title": "'I'm With Monica:' Sanders' Celebrity Supporter Slams Clinton 'Bullying'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/25/sanders-hollywood-supporter-invokes-clintons-bullying-of-lewinsky-n2153058", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/207/f83d2855-2288-4341-85af-b8635bb41fc3.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Hollywood actresses sound off on the Clintons.", "title": "'I'm With Monica:' Sanders' Celebrity Supporter Slams Clinton 'Bullying'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/25/sanders-hollywood-supporter-invokes-clintons-bullying-of-lewinsky-n2153058", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/207/f83d2855-2288-4341-85af-b8635bb41fc3.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "'I'm With Monica:' Sanders' Celebrity Supporter Slams Clinton 'Bullying', Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "(When exactly is she going to release those Wall Street transcripts?)\nDawson also called it a Clinton \"campaign strategy.\"\nAt one of Sanders\u2019 campaign events this weekend, Dawson reminded voters how the political duo likes to bully people, even invoking the infamous name of Monica Lewinsky to prove her point.\nShe also has not been afraid to speak out against power couple Hillary and Bill Clinton.\nAnother one of Sanders\u2019 famous female fans, Susan Sarandon, has no problem telling voters what she thinks of the Clintons."}
