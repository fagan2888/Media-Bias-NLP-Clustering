McNamara said he planned to seek a grand jury indictment of the Leonards as soon as possible.\n\nMcNamara declined to comment when asked about media reports that the teen was trying to leave the church group.\n\nDeborah Leonard, who appeared in shackles and orange jumpsuits along with her husband, wept during Friday's testimony. Bruce Leonard appeared stoic and wrote on a notepad as witnesses spoke to the court.\n\nFamily members drove Lucas Leonard to nearby St. Luke's Hospital on Monday afternoon, after discovering that he was not breathing, police said. Lucas Leonard, whose injuries were consistent with blunt force trauma to the torso and extremities, died shortly after arriving.\n\nNew Hartford police and the New York State Police launched a joint investigation after being notified about the suspicious death.\n\nPolice deployed tactical teams to the church, and discovered the younger brother, Christopher Leonard, on the second floor of the three-story red brick building, a former public schoolhouse.\n\nChristopher Leonard is being treated at a local hospital for blunt force trauma to the body and extremities, police say.\n\nSarah Ferguson, 33, the victims' sister, and fellow church members Linda Morey, 54, David Morey, 26, and Joseph Irwin, 26, were arrested on charges of assault in the second degree.\n\nAll of the defendants appeared at Friday's hearing. Ferguson and Irwin are scheduled to appear in court again next Friday. They were unable to make $50,000 bail each and will remain in custody at the Oneida County Jail.\n\nThe Moreys were freed on $50,000 bond each and were ordered to appear in court on Dec. 15.\n\nThe Leonards' next court appearance will depend on whether they are indicted by a grand jury.\n\n(Writing and additional reporting by Laila Kearney in New York; Editing by Sandra Maler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW HARTFORD, New York (Reuters) - A man who said he witnessed a teenager being beaten", "title": "Father beat New York teen with cord in fatal church attack: police", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/16/Father-beat-New-York-teen-cord-fatal-church-attack-police", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-new-york-church-beating_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/16/Father-beat-New-York-teen-cord-fatal-church-attack-police", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-new-york-church-beating_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NEW HARTFORD, New York (Reuters) - A man who said he witnessed a teenager being beaten", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf95d\"", "article_summary": "Irwin said he also observed Bruce Leonard and Christopher Leonard giving Lucas Leonard mouth-to-mouth resuscitation at some point during the session.\nNew Hartford police and the New York State Police launched a joint investigation after being notified about the suspicious death.\nLucas Leonard, whose injuries were consistent with blunt force trauma to the torso and extremities, died shortly after arriving.\nFamily members drove Lucas Leonard to nearby St. Luke's Hospital on Monday afternoon, after discovering that he was not breathing, police said.\nDaniel Irwin, deacon of the church, said during the hearing in New Hartford Town Court that he witnessed the counseling session and saw Bruce Leonard striking Lucas Leonard."}
