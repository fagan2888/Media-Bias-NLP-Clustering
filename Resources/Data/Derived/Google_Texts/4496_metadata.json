Maggie Hassan called for in her proposed budget.\n\n..\n\nThe committee also backed eliminating funding for a substance abuse benefit in the standard Medicaid program.\n\n\n\nThe proposals are part of a larger effort by the Republican-controlled committee to trim $180 million from the two-year budget of the Health and Human Services Department. The committee is also considering letting the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, known as the NH Health Protection Program, expire at the end of 2016.\n\n..\n\nAt the aldermen\u2019s meeting on Tuesday, Mayor Ted Gatsas said elected leaders at all levels needed to know the seriousness of the drug problem facing the city.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the heroin epidemic, there\u2019s no question I tell it to every presidential candidate that comes in. It\u2019s going to be the demise of this country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really hurting families in this community and throughout the state of New Hampshire. Something has to happen.\u201d\n\n..\n\nGatsas, a Republican and former state senator, said on Wednesday that he may reach out to the chairman of the House Finance Committee, Rep. Neal Kurk, R-Weare. \u201cI\u2019ve had a good working relationship with him,\u201d he said.\n\n..\n\nThe proposal to limit funding for substance abuse programs comes as the Manchester Police Department issued a public warning earlier this week in response to a dramatic increase in overdoses and deaths in the city in the first months of 2015. There were 105 overdoses in the city, most heroin-related, and more than a dozen deaths, according to statistics released by the police.\n\n..\n\nWard 1 Alderman Joyce Craig, who raised the issue on Tuesday, said in a memo to the board that New Hampshire was second in the nation for per-capita substance abuse, but ranked 49th in per-capita spending on prevention and treatment.\n\n..\n\n\u2018\u201cWe are facing a substance abuse epidemic in our city, and these funds are necessary to provide the services required to combat it,\u201d Joyce wrote.\n\n\n\nManchester joins advocates for the needy and social service providers who have strongly criticized the cuts proposed by the House Finance Committee.\n\n..\n\ntsiefer@unionleader.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "The board of mayor and aldermen voted on Tuesday to send a letter urging the House Finance Committee, which is currently hammering out its proposed 2016-2017 biennial budget, to maintain, if not bolster, funding for substance abuse programs.", "title": "Manchester officials worry state budget cuts will affect heroin fight | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "The board of mayor and aldermen voted on Tuesday to send a letter urging the House Finance Committee, which is currently hammering out its proposed 2016-2017 biennial budget, to maintain, if not bolster, funding for substance abuse programs.", "title": "Manchester officials worry state budget cuts will affect heroin fight | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150319/NEWS0606/150318943", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/images/unionleaderlogo.jpg", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Local & County Government", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "Public Safety, Health, Social issues, Manchester, Top Section Stories, State Government, Local and County Government,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-03-19 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "The board of mayor and aldermen voted on Tuesday to send a letter urging the House Finance Committee, which is currently hammering out its proposed 2016-2017 biennial budget, to maintain, if not bolster, funding for substance abuse programs.", "title": "Manchester officials worry state budget cuts will affect heroin fight | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150319/NEWS0606/150318943", "image": "http://www.unionleader.com/images/unionleaderlogo.jpg", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5604\"", "article_summary": "Manchester officials worry state budget cuts will affect heroin fightMANCHESTER \u2014 City officials are raising concerns about proposed cuts in the state budget that could impact efforts to combat drug abuse in the city.\nManchester joins advocates for the needy and social service providers who have strongly criticized the cuts proposed by the House Finance Committee.\nMaggie Hassan called for in her proposed budget.\nThe committee also backed eliminating funding for a substance abuse benefit in the standard Medicaid program.\nSomething has to happen.\u201d..Gatsas, a Republican and former state senator, said on Wednesday that he may reach out to the chairman of the House Finance Committee, Rep.
