In other words, one in five babies was born by C-section.\n\nBy contrast, New Jersey\u2019s rate was 38.8 percent in 2011, the last year for which statistics were available. That means more than one in three babies are born this way. The state\u2019s C-section rate has been around 39 percent since 2007, according to figures provided by the state Department of Health.\n\nCesarean delivery is of concern because it is carries with it a longer hospital stay and recuperation, is more expensive and, in the case of scheduled Cesareans, can risk delivery of a baby who is slightly premature.\n\nA statewide coalition of hospital and health care professionals has seen substantial progress in reducing the number of scheduled births, whether those came about by induction of labor or planned Cesareans, said Aline Holmes, senior vice president of clinical affairs for the New Jersey Hospital Association.\n\nScheduled, or elective, births used to account for 8 percent of all births in New Jersey. Through education and changed policies, that number is now down to 2 percent, she said.\n\nShe expects that progress to be reflected in the state\u2019s overall C-section rate by the end of this year.\n\nInitially, the New Jersey medical community argued the state had such a high rate of C-sections because mothers here were older, or had other health problems, she said. But an examination of the data proved that to be incorrect.\n\n\u201cOur moms are not any different from moms in other states,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of the high rate could be blamed on physician fears of malpractice charges.\n\n\u201cMany of the obstetricians in the state are just one lawsuit away from not being able to practice any more,\u201d Holmes said.\n\nObstetricians have told her they never get sued for doing a C-section, she said; instead, lawsuits stem from cases in which the aggrieved patient claims a C-section should have been performed.\n\nOne misconception that had underpinned the rise in C-sections was the notion that the final two or three weeks of gestation don\u2019t make much difference. In fact, doctors now believe that 30 percent to 40 percent of brain development takes place in those final few weeks before 39 weeks.\n\nEducating both obstetricians and parents about the importance of that timetable has helped a lot, said Holmes.\n\nThe state\u2019s various ethnic cultures are a factor as well, Holmes said. Hasidic Jewish women will almost always deliver vaginally. Yet women in other cultures will cite the belief that their uterus could be damaged by labor, or labor will ruin their sex lives.\n\n\u201cTrust me, I\u2019ve head women tell me that,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cSo it\u2019s very a complicated.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','health-news'", "title": "NJ C-section rates remain high, bucking national trend", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"NJ C-section rates remain high, bucking national trend\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/01/nj_c-section_rates_remain_high_bucking_national_trend.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/01/14147198-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12056430\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-25T14:49:44Z\", \"author\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"health-news\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/01/14147198-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@OBrienLedger", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey of 28 states and New York City showed an overall Cesarean rate of 21.9 percent in 2012.
