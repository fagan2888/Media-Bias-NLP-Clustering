Top Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters this week seeking more information about the financial status of the 11 remaining co-ops created under the Affordable Care Act.

Reps. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) and Joe Pitts (R-Pa.) say they want to better understand the financial challenges the co-ops are facing and ensure the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is taking the “necessary and appropriate steps” to keep the co-ops functioning. The agency has placed eight of the remaining co-ops on corrective action plans, and 12 had closed by the start of 2016.

“After reviewing these oversight plans, the Committee is concerned that CMS has not taken the appropriate steps to ensure that the remaining CO-OPs will be financially solvent for the remainder of the year,” the lawmakers write. “Federal taxpayers have invested over $1 billion into the remaining 11 CO-OPs. Especially considering this substantial taxpayer investment, the Committee wants to ensure CMS is taking the necessary and appropriate steps to keep these CO-OPs afloat.”

The lawmakers have asked to see loan applications, communication with CMS and corrective action plans from the co-ops. They also asked about what types of regulatory changes would be helpful for them and whether the co-ops had discussed closing with CMS, among other things.
