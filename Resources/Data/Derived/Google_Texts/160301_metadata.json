The original request came from Richard Leshin, former president of the Texas Exes, who is close to Powers and to South Texas power brokers Carlos Zaffirini and his wife, state Sen. Judith Zaffirini.\n\nEarlier this year, Leshin, a Corpus Christi lawyer, wrote an op-ed in the San Antonio Express-News denouncing as \u201coutlandish propaganda\u201d reports that the university was admitting sub-par students because of political influence.\n\nGilligan got back to Cedar and Leshin within a half-hour, offering a deal in which the applicant \u201cwill be admitted into McCombs upon completing several of the prerequisites (e.g. Calculus, Statistics, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics) with good grades (around a 3.5 GPA). Will that work?\u201d\n\nGilligan declined to comment.\n\nLeshin is a founding member of the Texas Coalition for Excellence in Higher Education, a group of Longhorn insiders established to maintain the status quo at UT. Members of the coalition and the alumni association have been quoted in dozens of news articles, creating the appearance of broad support for Powers.\n\nFar from being independent voices, the email records find the coalition and the alumni association often looped in on message coordination emails from Powers\u2019 PR staff.\n\nRead more on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The emails were first obtained but not published by Tony McDonald, legal counsel for the conservative advocacy nonprofit Empower Texans.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The emails were first obtained but not published by Tony McDonald, legal counsel for the conservative advocacy nonprofit Empower Texans.", "title": "Did Students Get Favorable Treatment at University of Texas?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/polphotos190176.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-19T17:07:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1wDlW5e"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The emails were first obtained but not published by Tony McDonald, legal counsel for the conservative advocacy nonprofit Empower Texans.", "title": "Did Students Get Favorable Treatment at University of Texas?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/polphotos190176.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "higher ed", "published_time": "2014-12-20T03:01:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-19T17:07:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "University of Texas, President Bill Powers, Texas, UT, bill powers"}, "article_summary": "The records also show the Texas Exes alumni association and the Texas Coalition for Excellence in Higher Education were, in effect, two more arms of Powers\u2019 public relations team.\nSupporters of University of Texas President Bill Powers have for months worked mightily to deny or to marginalize evidence lawmakers were pulling strings to get unqualified students admitted to the university.\nThe original request came from Richard Leshin, former president of the Texas Exes, who is close to Powers and to South Texas power brokers Carlos Zaffirini and his wife, state Sen.
