But he might not have an easy choice. McConnell has suggested that he\u2019d use riders on must-pass appropriations legislation, risking future government shutdowns to get his way. And with James Inhofe\u2014who believes that climate change is \u201cthe greatest hoax ever perpetrated\u201d\u2014likely poised to become the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, McConnell would have some strong backup.\n\nIII. T he Continuance of NSA Snooping\n\nThe provisions that justify much of the National Security Agency\u2019s (NSA) controversial collection of bulk telephone metadata will expire on June 1, 2015\u2014unless the White House and Congress strike a deal to replace them. But will they want to? Laura Murphy, a lawyer at the ACLU, believes that Obama is open to modifying the current laws. \u201cI think his closest advisers have told him that these programs have not thwarted any significant terrorist attacks,\u201d said Murphy, \u201cand the cost to rights is greater than the benefit to national security.\u201d But given the continued threat of ISIS and the recent domestic security breaches at the White House, it\u2019s hard to predict where exactly the president will be on surveillance reform next spring. It\u2019s also hard to predict what Congress will have the stomach for. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, is set to retire. Mark Udall, a key anti-metadata crusader, is in a reelection contest he may not survive. And if Republicans take over the Senate, Patrick Leahy, an NSA skeptic, will lose his position as chair of the Judiciary Committee. He is likely to be replaced by ranking Republican Chuck Grassley, whose record on surveillance questions is more mixed. (He voted to extend the provisions that allow for bulk metadata collection the last time they were scheduled to sunset, in 2011.) Those are a lot of hits for the anti-surveillance side to take. On the other hand, it\u2019s not as if either party really wants to be seen supporting the NSA these days. What will ultimately happen, then, largely depends on the political mood right around the time of the debate in the spring and early summer.\n\nIV. S trategic Slashes to Obamacare\n\nRepublicans know that they can\u2019t repeal the Affordable Care Act so long as Obama has the veto pen. That\u2019s why Senate Republicans are more likely to focus on Obamacare\u2019s most politically vulnerable pieces. Two quickly come to mind: a tax on medical devices and the so-called \u201crisk corridors\u201d program, which insulates insurers from large losses and which Republicans say is a taxpayer bailout of the insurance industry. And if they seek tooverturn these provisions, they may attract some Democratic support from unlikely places. Progressive stalwarts like Massachusetts\u2019s Elizabeth Warren and Minnesota\u2019s Al Franken and Amy Klobuchar have spoken out against the device tax\u2014perhaps because their states are home to major device makers. But taking a run at either one of these provisions would present complications, too. The device tax will raise about $30 billion in revenue over the next decade. Strip it out and there\u2019s a new hole in the deficit. Striking risk corridors from the law, meanwhile, would alienate the insurance industry (which has been counting on the subsidies) and potentially a lot of voters (who would end up paying higher premiums).\n\nIf Republicans are willing to risk such consequences, they\u2019ll have an opportunity to force the issue. As Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities points out, Congress must raise the debt ceiling again sometime in 2015. That\u2019s an opportunity for budget extortion. But if Republicans decide they don\u2019t want another standoff with the White House, they might train their sights on another vulnerable Obamacare provision\u2014one they could probably kill in the regular course of legislative business. Namely the \u201cemployer mandate,\u201d the requirement that medium and large businesses provide insurance to full-time employees (or pay a fine if they don\u2019t). The requirement has no friends on the right, and it doesn\u2019t even have that many on the left or among mainstream economists. The one catch is that the employer mandate raises even more money than the device tax\u2014anywhere from $46 to $149 billion over ten years. If Republicans voted to nix the mandate without replacing the revenue it generates, Obama would have an easy excuse for vetoing it\u2014and he almost certainly would.\n\nV. C onfirmation Chaos\n\nIn the history of the United States, there have been 168 filibusters of presidential nominees. Eighty-two of them\u2014nearly half\u2014have occurred during Obama\u2019s presidency. And now he\u2019s facing the possibility of a Republican Senate for the first time. Which means that many of the more than 200 (and counting) nominees awaiting confirmation in the next Senate session could be put in a state of permanent limbo. These aren\u2019t just for piddling back-office jobs, either. We currently don\u2019t have a surgeon general, though we do have Ebola and Enterovirus. (The nominee, Dr. Vivek Murthy, has been languishing since November 2013 due to his support for gun control.) The country is still waiting for the Senate to confirm an ambassador to Argentina, a chief financial officer of Veterans Affairs, a Social Security Administration commissioner, and a National Transportation Safety Board chairman.\n\nThen there\u2019s the judicial system: Obama has 53 district judgeships to fill and seven positions on the Court of Appeals. Currently, the ideological balance is even: 533 of all sitting district court judges were nominated by a Democratic president, compared to 530 by a Republican. Obama has the chance to tilt the balance strongly in the Democrats\u2019 favor, but don\u2019t count on that happening. During his first term, Obama\u2019s district court nominees endured longer confirmation times and lower confirmation rates than those under George W. Bush or Bill Clinton. According to the Brookings Institution\u2019s Russell Wheeler, 68 percent of Obama\u2019s appointees to the district court had to wait more than 180 days, whereas under Clinton it was only 8 percent. And that was with a Democratic Senate. It\u2019ll be hard for the president\u2014who \u201chas already been nominating middle-of-the road candidates,\u201d says Wheeler\u2014to confirm anyone who so much as looks like a liberal.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The five things to fear about a Republican Congress", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "The five things to fear about a Republican Congress.", "title": "What the Next Two Awful Years Will Look Like", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/aabebbdccc34ec250711c356ea3fddff5825e600.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/119779/2014-midterm-elections-what-republican-congress-will-look", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The five things to fear about a Republican Congress.", "title": "What the Next Two Awful Years Will Look Like", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/aabebbdccc34ec250711c356ea3fddff5825e600.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@rebleber", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/aabebbdccc34ec250711c356ea3fddff5825e600.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"What the Next Two Awful Years Will Look Like\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119779/2014-midterm-elections-what-republican-congress-will-look\",\"section\":\"2014 Midterms\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-10-12T23:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":119779,\"author\":\"Rebecca Leber\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"2014 Midterms\",\"Politics\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "2014 Midterms", "published_time": "2014-10-12"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0959\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s why Senate Republicans are more likely to focus on Obamacare\u2019s most politically vulnerable pieces.\nHe is likely to be replaced by ranking Republican Chuck Grassley, whose record on surveillance questions is more mixed.\nAnd if Republicans take over the Senate, Patrick Leahy, an NSA skeptic, will lose his position as chair of the Judiciary Committee.\nThen there\u2019s the judicial system: Obama has 53 district judgeships to fill and seven positions on the Court of Appeals.\nObama has the chance to tilt the balance strongly in the Democrats\u2019 favor, but don\u2019t count on that happening."}
