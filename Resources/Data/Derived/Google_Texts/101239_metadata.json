They left on Friday morning.\n\nEarlier, Kemp took an official visit to Michigan. He will take at least two more, including to the University of Colorado.\n\n\u201cIt has been pretty cool, both trips to Fort Collins on Thursdays, then Michigan-BYU and now Notre Dame-Navy,\u201d Fairview coach Tom McCartney said. \u201cThose are two awesome trips and stadiums, incredible universities for him to visit.
