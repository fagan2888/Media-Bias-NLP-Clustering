DIRECTV Loses 50 Local Channels In Fee Fight

Washington, D.C. (September 1, 2014) - DIRECTV last night lost more than 50 Raycom Media-owned local channels due to a fight over how much the satcaster should pay to carry them, the companies announced.



The old agreement between the companies expired at midnight last night and Raycom pulled the channels from DIRECTV's airwaves after they could not reach a new deal.



"This is frustrating for DIRECTV customers who rely on Raycom stations for information and entertainment. We share their frustration and are committed to doing everything we can to resolve this issue and have been for the last 12 weeks of discussions," Raycom Media CEO Paul McTear said in a statement posted at the stations' web sites.



DIRECTV responded at its web site, DIRECTVPromise.com, that Raycom was seeking "double' the amount the satcaster previously paid to carry the stations.







"Raycom Media is denying DIRECTV customers and some of its own most loyal viewers access to its local broadcast stations unless they pay more than double just to receive the same broadcast shows that remain available over the air for free," DIRECTV stated. "We will always work to protect our customers and prevent them from enduring any unnecessary interruptions, no matter how brief."



DIRECTV and Raycom engaged in a contentious negotiation in 2011 before finally signing a new deal.



As usual in these discussions, the companies are differing over how much DIRECTV should pay Raycom to carry its signals.



The Raycom stations are located largely in cities in the Southeast, such as New Orleans, Savannah, Augusta, Georgia and Birmingham. But the company also has stations in Cleveland and Cincinnati. To see a complete list of the Raycom stations, click here.
