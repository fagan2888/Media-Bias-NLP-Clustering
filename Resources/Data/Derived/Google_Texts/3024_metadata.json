Circuit\u2019s carefully reasoned decision striking down the IRS\u2019s unlawful tax subsidies in Halbig v. Burwell undermines the administration\u2019s interpretation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). As I noted before, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held 2\u20131 that the IRS had exceeded its authority in issuing a tax regulation that mandated tax subsidies through federal Obamacare exchanges that were not \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d Judge Griffith wrote the majority opinion, joined by Judge Randolph (who also wrote a separate concurring opinion). Carter appointee Judge Harry Edwards dissented. (The Fourth Circuit issued a contrary opinion today, too. More on that later.).\n\nThis case was all about text: What role does the actual language of a statute play when Congress has passed it as part of a complex legislative scheme that, quite frankly, includes bad policy decisions? How much latitude does the government have to re-interpret statutory text in trying to change the policy? And where do courts draw the line between interpretation and distortion? This post will examine how Judge Griffith and Judge Edwards answer those questions.\n\nJudge Griffith took what one might call a \u201ctextualist\u201d approach, reasoning from the text and its meaning and rebutting the alternative interpretations. Judge Randolph\u2019s concurring opinion agreed and made the sharper point that an exchange established by the federal government cannot possibly be an exchange established by the state, and that \u201cto hold otherwise would be to engage in distortion, not interpretation.\u201d Judge Edwards, as predicted, took the broadest interpretation of the ACA, relying on a broad understanding of the ACA\u2019s purpose and policy, which he then used to trigger Chevron deference. (Somewhat oddly, Judge Edwards directs most of his fire at the appellants, not the majority opinion.)\n\nJudge Griffith\u2019s majority opinion recognized the relationship between the Constitution and the court\u2019s duty to focus on the statutory text, noting that the Constitution \u201cassigns the legislative power to Congress, and Congress alone, see U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1, and legislating often entails compromises that courts must respect.\u201d The only legal instrument that triggers the executive\u2019s responsibility to execute it \u2014 a bill that passes both houses of Congress and is signed or acceded to by the president \u2014 is the statutory text. Because legally binding compromises can result in the passage of statutory text, the statutory text is the proper focal point for the courts.\n\nNevertheless, Judge Griffith pointed out what he called a \u201cfork\u201d in the D.C. Circuit\u2019s precedent regarding legislative history. One of those forks includes the traditional rule that if the statutory text is unambiguous, there is no need to resort to legislative history. The other fork, from a case called Sierra Club v. EPA (D.C. Cir. 2008), commended legislative history \u201cto shed new light on congressional intent, notwithstanding statutory language that appears superficially clear.\u201d (As a side note, a quick review of the precedent cited for Sierra Club\u2019s search for \u201cnew light\u201d in legislative history finds little support in Supreme Court precedent. It appears to be an artifact of in-circuit debate.)\n\nJudge Griffith also noted the limitations on the use of legislative history under Sierra Club. First, the clear language of a statute doesn\u2019t receive a different meaning simply because legislative history doesn\u2019t repeat the statutory terms. As Judge Griffith put it, \u201cits purpose is not to confirm already clear text; clear text speaks for itself and requires no \u2018amen\u2019 in the historical record.\u201d\n\nSecond, if the statute\u2019s plain language might lead to an \u201codd result\u201d (and there\u2019s lots of wiggle room in defining what counts as \u201codd\u201d), the court asks whether the legislative history is \u201cdemonstrably at odds with the intentions\u201d of the drafters. This means that there has to be some significant discrepancy between the text and intent that is provable from the legislative record, not based on post hoc rationalizations. Because the legislative history was silent on these issues, the majority concluded that the government had no way to demonstrate, rather than presuppose, what the drafters were intending to accomplish with particular provisions.\n\nJudge Edwards, by contrast, sought to discern a single, unifying purpose behind the ACA\u2019s matrix of interlocking provisions. The first part of his analysis attacked the argument that Congress could have intended to create perverse incentives by allowing exchanges to fail in states without exchanges. The rest of his opinion repeatedly invoked the whole-act canon. Based on these principles, Judge Edwards argued that the meaning of \u201cExchange\u201d in \u201cExchange established by the State\u201d comes from a different provision defining \u201cExchange\u201d to include federally-created exchanges, and that in total, the result is ambiguous.\n\nJudge Edwards also reasoned that the plain meaning of \u201cestablished by the State\u201d is implausible because allowing tax subsidies only to states that establish exchanges \u201cwould destroy the fundamental policy structure and goals of the ACA that are apparent when the statute is read as a whole,\u201d that is, from a birds-eye view. Having constructed an ambiguity, then, Judge Edwards concluded that the IRS\u2019s interpretation should receive Chevron deference.\n\nBut Judge Griffith\u2019s counterargument on this point is devastating. I can\u2019t do better than to simply quote (sans citations and footnotes):\n\nThe government, together with the dissent, also leans heavily on a more abstract form of legislative history\u2014Congress\u2019s broad purpose in passing the ACA\u2014urging the court to view section 36B through the lens of the ACA\u2019s economic theory and ultimate aims. They emphasize that to achieve the goals of \u201cnear universal coverage\u201d and \u201clower[ing] health insurance premiums,\u201d the ACA relies on three interrelated policies: insurance market reforms prohibiting insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on an individual\u2019s health status, the individual mandate, and subsidies to individuals purchasing insurance in the individual market. These policies, the government and dissent explain, are like the legs of a threelegged stool; remove any one, and the ACA will collapse. . . . Given this structure, the government and dissent argue that it is \u201cinconceivable\u201d to think Congress would have risked the ACA\u2019s stability by making subsidies conditional on states establishing Exchanges. Yet the supposedly unthinkable scenario the government and dissent describe\u2014one in which insurers in states with federal Exchanges remain subject to the community rating and guaranteed issue requirements but lack a broad base of healthy customers to stabilize prices and avoid adverse selection\u2014is exactly what the ACA enacts in such federal territories as the Northern Mariana Islands, where the Act imposes guaranteed issue and community rating requirements without an individual mandate. This combination, predictably, has thrown individual insurance markets in the territories into turmoil. . . . The CLASS Act and the provisions applicable to the territories attest that Congress twice did exactly what the government and the dissent insist it never would: introduce significant adverse selection risk to insurance markets. This is not to say that as Congress did in the CLASS Act and territories, so too must it have done in section 36B; perhaps Congress was willing to tolerate risks in those corners of the insurance market that it never would tolerate at its core. But perhaps not. The point is that we don\u2019t know, and in asking us to ignore the best evidence of Congress\u2019s intent\u2014the text of section 36B\u2014in favor of assumptions about the risks that Congress would or would not tolerate\u2014assumptions doubtlessly influenced by hindsight\u2014the government and dissent in effect urge us to substitute our judgment for Congress\u2019s. We refuse. As the Supreme Court explained just this term, \u201can agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.\u201d And neither may we. \u201cThe role of th[e] [c]ourt is to apply the statute as it is written\u2014even if we think some other approach might \u2018accor[d] with good policy.\u2019\u201d\n\nJudge Griffith\u2019s opinion is a model of careful statutory interpretation. Judge Edwards\u2019s opinion is also worth reading as an example of how to smuggle policy into textual interpretation. These two opinions clearly demarcate the legal battle lines for these cases (such as the Fourth Circuit\u2019s King v. Burwell and two cases still working their way through the district courts).\n\nNow that the panel has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, the government is expected to seek review of this decision by the en banc D.C. Circuit, which the administration has worked very hard to pack with friendly judges. But to me, it\u2019s no longer clear that the en banc Circuit would actually want to rehear this case. To reverse Judge Griffith\u2019s opinion, which carefully lays out decades of D.C. Circuit statutory interpretation precedent, the en banc court would be effectively unsettling its own precedent on a vast scale. Furthermore, endorsing Judge Edwards\u2019s use of policy considerations to create statutory ambiguity effectively leaves Chevron shorn of its first step (the finding of ambiguity) in the vast majority of cases where Congress compromises a single-minded policy goal for the purpose of passing legislation. There may be other downsides to reversing this opinion, so right now, I\u2019m not entirely sure the en banc D.C. Circuit will want to open up that can of worms.

This post will examine how Judge Griffith and Judge Edwards answer those questions.\n\nJudge Griffith took what one might call a \u201ctextualist\u201d approach, reasoning from the text and its meaning and rebutting the alternative interpretations. Judge Randolph\u2019s concurring opinion agreed and made the sharper point that an exchange established by the federal government cannot possibly be an exchange established by the state, and that \u201cto hold otherwise would be to engage in distortion, not interpretation.\u201d Judge Edwards, as predicted, took the broadest interpretation of the ACA, relying on a broad understanding of the ACA\u2019s purpose and policy, which he then used to trigger Chevron deference. (Somewhat oddly, Judge Edwards directs most of his fire at the appellants, not the majority opinion.)\n\nJudge Griffith\u2019s majority opinion recognized the relationship between the Constitution and the court\u2019s duty to focus on the statutory text, noting that the Constitution \u201cassigns the legislative power to Congress, and Congress alone, see U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1, and legislating often entails compromises that courts must respect.\u201d The only legal instrument that triggers the executive\u2019s responsibility to execute it \u2014 a bill that passes both houses of Congress and is signed or acceded to by the president \u2014 is the statutory text. Because legally binding compromises can result in the passage of statutory text, the statutory text is the proper focal point for the courts.\n\nNevertheless, Judge Griffith pointed out what he called a \u201cfork\u201d in the D.C. Circuit\u2019s precedent regarding legislative history. One of those forks includes the traditional rule that if the statutory text is unambiguous, there is no need to resort to legislative history. The other fork, from a case called Sierra Club v. EPA (D.C. Cir. 2008), commended legislative history \u201cto shed new light on congressional intent, notwithstanding statutory language that appears superficially clear.\u201d (As a side note, a quick review of the precedent cited for Sierra Club\u2019s search for \u201cnew light\u201d in legislative history finds little support in Supreme Court precedent. It appears to be an artifact of in-circuit debate.)\n\n\nJudge Griffith also noted the limitations on the use of legislative history under Sierra Club. First, the clear language of a statute doesn\u2019t receive a different meaning simply because legislative history doesn\u2019t repeat the statutory terms. As Judge Griffith put it, \u201cits purpose is not to confirm already clear text; clear text speaks for itself and requires no \u2018amen\u2019 in the historical record.\u201d\n\nSecond, if the statute\u2019s plain language might lead to an \u201codd result\u201d (and there\u2019s lots of wiggle room in defining what counts as \u201codd\u201d), the court asks whether the legislative history is \u201cdemonstrably at odds with the intentions\u201d of the drafters.\u00a0 This means that there has to be some significant discrepancy between the text and intent that is provable from the legislative record, not based on post hoc rationalizations. Because the legislative history was silent on these issues, the majority concluded that the government had no way to demonstrate, rather than presuppose, what the drafters were intending to accomplish with particular provisions.\n\nJudge Edwards, by contrast, sought to discern a single, unifying purpose behind the ACA\u2019s matrix of interlocking provisions. The first part of his analysis attacked the argument that Congress could have intended to create perverse incentives by allowing exchanges to fail in states without exchanges. The rest of his opinion repeatedly invoked the whole-act canon. Based on these principles, Judge Edwards argued that the meaning of \u201cExchange\u201d in \u201cExchange established by the State\u201d comes from a different provision defining \u201cExchange\u201d to include federally-created exchanges, and that in total, the result is ambiguous.\n\nJudge Edwards also reasoned that the plain meaning of \u201cestablished by the State\u201d is implausible because allowing tax subsidies only to states that establish exchanges \u201cwould destroy the fundamental policy structure and goals of the ACA that are apparent when the statute is read as a whole,\u201d that is, from a birds-eye view. Having constructed an ambiguity, then, Judge Edwards concluded that the IRS\u2019s interpretation should receive Chevron deference.\n\nBut Judge Griffith\u2019s counterargument on this point is devastating. I can\u2019t do better than to simply quote (sans citations and footnotes):\n\n\nThe government, together with the dissent, also leans heavily on a more abstract form of legislative history\u2014Congress\u2019s broad purpose in passing the ACA\u2014urging the court to view section 36B through the lens of the ACA\u2019s economic theory and ultimate aims. They emphasize that to achieve the goals of \u201cnear universal coverage\u201d and\u00a0 \u201clower[ing] health insurance premiums,\u201d the ACA relies on three interrelated policies: insurance market reforms prohibiting insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on an individual\u2019s health status, the individual mandate, and subsidies to individuals purchasing insurance in the individual market. These policies, the government and dissent explain, are like the legs of a threelegged stool; remove any one, and the ACA will collapse. . . . Given this structure, the government and dissent argue that it is \u201cinconceivable\u201d to think Congress would have risked the ACA\u2019s stability by making subsidies conditional on states establishing Exchanges.\n\nYet the supposedly unthinkable scenario the government and dissent describe\u2014one in which insurers in states with federal Exchanges remain subject to the community rating and guaranteed issue requirements but lack a broad base of healthy customers to stabilize prices and avoid adverse selection\u2014is exactly what the ACA enacts in such federal territories as the Northern Mariana Islands, where the Act imposes guaranteed issue and community rating requirements without an individual mandate. This combination, predictably, has thrown individual insurance markets in the territories into turmoil. . . .\n\nThe CLASS Act and the provisions applicable to the territories attest that Congress twice did exactly what the government and the dissent insist it never would: introduce significant adverse selection risk to insurance markets. This is not to say that as Congress did in the CLASS Act and territories, so too must it have done in section 36B; perhaps Congress was willing to tolerate risks in those corners of the insurance market that it never would tolerate at its core. But perhaps not. The point is that we don\u2019t know, and in asking us to ignore the best evidence of Congress\u2019s intent\u2014the text of section 36B\u2014in favor of assumptions about the risks that Congress would or would not tolerate\u2014assumptions doubtlessly influenced by hindsight\u2014the government and dissent in effect urge us to substitute our judgment for Congress\u2019s. We refuse. As the Supreme Court explained just this term, \u201can agency may not rewrite clear statutory terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should operate.\u201d And neither may we. \u201cThe role of th[e] [c]ourt is to apply the statute as it is written\u2014even if we think some other approach might \u2018accor[d] with good policy.\u2019\u201d\n\n\nJudge Griffith\u2019s opinion is a model of careful statutory interpretation. Judge Edwards\u2019s opinion is also worth reading as an example of how to smuggle policy into textual interpretation. These two opinions clearly demarcate the legal battle lines for these cases (such as the Fourth Circuit\u2019s King v. Burwell and two cases still working their way through the district courts).\n\nNow that the panel has ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, the government is expected to seek review of this decision by the en banc D.C. Circuit, which the administration has worked very hard to pack with friendly judges. But to me, it\u2019s no longer clear that the en banc Circuit would actually want to rehear this case. To reverse Judge Griffith\u2019s opinion, which carefully lays out decades of D.C. Circuit statutory interpretation precedent, the en banc court would be effectively unsettling its own precedent on a vast scale.\u00a0Furthermore, endorsing Judge Edwards\u2019s use of policy considerations to create statutory ambiguity effectively leaves Chevron shorn of its first step (the finding of ambiguity) in the vast majority of cases where Congress compromises a single-minded policy goal for the purpose of passing legislation. There may be other downsides to reversing this opinion, so right now, I\u2019m not entirely sure the en banc D.C. Circuit will want\u00a0to open up that can of worms.
