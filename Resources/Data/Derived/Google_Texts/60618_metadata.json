Offerings include a \"Detox Salad\" with organic kale, quinoa, fennel, fruits and beans served in white balsamic vinaigrette. The company already operates 11 other kiosks in the Chicago area, focusing on local and organic ingredients with the relatively new SPE Certification for nutritional quality.\n\nThe offerings are made fresh each morning and the machines are cleared out and stocked with new items at 10 a.m. Unsold items go to a local food pantry, according to the Farmer's Fridge website.\n\nSalads, breakfast items and snacks are priced from $3 to $12. Protein add-ons for the salads, such as lemon-pepper chicken, can be purchased separately from the kiosk. The salad vending machine will be in the Chicago Marriott O'Hare for the next five months for testing with guests.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "Responding to a request from a millennial, Marriott is testing a new grab-and-go healthy option for its lobby.", "author": "Amy Langfield", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Responding to a request from a millennial, Marriott is testing a new grab-and-go healthy option for its lobby.", "title": "Vending machine salad aims to sprout a hotel trend", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/12/would-you-buy-a-salad-from-a-vending-machine.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/09/10/101989755-farmers-fridge-salad.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Responding to a request from a millennial, Marriott is testing a new grab-and-go healthy option for its lobby.", "title": "Would you buy a salad from a vending machine?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/12/would-you-buy-a-salad-from-a-vending-machine.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/09/10/101989755-farmers-fridge-salad.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@AmyLangfield", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Road Warrior, Life, Road Warrior, Business Travel, Travel, Hotels Resorts and Cruise Lines, Hotels Restaurants and Leisure, US: News, Consumer, Food Retail, Food and Beverage, Marriott International Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-09-13T13:00:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Road Warrior", "modified_time": "2014-09-13T13:04:15-0400", "tag": "Marriott International Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 101985272, "news_keywords": "salad, healthy eating, business travel, Chicago foods"}, "article_summary": "Marriott is taking advice from its guests and experimenting with an unexpected twist in its lobby: a salad vending machine.\nThe salad vending machine will be in the Chicago Marriott O'Hare for the next five months for testing with guests.\nChecking into your hotel late and tired sometimes means the depressing last, best option for food is the vending machine next to the ice machine.\n\"Consumers are trained not to expect fresh food out of a vending machine,\" said Dave Henkes, vice president at the food industry research firm Technomic.\nRead MoreStacked, smothered: Why fast food's stayed extremeWhat guests see is not a regular vending machine, but a kiosk of colorfully layered salads, stocked fresh daily by Chicago start-up Farmer's Fridge."}
