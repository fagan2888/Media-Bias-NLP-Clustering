Doug Collins\u2019 (R-Ga.) pressed in front of the committee, saying that the process \u201cdid not sufficiently protect customers, and pharmacy competition.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe PBM industry, now dominated by Express Scripts, has proven its ability to drive independent pharmacists out of business, increase employer costs on prescription benefits, and force patients into mail-order programs, all while producing record profits for themselves.\n\nPatients have been most impacted by widespread mandatory mail-order pharmacy programs established by PBMs, programs which Collins critiqued. Patients, particularly rural ones, increasingly are losing pharmacy choice and their connections with local pharmacists, while long-time community businesses are forced to close their doors.\n\nA study published by the Journal of Managed Care Pharmacy this fall examined the attitudes of seniors on mandatory mail-order, particularly looking at the experiences of rural seniors. Some common concerns express were losing their pharmacy of choice, running out of medications, not receiving the proper medications, or losing the ability to consult a pharmacist. A staggering 83.7 percent of respondents said they would oppose mandatory mail order if it meant that their local community pharmacy would need to close.\n\nMeanwhile, several recent stories have highlighted employers who discovered that large PBMs like Express Scripts have quietly been driving up their benefits costs, hidden under the lack of transparency typical in PBM contracts. After one year with Express Scripts, for example, Meridian Health Systems, Inc. saw its prescription benefits costs for employees rise by $1.3 million. The City of Houston also recently announced that they were overcharged by $3.7 million by Cigna for their employee pharmacy benefits.\n\nFriday\u2019s hearing, though, produces hope for patients, employers, and pharmacists frustrated with an oppressive industry with seemingly unending power. Collins avowed to the committee and FTC Chairwoman Ramirez that if nothing else would be done to protect patients and pharmacists, Congress would be forced to step in.\n\nPolicymakers should follow Collins\u2019 lead and address the impacts of a growing industry that impacts so many and has benefitted from little oversight and regulation.\n\nWallace is the president of Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency, a coalition of more than 1,000 pharmacists dedicated to exposing secretive and unethical practices in the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) industry.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "On Friday (Nov. 15), the House Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on the state of antitrust enforcement, where committee members raised concerns about the controversial 2012 merger of Express Scripts Inc. and Medco, which created the country\u2019s largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM).", "description": "On Friday (Nov. 15), the House Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on the state of antitrust enforcement, where committee members raised concerns about the controversial 2012 merger of Express Scripts Inc. and Medco, which created the country\u2019s largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM).", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "On Friday (Nov. 15), the House Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on the state of antitrust enforcement, where committee members raised concerns about the controversial 2012 merger of Express Scripts Inc. and Medco, which created the country\u2019s largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM).", "title": "Lawmaker exposes pharmacy benefits abuses", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/191083-lawmaker-exposes-pharmacy-benefits-abuses", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:40:00-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:40-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/191083-lawmaker-exposes-pharmacy-benefits-abuses", "dcterms.date": "2013-11-21T14:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Jason Wallace", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-21T14:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:40:00-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/191083-lawmaker-exposes-pharmacy-benefits-abuses", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "On Friday (Nov. 15), the House Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on the state of antitrust enforcement, where committee members raised concerns about the controversial 2012 merger of Express Scripts Inc. and Medco, which created the country\u2019s largest pharmacy benefit manager (PBM).", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmaker exposes pharmacy benefits abuses"}, "dcterms.title": "Lawmaker exposes pharmacy benefits abuses"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb75d\"", "article_summary": "After one year with Express Scripts, for example, Meridian Health Systems, Inc. saw its prescription benefits costs for employees rise by $1.3 million.\nPatients have been most impacted by widespread mandatory mail-order pharmacy programs established by PBMs, programs which Collins critiqued.\nThe City of Houston also recently announced that they were overcharged by $3.7 million by Cigna for their employee pharmacy benefits.\nWallace is the president of Pharmacists United for Truth and Transparency, a coalition of more than 1,000 pharmacists dedicated to exposing secretive and unethical practices in the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) industry.\nPatients, particularly rural ones, increasingly are losing pharmacy choice and their connections with local pharmacists, while long-time community businesses are forced to close their doors."}
