The issues have ranged widely \u2014 from the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act to whether a fish is a tangible object. Court watchers usually analyze and predict how the justices will vote by reading the tea leaves \u2014 dissecting precedent, legal briefs and oral arguments. But floating in those leaves is also some hard data.\n\nOn Wednesday, the court hears oral arguments in the case Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch. This is our quantified look \u2014 what we\u2019re calling \u201cPriors and Precedent\u201d \u2014 at what may come of the case. But first, some background.\n\nMore Politics\n\nThe Case\n\nIn 2008, 17-year-old Samantha Elauf applied for a job at an Abercrombie Kids store at the Woodland Hills Mall in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She interviewed for a position \u2014 what Abercrombie & Fitch calls a \u201cmodel\u201d \u2014 on the sales floor. Elauf, a Muslim woman, wore a hijab to her interview. At the time, wearing a hijab in that position would have violated Abercrombie\u2019s \u201cLook Policy.\u201d The policy was meant to showcase Abercrombie\u2019s brand, which \u201cexemplifies a classic East Coast collegiate style of clothing,\u201d according to court documents. As a result, Elauf was given a poor score \u2014 1 out of 3 \u2014 on the \u201cappearance\u201d section of her interview assessment and was not hired. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency charged with enforcing employment discrimination laws, sued on Elauf\u2019s behalf. The EEOC argued that Abercrombie had violated discrimination laws by failing to provide Elauf with religious accommodation.\n\nIn October, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled for the company. Judge Jerome Holmes wrote in his opinion that even though she wore it to her interview, \u201cMs. Elauf never informed Abercrombie prior to its hiring decision that she wore her headscarf or \u2018hijab\u2019 for religious reasons and that she needed an accommodation for that practice.\u201d\n\nSo the question now before the Supreme Court is one of information and explication: Is an employer liable only if it received an explicit notice from an applicant or employee about a required religious accommodation? Or is explicit notice unnecessary?\n\nThis is not the first time that Abercrombie has found itself in this kind of hot water. It settled a class-action discrimination lawsuit \u2014 brought by female, Hispanic, black and Asian applicants and employees \u2014 in 2005 for $40 million and agreed to institute policies to promote diversity in its workforce. In 2008, the EEOC sued Abercrombie in a case that is similar to the one before the court now. Abercrombie argued that Halla Banafa\u2019s hijab would \u201cplace an undue hardship on its business.\u201d And in 2011, a woman sued Abercrombie-owned Hollister after she was fired from the clothing store for refusing to remove her headscarf. That woman, Umme-Hani Khan, filed an amicus brief in the current case in support of Elauf.\n\nThe Combatants\n\nIn one corner, arguing the case for the EEOC, is Deputy Solicitor General Ian H. Gershengorn. He has previously argued before the court six times. His record: 2-4. And in the other corner, for Abercrombie, Shay Dvoretzky, a partner at Jones Day. He has argued before the court once before and lost.\n\nThe Cases Like This One\n\nHow often does the court hear cases like this one? Before the current term, the Roberts court had heard 119 civil rights cases, according to The Supreme Court Database. This case volume is graphed below. Of those, 56 were decided in a liberal direction and 62 in a conservative direction (one case was not coded).\n\nMore specifically, the Roberts court had heard just 15 employment discrimination cases. Of those, nine were decided in a liberal direction, and six in a conservative direction. (A liberal decision in this case would be in favor of Elauf.)\n\nThe Predictions\n\nAs I\u2019ve written before, Supreme Court prediction is a tricky business \u2014 but that hasn\u2019t stopped many from trying. And here at FiveThirtyEight, we love predictions, so let\u2019s take a look.\n\nHere I\u2019ll turn to two sources: the {Marshall}+ algorithm \u2014 a computer program designed specifically to predict court cases \u2014 and the wisdom of the crowd at FantasySCOTUS \u2014 fantasy baseball\u2019s even nerdier little brother. This is how likely those predictors view a Supreme Court reversal vote from each justice \u2014 a reversal would be a win for the EEOC and Elauf.\n\nThe predictions are all over the place, and most are made with little confidence \u2014 the likelihood of many justices voting to reverse the 10th Circuit decision hovers near the middle.\n\nThe computer algorithm foresees a 7-2 reversal, with Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas dissenting. The crowd predicts the opposite \u2014 a 9-0 affirm as of Tuesday morning, but with a few justices more or less on the fence. And not everyone in the crowd agrees. \u201cAs it stands now, some of our best players are across the map on this case,\u201d Josh Blackman, FantasySCOTUS\u2019s creator, told me.\n\nThe crowd predictions may well improve. Some predictors will pore over the oral argument transcript looking for clues in the justices\u2019 questions. But there\u2019s only one way to find out what\u2019ll happen for sure \u2014 wait. The court will likely issue its decision in this case in June.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Supreme Court hears about 80 cases each year \u2014 and a guessing game is attached to nearly every one.
