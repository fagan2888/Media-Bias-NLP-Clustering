It’s a good thing for the White House that weekly magazines such as Time and Newsweek (now digital only) are no longer hugely influential in Washington or around the nation. The latest cover of Time would have deeply troubled – and irritated – the Obama administration.

The entire cover is taken up a big pill, split in half, with the blaring headline “Broken Promise” underneath. If an image is worth a thousand words, the Time cover is very wordy indeed.

The article is more even-handed. Yet the portrait offered by the writer, Time managing editor Nancy Gibbs, is not a pretty one, and she makes the obvious point that the fate of Barack Obama’s presidency hinges on his ability to Rx the problem.

Two decades ago – or even just 10 years ago – the kind of damning cover like that would have set off multiple fire alarms in the White House. One famous cover by Newsweek in 1987, showed a picture of then-Vice President George H.W. Bush and asked whether he was “Fighting the Wimp Factor.”

Bush still managed to win the presidency in 1988, but the the silly notion of him being a wimp bedeviled him throughout his term. He was so outraged by the cover that he froze out the main Newsweek reporter and was still seething about the incident years after he left the White House.

Although Time is no longer a media titan, the magazine still has more than 3 million paid subscribers and it sits on the shelves of thousands of book stores, drug stores and supermarkets. The White House is probably hoping the week goes by very fast.
