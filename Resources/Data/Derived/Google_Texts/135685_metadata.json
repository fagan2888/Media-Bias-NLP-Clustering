Oh, and also to Politico\u2019s round-up of Democrats wondering why someone who\u2019s so often touted as a brilliantly eloquent orator can\u2019t seem to sell the public on anything except his own personal awesomeness. (Headline: \u201cThe \u2018meh\u2019 of a salesman.\u201d) As usual, Nancy is eye-to-eye with reality.\n\nSilver lining: A reporter asking a big-name Democrat why righties dislike Obama is almost always bait to accuse them of racism. She doesn\u2019t take it. Second look at Pelosi?\n\nThroughout a 50-minute interview on Thursday in her second-floor Capitol office, where the late Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill used to receive supplicants, Pelosi was sharply derisive about the scorn Republicans have for this president. \u201cYou know why it is,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know why it is. He\u2019s brilliant, \u2026 he thinks in a strategic way in how to get something done \u2026 and he\u2019s completely eloquent. That\u2019s a package that they don\u2019t like.\u201d\u2026 Then she added a line that she has used before, that drives Republicans batty: \u201cHe has been \u2026 open, practically apolitical, certainly nonpartisan, in terms of welcoming every idea and solution. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons the Republicans want to take him down politically, because they know he is a nonpartisan president, and that\u2019s something very hard for them to cope with.\u201d\n\n\u201cPractically apolitical\u201d \u2014 the guy who couldn\u2019t bear to cancel his speech Monday dumping on Republicans over the financial crisis while the rest of the country was waiting to see how bad the massacre at the Navy Yard would be. And while normally I\u2019d cut her slack on grounds that she\u2019s duty bound as a party leader to spout flattering nonsense about a Democratic president, I can\u2019t believe she\u2019d praise his strategic acumen after three solid weeks of White House idiocy on Syria. He had no strategy in first announcing the \u201cred line\u201d; he had no strategy on what to do if it was crossed; he had no strategy to win over reluctant members of Congress from both parties to support an attack; and he had no strategy to extricate himself from the whole mess until Putin laid one on his plate. Egypt is almost as bad: His \u201cstrategy\u201d in dumping Mubarak was to realign the U.S. with the populists of the Arab Spring, and then when that turned predictably to crap under the Muslim Brotherhood, he didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nThe punchline is that it\u2019s probably partly because Obama sees himself the way Pelosi does, as a brilliantly eloquent rhetorician, that he doesn\u2019t take more care strategically. From the beginning, his politics has always placed the image of Obama the man as a uniquely inspirational, transformational figure at the core of Hopenchange, beyond any set of policies. And who could blame him? He got elected president by being a good talker; he won a Nobel Peace Prize for blathering on the stump about how he was going to do things differently internationally than Bush, the thought of which gets funnier every day. He gave a big speech in Cairo in 2009 and has pronounced upon the glories of ObamaCare near-weekly since 2010, so naturally those two things were going to work out for him. Strategy is important, sort of, but with The One throwing the full force of his brand behind those initiatives, they were bound to turn out well. And here we are.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cYou know why it is.
