Then the mind kicks in, trying to make sense of what the heart can\u2019t abide, we ask, \u201cWhy? Why? Why? What made this person murder themselves?\u201d\n\nJust days after Robin Williams\u2019 suicide, when many are still reeling from his tragic death, Urban Samurai has opened Marsha Norman\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning play, \u201d \u2018Night, Mother,\u201d at the New Century Theatre in downtown Minneapolis. The timing couldn\u2019t be better.\n\nThe two-person show grapples with suicide \u2014 and the depression that sparks it \u2014 with moving performances by Tina Sigel as Thelma and Marcia Svaleson as Jessie, her daughter.\n\nJessie asks for her Mom\u2019s help in finding her late father\u2019s pistol, ostensibly for protection against robbers, but soon admits to her mother that \u201cthe gun is for me.\u201d\n\nShe preps her Mom for her loss, trying to download all of the daily details the older woman will need to handle in order to survive and move forward, since Jessie has been taking care of things in their shared home.\n\nGradually, the play reveals the lives of the two that have brought them to this point.\n\nThere are ironies. The mother kept things from Jessie that she learns only now as she\u2019s planning to leave her life \u2014 while Jessie also has kept her mother in the dark about the depth of her pain. They are more honest with each other than ever, because this might be their last chance to speak.\n\nWhile the older woman admits that she fears death and will have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the darkness, Jessie wants to embrace the peace she thinks she\u2019ll find by moving beyond her sad life and epileptic body.\n\nThelma isn\u2019t always kind as she rages against the dying of her daughter\u2019s light, trying to stop her by any means possible. And Jessie\u2019s intended \u201ckindness\u201d in preparing her mother for her death seems to make her exit even harder for her mother than if she had simply left a note.\n\nThere is a stirring, melancholy humanity in Matt Greseth\u2019s direction, which juxtaposes the mundane, everyday with a larger catastrophic arc. It makes suicide become concrete and real, in spite of our urge to reject it as an act and deny it as a possibility \u2014 and it opens the door a crack into the dark room of depression.\n\nBut at the end, we are left wondering, still. Is there ever an answer to the \u201cwhy\u201d of suicide that will satisfy?
