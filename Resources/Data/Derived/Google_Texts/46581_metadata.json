Although science has always known that there were genetic variables for both male and female puberty, the recent study has \u201clifted the lid as to how complex\u201d this genetic influence really is.\n\nGenetic Roadmap\n\nAt birth, a child\u2019s future is unknown and filled with nothing but the blind ambition of the proud parents. Perhaps our future, though mysterious, isn\u2019t as arbitrary as once believed. With each passing year, the science of genetics has revealed how much of our future is already written out in our genome. The recent study, currently published in the journal Nature, has shown that the age at which a girl reaches sexual maturity is part of our genetic roadmap, predetermined by \u201cimprinted genes,\u201d a small subset of genes whose activity differs depending on which parent passes them on. Lead author, Dr. John Perry, told Medical Daily that \u201cfrom a biological perspective, it\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d but it\u2019s the possible implication these genes have on female health that are truly intriguing.\n\nComplex Biology\n\nThe study integrated the genetic data from 180,000 women in Europe or from European decent, according to a recent press release. By using this information, researchers were able to identify 123 genetic variations associated with the timing of a girl\u2019s first menstrual cycle. \u201cWe were pretty surprised by just how involved the biology is,\u201d explained Perry. The Cambridge researcher went on to explain how, at first, his team hypothesized the trigger for puberty \u201cmust be a fairly simple thing,\u201d but later found that \u201cit probably involves hundreds if not thousands of genes in the genome.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s Health\n\nScience has associated early menstruation with the occurrence of disease later in life, but the reasoning for this correlation has remained unknown. For women, early puberty can contribute to increased risks for developing diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer later in life. \u201cThe genetic findings confirm strong biological links between faster weight gain, or overweight, and higher risk of early puberty \u2014 and these women will retain the tendency to overweight throughout adult life,\u201d Dr. Ken Ong, senior author of the study explained to Medical Daily.\n\nHe hopes that further understanding this link between early puberty and increased risk for certain health complications will help researchers \u201cto hopefully one day break this link.\u201d Perry added that knowing the triggers and what the links are is essential to helping figure out ways to reduce the risk for later life disease.\n\nGenetic Predisposition?\n\nOften individuals may have an increased likelihood of developing a particular disease because of what doctors call a genetic predisposition. Although these genes can contribute to the development of the condition, they are not the direct cause of it. Oftentimes, some people with a certain genetic variation will never develop the condition, while other times the entire family with be stricken with the same disease. Breast cancer\u2019s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are probably the most easily identified by the public as genetic precursors for disease, but science has identified specific genes linked to other conditions such as obesity, heart disease, and mental illness.\n\nNext Step\n\nThis study is only the first step in a long journey to understanding the role that genetics play in certain diseases. Perry explained that next his team planned on identifying more genes and increasing the number of genetic variants in genes discovered. The team also plans on looking at more rare variants and genes belonging to women of different ancestry roots.\n\nThe researchers are also interested in puberty genes linked with health risks in males. Perry explained how the genes his team identified are not gender specific and can go on to influence puberty in either sex. Unfortunately, collecting data on the beginning of male puberty is much more ambitious. Most men cannot accurately recall the age at which their voice broke or started to grow hair under their arms. \u201cAs much as we\u2019d love to do these experiments in men, it's very difficult,\u201d Perry explained. Although the process of collecting data from the male population may prove to be tedious, Perry insists that it is a future project that he will definitely attempt to tackle.\n\nSource: Perry JRB, Day F, Elks CE.
