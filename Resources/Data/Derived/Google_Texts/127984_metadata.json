The video is quickly going viral and giving the world a glimpse of just how bleak the situation in West Africa has become.\n\nDr. Richard Besser, ABC\u2019s chief health and medical editor, who is currently working in Liberia, says Monrovia is currently a city where \u201cif you die from Ebola, they are very quick for you. If you\u2019re living and you need help, there\u2019s really nowhere to go.\u201d The doctor and his camera crew were able to witness this sad truth firsthand when they came across the \u201ccorpse\u201d of a dead man on the side of a busy city road, ABC News reported.\n\nThose surrounding the dead man told Besser that they had twice contacted local hospitals to get the dying man help, but their pleas were ignored. \u201cWe couldn't get him help when he was alive. They only come when you die,\u201d a community leader told ABC News.\n\nAs men wearing protective suits sprayed the area with bleach and began to wrap what they believed to be a dead body in plastic, the man moved his arm. \"He's alive,\" someone yelled, and the surrounding crowd began to cheer. Shortly after, an ambulance arrived to take the man away, but with no more space left in hospitals, it\u2019s unclear where the man was taken.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ebola, zombie, good, morning, america, captures, ebola, victim, come, back, alive, moments", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Good Morning America's camera crew captured a man on the side of the road as he began moving moments before his cremation.", "title": "News Crew Captures Ebola Victim 'Come Back Alive' Moments Before Cremation [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ebola-zombie-good-morning-america-captures-ebola-victim-come-back-alive-moments-cremation-306169", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/03/ebola-man.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Good Morning America's camera crew captured a man on the side of the road as he began moving moments before his cremation.", "title": "News Crew Captures Ebola Victim 'Come Back Alive' Moments Before Cremation [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ebola-zombie-good-morning-america-captures-ebola-victim-come-back-alive-moments-cremation-306169", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/03/ebola-man.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/03/ebola-man.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-03T10:47:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-04T09:59:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Good Morning America's camera crew captured a man on the side of the road as he began moving moments before his cremation."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddff6\"", "article_summary": "Those surrounding the dead man told Besser that they had twice contacted local hospitals to get the dying man help, but their pleas were ignored.\nThe video is quickly going viral and giving the world a glimpse of just how bleak the situation in West Africa has become.\nShortly after, an ambulance arrived to take the man away, but with no more space left in hospitals, it\u2019s unclear where the man was taken.\n\"He's alive,\" someone yelled, and the surrounding crowd began to cheer.\nTo the surprise of GMA's crew, a corpse they were filming sprung back to life moments before it was hauled into a truck on the way to the crematorium."}
