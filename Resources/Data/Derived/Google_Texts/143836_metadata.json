A whopping 53% of Tea Party identifiers were in favor of seceding.\n\nAmong the leading reasons given was anger with Obama. These people DO realize that there\u2019s an election in a couple years, shortly after which Obama won\u2019t be president, no? Or that if they secede while Obama still is president, that they\u2019re going to be totally bat-sh** preoccupied with the fear that Obama is planning to order the US military to invade them?\n\nOther reasons were Obamacare, immigration and even the threat of Isis and terrorist groups. Apparently some folks think the sheriff of Mayberry is more equipped to deal with Islamic radicals than the federal government. But if these southwest states think they have border control problems now, wait\u2019ll they secede and have to protect their borders from people coming in from Montana, Mississippi and California.\n\nIllogically, but not surprisingly, many of the \u201cmost-want-to-leave\u201d states are those that receive more money from the federal government than they contribute, and the ones with the highest loyalty to the US are the exact opposite, doling out more tax dollars than they reap in. Greater minds than mine have tried to explain this peculiar phenomenon and failed, so I won\u2019t try, other than to exasperate, \u201cHey, you Red States that want to break away from the US so you can \u2018stand on your own,\u2019 why don\u2019t you try doing it first before proclaiming you want your independence?\u201d\n\nPersonally, I think the pollsters asked the wrong question. A much more revealing \u2013 and fun \u2013 question would\u2019ve been asking Blue State citizens \u201cHow would you feel about some Red States seceding?\u201d and likewise, asking the \u201cReds,\u201d \u201cWould you be heartbroken if a couple of those blue northeastern states broke away from the country (or happened to fall into the ocean)?\u201d\n\nI think a pretty high percentage of respondents from both sides would answer \u201cHey, don\u2019t let the Constitution hit you on the way out!\u201d\n\nEven more fun would be polling \u201cIf you could throw out ONE state, which one would you pick?\u201d\n\nBecause, boy, peering across that Great Political Divide really is like looking at another country, and not one that we\u2019re particularly enamored of. Many in the blue states look at their \u201cred\u201d neighbors as a bunch of ignorant, intolerant religious fundamentalists with a serious cholesterol problem. While those in the red states regard their blue state counterparts as godless \u201cred\u201d \u2013as in communist \u2013sympathizers who favor \u201cbig gubmint,\u201d socialized everything, gay marriage and unilateral disarmament (gun control). We have as much in common as those relatives we share a table with once a year at Thanksgiving dinner and want to shove a turkey leg down their throat within a half hour. Really, the only thing that keeps this country together is that we live far apart from each other. \u201cBlues\u201d don\u2019t call \u2018em the \u201cfly-over\u201d states for nothing.\n\nObviously this is over-generalizing, and even the reddest of states like Texas and Louisiana have pockets of blue, like Austin and New Orleans, and the blue states likewise have red linings, mostly outside the major urban areas.\n\nBut when you get down to it, the one thing that virtually guarantees states will never secede from the United States is apathy. How are you EVER going to get a majority of residents to vote to leave, when a majority of eligible voters don\u2019t vote? Large segments nationwide can\u2019t even name their senators and congressional representatives and furthermore, don\u2019t care.\n\nWe\u2019re \u201cone nation, indivisible,\u201d although a lot of people don\u2019t know what \u201cindivisible\u201d means.\n\nThe Union remains strong. We have apathy and ignorance on our side.\n\nRelated articles", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Article 3", "description": "Now that the results are in and Scotland has decided to remain in the (slightly less) United Kingdom, it\u2019s time to make the story about us, so Reuters has conveniently released the results of a poll of some 9,000 Americans indicating that about \u00bc of them nationwide are in favor of their state seceding from the United States.
