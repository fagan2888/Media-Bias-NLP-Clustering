Ted Cruz \u2014 are looking at the Republican majority as the party\u2019s best chances of rolling back the clock on the federal health care package. Recent polls, too, have shown Obamacare has taken some popularity dings with the American people and that many now wish for a rewind button on the law.\n\nRecognizing these survey findings, Mr. Obama did say he would be amenable to making \u201cresponsible changes [to] make it work better,\u201d he said, Newsmax reported. He also added: \u201cThere\u2019s no law that has ever been passed that is perfect.\u201d\n\nBut Republican leaders may have some different views \u2014 and different ideas about what legislative direction that Obamacare should take.\n\n\u201cIf I had the ability, obviously I\u2019d get rid of it,\u201d said presumptive incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in his own news conference about an hour before the president\u2019s, Newsmax reported. \u201cIt\u2019s not secret that every one of my members thinks Obamacare was a huge legislative mistake.\u201d\n\nHe suggested that an outright repeal may not be feasible, but that Republicans would definitely take a piecemeal approach to dismantle it.\n\n\u201c[We\u2019ll strike at the bits] that are tremendously unpopular with the American people,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, Newsmax reported.\n\nSpecifically, he cited the individual mandate and the medical device tax.\n\nhttp://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Obamacare-Mitch-McConnell-Congress-GOP/2014/11/05/id/605518/", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama summoned his inner Yoda to say, post-Election Day party drubbing and in rather backward grammatical fashion, that no matter how many new Republican faces come to Capitol Hill, he's not repealing Obamacare.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama summoned his inner Yoda to say, post-Election Day party drubbing and in rather backward grammatical fashion, that no matter how many new Republican faces come to Capitol Hill, he\u2019s not repealing Obamacare.", "title": "Obama goes Yoda on Obamacare: \u2018Repeal of the law, I won\u2019t sign\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/6/obama-goes-yoda-on-obamacare-repeal-of-the-law-i-w/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/05/115_2014_obama-98201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/05/115_2014_obama-98201.jpg", "description": "President Obama summoned his inner Yoda to say, post-Election Day party drubbing and in rather backward grammatical fashion, that no matter how many new Republican faces come to Capitol Hill, he's not", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama goes Yoda on Obamacare: \u2018Repeal of the law, I won\u2019t"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
