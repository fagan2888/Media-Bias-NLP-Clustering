I\u2019m about 95 percent. I\u2019m not at 100 percent yet, and I say that because I mess up and have a little mental error on the field sometimes,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nThomas caught three passes for 24 yards in a preseason game at Houston last week, but misfired with quarterback Peyton Manning on multiple routes. In Saturday\u2019s presason game against the 49eers, the first string offense figures to play a half or 30 plays, whichever comes first. The extra repetitions should improve timing and execution, particularly on third down, where the starters went 1-for-5 last week.\n\n\u201cWe can do better,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe had a couple third-and-2, third-and-3 that we couldn\u2019t get, and I had a drop on one and somebody else had a drop on one. It\u2019s basically doing better at that, because we were moving the ball around pretty good. I think I was a little sluggish. But so far this week, I\u2019ve been way better than last week.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Are you worried about Peyton Manning if he has another so-so outing?\n\nJohn Elway impressed with Broncos defense\n\nWhile the offense remains a work in progress, and might for several weeks, general manager John Elway has been impressed with the defense under new coordinator Wade Phillips. Phillips switched to a 3-4 alignment, an aggressive scheme that appears tailored to the personnel.\n\n\u201cWe feel good about the talent on paper,\u201d said Elway, suggesting it might be the best group he\u2019s had since he returned to the Broncos in 2011. \u201cI am always cautious about that until we get out and play. But everybody has bought into the new system. We\u2019re happy with the direction that it\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Shane Ray on transition from college to NFL\n\nEmmanuel Sanders gets a rest day\n\nThe cautious approach with Emmanuel Sanders\u2019 hamstring injury continues. He sat out Thursday and is expected to return to practice next week after taking some passes from Manning on Friday.\n\n\u201cEvery thing is on schedule for him to be a full-time participant next week,\u201d Kubiak said. \u201cI think if it was a regular-season game, he\u2019d have a really good chance next week. Obviously, we are going to do what\u2019s right to get him ready for Baltimore.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Will Montee Ball get traded?\n\nCody Latimer gets challenged by Gary Kubiak\n\nKubiak challenged receiver Cody Latimer, who has had a quiet preseason. \u201cHe\u2019s a hard worker. He\u2019s in the right place, but it\u2019s time for him to start making plays on the ball and come up with some big plays.\u201d \u2026 Elway on Manning having no feeling in his fingertips after four neck surgeries. \u201cIf I threw for 5,400 something yards and 55 touchdowns, I wish my fingers would have been numb, too.\u201d \u2026 Left guard Evan Mathis participated in individual drills, impressing coaches with his conditioning. \u2026 A sign of the versatility of Phillips\u2019 defense: safety David Bruton has played some linebacker, and cornerback Bradley Roby worked as a safety in a package last week.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Demaryius Thomas close to 100 percent, less sluggish this week", "title": "Demaryius Thomas close to 100 percent, less sluggish this week", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/27/demaryius-thomas-close-to-100-percent-less-sluggish-this-week/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150819_015019_demaryius-thomas-2.jpg", "height": 508}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150819_015019_demaryius-thomas-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-27T16:52:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T13:21:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe08f6\"", "article_summary": "Thomas caught three passes for 24 yards in a preseason game at Houston last week, but misfired with quarterback Peyton Manning on multiple routes.\nAfter a month of learning the offense and working himself into football shape, Demaryius Thomas resembles the player who landed a $70-million contract.\nI\u2019m not at 100 percent yet, and I say that because I mess up and have a little mental error on the field sometimes,\u201d Thomas said.\nThe extra repetitions should improve timing and execution, particularly on third down, where the starters went 1-for-5 last week.\nHe sat out Thursday and is expected to return to practice next week after taking some passes from Manning on Friday."}
