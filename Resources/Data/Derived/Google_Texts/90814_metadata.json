They noted the law could in fact reduce employee absenteeism and improve output.\n\nThe CBO estimated last year that 7 million people would sign up for health insurance through Obamacare in 2014, but computer problems have now lowered their estimate by a million, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\n\n\n(Read more: Obamacare computers not yet equipped to fix errors: Report)", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Obama's signature health-care law will keep a historically high number of people out of the labor force, holding down revenue gains, the Congressional Budget Office says.", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Congressional Budget Office, jobs lost, CBO report", "author": "CNBC", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Obama's signature health-care law will keep a historically high number of people out of the labor force, holding down revenue gains, the Congressional Budget Office says.", "title": "Govt nearly triples job hours lost to Obamacare", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/02/04/cbo-nearly-triples-estimate-of-working-hours-lost-by-2021-due-to-affordable-care-act.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/02/04/101388616-463067855.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama's signature health-care law will keep a historically high number of people out of the labor force, holding down revenue gains, the Congressional Budget Office says.", "title": "CBO nearly triples estimate of working hours lost by 2021 due to Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/02/04/cbo-nearly-triples-estimate-of-working-hours-lost-by-2021-due-to-affordable-care-act.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/02/04/101388616-463067855.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Obamacare, Markets, US: News, Obamacare, Barack Obama, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-02-04T10:04:04-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Obamacare", "modified_time": "2014-02-04T15:51:53-0500", "tag": "Barack Obama"}, "pageNodeId": 101352868, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf32a\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama's signature health-care law will contribute to this phenomenon, the CBO said, citing new estimates that the Affordable Care Act will cause a larger-than-expected reduction in working hours\u2014eliminating the equivalent of about 2.3 million workers in 2021.\nIn 2011, the CBO estimated the law would cause a reduction of about 800,000 full-time equivalent workers.\nThe White House responded to the report, saying it does not show that Obamacare will reduce jobs.\nCNBC's John Harwood discusses the CBO's latest budget projections and says there's plenty of fodder for both Republicans and Democrats.\nA historically high number of people will be locked out of the workforce by 2021, according to a report by the Congressional Budget Office released Tuesday."}
