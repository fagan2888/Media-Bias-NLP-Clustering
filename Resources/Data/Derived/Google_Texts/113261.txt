A school operated by a religious group offers its students a health plan that doesn’t meet federal standards—in part because it does not cover most birth control expenses. The kicker is, the university doesn’t object to Obamacare based on religious beliefs, but rather on personal choice.

However, religious objections or not, students at Brigham Young University still may face fines at tax time for failing to acquire health insurance that meets minimum federal standards.
