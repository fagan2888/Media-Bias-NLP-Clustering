But in a simultaneous survey of retirees, the average actual age at which people had retired was 61.\n\nShutterstock.com Early retirement: Less fun when accidental.\n\nFor many boomers, of course, that five-year time gap would mean a major financial disruption, a one-two punch that combines fewer years of earning and saving with more years of post-work life to pay for. With those issues in mind, an article this week by Christine Benz, director of personal finance at research firm Morningstar, feels particularly pertinent. A premature retirement brings a host of financial challenges with it, of course, but Benz suggests that those who find themselves leaving the workforce early focus their energies on three main concerns:\n\nSocial Security: Delay it, if you can. Given the average retirement age, it\u2019s not surprising that between 35% and 40% of retirees begin claiming Social Security benefits at 62, the earliest possible age. (Those percentages ticked higher during the last recession, after a decade-long decline.) The problem, of course, is that claiming early almost always means your month-to-month Social Security income will be lower than it would be if you waited \u2013 a haircut of up to 30% from what you\u2019d receive if you waited until the \u201cfull retirement age\u201d of 66 or 67, and a cut of 43% compared with what you\u2019d get if you held out until age 70.\n\nBenz\u2019s message: Unless their assets are at a depressed level (as they were in 2008 and 2009), people who have independent retirement savings should tap those before they turn to Social Security. For broader advice about strategies for maximizing Social Security benefits, see the tools highlighted in this recent article by Encore\u2019s Anne Tergesen.\n\nTap your savings strategically. Cash \u201cemergency fund\u201d savings, long-term taxable investments and Roth IRAs are the first places early retirees should turn for money for living expenses, Benz says, because withdrawals from those sources won\u2019t be taxed as income. Those options are preferable to traditional 401(k)s and IRAs, since withdrawals from those accounts are taxable (and might be subjected to additional penalties if the saver is younger than 59 \u00bd). Being able to estimate your taxable income may be crucial, because if you\u2019re too young to qualify for Medicare, you\u2019ll need to\u2026\n\nDo your Obamacare homework. If it works the way it\u2019s supposed to (and of course, so far, not so good on that front) the Affordable Care Act could make health insurance more affordable for 50- and 60-somethings who previously faced sky-high premiums. But as Benz points out, for many people, affordability will depend on subsidies based on the insured person\u2019s gross income. Draw too much taxable income from your savings, she notes, and your annual premiums could be much higher. For some folks, that may mean relying on a combination of taxable and non-taxable withdrawals for a few years to keep the taxable share lower. Mike Piper, a CPA and author of the Oblivious Investor blog, covers the issue in more detail in this recent post.", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2013-11-01T15:34:35-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "To stay solvent, early retirees need to tap their savings strategically--and find affordable health care.", "title": "3 tips for coping with premature retirement", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2013/11/01/3-tips-for-coping-with-premature-retirement/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BN662_Retire_MG_20131022203619.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Matthew Heimer", "article.section": "Retirement", "keywords": "health care,Insurance,retirement income,Savings,Social Security", "article.headline": "3 tips for coping with premature retirement", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "description": "To stay solvent, early retirees need to tap their savings strategically--and find affordable health care.", "author": "Matthew Heimer", "article.page": "Encore Blog", "news_keywords": "health care,Insurance,retirement income,Savings,Social Security", "article.published": "2013-11-01T15:34:35-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2013/11/01/3-tips-for-coping-with-premature-retirement/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "To stay solvent, early retirees need to tap their savings strategically--and find affordable health care.", "title": "3 tips for coping with premature retirement", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/encore/2013/11/01/3-tips-for-coping-with-premature-retirement/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BN662_Retire_MG_20131022203619.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Encore", "article.id": "BL-235B-1679", "article.updated": "2013-11-01T15:34:35-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd437a\"", "article_summary": "Shutterstock.com Early retirement: Less fun when accidental.\nGiven the average retirement age, it\u2019s not surprising that between 35% and 40% of retirees begin claiming Social Security benefits at 62, the earliest possible age.\nFor broader advice about strategies for maximizing Social Security benefits, see the tools highlighted in this recent article by Encore\u2019s Anne Tergesen.\nBeing able to estimate your taxable income may be crucial, because if you\u2019re too young to qualify for Medicare, you\u2019ll need to\u2026Do your Obamacare homework.\nDraw too much taxable income from your savings, she notes, and your annual premiums could be much higher."}
