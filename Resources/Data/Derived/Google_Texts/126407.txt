Times “back then” were different. There weren’t iPhones and computers. Kids typically wore patched up pants and made many of the toys they played with. Hear Cherokee Elder Rufus King, who grew up with four brothers and three sisters, talk about his experiences in this video.

He talks about picking wild strawberries, hunting crawdads, traditional remedies, and what it was like going to school as a Cherokee.

“I didn’t know a word of English back then, we were all Cherokee speakers. That’s all we knew. I had a lot of trouble with that… a lot of times in class I didn’t understand what she was saying,” he says. “I’d get up when I wasn’t supposed to get up… I’d do the wrong thing.”
