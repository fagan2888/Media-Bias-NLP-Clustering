When you eat, you don\u2019t just swallow food but you also swallow air, which contains nitrogen and oxygen. These small bubbles of gas, according to Chemist Anne Marie Helmenstine, make their way through your body and mix with hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane along the way. The only way they can escape the body is by releasing out of your rear end (tush, behind, you get where we're going with this) and into the air we breathe.\n\nGrossed out yet? The human race releases 70 billion farts every single day, about 10 of which you have to own up to. But why don\u2019t our farts bother us as much as the rest of the worlds? The guys at AsapSCIENCE produce a video each week that aims to answer all different types of \u201cquirky and mind-blowing science\u201d questions, and they\u2019ve dedicated one entirely to farts.\n\nTurns out, the millions of gut bacteria that reside within your body match the ones that are released when you pass gas. In blind smell tests, people preferred their farts over every one else\u2019s every time (wouldn\u2019t want to be a participant in that study!). The bottom line: we prefer what\u2019s familiar to us.\n\nBut it might go deeper than that. Things that don\u2019t smell pleasant are usually poisonous, bacteria-ridden, or expired (if we're talking about food). We instinctively avoid another person's farts in order to protect ourselves from possible harm. Unhygienic things, animals, or people can carry disease; some can be transmitted through air-borne fecal matter contained in a fart. Mothers, however, are an exception to that rule. The smell of their own baby or child doesn\u2019t offend them as much, making it easier to clean them and maintain their hygiene.\n\nA good ol\u2019 SBD (silent but deadly) fart is one of the worst because it doesn\u2019t give the brain time to prepare itself for the smell. The anterior cingulate cortex is the part of the brain that processes your body\u2019s own fart or the sound of another\u2019s. It warns the rest of the brain the foul smell that is to follow.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "our, favorite, fart, smells, are, protecting, our, bodies, possible, disease", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Farts are more than just a passing gas, and we love our own scent for a reason.", "title": "Why Silent But Deadly Farts Are The Worst", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/our-favorite-fart-smells-are-protecting-our-bodies-possible-disease-310216", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/11/11/reasons-why-we-our-own-farts.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Farts are more than just a passing gas, and we love our own scent for a reason.", "title": "Why Silent But Deadly Farts Are The Worst", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/our-favorite-fart-smells-are-protecting-our-bodies-possible-disease-310216", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/11/11/reasons-why-we-our-own-farts.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/11/reasons-why-we-our-own-farts.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2014-11-11T17:15:11-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-11T17:15:10-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Farts are more than just a passing gas, and we love our own scent for a reason."}, "article_summary": "Passing gas, farts, toots, flatus, intestinal gas, or whatever you prefer to call it, are a natural part of your digestive process.\nThings that don\u2019t smell pleasant are usually poisonous, bacteria-ridden, or expired (if we're talking about food).\nUnhygienic things, animals, or people can carry disease; some can be transmitted through air-borne fecal matter contained in a fart.\nWhen you eat, you don\u2019t just swallow food but you also swallow air, which contains nitrogen and oxygen.\nThe anterior cingulate cortex is the part of the brain that processes your body\u2019s own fart or the sound of another\u2019s."}
