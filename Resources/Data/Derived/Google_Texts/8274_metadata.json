Bill Flores, R-Bryan, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz spoke at a July 15, 2015, news conference in front the U.S. Capitol to call on U.S. House and Senate leaders to eliminate any path for the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s hard to believe that four years ago, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul endorsed a largely unknown Texas candidate named Ted Cruz, writing that \u201cwe need Ted in the Senate.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Paul said that Cruz is \u201cpretty much done for\u201d in the Senate, a place where personal relationships are key to daily life. Granted, the two men are rivals in a heated race for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. But Paul\u2019s comments echoed what other Senate colleagues have been saying privately since Cruz called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a liar in July.\n\nWhen the 2016 election is over, Cruz will either return to the Senate as a rank-and-file member or, if elected president, he will have to negotiate with his former colleagues. Political opponents and analysts have questioned whether he could do either effectively because of the increasingly poisonous relationships he has with many Senate colleagues.\n\n\u201cTed has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership and call them names, which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the Senate, and as a consequence he can\u2019t get anything done legislatively,\u201d Paul said this week on Fox News Radio.\n\nCruz and his allies argue that his criticism of colleagues is not personal in nature. And his larger point is that so much of Washington is corrupt and that his disposition is a matter of keeping his campaign promises, like repealing the 2010 health care law.\n\nBack home, Cruz is methodically adding to his support among fellow Republicans. He's betting big on its presidential primary and has picked up the endorsements of 41 state lawmakers; six members of the state\u2019s congressional delegation have endorsed him.\n\n\"I Would Say the Jury Is Out\"\n\nBut some Texans remain concerned about Cruz\u2019s ability to help enact legislation.\n\nAfter years of playing down questions about their relationship, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, is beginning to show signs of frustration.\n\nOn a Wednesday conference call, Texas' senior senator compared Cruz to a football player who sacks his own quarterback. \u201cI would say the jury is out,\u201d Cornyn answered when asked whether Cruz could still effectively represent Texas in the Senate.\n\nOthers have been more emphatic.\n\n\u201cTexas has been short a senator since the day Cruz was elected,\" said Jenifer Sarver, an Austin-based GOP consultant and former staffer for U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Cruz\u2019s predecessor.\n\n\"As someone who worked for Senator Hutchison, who was an absolute and constant champion for Texas, it\u2019s disappointing to see his lack of regard for how his political posturing could impact Texans.\u201d\n\nA Cruz spokeswoman countered that taking on the establishment is no easy task.\n\n\"Sen. Cruz has been the most effective senator in stopping the agenda of the Washington Cartel and promoting conservative priorities,\" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier responded in an email. \"Because of his leadership, he helped put the brakes on amnesty, stop the Democrats\u2019 gun control legislation, stop reauthorization of the ExIm bank, and he has exposed the truth about how the Washington Cartel fails to take a stand on issues they were elected to defend.\"\n\nThere are three keys to twisting arms and getting things done in the Senate: seniority, an ability to pivot from adversary to ally with colleagues on various issues and committee assignments.\n\nCruz, who took office in 2013, is 41st in seniority among Senate Republicans, according to the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call.\n\nFor now, he sits on prime committees, including the Judiciary and Armed Services committees. Committee assignments are where serious power is delegated, and committee chairs wield enormous influence. For instance, the Senate Judiciary Committee chair takes a central role in U.S. Supreme Court nomination hearings, an issue Cruz speaks of often.\n\nBut after each election, \u201ca committee on committees\u201d forms to consider each senator\u2019s skill-set and legislative preferences in setting committee assignments. The committee then sends its recommendations to the Republican leader, who makes the final decision.\n\nIf Cruz remains in the Senate after the 2016 election, his committee assignments would be subject to the approval of McConnell, the man whom Cruz called a liar.\n\nLegislative Challenges\n\nAnd if elected president, Cruz would need the support of 60 senators to move on almost any of his agenda items. The current president has had a rocky relationship at times with members of his own party, and paid a price for it.\n\n\"If he is elected President, Republicans in Congress will have no more excuses for failing to fight \u2014 no excuse to not pass legislation that finally repeals Obamacare, that promotes jobs and growth, that cuts spending, that repeals stifling regulations, that upholds our Constitutional liberties,\" Frazier said.\n\nIf Cruz remained in the Senate, there could also be unique obstacles in the basic tasks of legislating.\n\nFor instance, one of any federal legislator\u2019s biggest fears is that the U.S Department of Defense will close a military base in his or her home state. The consequences of a closing are swift and the job losses ripple throughout the community.\n\n\n\nMuch has been done to take the politics out of the base closing process. But more than any other moment, that is the time a senator leverages the chits he or she built up over the years.\n\nBut many Senate staffers shrug off the concerns about Cruz's effectiveness in legislating for one reason: the strength of the Texas delegation.\n\nCornyn is as popular in the Senate as Cruz is not, and he serves as the second-ranking Republican member of the chamber.\n\nAnd the delegation is hitting new heights of power on the House side: six Republicans serve as committee chairmen. One of those members, U.S. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas, is currently running for House majority whip, the third-ranking slot in House GOP leadership.\n\nAnd, it's not like day-to-day legislation was on Cruz's agenda in the first place, notes Norm Ornstein, a political analyst with the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\"Even if Cruz were Cruz but not running for president, if he hadn't taken those additional steps that had basically alienated his colleagues, it's not like he would be devoting his time and attention to things that would have a dramatic impact on Texan's daily lives,\" he added. \"His interest are in broader in national policy and getting government out of our lives.\"\n\nIt\u2019s not altogether new to be a Senate black sheep among Republicans.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s who I was,\u201d said former U.S. Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a co-chair of \u201cVets for Ted,\u201d a coalition focused on outreach to military veterans. \u201cI was exactly the same way.\u201d\n\nSmith said he shared Cruz\u2019s frustrations with \u201cpeople who are not sticking to the principles and values\u201d they campaigned on as Senate candidates.\n\nHis history with fellow Republicans is equally stormy.\n\n\n\nSmith ran for the GOP presidential nomination in 1999, but quickly left the party to mount a third-party run for the White House. He then rejoined the GOP, but when he ran for re-election in 2002, he faced a scion of a local political dynasty, John E. Sununu, in his primary.\n\n\u201cPeople weren\u2019t happy with me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey punished me as best as they could and I wound ended up losing my primary, and I wasn\u2019t supported by the party.\n\nBut Smith added that, given his experiences, he still thought Cruz\u2019s posturing and tactics were worth it.\n\n\u201cYes, you can be marginalized. Yes, it can be very difficult to be effective,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on the other hand, what does effective mean?\u201d\n\nPatrick Svitek contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the national election is over, Cruz&nbsp;will either return to the Senate as a rank-and-file member; or if elected president, he will have to negotiate with his former colleagues.
