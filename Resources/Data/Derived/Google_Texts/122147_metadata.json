The Centennial State is looking to implement a universal health care proposal that goes above and beyond what Obamacare offers.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason Obamacare is so unpopular is that it\u2019s a one-size-fits-all approach for 50 different states,\u201d Colorado Democratic state Sen. Irene Aguilar, a doctor, told TheBlaze. \u201cWhat we are hoping to do with this is create a plan that works for Colorado.\u201d\n\nThe plan would cover every resident in the state primarily through the government, but supporters are careful about calling it \u201csingle-payer.\u201d Aguilar is leading the charge for the ColoradoCare ballot initiative that if approved by voters would have a $25 billion price tag, financed through a new 10 percent payroll tax \u2014 6.67 percent from employers and 3.33 percent from employees. Still, advocates say it would save $1.6 billion in health care costs for individuals across the state and $3.1 billion for businesses.\n\nThe Obama administration allows waivers for states that meet certain qualifications in creating an alternative health care plan.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration is not going to approve a waiver for a more free market plan,\u201d Jonathan Lockwood, executive director of Advance Colorado, which opposes the state\u2019s ballot initiative, told TheBlaze. \u201cThis would be the largest tax increase ever introduced in Colorado.\u201d\n\nProponents gathered 156,107 signatures \u2014 98,000 were required to get the measure on the 2016 ballot. The signatures will be formally verified in late November.\n\n\u201cAfter the Affordable Care Act, many can\u2019t afford the new health care deductibles and premiums themselves,\u201d former Colorado Democratic state Sen. Jeanne Nicholson told TheBlaze. \u201cUninsured has gotten better since the Affordable Care Act. But the number of underinsured has gotten worse. The number of underinsured has jumped 16 percent.\u201d\n\nNicholson, a nurse and an advocate for the ColoradoCare ballot initiative, said it can be a \u201ctrick question\u201d to ask if the plan is \u201csingle-payer.\u201d The reason is that while it provides health insurances for 100 percent of Colorado\u2019s residents it would divide those residents into four areas: Veterans would get their medical coverage through the Veterans Administration; the Indian Health Service would serve Colorado\u2019s significant Native American population; Medicare would be available for seniors in the state; and ColoradoCare for everyone who doesn\u2019t fall into those categories. Essentially, anyone who isn\u2019t a Native American, senior or veteran would be eligible for the new program if it is established.\n\nColorado established an exchange under the existing federal law called Connect Health Colorado, but projected operating costs prompted the state to raise fees on insurance consumers and those who sign up on the exchange. Adding to the state\u2019s burden, the co-op recently went under.\n\nThe state of Vermont scrapped its plan last year for a single-payer plan, fearing it would be too expensive and harm the state\u2019s economy.\n\nFinancing the Colorado plan would mean tripling taxes, which is one reason the ballot initiative will likely fail in a state where both Democrats and Republicans have libertarian leanings, Lockwood asserted.\n\n\u201cThe campaign has been shady from the beginning,\u201d Lockwood said. \u201cThey go to conservatives in places like Colorado Springs and say it\u2019s about repealing Obamacare. They go to liberal areas like Boulder and say it\u2019s about universal health care.\u201d\n\nAguilar was uncertain if the initiative would influence the presidential race.\n\n\u201cWe wanted it on the ballot in a presidential year because that\u2019s when more people will turn out to vote, but I hadn\u2019t thought about whether it will draw more people to vote in the presidential race. It might,\u201d Aguilar said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Voters in the battleground state of Colorado will likely have a big issue to vote on in 2016\u00a0\u2014 and it's not the presidential election.
