(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nAmerica faces serious challenges. An anemic job market, with low-income Americans most affected. Escalating violence in urban areas, with black men bearing the brunt of it. Declining education performance, with inner-city youth most disadvantaged. Exploding costs and declining quality of health care.\n\nWhat is most remarkable is their persistence over many decades, despite massive government spending and new regulations. Is it time for a revolution? No. We don\u2019t need the \u201cflush America down the toilet\u201d proposals sold by President Obama in 2008 and now peddled by the Democratic Party\u2019s 2016 presidential candidates. We just need to apply Problem Solving 101: \u201cWhen fixing something, the crucial first step is to understand the problem, determine its root cause.\u201d\n\nCandidates skip this first step when they propose to address youth unemployment, not by reducing the costly government mandates that discourage businesses from hiring but instead by imposing new rules and costs \u2014 higher minimum wage, more taxes, Obamacare, etc.\n\nObamacare proponents skipped this step when, instead of fixing the real problem \u2014 exploding costs and declining quality of health care, they rammed through an oppressive law aimed at extending (by force) health care coverage to those without. There may now be more people carrying insurance cards, but the real problem continues unabated.\n\nAmerica\u2019s problems do not require an abandonment or \u201cfundamental transformation\u201d of our core free market principles. We just need to stop fixating on symptoms and address the root cause: an overbearing government.\n\nDan Hurley\n\nMarlboro\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1oWgGsJ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Reduce federal spending, eliminate burdensome regulations", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Reduce federal spending, eliminate burdensome regulations", "title": "LETTER: Overbearing government is root of nation\u2019s ills", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/03/04/letter-overbearing-government-root-nations-ills/81334916/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Reduce federal spending, eliminate burdensome regulations", "title": "LETTER: Overbearing government is root of nation\u2019s ills", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f6162067fcd5a3bd1de31e962a9876877da833c0/c=180-0-619-439&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/04/AsburyPark/B9321155529Z.1_20160304163612_000_GCFDKDIP1.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b0e\"", "article_summary": "We just need to stop fixating on symptoms and address the root cause: an overbearing government.\nWhat is most remarkable is their persistence over many decades, despite massive government spending and new regulations.\nExploding costs and declining quality of health care.\nReduce federal spending and eliminate burdensome regulations.\nThere may now be more people carrying insurance cards, but the real problem continues unabated."}
