In Roberta Gorman\u2019s grade 4-5 classroom, the children explore traditional Navajo science. They also learn Western science. Her fourth graders do well on Arizona\u2019s standardized science testing, which is administered statewide to all children in that grade.\n\nEstablished in 2001, Puente de Hozh\u00f3 is part of the Flagstaff, Arizona public school system. In addition to its Navajo/English program, the trilingual magnet school offers a Spanish/English program for Hispanic children. The name of the school comes from the Spanish words puente de, which mean \u201cbridge of,\u201d and the Navajo word hozh\u00f3, which roughly translated means \u201cbeauty.\u201d In English, the name means Bridge of Beauty, a concept illustrated by murals on the exterior of the building created by children and staff under the direction of Navajo artists Shonto Begay and Baje Whitethorne.\n\nAt the kindergarten level in the Navajo/English program, the children spend all of their time in a classroom where 90 percent of the instruction is in Navajo. Their teacher is Ilene Ryan, who is a fluent speaker and who holds both regular Arizona teaching credentials and a master\u2019s in bilingual multi-cultural education.
