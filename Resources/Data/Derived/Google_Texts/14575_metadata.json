Boxer says. Boxer: Why no Viagra complaints?\n\nAs the Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday about the Obamacare mandate on birth control coverage, Sen. Barbara Boxer questioned why those up in arms about the requirement have no problem with most insurance covering Viagra.\n\n\u201cI have never heard Hobby Lobby or any other corporation, I could be wrong, or any other boss complain that Viagra is covered in many insurance plans, practically all of them, or other kinds of things, you know, for men, which I won\u2019t go into,\u201d Boxer said Tuesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cJansing & Co.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe California Democrat was discussing the lawsuit before the Supreme Court Tuesday morning arguing that companies like Hobby Lobby, which brought the suit, shouldn\u2019t have to provide for employees\u2019 birth control because it violates their religious beliefs.\n\n( PHOTOS: Hobby Lobby protests)\n\nHost Chris Jansing pressed Boxer as to whether she could compare Viagra and birth control, saying Hobby Lobby and other advocates argue that birth control is a \u201clife issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never heard them put any type of moral objection, remember, this is a moral objection, to men getting Viagra, but they have a moral objection to women getting certain types of birth control,\u201d Boxer said. \u201cWhat\u2019s their next moral objection, do they then object to vaccinations? Where do you take it from here? \u2026 There has been a well-documented study by a university that gave women free birth control for several years. Abortions went down by 50 percent, Chris. So if you are for life and want to attack this issue for abortion, this is a place we could work together and reduce the number of abortions.\u201d\n\nBoxer said it\u2019s the rights of the employees that are being restricted, not the employers.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Contraception coverage to SCOTUS)\n\n\u201cI view this as very much an anti-woman position to take,\u201d Boxer said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important to note that women take birth control, more than half of them, as a medication for other conditions, so it is an attack on women. I think it\u2019s an attack on the religious freedom of the women who work there. Remember, no one is forced to take birth control. It\u2019s an individual right, and this is America, and this is the 21st century, and this is shocking.\u201d\n\nBoxer said the vast majority of women take birth control at some point in their lives, and it\u2019s not fair for companies like Hobby Lobby to make a choice for them.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "She asks why those up in arms about the birth control requirement don't object to covering Viagra.", "title": "Boxer: Why no Viagra complaints?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/barbara-boxer-obamacare-birth-control-viagra-104990.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/07/25/100922_barbara_boxer_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Barbara Boxer,Birth Control,Viagra", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "She asks why those up in arms about the birth control requirement don't object to covering Viagra.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0633\"", "article_summary": "Boxer: Why no Viagra complaints?\nAs the Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday about the Obamacare mandate on birth control coverage, Sen.
