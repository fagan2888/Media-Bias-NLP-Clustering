Immediately after the grand jury\u2019s decision in the Garner case, the mayor said he had warned his bi-racial son Dante to take special caution in any dealings with police officers.\n\nLargely peaceful protests have also taken place nightly in major U.S. cities since a grand jury returned a no indictment decision after a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in August.\n\nThe protests have intensified since the decision on the Garner case, and other police shootings in New York, Cleveland and elsewhere.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEW YORK \u2014 New York\u2019s police union is showing its displeasure with Mayor Bill de Blasio and the head of the city council by starting a campaign to keep the two politicians away from funerals of fallen officers.
