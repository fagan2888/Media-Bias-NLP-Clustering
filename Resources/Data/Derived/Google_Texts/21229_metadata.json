However, the 49-year-old South Carolina resident says he doesn\u2019t want to be the poster child for the Republican Party\u2019s opposition to health care reform anymore.\n\nAt the end of last week, the Charlotte Observer reported that Lang, a lifelong Republican who\u2019s previously prided himself on covering his own medical bills, can\u2019t afford to pay thousands of dollars to treat an issue stemming from his chronic diabetes. Lang is suffering form bleeding in his eyes and a partially detached retina, which will cause him to go blind if left untreated. So he set up a GoFundMe page to solicit $30,000 in donations to cover a costly surgery that will save his vision.\n\nSince then, the story has been picked up in left-leaning outlets across the country and covered in nationally syndicated newspaper columns. Obamacare supporters flocked to Lang\u2019s GoFundMe page to urge him to change his mind about the health law.\n\nIn an interview with ThinkProgress, Lang joked that he might be the most hated Republican in the country right now. But he also said that, thanks in part to a flood of media attention that led him to learn more about health care policy, he doesn\u2019t identify with the GOP anymore.\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m looking at what each party represents, my wife and I are both saying \u2014 hey, we\u2019re not Republicans!\u201d Lang said. He added that, though he\u2019s not a political person by nature and has never voted solely along party lines, he wants to rip up his voter registration card on national television so Americans will have proof that he\u2019s making the switch.\n\nAlthough the Charlotte Observer article positioned Lang against the ACA, he insists he has never been completely opposed to the law. He does, however, have some issues with the way it\u2019s been implemented.\n\nLike many Americans, Lang struggled to navigate the website last year and was frustrated by long wait times and technological glitches. He told ThinkProgress he thinks the law is too confusing as it\u2019s currently written \u2014 and pointed out that it\u2019s too difficult for him to predict his annual income as a self-employed contractor, which is what prevented him from signing up for a plan during previous enrollment periods. He was too nervous about underestimating his income during the enrollment process and being required to pay back his insurance subsidy during tax season.\n\nBut Lang\u2019s main complaint is the fact that the Supreme Court ruled that Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion should be optional, which has given Republican lawmakers the opportunity to refuse to implement the policy on the state level. That\u2019s led to a coverage gap preventing millions of Americans from accessing affordable insurance whatsoever. Because Lang\u2019s income has recently dried up, now that his deteriorating vision prevents him from working, he now falls into that gap.\n\n\u201cI put the blame on everyone \u2014 Republican and Democrat. But I do mainly blame Republicans for their pigheadedness,\u201d Lang said. \u201cThey\u2019re blocking policies that could help everyone. I\u2019m in the situation I\u2019m in because they chose not to expand Medicaid for political reasons. And I know I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d\n\nLang said he\u2019s read almost every comment on his GoFundMe page. He acknowledged that a lot of people have criticized him for waiting until he got sick to think about purchasing insurance, which is not how the health care system is intended to function. But he insists that he and his wife have been discussing getting coverage now that they\u2019re getting older, and notes that he tried his best to navigate the law last year.\n\n\u201cI know we didn\u2019t do it the right way,\u201d Lang told ThinkProgress, explaining that he\u2019s hoping to figure out the situation with his fluctuating income so he can be the first in line to sign up for a plan during the next open enrollment period.\n\nHe said he\u2019s always tried to take responsibility for his own bills, but he also believes that the United States should move toward a universal health care system that makes coverage available to everyone regardless of their income level. He said he \u201cone hundred percent agrees\u201d with the people who commented on his crowdfunding page to argue that health care is a human right.\n\n\u201cIn fact, I have some eyesight jokes for you,\u201d he added. \u201cThis whole thing has helped me see more clearly.
