The previous Conservative government refused to renegotiate it and unilaterally declared that the six per cent escalator would end in 2017.\n\nAlthough they denounced the Conservative move and promised to negotiate a new accord with a long-term funding agreement, the Liberals did not specifically promise to reinstate the escalator.\n\nAnd Philpott appeared to suggest Thursday that it's not in the cards.\n\nAt $36 billion, health transfers are already \"the largest in Canadian history,\" she told the House of Commons.\n\nAs for not putting the promised $3 billion in additional home-care funding on the books yet, Philpott said later that the federal government first wants to strike an agreement with the provinces about how that money is to be spent \"and what Canadians should expect to see as a result.\"\n\nWhat is the best way forward for Canadian health care?\n\nReaders let us know in today's CBC Forum \u2014 a live, hosted discussion about topics of national interest. Here's some of what they had to say.\n\n(Please note that user names are not necessarily the names of commenters. Some comments have been altered to correct spelling and to conform to CBC style.

Emergent-care centres and more nurse practitioners would address many issues. People need more immediate access to health-care providers, but there are solutions.\" \u2014 Kadie\n\n\u200b\"There is a serious palliative-care crisis on the horizon as the baby boomers retire. The only solution is a large increase in public funding.\" \u2014 Mic Mac\n\n\"We have to decide what we want and then fund it properly. And, yes, that may mean higher taxes. It will still be much cheaper than in the U.S.\" \u2014 EEWint\n\n\"Prevention is key. Developing healthy public policy and effective health-promotion resources is integral to lowering health-care costs. People need greater education surrounding their health and the factors that can affect their well- being. Having issues funding such things? Slap a greater tax on alcohol, cigarettes and junk food.\" \u2014 Andrew\n\n\"Health care needs to include basic dental and vision care. Doing so would prevent some of the more severe diseases and save money in the long run. This could easily be paid for if we stopped subsidies to the oil and gas industries and closed all the tax loopholes for the wealthy.\" \u2014 BC Coast\n\n\"If the federal government is funding healthcare, there needs to be more standardization of services rendered by the provinces. There is no reason why a person moving from province [to province] has to wait to get on a provincial medical plan.\" \u2014 Jonathan\n\n\"It is critical that the health-care system look into itself and rid itself of needless bureaucracy, which is costing the system huge dollars that can be better spent on actual care. It is obvious there is poor control of management and our tax dollars are not being used efficiently by politicians and administrators and thus we constantly have deficits.\" \u2014 RobbieCanuck\n\n\"I believe strongly in the two-tier system of health care \u2026 Those with insurance should be encouraged to 'bump ahead' in order to free up space for those who don't. We do have some insurance, not enough to make the kind of difference I reference, but those who have should be able get their treatments as needed.\" \u2014 CaperLeaf\n\n\u200bYou can read the complete discussion below.\n\nCan't see the forum?
