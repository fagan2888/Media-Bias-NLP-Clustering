With a record 80 teams needed to fill spots, the equation started getting messy when only 77 teams were bowl-eligible. The NCAA ruled the empty spots could be filled by 5-7 teams, ranking them based on APR.\n\nNevada (6-6) finished second in the West Division behind San Diego State. The Wolf Pack and Rams faced six common foes, with both beating New Mexico and Fresno State, both losing to Utah State and San Diego State. Colorado State beat both UNLV and Wyoming, teams Nevada lost to this season.\n\nThe two didn\u2019t play this year, nor will they next year. They played as part of cross-division play the two years prior, with Colorado State winning both games.\n\nThe last time two teams from the same conference played in a non-playoff bowl game was 1979 when Oklahoma played Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado State football off to Arizona Bowl", "title": "Colorado State football off to Arizona Bowl", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/06/colorado-state-football-off-to-arizona-bowl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151123_015349_mike-bobo-2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151123_015349_mike-bobo-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-06T19:49:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T00:01:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "Colorado State also appeared in the first New Orleans Bowl (2001) and the Poinsettia Bowl (2005).\nThey played as part of cross-division play the two years prior, with Colorado State winning both games.\nThe last time two teams from the same conference played in a non-playoff bowl game was 1979 when Oklahoma played Nebraska in the Orange Bowl.\nColorado State beat both UNLV and Wyoming, teams Nevada lost to this season.\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 For the third time in program history, Colorado State\u2019s football team gets to take part in an inaugural bowl game."}
