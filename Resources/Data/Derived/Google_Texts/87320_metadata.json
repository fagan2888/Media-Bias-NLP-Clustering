Butch Otter and First Lady Lori Otter have only two more years left in their leadership positions. But they hardly have a short-timer\u2019s attitude when it comes to shaping the Republican Party on the legislative and precinct levels.\n\nThe formation of Otter PAC, criticized as being a \u201cpower grab\u201d by the governor and first lady, showed some muscle in last week\u2019s primary elections. Sen. Shawn Keough of Sandpoint, Luke Malek of Coeur d\u2019Alene and Rep. Kelley Packer of McCammon were victorious in the face of heavy opposition from the conservative Idaho Freedom Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here because we are afraid of the Idaho Freedom Foundation. We\u2019re here because we think we can make a difference with the party,\u201d said Lori Otter. \u201cThe driving force for us is there is a lot of common sense that goes with leading and a lot of common sense that goes with conservative values.\u201d\n\nThrough her husband\u2019s experience in Congress and as governor, she knows that running for office is not the same as serving.\n\n\u201cI sometimes think the far right of our party doesn\u2019t understand that,\u201d she said. \u201cFor instance, take Obamacare. I think Butch did the best job he could to make the best decision for the state going forward. History will show that he did, because we have the most successful state-run exchange in the nation. But we almost lost the last election because of that.\n\n\u201cThe emotional reaction is, Obamacare is awful and we want nothing to do with it. The leadership part is what we do that is the best decision for the next 30 years,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you have to govern, and that\u2019s what we are trying to promote in the PAC.\u201d\n\nThe Idaho Freedom Foundation, directed by Wayne Hoffman, criticizes the governor and most legislators for spending too much and providing too little in tax relief.\n\n\u201cWayne Hoffman is entitled to his opinions. He is sincere with his opinions, but we think he is sincerely wrong,\u201d the first lady said. \u201cButch has been the most conservative governor in the United States for the last two years and in the top five for the last six, yet he was called a socialist in the last election. That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\n\nBut the Idaho Freedom Foundation, which racked up some impressive victories of its own in last week\u2019s primary, makes plenty of noise and has people working to elect conservative candidates. The Otter PAC is aimed at countering some of those efforts.\n\n\u201cIf they want to do the PAC thing, we can play that game \u2026 and we\u2019re pretty dang good at it,\u201d Lori Otter said.\n\nThe Otter PAC came away last week with three key players on the Joint-Finance Committee getting wins \u2014 Keough, Rep. Maxine Bell of Jerome and Rep. Wendy Horman of Idaho Falls. According to Kevin Richert of Idaho Education News, a longtime Idaho political reporter and editorial writer, Otter-supported candidates won in eight of the 12 races.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t all bad for Hoffman\u2019s IFF, with Rep. Ron Nate of Rexburg and Judy Boyle of Midvale staving off heavy opposition from the Otter side. Nate\u2019s victory was especially impressive, as Richert observed. Senate President Pro Tem Brent Hill of Rexburg donated $1,000 to Nate\u2019s opponent, Doug Ricks, and House Speaker Scott Bedke did not contribute to Nate\u2019s campaign. Christy Zito\u2019s victory over Rep. Rich Wills of Glenns Ferry also was a big win for IFF backers.\n\n\u201cWe engaged in about 10 different legislative districts and won in five, so I have no complaints,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cFor years, southern and eastern Idaho has been a disaster for conservatives. But they are making inroads. They did in 2014 and did it again in 2016. It\u2019s because we\u2019re giving information to voters so they are no longer fooled by phony conservatives.\u201d\n\nThe Otter PAC, of course, will be providing plenty of information of its own \u2014 which is probably good for Idaho voters.\n\n\u201cIdaho is a relatively young state,\u201d Lori Otter said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty lucky with how things have gone, but that could all turn around pretty fast if people stop paying attention and people stop investing in the election process.\u201d\n\nNeither the Otter PAC, nor the Freedom Foundation, can claim a clear victory in last week\u2019s primary. But in baseball terms, it was a heck of a good first inning.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nChuck Malloy is a native Idahoan and longtime political reporter and editorial writer.
