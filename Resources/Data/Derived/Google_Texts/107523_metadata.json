Rand Paul said there are two arguments for keeping government small\u2014the \u201cliberty argument\u201d and the \u201cefficiency argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe liberty argument was put forward by Thomas Paine; he said \u2018government is a necessary evil,\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cOh, that sounds terrible, he\u2019s saying government is evil. No, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s a necessary one.\u201d\n\nPaul, R-Ky., elaborated on his theory of government, arguing that you must have \u201csome of it, but you don\u2019t want too much of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not no government, we just want small government,\u201d Paul said.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be that bad, I\u2019m part of it,\u201d he joked.\n\n\u201cThe efficiency argument,\u201d according to Paul, is that \u201cnobody spends somebody else\u2019s money as wisely as their own,\u201d and that individuals are more likely to be judicious with their money than politicians in Washington, D.C.\n\nPaul criticized Democrats and his fellow Republicans for \u201cgrowing the debt\u201d and \u201cmaking the government bigger,\u201d and accused some of his potential GOP opponents in the presidential race as not being \u201cconservative\u201d enough.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t mention any names\u201d said Paul, \u201cbut he was the former governor of Florida.\u201d\n\nIn a nod to independents, Paul said that to win purple states, Republicans not only need to attract business owners, but \u201cthe people who work for those businesses.\u201d\n\nThe best way to do that, according to Paul, is to be the party \u201cthat stands for the whole Bill of Rights.\u201d\n\nPaul cited NSA spying, civil asset forfeiture and Common Core as examples of big government that his party should fight against.\n\nPaul said that if civil liberties are not protected, than people could be targeted for the \u201cshade of their ideology.\u201d\n\nHe answered several audience questions on subjects like Common Core, Iran, immigration, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nPaul said that veterans should be free to choose to receive their care from a VA facility, but should also be given the option to use vouchers at another health care provider.\n\nDuring the question-and-answer session, Paul also criticized the structure of the United Nations, and said that he is \u201cfor dialogue\u201d with the international community, but against \u201cpaying for people to attack America.\u201d\n\nOn immigration, Paul cited Milton Friedman, who argued that a nation can\u2019t have both an open border and a welfare state.\n\nPaul was accompanied at the town hall event by members of the state Senate and House who have endorsed him for president, including State Sen.
