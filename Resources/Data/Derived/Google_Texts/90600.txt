SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Officials say a second sheriff’s deputy has died after being shot by a suspect who has now been apprehended for four shootings.

Placer County Sheriff’s spokeswoman Dena Erwin says one of her department’s deputies was killed Friday after he was shot with an AR-15-type assault rifle.

A second Placer County Sheriff’s deputy was shot in the arm and was expected to survive. A Sacramento County sheriff’s deputy died earlier in the day after he was shot in the head by the same suspect.

Erwin says 34-year-old Marcelo Marquez was taken alive Friday afternoon from a home in Auburn, 30 miles northwest of Sacramento. An armed woman was also taken into custody.

Officers chased the suspect for hours in a manhunt spanning two counties after the suspect shot three deputies and a bystander.
