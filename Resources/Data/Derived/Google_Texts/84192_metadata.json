Disclosure of diagnostic or clinical information is prohibited.\n\nPaul Gionfriddo, chief executive of the mental health rights advocate Mental Health America, said he believes the White House strikes the right balance between the need to have this information shared with the FBI\u2019s background check system and protecting individuals\u2019 privacy.\n\nCurrent law allows HIPAA exclusions for law enforcement purposes, but it's a broad exclusion.\n\n\u201cThat could be a barn door opened quite wide if an administration really wanted to open it, and they didn\u2019t,\u201d Gionfriddo said. \u201cThe administration has taken great pain to try to clarify that there is very limited information that would be reported only within a very limited group.\u201d\n\nSince the Newtown shootings, the number of mental health records submitted to the FBI system has tripled to more than 3 million records, according to an analysis by Everytown for Gun Safety, a group promoting an end to gun violence. The FBI system resulted in more than 6,000 denials of firearm purchases because of mental health criteria.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The new rule will be part of the Obama administration's gun package.", "title": "Doctors can report some mentally ill patients to FBI under new gun control rule", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/obama-gun-control-rule-mental-illness-217340", "image": "http://static.politico.com/0d/2f/a2d767764bfca9e4d17a1c2aaeba/20160104-gun-image-1-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The new rule will be part of the Obama administration's gun package.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The FBI system resulted in more than 6,000 denials of firearm purchases because of mental health criteria.\n| AP Photo Doctors can report some mentally ill patients to FBI under new gun control ruleDelivering on its promise to deliver \"common sense\" gun control, the Obama administration on Monday finalized a rule that enables health care providers to report the names of mentally ill patients to an FBI firearms background check system.\nUnder the rule, which takes effect next month, for the first time health providers can disclose the information to the background check system without legal repercussions.\n\u201cThe disclosure is restricted to limited demographic and certain other information needed for NICS purposes,\u201d the rule states.\nThe rule, published Jan. 4, was one of a series of steps that President Barack Obama had called for in January 2013 in the wake of the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings."}
