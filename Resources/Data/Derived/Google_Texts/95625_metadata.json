John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in a written statement after Obama spoke. \u201cWe should dismantle this law, so Americans can choose the insurance plan that works for them, not President Obama.\u201d\n\nEnergy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., said, \"Our main priority should be helping the American people. Today's abrupt pivot comes after the White House has spent the last week attacking our thoughtful approach to begin to give peace of mind to those folks worried about losing their affordable health care.\"\n\nThe House is planning to vote on a bill by Upton Friday that would allow insurers to continue selling insurance plans that would otherwise be banned under the law, which the White House has threatened to veto.\n\nOregon Democrat Sen. Jeff Merkley said he believed the one-year fix doesn\u2019t go far enough but was \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nSen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said he was still \u201cconcerned about people having policies which don\u2019t do anything. They\u2019re just junk policies.\u201d\n\nEchoing the frustration he said many in his party have with the rollout, he added \u201cI want it fixed so the Affordable Care Act will succeed \u2026 not be torn down.\u201d\n\nBut he also said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have done what we did today, quite frankly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s guidance is a great step forward,\u201d said Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. But, she added, \u201cI\u2019m going to continue to work with the leadership. I\u2019m open to working with Democrats and Republicans if there is a legislative fix that\u2019s also necessary.\u201d\n\nLandrieu is sponsoring a bill that would extend current insurance plans indefinitely.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner said he was \u201chighly skeptical\u201d the Obama administration would be able to fix the problems with ObamaCare administratively, as the president suggested.\n\nBoehner, a Republican from Ohio, has recently ramped up his criticism of ObamaCare, calling it \u201ca rolling calamity that has to be stopped.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is going to destroy the best health care delivery system in the world,\u201d Boehner said moments before the president\u2019s remarks.\n\nThe president also drew criticism from the insurance industry, now charged with implementing his \"fix.\"\n\n\u201cThe only reason consumers are getting notices about their current coverage changing is because the ACA (Affordable Care Act) requires all polices to cover a broad range of benefits that go beyond what many people choose to purchase today,\u201d America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans\u2019 President Karen Ignagni said following Obama\u2019s comments.\n\n\u201cChanging the rules after health plans have already met the requirements of the law could destabilize the market and result in higher premiums for consumers,\u201d she warned\n\nDuring his remarks, Obama also apologized to members of his own party for denting their credibility among constituents.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s legitimate for them to expect me to have to win back some credibility on this health care law in particular and on a whole range of these issues in general,\u201d Obama said.\n\nHe also apologized to millions of Americans who have been receiving cancellation letters from their insurance providers.\n\n\u201cI completely get how upsetting this could be for many Americans,\u201d Obama said.\n\nWhite House officials said they will send a letter to state insurance commissioners specifying that current plans sold to existing customers will not be considered out of compliance with the health care law in 2014.\n\nThat means insurance companies don\u2019t have to drop current customers for at least a year.\n\nPart of the problem was that the ObamaCare law specified what needed to be covered, which was basically everything including the kitchen sink.For example, couples in their 60\u2019s got canceled because their insurance did not have pre-natal coverage. Obama\u2019s fix basically buys some time for millions of Americans in danger of being dropped by their provider.\n\n\u201cI am confident that by the time we look back on this next year, people are going to say, \u2018this is working out well,\u2019\u201d Obama said.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-12-17 12:40:36
