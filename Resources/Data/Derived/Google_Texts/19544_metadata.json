Ongoing process improvements that streamline operations, while also driving the highest quality care, demand initiatives that balance the needs of all stakeholders \u2013 patients, nurses, pharmacy, ancillary departments and the healthcare organization as a whole.\n\nPharmacy and nursing workflows within the bigger picture of medication management, including medication administration, are no exception. Hospitals across the nation leverage automation strategies for medication management processes, but identifying and implementing best practice workflows to optimize efficiencies, patient safety and ultimately, fiscal responsibility can be a challenging proposition.\n\nAs the industry faces increasing regulations and financial risk based on patient satisfaction and outcomes, it is imperative for executive leadership to understand how a hospital\u2019s unique medication distribution workflow impacts pharmacy operations, nursing workflow and patient safety and satisfaction.\n\nThe ability to fully incorporate industry best practices around technology and workflow is critical to staying in the black when it comes to HCAHPS patient experience scores, outcomes metrics and quality, including readmissions, hospital acquired conditions and never events.\n\nLeaner medication management: The balancing act\n\nHospitals face a double-edged sword when it comes to streamlining medication management workflows for both pharmacy and nursing. In today\u2019s healthcare environment where maximizing productivity is essential, pharmacies are looking to establish a top-of-license approach to utilizing their resources which requires lean pharmacy operations. As such, many are leveraging automated dispensing cabinets (ADCs) that may help promote efficient pharmacy operations by making medications readily available on patient floors.\n\nNon-value added time associated with retrieving medications is the result of nurses walking back and forth to the med room, waiting in lines to access the ADC and then retrieving medications. This all occurs during the \u201cgolden hour\u201d of the morning, when nurses are charged with not only retrieving medications and prep supplies, but more importantly, determining the appropriateness of the medications. Additionally, the nurse is in a \u201crace against the clock\u201d to ensure medications are administered to all their assigned patients in a timely manner and in accordance with Centers for Medicare & Medicare Services (CMS) regulations.\n\nWith the average patient receiving nine medications, nurses can spend upwards of 30 minutes vending medications from the ADC\u2014time that could be spent educating and engaging patients in their treatment plans. While it may be difficult to associate hard dollars with nursing time at the bedside, patient satisfaction and quality of care reimbursements are directly impacted by nursing time with patients. In fact, a hospital\u2019s clinical process of care, outcomes and efficiency account for 70 percent of a hospital\u2019s total performance score with patient experience accounting for 30 percent. This score is determined by the Hospital Value-based Purchasing program, which links a portion of a hospital\u2019s CMS payments to performance based on a set of quality measures.\n\nDue to the speed at which a nurse must administer the large numbers of medications to meet guidelines for timely medication administration, a \u201ctask-driven\u201d nurse mentality, which diametrically opposes the needs of the patient during this \u201cgolden hour,\u201d directly impacts patient satisfaction and requirements for medication education. This, in turn, can have an effect on reimbursement, which is why it is critically important for hospital leaders to ask the question: \u201cHow can pharmacy help nursing find more time at the bedside?\u201d\n\nLeveraging industry best practices\n\nOne solution to the goal of maximizing nursing time at the bedside is implementing a lean workflow. Eliminating, or drastically reducing, non-value added time provides the opportunity to not only increase nursing time with patients, but also to implement key initiatives\u2014such as rounding, medication education or medication reconciliation\u2014and improved throughput, all of which are proven to support quality and the patient experience.\n\nFocusing purely on lean processes sometimes directly conflicts with best practice and regulatory requirements. Incorporating regulatory compliance and leveraging industry best practices as the foundation for lean medication management strategies ensures both safety and productivity needs are met. For example, while the vast majority of hospitals across the U.S. have invested in ADCs, many are still not optimizing or adhering to the industry best practices to produce optimal safety and performance results from their use.\n\nThese best practices include core processes developed by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP), the nation\u2019s voice for medication error prevention and safe medication use, in response to increased ADC use. Designed to maximize productivity and optimize patient safety, these guidelines aid in strategic decision making about ADCs and help healthcare organizations assess and manage their impact on both nursing and pharmacy workflows.\n\nAdditionally, the Joint Commission, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, The Advisory Board and National Database Nursing Quality Indicators also provide best practice information that can be incorporated with lean workflows.\n\nThe following ISMP core processes for guidance on the interdisciplinary safe use of ADCs support the highest level of patient safety and provide best practice strategies for preventing dangerous work-arounds, increasing productivity and ensuring proper use of technologies for safe medication administration. Healthcare organizations can leverage these guidelines to lay the right foundation for the safe use of ADCs as they move toward maximizing nursing time at the patient bedside.\n\nProvide ideal environmental conditions for the use of ADCs Ensure ADC system security Use pharmacy-profiled ADCs Identify information that should appear on the ADC screen Select and maintain proper ADC inventory Select appropriate ADC configuration Define safe ADC restocking processes Develop procedures to ensure the accurate withdrawal of medications from the ADC Establish criteria for ADC system overrides Standardize processes for transporting medications from the ADC to the patient\u2019s bedside Eliminate the process for returning medications directly to their original ADC location Provide staff education and competency validation\n\nAs hospital pharmacies focus on implementing the most efficient processes possible in order to improve their bottom lines in today\u2019s value-based care environment, it\u2019s important not only to leverage lean strategies, but to ensure these strategies are rooted in regulatory compliance and industry best practices while providing the desired impact of increasing nursing time with patients.\n\nBy incorporating these practices as a foundation, organizations can make the most of lean medication management for enhanced clinical quality, productivity and financial performance overall.\n\nDebra Jarratt, RPh, is an executive pharmacist consultant at Aesynt.
