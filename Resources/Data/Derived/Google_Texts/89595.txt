The man shot to death in broad daylight on a Strawberry Mansion street Tuesday afternoon was identified by police on Wednesday.

Ernest Tisdale, 38, who lived on Dover Street near Cumberland, was on 29th Street less than a block from his home when someone opened fire on him, wounding him at least once in the chest, police said.

Medics pronounced Tisdale dead on the street. Police on Wednesday were still working to determine a suspect and motive in the homicide, which was the 218th slaying so far this year, according to police statistics. As of the same date last year, the city had recorded 205 homicides.

Tisdale's court record shows several arrests, mostly for drug charges. He served jail time in 2013 for drug possession, records show.
