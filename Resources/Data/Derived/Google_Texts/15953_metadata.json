Lizza joins fellow staff writer Jeffrey Toobin and host Dorothy Wickenden on this week\u2019s Political Scene podcast to talk about Obama\u2019s new approach to executive power in the face of a hostile Congress. They discuss the negotiations to avoid a Homeland Security shutdown, the use of the Administrative Procedures Act to halt the President\u2019s executive action on immigration, and the significance of the upcoming Supreme Court case challenging the Affordable Care Act, King v. Burwell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a grand Constitutional case, but in terms of the stakes, for actual people\u2019s lives, it may be the most important Supreme Court case of our lifetime,\u201d Toobin says.\n\nYou can listen to the full episode above.
