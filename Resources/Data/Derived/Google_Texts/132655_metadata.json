Our round-up of state blogs will follow over the weekend.\n\nJump to:\n\nOn Wednesday this week, The Daily Signal has the news that President Obama is planning to circumvent Congress on climate regulations once again, by passing the Paris Protocol on climate change without that body\u2019s input. They argue that the agreement is a legally binding treaty, and that the Constitution mandates that it be sent to the Senate for consideration. FreakOutNation says that the Obama Administration (via the Department of Justice) is going to boost its efforts to fight against domestic terrorism with the appointment of a \u2018domestic terrorism counsel\u2019.\n\nTurning to the Democratic Party more generally, The Fix writes Thursday on Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii who has been fighting with the Democratic National Committee (of which she is a vice chair) about whether its chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz (FL) suggested that Gabbard should not attend the first Democratic debate in Las Vegas this week. The drama comes after Gabbard stated that that the DNC should host more than six debates.\n\nOn the Republican side, The Federalist this week argues that it is now the time for the GOP to chase black voters, as they have not prospered under the last seven years of the Obama administration. They say that the Democrats are taking black voters for granted, and that the Republican Party needs to make them work for their votes. On Tuesday, Red State comments that the Chamber of Commerce is pledging $100 million to defeat GOP-conservatives in the 2016 election cycle, to \u2018buy\u2019 a new party. They say that while the chamber used to be a force for conservatism in Congress, now it has become a \u2018breeding ground for corrupt cronyism\u2019 which insists on spending programs. The Daily Signal, meanwhile, takes some time to examine what the Tea Party has achieved since it began in 2009. They argue that the movement has changed and \u2018even slightly fixed\u2019 America, as evidenced by the falling deficit despite the launch of expensive government programs such as Obamacare.\n\nElections and the road to 2016\n\nOn Sunday, Caffeinated Politics has the news that just 158 families have contributed nearly 50 percent of the money given to presidential campaigns in this first phase of the race. Vox Mischiefs of Faction also looks at donor this week, dispelling the often circulated idea that super-wealthy donors are pulling US politics farther to the right. They comment that GOP candidates have received more donations simply because there are far more (15) candidates in the field. The Fix writes this week that Republican and Democratic voters want completely different presidents, and not just ideologically. Their data shows that Republicans favor candidates with business experience, while Democrats want someone with a political or governmental record.\n\nIn the week that saw the first Democratic debate of the 2016 primary season, Smart Politics says that ex-presidents have collectively been mentioned over 100 times in the current debate season, with Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush leading the pack by far.\n\nThe first Democratic debate\n\nThe lead up to the debate on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, Nevada, saw a great deal of commentary:\n\nThe debate\u2019s format was apparently structured to prevent conflict between candidates (Red State).\n\nFiveThirtyEight profiles the candidates who are not either Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton \u2013 former Senator Jim Webb, former Rhode Island Governor, Lincoln Chafee, and former Maryland Governor, Martin O\u2019Malley.\n\nWonkblog has four big differences between the candidates, including on gun control and the minimum wage.\n\nHarvard Law Professor Larry Lessig won\u2019t be there \u2013 he blames the Democratic Party (Wonkblog).\n\nTurning to post debate commentary:\n\nFor some, Hillary Clinton was the clear winner (Outside the Beltway)\u2026\n\n\u2026while others said that she had the debate that she needed to shift the media narrative away from the controversy over her private email server (Daily Kos).\n\nOr perhaps her email controversy is here to stay, despite Bernie Sanders\u2019 statement that \u201cthe American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails\u201d (Post Politics).\n\nApparently only Democrats are actually sick and tired of hearing about Clinton\u2019s emails (The Fix).\n\nFiveThirtyEight reckons that the media underestimated Clinton in the lead-in to the debate, but have overestimated her performance in it.\n\nWonkblog looks at why Bernie Sanders loves Denmark (who used it as an example during the debate) and why Clinton does not.\n\nSpeaking of Sanders, The Atlantic says that he did better on Tuesday night than the pundits had predicted.\n\nSo well, in fact, that he raised $1.3 million in the four hours after the debate began (Post Politics).\n\nHit & Run has an overview of how the \u2018also-rans\u2019 of O\u2019Malley, Webb and Chafee did in the debate\u2026\n\n\u2026while Americablog argues that the Democratic Party was the winner overall.\n\nThis was the first presidential candidates\u2019 debate that had adults on stage (Crooks and Liars).\n\nWonkblog has a helpful Venn diagram showing the differences between the Democrats\u2019 and GOP\u2019s debates.\n\nThe debate clarified that many libertarian views \u2013 such as a more isolationist foreign policy \u2013 have gone mainstream (Hit & Run).\n\nThe Federalist rounds up the 25 craziest things said at the debate.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate, Mike Huckabee did apparently not cover himself in glory with his live tweeting of the Democratic debate (The Fix).\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 2016 campaign\n\nMoving on to the Democratic Party\u2019s candidates more generally:\n\nAs of Monday, everyone still hated Hillary Clinton (Red State).\n\nWas House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), right when he stated last week that the House\u2019s Benghazi Committee had damaged Clinton? (The Fix)\n\nClinton is apparently easier for the GOP to beat next year than Vice President Joe Biden would be \u2013 should he choose to enter the race (Red State).\n\nBernie Sanders has a problem with minority voters \u2013 now may be his big chance to woo them (FiveThirtyEight).\n\nOver 13,000 people attended one of Sanders\u2019 rallies this week, where he spoke on gun violence and immigration reform (Post Politics).\n\nAre guns Bernie Sanders\u2019 Achilles heel? (The Fix)\n\nSanders\u2019 brand may be both \u2018dangerous and popular\u2019 (Red State)\u2026\n\n\u2026popular enough for him to pick up another endorsement \u2013 this time from House Representative Keith Ellison (D-MN) (Crooks & Liars).\n\nApparently, more Americans support Bernie Sanders than they do Donald Trump (The Fix).\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s 2016 campaign\n\nLooking to the other side of the presidential race:\n\nGOP activists are probably wrong when they think that a strong conservative can win the White House next year (Monkey Cage).\n\nOhio Governor John Kasich this week told a forum audience that people would have to \u2018get over\u2019 cuts to their Social Security benefits (Crooks & Liars).\n\nFormer Florida Governor, Jeb Bush, has sunk nearly $5 million on ads in New Hampshire since September \u2013 with zero effect on his polls (PoliticusUSA).\n\nA Bush campaign worker grilled Donald Trump on women\u2019s rights this week \u2013 but Bush is apparently just as bad (Daily Kos).\n\nSpeaking of Trump \u2013 he wants Secret Service protection (Post Politics).\n\nTrump has received nearly $4 million in campaign donations over the past three months (Post Politics)\n\nWhich two candidates\u2019 will drop out of the race next? It could be Governors Chris Christie and John Kasich (Monkey Cage).\n\nEven if they don\u2019t drop out, Kasich and Christie may still be in danger of missing out on the main stage at the next GOP debate (Outside the Beltway).\n\nNeurosurgeon Ben Carson\u2019s poll numbers have been rising despite his recent offensive statements (Daily Kos)\u2026\n\n\u2026though for some, he does not seem to be serious about running for president, given that he has put his campaign on hold in favor of his book tour (Red State).\n\nThis week, Kentucky Senator, Rand Paul, brushed off the concerns of those who might be fired because of their sexual orientation, stating that if that happens \u201cthere are plenty of places that will hire you\u201d (America blog).\n\nPaul also live-streamed a day of his campaign this week to the befuddlement of some (Red State).\n\nIs Louisiana Governor, Bobby Jindal, about to bow out of the race? (The Atlantic).\n\nWhy the GOP should nominate Ted Cruz (Roll Call\u2019s Rothenblog).\n\nGovernment, the Beltway and Congress\u2019 agenda\n\nOn Tuesday, The Atlantic previews the coming \u2018death penalty feud\u2019 at the Supreme Court. They say that the Court will hear four death penalty cases this term which center around how trial judges instruct juries, juries\u2019 roles, and racial discrimination.\n\nMoving on to Congress, The Fix agrees with Representative Trey Gondy (R-SC) that the house is essentially \u2018ungovernable\u2019, with it looking very difficult for any Speaker to be approved with the necessary 218 House votes in the wake of Speaker John Boehner\u2019s (R-OH) planned departure. The Hill\u2019s Congress blog reckons that before Boehner leaves, he should present a clean suspension of the debt-limit to the House, ahead of the limit being reached in early November. In recent days, many have speculated that someone from outside the House of Representatives could be elected Speaker. Not so, says the Daily Signal, explaining that the Constitution says that the House should choose \u2018their\u2019 Speaker, i.e. someone from the House.\n\nOn Tuesday, following the accusations of a fired Benghazi Committee staffer that the committee is a political ploy to hurt Hillary Clinton, The Atlantic wonders if it has reached a turning point.\n\nPoliticusUSA says that Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, has put a huge \u2018ransom\u2019 on raising the debt limit, which President Obama will never agree to \u2013 raising the age of eligibility for Medicare and restricting the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to uphold clean water standards.\n\nForeign policy, defense and trade\n\nOn Saturday, American Thinker wonders if the recent deal with Iran over that country\u2019s nuclear program is a fait accompli. The American Interest meanwhile argues that Iran isn\u2019t that interested in promoting a stable order in the Middle East, in cooperation with the US.\n\nPolitical Animal gives an overview of what they say is President Obama\u2019s \u2018grand strategy\u2019 for the 21st century, which is largely focused on correcting the country\u2019s past foreign policy disasters.\n\nPowerline says that according to a recent survey, only 26 percent of Americans think that the US is winning the war on terror, down from 52 percent when Obama was elected.\n\nOn Thursday, Outside the Beltway has the news that President Obama would announce that the ongoing withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan would be halted, and the current troops there will remain until 2017. They say that the news is a stark indication that the US\u2019 longest war is not coming to an end any time soon.\n\nThe American Interest writes this week on the US\u2019 standoff with China in the South China Sea. They say that the US will be sending ships through China\u2019s 12-mile exclusion zone after China has continued to build facilities on artificial islands.\n\nObamacare and health policy\n\nOn Saturday this week, Daily Kos says that the expansion of Medicaid is reducing the rate of uninsurance, at least in the states which are allowing it. The states which have expanded Medicaid now have an uninsured rate of just below 9 percent, while those that haven\u2019t have a rate of about 14 percent.\n\nThe Daily Signal comments on a new report which has found that health insurers have lost a great deal of money selling plans under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 AKA Obamacare. They say that the losses of up to 12 percent will mean higher premiums over time. Townhall, meanwhile investigates Obamacare\u2019s \u2018missing billions\u2019 \u2013 the $2 billion in funding not spent on setting up state exchanges but has not yet been returned to the federal government.\n\nWho pays hospital bills when patients can\u2019t? The Atlantic says that, at non-profit hospitals, unpaid bills become bad debts for the patient, or are written off, amounting to $57 billion nationally.\n\nThe economy and society\n\nAmerica is becoming increasingly pessimistic, writes The Atlantic, with most people not feeling great about the long term prospects for the quality of education, the growing elderly population, corporate decision-making, and governmental dysfunction.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ten Miles Square looks at new statistics which show that nearly 63 percent of the US jail population have never been convicted of a crime. The cause? Increasingly stringent bail conditions.\n\nIn the wake of recent tragic shootings across the country, there has been a resurgent debate over the role of \u2018gun free zones\u2019. American Thinker reckons that they are illogical, because they are based on the voluntary compliance of the people who are likely to not care about gun control laws of any kind.\n\nWriting at Wonkblog, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers argues that fixing America\u2019s roads would pay for itself, with road users benefiting from reduced operating costs because of higher quality infrastructure.\n\nOn Tuesday, Political Animal praises federal and state regulators for looking into \u2018big beer\u2019, after allegations came to light that the brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev is seeking to curb market competition by buying distributors.\n\nWonkblog this week compares the American middle class to other middles classes across the world \u2013 it turns out that it is worse off.\n\nAnd finally\u2026\n\nPost Politics reports that a man who previously presented Jeb Bush flowers was thrown out of a Q&A with Donald Trump.\n\nRecent presidential candidates have written 172 books. But only one helped a candidate to win (The Fix).\n\nFeatured image credit: Credit: MudflapDC (CC- BY-NC-SA-2.0)\n\nPlease read our comments policy before commenting.\n\nNote: This article gives the views of the author, and not the position of USAPP\u2013 American Politics and Policy, nor of the London School of Economics.\n\nShortened URL for this post: http://bit.ly/1X9oDXC", "article_metadata": {"description": "USAPP Managing Editor,\u00a0Chris Gilson looks at the best in political blogging from around the Beltway.
