An 18-year-old woman who wandered away from friends camping near Nederland early Sunday has been found, with leg wounds. She was airlifted for treatment.

The friends notified police about 10 a.m. after the woman strayed from camp at about 3 a.m., Boulder County authorities announced Sunday afternoon.

Before rescuers began their search, the woman found her way back to the West Magnolia camping area at 11 a.m. — with substantial wounds to her legs.

She was rushed by helicopter to University Hospital in Denver.

“We don’t know what the injuries are from,” Boulder County sheriff’s office Commander Heidi Prentup said. “They were bad enough that she was choppered out.”

Boulder deputies, en route to the hospital, were trying to find out what happened.
