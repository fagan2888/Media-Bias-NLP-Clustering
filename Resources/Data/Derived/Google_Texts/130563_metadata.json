Findings from its pilot study, published in BMJ Quality and Safety, indicate that the sound-absorbing panels led to a three to four sound decibel drop, similar with a fall in noise generated by a car slowing down from 80 mph to 60 mph.\n\n\"In hospital environments where noise levels are often double what they should be according to the World Health Organization's standard decibel guidelines for patient rooms, the difference is significant,\" Majtaba Navvab, Ph.D., associate professor of architecture and design at the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning at the University of Michigan, said in the study announcement.\n\nThe architectural design could complement ongoing strategies for addressing noise in the hospital environment, lead study author Peter M. Farrehi, M.D., a cardiologist at the U-M Health System, said in the statement.\n\nIn addition to the sound panels, the hospital is promoting a culture of quiet by providing complimentary ear buds and headphones to patients and families; setting quiet hours in all inpatient areas, setting pagers to vibrate when medically appropriate and providing a \"white noise\" television channel in patient rooms.\n\nLast summer, Inspira Health Network, a nonprofit healthcare system comprised of three hospitals in southern New Jersey, eliminated noise by using technology to reduce the number of overhead pages, a frequent source of patient complaints. So, the health system replaced its broadcast system with direct communication between physicians and patients--doctors can be reached on their cell phones, as well as customized messages.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study announcement\n\n- read the study abstract\n\nRelated articles:\n\nNoisy hospitals pose patient safety risks\n\n5 steps to quiet damaging hospital noise\n\nHospital reduces damaging noise with direct communication technologies", "article_metadata": {"description": "Complaints that\u00a0hospital noise\u00a0from monitors and paging systems interrupts patients' sleep and can influence their blood pressure and heart rates has led one Michigan system to borrow a method used in music rooms to make the hospital quieter and improve patient care.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Complaints that\u00a0hospital noise\u00a0from monitors and paging systems interrupts patients' sleep and can influence their blood pressure and heart rates has led one Michigan system to borrow a method used in music rooms to make the hospital quieter and improve patient care.", "title": "Turning down the volume: Hospital experiments with sound panels to reduce noise", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/turning-down-volume-hospital-experiments-sound-panels-reduce-noise/2015-08-20", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,hospital noise,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient safety,sound panels,University Of Michigan Health System", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor says it is experimenting with sound acoustic panels to help diffuse sound in patient hallways.\nSo, the health system replaced its broadcast system with direct communication between physicians and patients--doctors can be reached on their cell phones, as well as customized messages.\nTo learn more:- here's the study announcement- read the study abstractRelated articles:Noisy hospitals pose patient safety risks5 steps to quiet damaging hospital noiseHospital reduces damaging noise with direct communication technologies\nComplaints that hospital noise from monitors and paging systems interrupts patients' sleep and can influence their blood pressure and heart rates has led one Michigan system to borrow a method used in music rooms to make the hospital quieter and improve patient care.\nThe architectural design could complement ongoing strategies for addressing noise in the hospital environment, lead study author Peter M.
