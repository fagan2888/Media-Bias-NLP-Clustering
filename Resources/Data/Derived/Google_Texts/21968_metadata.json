Gov. Dan Patrick was interviewed by Tribune CEO and Editor-in-Chief Evan Smith on Oct. 16, 2015.\n\nLt. Gov. Dan Patrick unapologetically stuck to his guns in an on-stage interview Friday evening \u2014 as well as his religious views, the Legislature\u2019s conservative budget and the state\u2019s reluctance to embrace Medicaid expansion and the federal health care law.\n\nPatrick talked one-on-one with Texas Tribune Editor-in-Chief Evan Smith on the opening night of the 5th annual Texas Tribune Festival on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nThe conversation ranged widely:\n\n\u2022 Guns \u2014 Patrick said he was happy to see campus carry and open carry laws pass during the legislative session, but he said support for so-called \"constitutional carry\" was thin among lawmakers and the public. And he said he doesn\u2019t expect to see widespread adoption of open carry. \"I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna see a lot of people walking around with a gun on their hip,\" he said.\n\nAsked about the epidemic of mass shootings, Patrick said many of those take place in gun-free zones. \"If you're intent on killing people, are you going to go into a room with 20 students who are armed or unarmed?\" he asked.\n\nHe said he wouldn\u2019t feel safe if a shooting occurred on campus and nobody had a gun with which to defend themselves and said he was unaware until asked that the Texas open-carry law will take effect on the 50th anniversary of the tower shooting on the University of Texas campus during which Charles Whitman shot 46 people and killed 14.\n\n\u2022 Religion \u2014 Patrick talked about religious liberty laws, which he has asked senators to study between now and the beginning of the next legislative session: \u201cI\u2019m an unashamed Christian. No one should be able to deny service to anyone who comes in the door. But should a person in business be forced to participate in an event that is against their religious beliefs?\u201d\n\nSmith asked whether saying this is a Christian nation, as Patrick has done, should put people off. \"I\u2019m a Jew. I\u2019m the worst Jew in the world, but I\u2019m a Jew,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t control how people feel,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cTo deny that we were founded on Christian principles is to deny history.\u201d\n\nAsked if a point can be reached where there is too much religion in politics, Patrick replied \u201cnot as long as you\u2019re sincere.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is entitled to see it how they see it,\u201d he said. But he said he would get out of politics if he felt staying would force him to break his faith.\n\n\u2022 Health care \u2014 Patrick, after discussion about the expense of expanding health care and the state\u2019s reluctance to accept Medicaid expansion or embrace the federal Affordable Care Act, told a somewhat hostile audience that it was ignoring the other side of that issue. \u201cThere's no free anything,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone paying for it, folks, and that someone is you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have demonstrated the model of conservative policy works,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re leading the nation in so many ways, and some liberals can\u2019t take it.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Economic incentives \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t believe in picking winners and losers,\u201d Patrick reiterated, saying companies come to Texas for low taxes, moderate regulations and laws.\n\nHe also said an educated workforce is important for economic development and added: \u201cWe have devalued blue-collar work.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Taxes \u2014 Recent proposed property tax cuts \u2014 an increase in the homestead exemption that is on the ballot next month as a constitutional amendment \u2014 are just a first step, Patrick said. Next, the state should tighten laws requiring automatic rollback elections when taxes go up.\n\nHe would lower the automatic rollback elections on tax increases of 6 percent, applied to cities and counties as well as schools. \u201cAs your value goes up, your tax rate should go down,\u201d Patrick said.\n\n\u2022 Conservative accomplishments \u2014 Asked what he'd done for Texas, Patrick highlighted legislation passed by lawmakers earlier this year including property tax exemptions, scholarships for math and science teachers, incentives to keep Texas-trained doctors here when they begin their practices and passage of tuition revenue bonds for higher education. And he said most of the legislation that passed did so with support from both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nHe also touted the relatively small growth in state spending, which he put at 3.9 percent. \u201cWe passed a conservative budget,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a conservative thing to do and a wise thing to do to not spend all the money.\u201d\n\nLawmakers left much of the money they expected to have unbudgeted, a decision that looks better in light of Comptroller Glenn Hegar\u2019s recent announcement that state revenues will be lower than expected because of a slumping energy industry. Patrick said oil prices fell because Saudi Arabians lowered prices to keep their enemies at bay and the U.S. close. \u201cIf we become energy independent, we won\u2019t need Saudi Arabia anymore,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2022 Running for governor \u2014 Before Smith could get out a question, Patrick answered one: \u201cI\u2019m not running for governor in 2018.\u201d That\u2019s not new, and in fact, Patrick said as much in interviews earlier this summer. But he said he gets along fine with Gov. Greg Abbott and won\u2019t run against him when Abbott\u2019s term is up.\n\n\u2022 The presidency \u2014Patrick was not ready to endorse anyone in the presidential race, but said he will \u201csoon enough.\u201d He also said there is a \u201chigh chance we will have a brokered convention,\u201d where no candidate has amassed more than half the votes.\n\n\u2022 Voter turnout \u2014 Patrick said the state doesn\u2019t need to make it easier to vote. He said voters should be informed and study the issues. \u201cIf people don\u2019t show up and vote, they\u2019re either happy or they don\u2019t care,\u201d he said.\n\nDisclosure: The University of Texas at Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.
