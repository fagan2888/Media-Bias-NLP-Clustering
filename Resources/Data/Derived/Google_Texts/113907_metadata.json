Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2014who recently voted against the Affordable Care Act, and against protection from housing discrimination (because the NBA is mostly black\u2026yeah, seriously) \u2014brings up slavery to \u2018splain why he voted against same-sex marriage.\n\nIn Friday\u2019s landmark decision, Thomas joined Justices John Roberts, Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito in his vote against Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized same sex marriage in the United States. Yet, brother man couldn\u2019t just leave well enough alone, bringing up slavery, and saying that the state could not bestow \u201cdignity\u201d on slaves\u2014and can\u2019t do that for same sex loving people either.\n\nYeah, no really? To a lot of folks, it\u2019s not about \u201cdignity\u201d from the government but equal rights under the law. And for slaves it was about\u2026freedom from brutal, exploitative, back-breaking oppression. Saying that the state can\u2019t bestow or take away \u201cdignity\u201d seems to miss the point entirely.\n\nAnd we quote Justice Thomas:\n\nThe corollary of that principle is that human dignity cannot be taken away by the government. Slaves did not lose their dignity (any more than they lost their humanity) because the government allowed them to be enslaved. Those held in interment camps did not lose their dignity because the government confined them. And those denied governmental benefits certainly do not lose their dignity because the government denies them those benefits. The government cannot bestow dignity, and it cannot take it away.\n\nBet we can tell you what the government can give (at least on paper): the exact same rights every other American has.\n\nThe irony of Thomas\u2019 own marriage situation was not lost on social media yesterday, showing the good judge and his second wife, Virginia Thomas, a white woman, whom he couldn\u2019t have married if the Supreme Court had not voted to make interracial marriage legal in 1967\u2019s Loving v. Virginia case. To some it reeks of the same hypocrisy of Bristol Palin talking about abstinence but getting pregnant out of wedlock\u2026again.\n\nBack in 1967, it took SCOTUS to say it was OK for Clarence Thomas to do this: #LoveWins pic.twitter.com/cgHemREyXt \u2014 Terrell J. Starr (@Russian_Starr) June 26, 2015\n\nAnd to invoke slavery here is like using the \u201cthe race card\u201d in a weird, self-serving way as he is wont to do when it suits his agenda. Who could forget Thomas saying he was a \u201cvictim\u201d of a \u201chigh tech lynching\u201d when Anita Hill took him to task about sexual harassment during his SCOTUS confirmation hearings so many years ago?\n\nIncredible.\n\nSEE ALSO: Black Woman Climbs Flagpole, Snatches Confederate Flag From South Carolina Statehouse\n\nSource: Fusion, Photo: Getty Images\n\nAlso On News One:", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "Le Sigh.
