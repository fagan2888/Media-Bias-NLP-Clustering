The Richmond native and R.A. McMath Secondary grad averaged a triple-double over the national championships.\n\n\u201cIt is something special to do this with a special group of guys,\u201d said Eberhardt, who over the majority of his coaching career, has coached both college and high school boys varsity teams simultaneously. \u201cI will still be processing this over the spring break. It is such an awesome feeling to get a national championship.\u201d\n\nEberhardt, a high school teacher at Richmond\u2019s R.C. Palmer Secondary, coached the school\u2019s Griffins to the 2011 B.C. senior boys Triple A title. Last week, Eberhardt coached the Griffins to fourth place at the B.C. senior boys Double A provincial championships in Langley.\n\nJitinder Lohcham of Langara was picked to the first all-star team, while Mason was selected to the second team along with Jose Colorado of Quest, which finished tied for fifth.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "The Province", "generator": "WordPress.com", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Vancouver Province", "fb": {"app_id": 135455519931679}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "keywords": "men's, bc boys high school basketball, brody greig, canadian collegiate athletic association, ccaa men's basketball, howard tsumura, jatinder lohcham, jose colorado, lanagara falcons, langara college falcons, pacwest conference, pacwest men's basketball, paul eberhardt, quest university kermodes, r.a. mcmath secondary, rc palmer griffins, red deer college kings", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://blogs.theprovince.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "description": "They began the season as a team whose theme was getting a second chance to achieve its dream. \"So the first thing we did was we showed them Jimmy V's speech from the ESPY's,\" Langara College Falcons men's basketball coach Paul Eberhardt was explaining Sunday morning, one sleep after his team's st..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca79f\"", "article_summary": "Last week, Eberhardt coached the Griffins to fourth place at the B.C.\nIt is such an awesome feeling to get a national championship.\u201dEberhardt, a high school teacher at Richmond\u2019s R.C.\nThey began the season as a team whose theme was getting a second chance to achieve its dream.\n\u201cIt was a crazy comeback, one of the most amazing comebacks I have ever been involved with,\u201d said Eberhardt, whose team carried the nation\u2019s No.\nThe Richmond native and R.A.
