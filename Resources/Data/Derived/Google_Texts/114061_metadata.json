The $62.2 million Board of Education budget was defeated 734 to 716, while the $36.6 million town budget passed 841 to 608.\n\nOverwhelmingly in two advisory questions on the ballot, voters said they didn\u2019t want either budget increased should a second vote be necessary.\n\nThe combined proposed budget of $100.3 million was about $300,000 more than the current fiscal year. This included a spending increase of $1 million for the school budget, $182,000 more for the town budget, and $1.6 million for capital projects, which is about $872,000 less than the current fiscal year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed in the budget being defeated,\u201d Board of Education Chairman David Lawson said. \u201cIt was a very low budget, but we\u2019re going to make it work.\u201d\n\nHe said the school board will meet in the near future to discuss its options.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to maintaining our programs for the upcoming school year,\u201d he said.\n\nResults for an advisory question on the ballot show 970 voters don\u2019t want to see the school budget increase, while 441 said they do.\n\nMayor David Gronbach views the new referendum as a chance to present a more accurate budget using final state aid and health insurance figures. He is in the process of organizing a Town Council meeting to discuss the budget.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a discussion about if the town budget needs tweaking to reflect the state budget,\u201d he said.\n\nThe proposed budget includes $448,000 the Board of Finance added to the mayor\u2019s original budget.\n\nThe Board of Finance's budget would have increased the tax rate by 2 cents to $26.77 per $100,000 of assessed value, or 0.06 percent. Gronbach\u2019s budget would have decreased the tax rate by about the same amount.\n\nHe plans to include input from the school board on what a decrease would mean for the schools.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens with this next budget,\u201d Gronbach said.\n\nFollowing Tuesday\u2019s vote, Gronbach said the school budget could have failed because the Republican Town Committee had campaigned against the budget.\n\nMichael Barnes, chairman of the New Milford Republican Town Committee, said in a statement Wednesday that the mayor was giving the committee too much credit. He said the the committee only submitted one letter about the issue to the paper. He said voters were aware some school employees received salary and benefits increases.\n\n\u201cMost businesses I know are foregoing pay increases because their insurance costs have risen so much due to Obamacare,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTaxpayers aren\u2019t getting raises so these BoE costs should not be pushed onto them. The BoE should cut their budget so that employees understand that if some want large pay or benefit increases it will come out of the BoE budget, not from taxpayers.\u201d\n\nBarnes said he was thankful the Board of Finance added the $448,000 to the budget.\n\n\u201cAs the Mayor pointed out, it can cover income we may not receive from the state,\u201d Barnes wrote.\n\nThe town had a turnout lower than normal. Only 9.16 percent of registered voters in town voted on the budget.\n\n\u201cI think the people saw it as non-controversial this year and decided to stay home and not vote and let others go out and vote,\u201d Gronbach said.\n\nkkoerting@newstimes.com; 203-731-3345; @kkoerting", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "NEW MILFORD \u2014 School and town officials will go back to the drawing board after voters narrowly rejected a proposed school budget on Tuesday.
