Dan Coats (R-Ind.) was talking about, and the reason soon became clear. (U.S. Senate )\n\nSen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) was prepped for an appropriations hearing on the defense budget when he took his turn Wednesday afternoon, flipping papers on his lap, reading from them and commending the witness for his department\u2019s prompt response to a letter Coats had sent about a military accounting office in his home state.\n\nIt was all fairly innocuous except for one problem: Coats was in the wrong hearing.\n\nAfter finishing a lengthy opening to his question, a staffer slipped Coats a piece of paper. Coats read it to himself, looked up, and said, \u201cI just got a note saying I\u2019m at the wrong hearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that would explain why I didn\u2019t know anything about this letter,\u201d said David Cohen, the Treasury Department\u2019s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. The room erupted in laughter.\n\nCoats, who served in the Senate from 1989 to 1999, was U.S. ambassador to Germany and then returned to the Senate in 2011. He said that had never happened to him before. He saw familiar faces, he said, and thought he was in the right place. (Coats is on the Appropriations Committee, but he showed up at a hearing of the wrong subcommittee.)\n\nSen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) attended the wrong committee hearing on Wednesday. (U.S. Senate)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go try to find out where I\u2019m supposed to be,\u201d Coats said. (You can watch a clip online at washingtonpost.com/blogs/\n\nin-the-loop.)\n\nCoats did find his place, in a hearing room down the hall in the Dirksen Building, where the meeting was set for an hour later. There, Principal Deputy Undersecretary of Defense Mike McCord knew all about the letter.\n\nA belated apology\n\nWhat\u2019s the statute of limitations on saying you\u2019re sorry?\n\nWhen Billy Crystal asked in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d it was 10 years, but Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) is hoping his fellow \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum was off by a few decades.\n\nThe funnyman-turned-serious-senator has some apologizing he\u2019d like to do on behalf of his Senate predecessors.\n\nIn the early part of the last century, during the rush of European immigration to the United States, Congress stripped citizenship from any American woman who married a foreigner. The little-known Expatriation Act of 1907 stayed on the books until 1940, so even after women won the right to vote in 1920, those who were married to a non-American could not exercise that newfound right.\n\nFranken would like the Senate to offer, through legislation, its sympathy and regret for passing a law \u201cincompatible with and antithetical to the core principle that all persons, regardless of gender, race, religion, or ethnicity, are created equal.\u201d\n\nFranken\u2019s office first learned of this blemish in U.S. history from a constituent who was seeking posthumous citizenship for his grandmother. She lost hers when she married a Swedish man in 1914. Franken\u2019s office couldn\u2019t accomplish that, so is seeking an official apology as the next-best commendation.\n\nThe Senate doesn\u2019t make a habit of seeking absolution, but this would not be the first time it formally recognized a mistake from America\u2019s past.\n\nIn 2011, the Senate expressed regret for the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, which discriminated against Chinese immigrants.\n\nIn 2009, the Senate apologized for slavery and racial segregation of African Americans.\n\nAlso in 2009, the Senate apologized to Native Americans for \u201cviolence, maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by citizens of the United States.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, the Senate apologized for lynchings and for not having outlawed them.\n\nMakes you wonder what we\u2019ll be apologizing for 100 years from now.\n\nSynchronize watches!\n\nSeems Janice Jacobs\u2019s surprise send-off Thursday morning took planning and subterfuge worthy of Eisenhower\u2019s landing at Normandy.\n\nOn the assistant secretary of state for consular affairs\u2019 last day in office, about 200 applauding, cheering staffers lined the 41 / 2 -block route from her bureau\u2019s building on F Street NW to her office at the State Department.\n\nDon Heflin, chief of the State Department\u2019s visa office, floated the proposal last week, we\u2019re told, along with a five-point implementation plan.\n\nFirst, he instructed, they had to \u201ccreate a ruse to keep\u201d her in the bureau for a half-hour after the usual morning staff meeting so everyone could get ready. The visa office would host a \u201cfarewell coffee,\u201d Heflin told other officials, and \u201cthat should do the trick.\u201d\n\nSecond, five offices within the bureau would start rounding up 60-plus people per block to line the route.\n\nThird, he instructed, \u201cmaintain opsec\u201d (operation security) \u2014 \u201cnot a word to Janice, no use of e-mail distribution lists she might be on.\u201d\n\nFourth, the offices were given block assignments, with the visa office taking the last leg along 21st Street NW as she headed to her favored entrance to the State Department.\n\nFifth, office heads should \u201cbegin exfiltrating people\u201d to their designated blocks as soon as Jacobs went upstairs for the coffee. Heflin would e-mail coordinators \u201cas soon as she comes upstairs,\u201d and the visa office would \u201cmake sure that Janice is not early.\u201d\n\nA 90-minute \u201chappy hour\u201d was scheduled in a conference room \u201cto make posters with the leadership and management tenets\u201d of the office, such as \u201cThink Globally,\u201d \u201cLead by Example\u201d and \u201cFollow Creatively.\u201d\n\nJacobs, wearing a tan trench coat and sneakers, carrying a Blue Cross-Blue Shield tote bag and walking quickly, appeared a bit stunned.\n\nReturn those T-shirts\n\nWe have a new winner in the Loop Obamacare Contest to predict the total enrollees in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhen we announced the winners Wednesday, we said no one guessed that the administration would reach its goal of 7 million enrollees, much less hit the 7.1 million figure that President Obama announced Tuesday.\n\nBut we missed an entry that had been submitted by Alicia Payne, a homemaker from Spotsylvania, Va.\n\nPayne\u2019s admittedly \u201crather optimistic\u201d guess was 7,141,973, which she said she picked because she was married on 7/14/1973.)\n\nShe reminded us Thursday of her entry, but we couldn\u2019t find her e-mail anywhere. The IT people, when they found it, told us the problem was \u201csome undiagnosed technical glitch.\u201d\n\nSo congrats to Ms. Payne. Apparently there are some optimists out there after all.\n\nThe aforementioned\n\nThe Loop Quote of the Week? No contest. Sen. Dan Coats: \u201cI just got a note saying I\u2019m at the wrong hearing.\u201d (See above.)\n\n\u2014 With Colby Itkowitz\n\nThe blog: washingtonpost.com/\n\nintheloop.
