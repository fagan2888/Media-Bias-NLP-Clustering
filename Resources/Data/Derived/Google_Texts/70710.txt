Republican gubernatorial candidate Hal Heiner is wasting no time getting on the air and staying there during the four-way GOP primary for governor.

Heiner released his second television ad of the year Monday focusing on his “outsider” message promising to “get Kentucky working again.”

“As Governor, I’ll fight mandates like Obamacare, Common Core and the War on Coal,” Heiner says in the ad. “It’s time to put career politicians last and Kentucky families first.”

The 30-second spot introduces Heiner as a “successful businessman, conservative and man of faith.”

Gov. Steve Beshear, who is term-limited in the post, has defended Kentucky’s economy saying the state is “back with a vengeance” in his State of the Commonwealth address in early January.

Beshear told reporters recently that he doesn’t have to apologize to anyone for the economic position of the state calling wedge issues like right-to-work “politics.”

Heiner faces state Agriculture Commissioner James Comer, Louisville investor Matt Bevin and former state Supreme Court Justice Will T. Scott in the May GOP primary.
