This de facto tightening of monetary policy has eroded the competitiveness of U.S. exports, eaten into economic growth and diminished company profits repatriated from overseas.\n\n\"(The yuan devaluation) puts the Fed in a difficult spot. It opens the possibility that the Fed might delay (a rate increase),\" said Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management in New York. \"On its own, it makes it harder to raise rates.\"\n\nOver the past decade, the U.S. Congress has pressed Beijing to loosen its dollar-pegged exchange rate to allow the yuan to appreciate, arguing that trillions of dollars of currency market intervention had depressed the yuan artificially and given China an unfair trade advantage on global export markets.\n\nRelated: Can Gold Regain Its Shine?\n\nThat made sense with China growing 10 percent per annum and attracting hundreds of billions of dollars of global capital every year. But with growth expected to slow to its weakest in 25 years and Beijing dipping into its foreign reserves to offset the biggest outflow of capital in years, a looser exchange rate now means a weaker yuan.\n\n\"Treasury now has to choose which is more important,\" said Chovanec, also Adjunct Professor at Columbia School of International Public Affairs. \"Should the renminbi (yuan) float, or should Beijing actively intervene to support it and draw down its reserves?\"\n\nThe People's Bank of China described its move, which caught markets by surprise, as a \"one-off depreciation\" of the yuan and billed it as a free-market reform.\n\nThe yuan's slide to a three-year low instantly rippled across the world. South Korea's won fell 1.6 percent against the dollar, its biggest fall in 10 months, and South African central bank governor Lesetja Kganyago said his country's exports would be less competitive.\n\nPRESSURE ON ASIAN CURRENCIES\n\n\"If China is really moving towards greater alignment with the market, which implies greater yuan weakness, this may be a factor that adds more pressure on China-related currencies,\" Barclays Asia-based strategists said in a note on Tuesday.\n\nRelated: The Fed Is Setting Up the Market for a September Cliffhanger\n\nTheir counterparts at Morgan Stanley also Asian currencies excluding the yen were likely to slide against the dollar.\n\nMany emerging market currencies, including the Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah and Brazil's real, had already slumped to their weakest levels against the dollar in over a decade as capital fled their slowing economies.\n\nThe big question now for emerging markets, where growth has slowed and capital flight has increased dramatically this year, is whether their officials respond to China's move in kind.\n\n\"It was inevitable that China would join the currency war at some point. The key will be the response of other central banks ... There should be further pressure on the currencies of China's trade partners,\" said Nick Lawson, managing director at Deutsche Bank in London.\n\nCentral banks dumped as much as $260 billion of foreign exchange reserves in the second quarter as emerging market central banks tried to mitigate the impact of capital fleeing their own economies.\n\nThe decline was the largest drop in global foreign exchange reserves in more than a decade, outstripping the depletion in 2008-09 when central banks frantically tried to manage the fallout from the global financial crisis.\n\n(Reporting by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Kevin Liffey.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The global currency war entered a new and critical phase on Tuesday as China's surpris", "title": "How a Soaring Dollar Forced China to Devalue Its Currency", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/11/How-Soaring-Dollar-Forced-China-Devalue-Its-Currency", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/11/How-Soaring-Dollar-Forced-China-Devalue-Its-Currency", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The global currency war entered a new and critical phase on Tuesday as China's surpris", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9dbd\"", "article_summary": "That made sense with China growing 10 percent per annum and attracting hundreds of billions of dollars of global capital every year.\nThe key will be the response of other central banks ...\nCentral banks dumped as much as $260 billion of foreign exchange reserves in the second quarter as emerging market central banks tried to mitigate the impact of capital fleeing their own economies.\n\"It was inevitable that China would join the currency war at some point.\nDOLLAR'S STEEP RISEThe dollar has risen 20 percent on a trade-weighted basis in just one year."}
