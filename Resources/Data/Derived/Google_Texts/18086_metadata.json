Out of the remaining seven million uninsured Americans, another estimated three million will be exempt due to \u201chardship exemptions.\u201d As the analysis points out, only four million of the 30 million uninsured Americans will pay the individual shared responsibility payment.\n\nWhat Is the Individual Shared Responsibility Payment?\n\nIf an individual fails to purchase health insurance that qualifies as minimum essential coverage, and does not qualify for an exemption, they will pay the individual shared responsibility payment. The fee is calculated in one of two ways, and the individual is required to pay whichever amount is higher:\n\nOne percent of yearly household income: the maximum penalty is the national average premium cost for a bronze plan.\n\n$95 per adult and $47.50 per child under 18: the maximum family penalty is $285.\n\nThe penalty will increase each year:\n\nIn 2015, the penalty will be 2% of annual income or $325 per adult.\n\nIn 2016, the penalty will be 2.5% of annual income or $695 per adult.\n\nIf an individual in uninsured only part of the year, 1/12 of the yearly penalty applies to each month they are uninsured. However, if an individual has one short gap of less than three consecutive months they are exempt from the penalty.\n\nWhat are the Exemptions from the Individual Shared Responsibility Payment?\n\nIndividuals may qualify for an exemption from the individual shared responsibility payment if they are:\n\nUninsured for one short gap, fewer than three months of the year\n\nUnable to obtain coverage that could cost less than 8% of household income\n\nMember of a federally recognized tribe\n\nMember of a recognized healthcare sharing ministry\n\nEarning an income low enough to have exemption from filing taxes\n\nRead more about exemption from the individual shared responsibility payment here.\n\nWhat Is a Hardship Exemption?\n\nMany of the individuals who are exempt from paying the penalty have been deemed exempt through hardship exemption.\n\nIn order to qualify for a hardship exemption, an individual must fill out an application with the reason applicable to their situation. A hardship exemption is a situation which may have affected an individual\u2019s ability to obtain or pay for health insurance coverage, including homelessness, bankruptcy within the last six months, death of a close family member, experiencing a natural disaster that has caused substantial damage to one\u2019s property, and ineligibility for Medicaid due to one\u2019s state not expanding Medicaid under the ACA.\n\nAn individual may apply for an exemption by:\n\nClaiming the exemptions when filing their 2014 tax return\n\nFilling out the applicable exemption application form for the specific situation\n\nIf the Marketplace deems an individual eligible for exemption, they will mail out a notice of exemption eligibility result. These exemptions can last up to a full calendar year.\n\nHow Do These Exemptions Affect the ACA?\n\nThe idea behind the individual shared responsibility payment is to increase the number of enrollees in health insurance. This, in turn, makes a larger pool of insured individuals, spreading the risk more widely. The concern is that with these exemptions making it easier for healthy, young people to go without health insurance, the risk pool will be filled with older people or those with significant health problems. This could increase the premiums across the board.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nRead the CBO analysis here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to the CBO\u2019s analysis, there are 30 million uninsured Americans, and yet only four million are expected to pay the fee at tax-time.
