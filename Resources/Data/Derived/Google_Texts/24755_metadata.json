Fisher expects his team to fight for a national championship.\n\n\"I still think we're an extremely talented football team,\" Fisher said. \"We're young but I'm anxious to coach this team. The way we approach this will be the same way. What we have to understand is that each team takes its own identity. We have to play to those strengths.\"\n\nFSU must replace nine starters including quarterback Jameis Winston. Sean Maguire appears to be the leading candidate to replace Winston in the fall but First Coast product DeAndre Johnson has impressed Fisher.\n\n\"He has a lot of potential,\" Fisher said. \" He has a lot of talent. He has a chance to be a really good player. Very instinctive, leads naturally just needs to get a better grasp of the offense.\"\n\nThe Seminoles open the season at home September 5th vs. Texas State.\n\nCopyright 2015 by Graham Media Group.
