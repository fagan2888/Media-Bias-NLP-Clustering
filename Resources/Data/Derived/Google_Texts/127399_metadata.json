Across the country, conservatives in particular have debated fiercely whether to pursue voter suppression to remain competitive in an increasingly diverse electorate. There was, however, another way out, as I\u2019ve argued before: Socially and economically conservative values are not unpopular, and if conservatives were to cease supporting people who made speeches at KKK rallies, they could garner enough votes to remain competitive. I worried, though, that the temptation of voter suppression would be too great. And, indeed, a new paper by Ian Vandewalker and Keith Bentele indicates that partisans have chosen the path of voter suppression to an even greater extent than previous thought.\n\nWhen the conservative Supreme Court struck down key parts of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder, states flocked to impose voter ID laws. Early research by Bentele and Erin O\u2019Brien found these laws were \u201chighly partisan, strategic, and racialized affairs.\u201d Another study finds that \u201cwhere elections are competitive, the furtherance of restrictive voter ID laws is a means of maintaining Republican support while curtailing Democratic electoral gains.\u201d Support for voter ID laws among the American population is strong, but also racially based: Voters are significantly more likely to support a voter ID law when they are shown pictures of black people voting than when shown white people voting.\n\nMuch of the extant literature has mainly been focused on voter ID laws; but Vandewalker and Bentele find that the strategy is actually more expansive than that. They have created an extensive metric that includes nine different measures of accessibility, including voter ID, absentee voting and same-day registration. They find that the accessibility of voting systems is negatively correlated with the share of the state\u2019s population that is black (see chart). As the black population increases, voting systems become more inaccessible. The chart below includes all changes that were passed in the legislature; as of writing some of the changes were stalled in court.\n\nThe study finds that between 2006 and 2012, the most influential factor in determining whether a law would be passed was Republican control of government. It also finds that the level of anti-black stereotyping in a state (a measure based on survey respondents\u2019 beliefs about work ethic and intelligence) strongly correlates with the proposal (though not the passage) of voting restrictions. Vandewalker and Bentele find that states with a recent increase in Democratic turnout were more likely to pass a restriction indicating \u201cthe passage of voter restrictions as a partisan response by Republicans to recent Democratic electoral gains.\u201d States with large black populations were significantly more likely to pass restrictive laws. Finally, they note that what little voter fraud exists does not correlate at all with voter restrictions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since SCOTUS gutted the Voting Rights Act, things have gotten bad \u2014\u00a0and are getting worse", "title": "Our election system\u2019s anti-minority bias is even worse than you think", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Since SCOTUS gutted the Voting Rights Act, things have gotten bad \u2014\u00a0and are getting worse", "title": "Our election system\u2019s anti-minority bias is even worse than you think", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/01/our_election_systems_anti_minority_bias_is_even_worse_than_you_think/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/scalia_roberts2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Since SCOTUS gutted the Voting Rights Act, things have gotten bad \u2014\u00a0and are getting worse", "title": "Our election system\u2019s anti-minority bias is even worse than you think", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/scalia_roberts2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Election 2014, elections, The Supreme Court, Voter ID, Voting Rights Act", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Across the country, conservatives in particular have debated fiercely whether to pursue voter suppression to remain competitive in an increasingly diverse electorate.\nI worried, though, that the temptation of voter suppression would be too great.\nThey have created an extensive metric that includes nine different measures of accessibility, including voter ID, absentee voting and same-day registration.\nTopics: Election 2014, elections, The Supreme Court, Voter ID, Voting Rights Act, News, Politics NewsIn the wake of the recent gutting of the Voting Rights Act, partisans were quick to jump on the opportunity to restrict unfavorable voters.\nMuch of the extant literature has mainly been focused on voter ID laws; but Vandewalker and Bentele find that the strategy is actually more expansive than that."}
