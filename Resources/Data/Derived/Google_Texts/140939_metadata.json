As a result, Legislators have not really grappled with the complexities of changing the state's approach to health care until it became clear the next governor would accept Medicaid expansion -- one of the key elements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIt's been difficult to have frank discussions about the implications of Medicaid expansion given Gov. Bobby Jindal's opposition to the policy change. In an interview before the Senate Finance committee's Oct. 26 meeting, state Sen. Fred Mills, R-Parks, expressed frustration about getting information from Jindal appointees about Medicaid expansion.\n\nMills described a previous meeting with DHH officials as \"a bizarre conversation\" in which Jindal appointees were wary of discussing Medicaid expansion, saying elected officials \"left with a lot more questions than answers.\" DHH Secretary Kathy Kliebert and her undersecretary, Jeff Reynolds, did not mention Medicaid expansion during testimony at the Senate Finance meeting, and they were not asked.\n\nBut now Senate Finance Chairman Jack Donahue said he wants the committee to \"come to some conclusions about if we did expand Medicaid, what would the costs be.\" The Senate Finance Committee's meeting Monday (Dec. 7) will be the first to focus on health care since Democrat John Bel Edwards, who campaigned on expanding Medicaid, was elected governor.\n\nSenate Finance members will work with legislative staff to prepare a report for Edwards, about the effect of expanding Medicaid to include more than 250,000 uninsured people in Louisiana. Donahue acknowledged that at the Senate Finance meeting in October, Medicaid expansion was not a focus.\n\n\"What we did first was get what the health care costs were and how health care has grown over the years,\" Donahue said. \"We're going to look at what the cost of Medicaid is and then try to find out if you do expand Medicaid.\"\n\nThe major report DHH produced on the implications of Medicaid expansion is now more than two years old and doesn't contain data that has been gathered in states that have expanded Medicaid. Donahue said there also hasn't been much study done on other state's Medicaid expansion models that could be applied in Louisiana.\n\n\"I know there's a number of things going on in other states, some have accepted Medicaid with provisions for waivers,\" Donahue said. \"Others have just taken a straight Medicaid expansion. There's been some reports out now that some of these states now are having some difficulty with it.\"\n\nDonahue said there are also other questions the committee will need to address about the effect Medicaid expansion could have on private insurers. He said while hospitals are in favor of Medicaid expansion because it will \"financially benefit them,\" there hasn't been much discussion about insurers.\n\n\"We have people in Louisiana on private coverage who are going to drop (their policy) and go onto Medicaid,\" Donahue said. \"What would be the results of that and how many people would be involved in that? Is the Medicaid care better or worse than the private market? I don't think we'll be able to answer all of those questions before you can decide whether Medicaid expansion is worth it.\"\n\nA side issue the committee is likely to discuss will include a problem with legislation passed during the spring that has prompted questions from the Legislative Fiscal Office. That legislation contains a solution for what's expected to drive Medicaid costs in the future: The percentage match the state will eventually have to pay the federal government for Medicaid program costs beginning in 2017 and escalating to 10 percent by 2020.\n\nIt's also possible the committee will address a funding shortfall DHH is facing in the Medicaid program due to a higher-than-expected number of enrollees in Bayou Health.\n\n\"It's still a real problem that will need to be addressed,\" Donahue said. \"We're still trying to lay the groundwork for where we are, how much money we spend, and how much Medicaid will cost the state right now. So far what we've tried to do is gather information to put this thing on paper.\"", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Kevin Litten, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Medicaid, Senate Finance Committee, Jack Donahue, br-homepage, br-politics, homepage, john bel edwards, medicaid expansion, news, politics", "title": "How much will Medicaid expansion cost in Louisiana?
