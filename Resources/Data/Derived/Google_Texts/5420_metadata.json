It is expected to bring in $87 billion in federal revenue by 2025, according to the most recent Congressional Budget Office analysis.\n\nGottfried, a Democrat from Manhattan, said \u201cthe approach of the Cadillac tax ought to be regarded by almost everybody as an oncoming train or worse.\u201d\n\nThe initial idea behind the tax was to limit high-cost \u201cCadillac\u201d coverage plans that offered generous benefits with little cost-sharing, effectively shielding employees from the cost of care.\n\nFrom the time that it was announced, the tax has been fiercely opposed by labor unions that argued it would have an outsize impact on unionized workers who often receive very generous health benefits packages.\n\nThere has also been growing concern about how much taxpayers might end up paying for Cadillac health plans offered to city and state employees. A letter obtained by The New York Times in 2013 from former deputy mayor for operations Cas Holloway to the head of a labor coalition said \u201cthe Cadillac tax would cost New York City $22 million in 2018, increasing to $549 million in 2022.\u201d\n\nHannon, a Republican from Long Island, said that the tax wouldn\u2019t just hit New York's public employees.\n\n\u201cWe have many of our large corporations that will be tagged with having Cadillac plans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have many of the Taft-Hartley unions being tagged with having Cadillac plans.\u201d\n\nThe Taft-Hartley health plans are for private sector unionized employees and are collectively bargained with each employer.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a comprehensive study of just how many health plans could be hit by the Cadillac tax in New York State. But Politico\u2019s Brian Faler reported last month on a survey by benefits consulting firm Mercer, which found that \u201cabout one-third of employers will be hit by the tax in 2018 if they do nothing to change their plans.\u201d\n\nThe number is expected to rise to 60 percent by 2022.\n\nThe fear is that leading up to 2018, many unions and employers might have to reduce their benefit plans in order to avoid the tax. But supporters of the Cadillac tax, like Manhattan Institute fellow Yevgeniy Feyman, argue that the cap on employer-sponsored benefits and the associated increase in cost-sharing on behalf of employees will work to drive down total health care costs.\n\nIn a recent Forbes post, Feyman suggested that the existing structure incentivizes employers to offer more generous health benefits. But if there is a cap on benefits from private employers, then \u201cwages are likely to rise as a result.\u201d\n\nLooking toward 2018, when the tax goes into effect, Hannon said, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very pervasive type of reaction and New York won\u2019t be alone, so Congress may actually have to take steps [to address it].\u201d\n\nEight House members from New York recently signed on as co-sponsors of H.R. 2050, a bill that seeks to repeal the Cadillac tax, including Paul Tonko, Brian Higgins, Christopher Gibson, Sean Patrick Maloney, Jerrold Nadler, Jose Serrano, Hakeem Jeffries, and Nita Lowey. It was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means on April 28.\n\nThe panel discussion, moderated by E.J. McMahon, the president of the Empire Center for Public Policy, touched on several other key issues related to Affordable Care Act implementation in New York State, including the state\u2019s health insurance exchange and the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) program, the overhaul of the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nGottfried, a staunch advocate for a single-payer system, criticized the New York state health insurance exchange, which currently enrolls more than 2.1 million people, for being hard for consumers to navigate.\n\n\u201cWhen people go to the exchange they\u2019ve got a blizzard of information that nobody can ever figure out. So they make their choice the way I pick wine at a restaurant\u2014I look at the red with the lowest price,\u201d he said, generating laughter from the audience. \u201cWith my taste in wine I don\u2019t know if it makes any difference, but the consequence for health care is people then get surprised when they find that they\u2019ve bought the plan with the highest deductible and the narrowest provider networks.\u201d\n\nHannon thinks the exchange \u201chas been relatively successful\u201d when compared to the goals that it set out to achieve. But he questioned whether the exchange would be able to run without state funding by the end of this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to meet the requirement of self-sustaining that the governor said it ought to be,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the key trends discussed on all of the panels throughout the day was how the integration of provider networks, encouraged by the Performing Provider Systems established by the DSRIP program, might affect care delivery.\n\nGottfried voiced his support for more integrated provider systems, but also questioned the role that insurance companies would ultimately play in the new reform landscape.\n\n\u201cIf the providers are forming a network and the providers are doing care coordinating and the providers are getting a capitated payment and distributing it among themselves, at some point we have to ask, why are we paying millions of dollars a year to health plan C.E.O.s?\" he said. \"What are they bringing to the table?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/05/8568249/health-chairs-predict-problems-coming-%E2%80%98cadillac%E2%80%99-tax", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20Richard%20Gottfried_6.png", "type": "article", "title": "Health chairs predict problems with coming \u2018Cadillac\u2019 tax"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "\u2018The approach of the Cadillac tax ought to be regarded...as an oncoming train or worse\u2019"}, "article_summary": "There hasn\u2019t been a comprehensive study of just how many health plans could be hit by the Cadillac tax in New York State.\nThe controversial Cadillac tax, or excise tax on high-premium insurance plans, imposes a 40 percent tax on health premiums above a threshold of $10,200 a year for individuals and $27,500 for families.\nThere has also been growing concern about how much taxpayers might end up paying for Cadillac health plans offered to city and state employees.\nIn a recent Forbes post, Feyman suggested that the existing structure incentivizes employers to offer more generous health benefits.\n\u201cWe have many of our large corporations that will be tagged with having Cadillac plans,\u201d he said."}
