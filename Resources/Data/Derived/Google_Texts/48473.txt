One of the best preserved copies of the first comic book featuring Superman will be auctioned on eBay starting August 14.

“The publication of Action Comics No. 1 marked the first time that Superman rushed to the scene to restore order and peace in the world,” eBay said in a blog post Wednesday.

Published in 1938 and initially sold for 10 cents, Action Comics No. 1 also features Lois Lane, in addition to the first American comic book superhero ever. There are only 50 to 100 original copies still in existence.

The seller, Darren Adams, owner of Pristine Comics, said in a promotional video that he chose eBay to auction because of its worldwide reach and that it’s difficult to estimate how much the book will eventually sell for when the auction closes on Aug. 24. “There’s really no limit to it,” he said.

Almost three years ago, actor Nicolas Cage sold his copy of Action Comics No. 1 for more than $2 million, making it the only single original comic book copy that has sold for that much.

Investing in comic books has become a popular and increasingly lucrative hobby. In June, a Kentucky man sold his collection of about 175 comics for $1.5 million.

A portion of the eBay auction’s proceeds will go to the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation.
