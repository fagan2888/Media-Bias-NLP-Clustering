But this is Cambridge, the city that commands an operating budget upward of $500 million and hosts local offices from some of the wealthiest companies in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich begs the question: Why does a city councilor have to raise $6,000 online for blankets to keep the homeless warm?\n\nThe closing of the Long Island shelter is contributing to a shortage of shelter beds everywhere in Greater Boston. In Cambridge, there are about 9,000 individuals or families on waiting lists for affordable housing in the city.\n\nAlso, the number of people who live below the poverty line, especially blacks and Hispanics, continues to rise in Cambridge, in spite of the economic boom.\n\n\u201cWe are creating this sort of apartheid system here,\u201d said Jim Stewart, program director at the First Church shelter in Cambridge.\n\n\u201cA lot of communities would be very grateful to have Cambridge\u2019s revenue streams. If the city wanted to step up, they could certainly find money to set up emergency beds for winter so lives at risk are taken care of.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlankets are great,\" Stewart added, \u201cbut the only thing that really does make a difference is putting significant resources into services. Our phone rings every hour every day and into the night with a request for a bed. People are stuck in desperate situations.\u201d\n\nIt is not that McGovern isn\u2019t working on the bigger issues.\n\n\u2018It seemed the fastest way to get blankets into people\u2019s hands.\u2019 Marc McGovern, city councilor in Cambridge\n\n\u201cI understand that what the homeless really need is beds,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I can\u2019t get them beds right away, I can at least get them a blanket.\u201d\n\nMcGovern tapped into the Harvard Square Business Association to help promote his campaign, and he considered working with the city or a local nonprofit instead of going with Indiegogo.\n\nBut he knew that would slow down the process significantly.\n\n\u201cWe are having these ongoing, complicated conversations about how to improve the situation in the city,\u201d said McGovern.\n\n\u201cWe are in our ninth year of a 10-year plan to combat poverty and homelessness, and we are nowhere near where we wanted to be,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe have these great partnerships with nonprofits but in the end, we are not doing enough.\u201d\n\nRELATED:\n\n\u2022 \u2018Area Four\u2019 residents live in the shadow of the future\n\n\u2022 How to succeed in crowdfunding\n\n\u2022 A new age of giving with crowdfunding\n\n\u2022 Scientists experiment with crowdfunding\n\n\u2022 BU student turns to \u2018crowdfunding\u2019 site to raise money for tuition and fees", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.951218931", "eomportal-id": 899021, "description": "It is an unconventional move, and one that has allowed McGovern to avoid bureaucracy that could get in the way of good intentions.
