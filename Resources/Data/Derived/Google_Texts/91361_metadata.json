There are two examples from last week\u2019s news cycle that shed some light on that question.\n\nAt the beginning of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, Anderson Cooper challenged Sen. Bernie Sanders on the Vermont liberal\u2019s willingness to describe himself as a democratic socialist. Indeed, the CNN host went so far as to pointedly ask, \u201cHow can any kind of socialist win a general election in the United States?\u201d This is because, for more than a century, socialism has been a dirty word in American politics. Any liberal president who attempted a major economic or social justice reform\u2014be it Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal and John Kennedy\u2019s civil rights promises or President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act\u2014could safely bet that his opponents would accuse him of pushing a socialist agenda.\n\nThis is an unsavory residue from our recent history. Although anti-socialist paranoia has existed in this country since the late 19th century, it reached its nadir during the Cold War, when many liberals joined their right-wing counterparts in denouncing any program that smacked of socialism with the hard communism of America\u2019s sworn enemy, the Soviet Union. There was a time not too long ago when even the suspicion of harboring socialist sympathies could get you blacklisted from jobs in government, academia, business, and entertainment. Although the political climate has changed considerably in the early 21st century, the nasty undertone associated with \u201csocialist\u201d is still strong enough that it\u2019s frequently used as a political insult.\n\nIn fact, that may be a big part of the reason why it has lost so much of its punch. By repeatedly insisting that traditional liberal candidates like John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama are actually socialist, the term\u2019s meaning has been so blurred that voters are not only having trouble identifying the genuine article, but even mustering up the energy to care.\n\nNevertheless, Cooper still knew that\u2014because every Democratic president since FDR can rely on being called a socialist by his critics\u2014a candidate who actually went by that title would need to be interrogated on the subject. I would argue that Cooper\u2019s question, though necessary, would have been even more powerful if he had approached the question of Sanders\u2019 \u201csocialism\u201d as an objective one\u2014i.e., exploring the pros and cons of socialist policies\u2014rather than by acknowledging its taboo nature and thereby implicitly validating it.\n\n\u2666\u25ca\u2666\n\nThis is where Bill Maher enters the picture. In a recent interview with Sanders, Maher began by openly confronting the irrational response to the word \u201csocialist\u201d in American political debate, exclaiming \u201c\u201cThey hear socialist and they think herpes, Bernie!\u201d From there, however, he didn\u2019t give Sanders a free pass, but interrogated him about the potential cost of his proposed programs. Indeed, when Sanders challenged his interviewer to explain why the socialized health care plan he was proposing couldn\u2019t work, Maher more than rose to the occasion. \u201cIf you\u2019re saying that the government is going to pick up the tab but not make the insurance companies, the hospitals, and the doctors not gouge people, then we are going to break the budget,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cIt has to work both ways. So you\u2019re going to make the hospitals do that? Because that is socialism.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie Sanders' policies are finally being evaluated on their own merits, and we have the \"Real Time\" host to thank", "title": "Bill Maher is right about this much: We still have socialism all wrong", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bernie Sanders' policies are finally being evaluated on their own merits, and we have the \"Real Time\" host to thank", "title": "Bill Maher is right about this much: We still have socialism all wrong", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/20/bill_maher_is_right_about_this_much_we_still_have_socialism_all_wrong_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/bill_maher5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bernie Sanders' policies are finally being evaluated on their own merits, and we have the \"Real Time\" host to thank", "title": "Bill Maher is right about this much: We still have socialism all wrong", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/bill_maher5.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Matthew Rozsa", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Anderson Cooper, Bernie Sanders, Bill Maher, CNN, The Good Men Project", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09cc\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Anderson Cooper, Bernie Sanders, Bill Maher, CNN, The Good Men Project, Entertainment News, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on The Good Men ProjectIs the term \u201csocialist\u201d losing its stigma?\nAt the beginning of Tuesday\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, Anderson Cooper challenged Sen.
