And if you\u2019re trying to explain anything to a young person in 2014, then you obviously have to use GIFs (animated images).\n\nSo the latest PSA on WhiteHouse.gov is a bracket in the form of a BuzzFeed-style \u201clisticle\u201d called \u201cThe 16 Sweetest Reasons to Get Covered.\u201d Each argument for getting insured is illustrated by an appropriate GIF, whether it is an image of a cat, puppies chasing each other, a woman twerking on a bathroom sink, or First Lady Michelle Obama dancing with Jimmy Fallon, who is doing his best mom impersonation.\n\nThe White House has been amping up its use of GIFs to make its agenda accessible to young Americans since it launched a Tumblr in April 2013. In fact, its inaugural post endorsed the spelling of GIF with a \u201cHard \u2018G'\u201d \u2014 an \u201cexecutive order\u201d of sorts. Since then, its GIFs have featured the adorable first dog Bo, a list of the 13 best GIFs of 2013, and that moment when President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden went on a run together.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The White House unveils an Affordable Care Act (ACA) bracket pegged to March Madness, and there are cat GIFs.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "And to plug the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "WhiteHouse.Gov Is Using Cat GIFs to Communicate With Young People", "url": "http://time.com/27571/there-are-cat-gifs-on-whitehouse-gov-right-now/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-17-at-2-00-45-pm1.png?w=363", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/screen-shot-2014-03-17-at-2-00-45-pm1.png?w=363"}, "title": "WhiteHouse.Gov Is Using Cat GIFs to Communicate With Young People", "description": "And to plug the Affordable Care Act.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "aka bracket, march madness obamacare, barack obama, michelle obama, affordable care act, insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf4fe\"", "article_summary": "As TIME reported earlier today, the White House is seizing on March Madness to market the Affordable Care Act to young Americans and remind them about the looming March 31 deadline to sign up for health insurance.\nThe White House has been amping up its use of GIFs to make its agenda accessible to young Americans since it launched a Tumblr in April 2013.\nSince then, its GIFs have featured the adorable first dog Bo, a list of the 13 best GIFs of 2013, and that moment when President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden went on a run together.\nAnd if you\u2019re trying to explain anything to a young person in 2014, then you obviously have to use GIFs (animated images).\nIn fact, its inaugural post endorsed the spelling of GIF with a \u201cHard \u2018G'\u201d \u2014 an \u201cexecutive order\u201d of sorts."}
