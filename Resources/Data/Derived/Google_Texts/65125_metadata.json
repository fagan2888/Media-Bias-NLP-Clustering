The international combat mission ends on Dec. 31, leaving the Afghan security forces in charge after leading the fight since the middle of last year.\n\nSome 5,000 members of Afghanistan\u2019s security forces \u2014 army, police and armed rural defense units \u2014 have died this year fighting the Taliban, according to Karl Ake Roghe, the outgoing head of EUPOL, the European Union Police Mission in Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cThe police have lost something like 3,200 this year, so most of the casualties belong to the Afghan National Police,\u201d Roghe, who has led the mission for two and a half years, told The Associated Press. By comparison, some 3,500 foreign forces, including at least 2,210 American soldiers, have been killed in the 13 years since the war began.\n\n\u201cThis is the main problem for Afghanistan \u2013 how they are dividing the responsibilities for fighting the insurgency. This should be a task for the Afghan National Army, not the police. Currently it belongs to the police and the main part of the fight is done by the police,\u201d he said.\n\nGen. Joseph Anderson, second in command of the NATO combat mission until it officially ended earlier this month, described the Afghan losses as \u201cunsustainable.\u201d\n\nAfghanistan has 157,000 police in a force created, trained and funded by the European Union. Almost every day, Afghan authorities report the deaths of policemen in Taliban assaults on checkpoints around rural towns and on the outskirts of larger cities. The police receive little backup from the army and do not have air support, medical evacuation or dedicated hospitals that could help reduce deaths, Roghe said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Afghan police lead insurgent fight at high cost", "title": "Afghan police lead insurgent fight at high cost", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Afghan police lead insurgent fight at high cost", "title": "Afghan police lead insurgent fight at high cost", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/28/afghan_police_lead_insurgent_fight_at_high_cost/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/afghanistan-police.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Afghan police lead insurgent fight at high cost", "title": "Afghan police lead insurgent fight at high cost", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/afghanistan-police.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lynne O'donnell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceba6\"", "article_summary": "The international combat mission ends on Dec. 31, leaving the Afghan security forces in charge after leading the fight since the middle of last year.\nThis should be a task for the Afghan National Army, not the police.\nCurrently it belongs to the police and the main part of the fight is done by the police,\u201d he said.\nAlmost every day, Afghan authorities report the deaths of policemen in Taliban assaults on checkpoints around rural towns and on the outskirts of larger cities.\nAfghanistan\u2019s war is as hot as it has been since the U.S.-led invasion following the Sept. 11 attacks overthrew the Taliban."}
