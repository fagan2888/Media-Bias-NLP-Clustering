Congressman Darrell Issa endorsed Donald Trump on Thursday, adding another prominent Republican lawmaker to his growing list of backers after the businessman became the party's presumptive nominee on Tuesday.

"Elections are choices, and this year provides as clear an option between two candidates as any times in recent memory," Issa said in a statement titled "Donald Trump is the obvious choice for every American."

"Donald Trump is the obvious choice for every American suffering from eight years of disastrous economic policies and anti-job regulations that have causes real pain to tens of millions of Americans who need and deserve better," Issa said. "Donald Trump is the obvious choice for every American harmed by Obamacare, outraged by the continuous corruption of the State Department, Justice Department and the IRS, and worried about a failed foreign policy that has weakened our military, let down our allies and endangered Americans everywhere."

Comparing Trump to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Issa said the former secretary of state represents a continuation of President Obama's "arrogant" administration.

"Hillary Clinton makes it clear she's running for Barack Obama's third term in the White House with nothing but a different name on the door," Issa said. "That makes our choice all the more obvious."

Issa, who was chair of the House Government Oversight committee from 2011 to 2015, led an inquiry into the 2012 attacks on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi that left four dead.
