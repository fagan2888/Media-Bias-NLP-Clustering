The kids love it because we don't have these toys at home,\" Lindsay McMahon of Libertyville said as she joined in to play with her children, Thomas, Clare and Colin. \"So it is a new experience for them and they love the science aspect of it.\"\n\nThe program was paid for, in part, from a grant by the Illinois Library Association with the Innovative Library Award.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Children made scientific discoveries with PVC pipe, liquid-filled cylinders, rubber bands and socks Tuesday at the Hands-On Science Museum at Cook Park Library.
