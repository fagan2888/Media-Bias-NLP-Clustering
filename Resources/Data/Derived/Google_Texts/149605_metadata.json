The new bags include a competitively priced \u201cLizzy\u201d bag which retails for $89.99 in a chic gray chain-link pattern as well as on-trend \u201cAnnie\u201d bags retailing for $165, in Black as well as in \u201cDazzling Blue,\u201d which was named a Pantone\u00ae color trend selection for 2014. The new releases are available for purchase on Amazon.com and through select retailers across the United States.\n\nWith the annual number of babies born in the United States increasing after the recession, breastfeeding rates at 79% for newborns and a provision in the Affordable Care Act mandating that insurers cover breast pumps for new moms (source: CDC.gov), the breastfeeding accessories market is booming. Sarah Wells, LLC entered the market in November 2013 with the \u201cMaddy\u201d breast pump bag. The bag received rave reviews by mothers who wanted an efficient and fashionable way to carry their breast pump, accessories, purse items and more.\n\n\u201cI was inspired to launch this business by my own frustration carrying an ugly and inefficient pump bag to my workplace in Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Sarah Wells LLC, CEO and Founder Sarah Wells. \u201cMy debut design has been such a huge hit with new moms, that I am expanding the collection for the holidays to offer moms a full range of breast pump bag options, including several different price points, materials, patterns and colors.\u201d\n\nSarah Wells breast pump bags were designed with functionality that differs from a regular purse wherein new moms can operate their pump equipment from the sides of the bags, without having to setup and break-down the pump parts during their short work breaks. The bags also feature built in cooler compartments, a large main compartment for purse items and laptops. All bag materials are water resistant and include clear pouches on each side for a picture of baby.\n\n# # #\n\nThe mission of Sarah Wells LLC is to help new mothers feel confident and fashionable by offering functional and stylish high-quality breast pump bags.
