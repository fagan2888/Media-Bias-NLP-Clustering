For example, she explained, I could never be president of the United States. She\u2019d experienced the civil rights movement, fought against apartheid and was a professor of black history and women\u2019s history. She believed that no black person would ever become POTUS in our lifetime\u2014and certainly not a woman. So I always wonder what she would have said if she\u2019d lived to see 2008.\n\nFew things aside from the election of Barack Obama have shocked me over the years, but I did receive one unforgettable surprise a few months back, during the season finale of \u201cEmpire.\u201d When I heard Taraji P. Henson, as Cookie Lyon, utter the words \u201cRun them pearls, ho,\u201d on national television, on a popular show that I knew people from all backgrounds were watching, I couldn\u2019t believe how much things seemed to have actually changed over time. And while it\u2019s in no way comparable to the election of America\u2019s first black president, it felt like a hugely significant cultural moment.\n\n\u201cRun them pearls, ho\u201d is the exact line you would write for a TV show with a predominantly black cast if you had no interest in respectability politics, only in presenting an authentic character whose language was perfectly aligned with her back story and current context. The scene\u2014which culminated in a smack-down between Cookie and Anika Calhoun\u2014was like one of those classic skits from late \u201890s rap albums, made popular by the Ruff Ryders and rappers signed to Def Jam. Hearing Henson utter the phrase made me feel like DMX, Lil\u2019 Kim or Beanie Sigel had been invited into the \u201cEmpire\u201d writer\u2019s room; all rules of popular TV had been broken and\u2014like other big moments in the season\u2014it seemed that we had entered a new Golden Age of TV where soapy dramas were suddenly going to be allowed at the big kids\u2019 table with shows like \u201cMad Men\u201d and \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d (or else create their own table entirely).\n\nIn the same way that I sometimes can\u2019t believe America elected a black president, I can\u2019t believe \u201cEmpire\u201d got away with Cookie Lyon. A character like hers will open up the door for a wider array of diverse women of color on TV who will be written with more concern for authenticity than respectability. The fact that the Emmys are taking notice of this important character with a lead actress nomination is exciting and, hopefully, a sign of better things to come.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that Henson deserves to win.\n\nThe truth is that season one of \u201cEmpire\u201d was full of highs and lows. Many viewers struggled to get through the first couple of episodes, when the soapiness of it all weighed down the show\u2019s positive attributes. And while it was always clear (from that first broomstick butt-whooping) that Taraji P. Henson was going to steal the show, her role was not always written in a way that gave her character the depth it needs to compete with the other great talents nominated this year. Critics and fans agree that, for what she was given, Henson truly delivered. But this is not the season for her Emmy win.\n\nCookie is beloved by so many because she both embraces and subverts certain tropes. Her flashbacks show a young girl from the \u2018hood who rocked that classic Salt-N-Pepa hairstyle, served time in prison and then comes out kicking ass, taking names and wearing a lot of leopard print and fur. She\u2019s no Olivia Pope and she\u2019s no Alicia Florrick. As an intelligent woman without a college degree, who knows how to work the system (and can run the show better than the men around her, all while rocking 6-inch heels), she\u2019s more like Christina Hendricks\u2019 Joan Harris on \u201cMad Men.\u201d And like Joan Harris, it\u2019s going to take time before we get to see what this character is really made of, and what Henson can bring to the role.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I never thought I'd see a character like Cookie on prime-time TV, but her true greatness is yet to come", "author": "Shannon M.
