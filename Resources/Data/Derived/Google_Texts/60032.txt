Taroudant, Morocco – A video posted on YouTube shows one of the Saudi security guards slapping and screaming at a Hajji in the presence of women who seems to be his wife.

The incident took place during the annual pilgrimage, or hajj, a duty that every Muslim, who can afford it, must fulfil once in their lifetime.

In an act of humiliation, the security personnel pushed aside a woman, who stood between him and her husband, and slapped the old man who was in the sacred place, performing the Hajj rituals.

The old Hajji said nothing but a religious statement used for such incidents “Hasbi Allah wa niima alwakil”, Allah suffices me, for He is the best disposer of affairs.

While the causes of this unfortunate incident is unknown, the security personnel has no right to act authoritatively and violently against this Muslim who is in a sacred place, where any form of dispute is religiously unacceptable.

In conformity with the teachings of the Quran, the Hajj is a religious duty that should be performed for able Muslims in tranquility, deep reverence and piousness.

“Hajj is [during] well-known months, so whoever has made Hajj obligatory upon himself therein [by entering the state of ihram], there is [to be for him] no sexual relations and no disobedience and no disputing during Hajj. And whatever good you do – Allah knows it,” Surat Al-Baqarah. 197.

Being “the custodian of the two holy mosques” does not give the Saudi authorities the right to act violently against pilgrims. Everyone who is caught violating the rules and law should be held accountable.
