No one should live in fear of being fired or passed over or discriminated against at work simply because of who they are or who they love,\u201d Labor Secretary Thomas Perez Thomas E. PerezClinton\u2019s top five vice presidential picks Government social programs: Triumph of hope over evidence Labor\u2019s 'wasteful spending and mismanagement\u201d at Workers\u2019 Comp MORE said in a statement. \"Laws prohibiting workplace discrimination on the bases of sexual orientation and gender identity are long overdue, and we're taking a big step forward today to fix that.\u201d\n\nThe LGBT workplace protections spring directly from President Obama\u2019s executive order from July, which called for the Labor Department to issue these rules.\n\nThese companies are already prohibited from discriminating against employees because of their sex, race, color, religion, or nationality.\n\nLGBT workers are protected in 18 states and Washington, D.C., but previously there were no federal rules protecting gay employees across the country.\n\nBut the LGBT protections only apply to the small percentage of private sector companies that do business with the federal government.\n\nWhile the Obama administration can dictate the terms of their contracts with the government, Congress would have to act to protect all private sector employees, including those who do not work for government contractors.\n\nGay rights advocates praised the rules and said they will pave the way for the Obama administration to take action companies that treat LGBT employees unfairly.\n\nTico Almeida, president of the gay rights organization Freedom to Work, said the Labor Department should start by enforcing the rules at ExxonMobil, which he called \u201cthe most anti-gay corporation in America\u201d because of certain workplace policies.\n\nGay rights advocates have long targeted ExxonMobile, but the company denies the claims.\n\n\"ExxonMobil has a zero-tolerance policy that prohibits all forms of discrimination in any company workplace, anywhere in the world, including discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity,\u201d an ExxonMobil spokesman said in a statement.\n\nThe LGBT workplace protections will be published in Friday\u2019s edition of the Federal Register. They go into effect in 120 days.\n\nThis story was updated at 5:16 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Federal contractors are prohibited from discriminating against gay employees under new rules.", "description": "Federal contractors are prohibited from discriminating against gay employees under new rules.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Tim Devaney", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Federal contractors are prohibited from discriminating against gay employees under new rules.", "title": "Labor Department finalizes protections for gay employees", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/225997-labor-department-issues-new-lgbt-workplace-protections", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/225997-labor-department-issues-new-lgbt-workplace-protections", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-04T11:49-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Tim Devaney", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Thomas Perez,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-04T11:49:39-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/225997-labor-department-issues-new-lgbt-workplace-protections", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Federal contractors are prohibited from discriminating against gay employees under new rules.", "card": "summary", "title": "Labor Department finalizes protections for gay employees"}, "dcterms.title": "Labor Department finalizes protections for gay employees"}, "article_summary": "The Labor Department announced Wednesday it is finalizing new workplace protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals employed by government contractors.\nFederal contractors will be prohibited from discriminating against gay employees because of their sexual orientation, under new Obama administration regulations.\nLGBT workers are protected in 18 states and Washington, D.C., but previously there were no federal rules protecting gay employees across the country.\nThe LGBT workplace protections will be published in Friday\u2019s edition of the Federal Register.\nThe workplace protections will prohibit federal contractors from firing, disciplining or not hiring an employee because of his or her sexual orientation or gender identity."}
