As a descendent of a Confederate army general, I figured my defiant intentions were enough to justify an ironic personal experience.\n\nWhy was my trip so effortless? Because the battlefield is a regional park owned and operated by the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority, which has been completely ignored by the shutdown.\n\nAnd the small national cemetery is surrounded by 215 acres of regional park. So even if the feds decides to barricade the entrance, visitors can walk up to the cemetery and peer over the roughly 3-foot tall brick wall.\n\nIn a spurt of curiosity, I searched for other battlefields that are still open.\n\nI found Pamplin Historic Park and National Museum of the Civil War Soldier. A privately owned, 424-acre, historic site located in Petersburg, the site features a restored plantation, re-enactors, a Civil War museum and battlefield.\n\nThe battlefield is where the beginning of the end of the Civil War happened, said Brenna Ralston a marketing specialist for Pamplin Park said.\n\nThe federal government shutdown has been good for business though, because Civil War tour groups, which sometimes are booked months in advance, are left with fewer options.\n\nThe park has increased its hours of operation in order to keep up with the increased demand, Ralston said.\n\nContact Bre Payton at bpayton@watchdog.org or follow her on Twitter @Bre_payton.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Part 42 of 51 in the series Shutdown 2013 By Bre Payton | Watchdog.org Virginia Bureau PURCELLVILLE \u2014 Two parks, one question: Should the federal government be maintaining Civil War sites?
