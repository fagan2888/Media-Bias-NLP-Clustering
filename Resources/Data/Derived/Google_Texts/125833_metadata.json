Jerry Brown isn\u2019t going to have to put up too much of a fight to secure his fourth term in the state\u2019s executive office \u2014 but one of the biggest signs of the success of his governorship to which he\u2019s constantly pointing for his campaign is a basically fake budget \u201csurplus\u201d of a few billion dollars and an ostensibly \u201cbalanced budget\u201d that he supposedly engineered. As David Crane at Bloomberg aptly notes, the state\u2019s progressive Democratic coalition is less about responsible governance than it is about some tricky accounting methods that are in no way an honest portrayal of the state\u2019s tremendously problematic long-term fiscal and economic outlook:\n\nSimilarly, Brown is using cash-based budgeting to underreport the cost of an employee benefit \u2014 retiree health care \u2014 by $3 billion. The governor could have chosen to report the expense at its full size, but to do that under cash-based budgeting, he would have had to actually contribute $3 billion in cash to a retiree health-care trust fund. That\u2019s exactly what governors are supposed to do. Retiree health-care expenses, like pensions, are supposed to be pre-funded in order to protect future generations from having to pick up an earlier generation\u2019s costs. But Brown chose not to do so, making his budget look rosier than it is. This shortchanges future generations, which will have less money for their own services because they will have to pay off the skipped costs. Businesses aren\u2019t permitted to use cash-based budgeting. Instead, they must accrue expenses whether paid or not. During Brown\u2019s current term in office, his budgets will ignore more than $12 billion in retiree health-care costs. \u2026 Brown\u2019s budget this year also ignores more than $3 billion in required contributions to the state teacher pension fund. It\u2019s the largest \u201cskipped\u201d pension contribution in the country and continues a pattern that has led the fund to build up an $80 billion deficit accruing zero-coupon interest at 7.5 percent a year.\n\nAs Crane notes, spending on state services like welfare, universities, and parks is down by more than 20 percent from 2007, while spending on liabilities like employee salaries, pensions, retiree health care, debt service, and Medicaid is up by 20 percent, and the state is in reality nowhere near to a \u201cbalanced budget\u201d \u2014 despite the simultaneous increase in revenue Brown has actually engineered with the voter-approved Proposition 30 tax increase in 2012.\n\nAnd speaking of those recently heightened taxes those oh-so-egalitarian Californians are now paying, J.D. Tucille at Reason points out a poll from last month reporting that most Californians think they\u2019re paying too much in taxes \u2014 but they\u2019re generally still in favor of soaking the rich still more. How glorious.\n\nThe results come in a wide-ranging poll (PDF) conducted last month by the Public Policy Institute of California. Asked, \u201cOverall, how fair do you think our present state and local tax system is\u2014would you say it is very fair, moderately fair, not too fair, or not at all fair?\u201d 3 percent said \u201cvery fair\u201d and 47 percent answered \u201cmoderately fair.\u201d The results were consistent across income groups, with 53 percent of those making over $80,000 agreeing with the 49 percent of Californians earning under $40,000 that the tax system is just swell. Of those polled, 51 percent also said corporations should pay higher taxes and 63 percent called for raising the top income tax rate on the state\u2019s wealthiest residents. But if Californians agree that the other guy should get it in the neck, they\u2019re all ready for a little mercy on their own behalf. Fifty-six percent of those making less than $40,000 say they\u2019re paying more than they should, 59 percent of those making between $40,000 and $80,000 agree, and 64 percent of those earning over $80,000 chime in with a \u201cditto.\u201d\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Gimmicks.", "title": "California budget \u201csurplus\u201d? \u2026Nope, not so much.", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/04/14/california-budget-surplus-nope-not-so-much/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-15T00:11:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-15T00:18:34+00:00"}, "keywords": "Budget, California, debt and deficit, Jerry Brown, taxes,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4315\"", "article_summary": "posted at 8:11 pm on April 14, 2014 by Erika JohnsenAs I mentioned last week, it looks like California Gov.\nBut Brown chose not to do so, making his budget look rosier than it is.\n\u2026 Brown\u2019s budget this year also ignores more than $3 billion in required contributions to the state teacher pension fund.\nCalifornia budget \u201csurplus\u201d?\nDuring Brown\u2019s current term in office, his budgets will ignore more than $12 billion in retiree health-care costs."}
