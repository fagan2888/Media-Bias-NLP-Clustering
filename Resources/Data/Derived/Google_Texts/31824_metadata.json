They\u2019re running so fast from patient to patient. It\u2019s amazing the amount of knowledge that they have and what they know and all they know about the patients.\u201d\n\nKeith Brill, president of the Clark County Medical Society, said the program gains popularity as people participate in it. Many didn\u2019t realize it existed and want to do it again, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique opportunity to go behind the scenes of a medical practice and get to see a glimpse of what the world of medicine looks like from providers point of view. I kind of look at it like someone who goes on a cruise and there\u2019s a behind the scenes tour like to go see a bridge. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re as fascinating as a cruise ship, but people are intrigued by it but most don\u2019t get a chance to go see what it\u2019s like.\u201d\n\nMost people see a doctor only through the lens of a patient, but people in the program see the challenges providers face in terms of their schedules, dealing with medical records, hospitals calling them and insurance companies authorizing or denying procedures, Brill said. They get to hear the prospective of the doctors and see the back-office challenges, he said.\n\n\u201cMany people assume these rich doctors just like to complain,\u201d Brill said. \u201cThat\u2019s not at all what we are doing. The profession of medicine has changed from previous generations. It\u2019s a business like any other business and there are real changes. This is a business where most patients aren\u2019t paying for their care upfront. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re putting it on a credit card. It\u2019s paid for by an insurance company or third-company provider months and months later. For community leaders to see how the process works for a doctor\u2019s office, it gives them an idea of what it\u2019s like to practice medicine.\u201d\n\nMichael Rocheleau, marketing director and administrator of Right Lawyers, spent his internship with pediatric gastroenterologist Howard Baron. He said his experience impressed him about the complexity of medicine in dealing with children and how much knowledge doctors must have. Rocheleau said for those who say Las Vegas doesn\u2019t have any good doctors, they haven\u2019t met Baron.\n\n\u201cWe hear people say they don\u2019t like the school system and you read about that in the papers.,\u201d Rocheleau said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing with doctors. You hear we don\u2019t have great doctors and we don\u2019t have this and we don\u2019t have that. We are not Los Angeles or San Francisco but individually there\u2019s some really good doctors, and the program taught me that.\u201d\n\nBrill said it\u2019s great that the medical community gets involved with the non-medical community and establishes relationships with legislators and other leaders as issues arise in the Southern Nevada medical community.\n\nWilliam Evans, a pediatric cardiologist, said he\u2019s been participating in the program for several years and recently hosted Marcia Turner, vice chancellor of the Nevada System of Higher Education and Assemblyman Paul Aizley. Evans said the program exposes people to the care that\u2019s provided and said participants if they aren\u2019t familiar with the profession are shocked at what doctors do in their daily practices.\n\n\u201cPeople think they have to go somewhere else for health care,\u201d Evans said. \u201cWhen these people see what we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s an eye-opening experience. It\u2019s very helpful.\u201d\n\nRocheleau acknowledges the internship changed her perspective and encourages other people to participate it in the program. It gave her a perspective on the back end of the medical profession, she said.\n\n\u201cThe level of patient care and the connection doctors have with patients is really neat,\u201d Rocheleau said. \u201cI always heard the joked that if you want a good doctor, go to the airport. There are so many good doctors that are really committed to the good practice of medicine and their patients. They put their patients first. It really did change my perception of our physicians in Southern Nevada.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/business-press/business-medicine/mini-internship-program-offers-insight-how-medical", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "BUCK WARGO southern nevada business of medicine", "parsely-title": "Mini-internship program offers insight on how medical profession operates", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_INTERNS-MEDICAL-2.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "The semiannual mini-internship program sponsored by the Clark County Medical Society has provided insight into how the medical profession works and appreciation for what Southern Nevada has in terms of doctors.", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/business-press/business-medicine/mini-internship-program-offers-insight-how-medical", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_INTERNS-MEDICAL-2.jpg"}, "title": "Mini-internship program offers insight on how medical profession operates", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2014-06-23T23:52:11Z", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1889056"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1380995", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1380995", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540820524", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "BUCK WARGO southern nevada business of medicine", "parsely-section": "Business of Medicine", "keywords": "Business of Medicine,Business Press, Business,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-23T16:52:11-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Business of Medicine,Business Press,Business", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "The semiannual mini-internship program sponsored by the Clark County Medical Society has provided insight into how the medical profession works and appreciation for what Southern Nevada has in terms of doctors.", "title": "Mini-internship program offers insight on how medical profession operates", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/business-press/business-medicine/mini-internship-program-offers-insight-how-medical", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_INTERNS-MEDICAL-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "The semiannual mini-internship program sponsored by the Clark County Medical Society has provided insight into how the medical profession works and appreciation for what Southern Nevada has in terms of doctors."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda381\"", "article_summary": "The semiannual mini-internship program sponsored by the Clark County Medical Society has provided insight into how the medical profession works and appreciation for what Southern Nevada has in terms of doctors.\nThere are so many good doctors that are really committed to the good practice of medicine and their patients.\nRocheleau said for those who say Las Vegas doesn\u2019t have any good doctors, they haven\u2019t met Baron.\nYou hear we don\u2019t have great doctors and we don\u2019t have this and we don\u2019t have that.\n\u201cThe level of patient care and the connection doctors have with patients is really neat,\u201d Rocheleau said."}
