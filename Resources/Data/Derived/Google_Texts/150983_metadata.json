Burwell, which could fundamentally undermine Obamacare by, ironically, upholding the law as written, passed, and signed by the president.\n\nThe Supreme Court will probably rule in late June of next year, and if it decides in favor of the plaintiff, Obamacare opponents will have achieved a major victory.\n\nThe dispute in King is fairly simple. The actual text of the Affordable Care Act states that tax credits for individuals to purchase health insurance are available only for insurance policies purchased through an Obamacare exchange \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d More than 30 states have chosen not to set up exchanges, instead allowing the federal government to do so.\n\nIgnoring the language of the law, the Obama administration decided to give tax credits through the federally established exchange. This triggered several lawsuits, with two courts ruling to uphold the law as written, thereby preventing tax credits from being given to individuals who signed up through the federal exchange, while a third court sided with the administration\u2019s argument that Congress simply forgot to write into the law a provision stating that tax credits could be given through the federal exchange. It\u2019s easy to predict how President Obama and his allies will react if the Supreme Court rules against their expansive interpretation of Congress\u2019s intent and declares that the law should be administered as written. They will bludgeon Republicans for months or years for \u201ctaking away health care from millions of Americans,\u201d even though the truth is that it\u2019s entirely the fault of the Democrats who hastily passed and signed the law without reading it \u2014 not a single Republican voted for it.\n\nThis firestorm will put intense pressure on Congress and on Republican governors and state legislators to rewrite the law to Obama\u2019s liking or to create state exchanges where they haven\u2019t been established. To avoid this demagoguery, Congress should pass legislation authorizing tax credits in states that don\u2019t set up exchanges. But here\u2019s the catch: While making the tax credits available to everyone in states with federal exchanges, they should not be made available through the federal exchanges. Nor should those credits be based on the current convoluted formula that gives aid to some people while leaving others out.\n\nInstead, Republicans should pass legislation that gives tax credits along the lines they have long proposed, allowing anybody who buys insurance in the individual market to get a credit toward the cost, avoiding the federal exchange and all the cumbersome bureaucracy and mandates that come with it.\n\nSeveral such proposals have already been offered. The 2017 Project proposes tax credits based on age. Those under age 35 would receive a $1,200 tax credit, those over 50 would receive a $3,000 tax credit, and those in between would receive $2,100. The concept is straightforward: Give people a tax credit \u2014 in the form of an IRS refund \u2014 for buying health insurance, and then get out of the way.\n\nCongress would have to do more than just give tax credits, of course. The legislation should also repeal the law\u2019s benefit mandates, which, for example, require 61-year-old women to pay for maternity coverage. This will lower insurance costs and make those tax credits go much further.\n\nIf President Obama becomes desperate to sign something that preserves at least part of his signature domestic legacy, Republicans might even be able to get real Medicaid reform into the legislation. The gold standard would be block grants giving states greater authority to experiment and design their own insurance coverage for the poor on the basis of local needs, not federal dictates.\n\nThe beauty of this approach is that it will turn the tables on Obama and his allies when they demand that the Republican Congress \u201cfix\u201d the problem the GOP had nothing to do with creating. If Republicans pass legislation authorizing tax credits in states that haven\u2019t set up exchanges, suddenly it will be Obama and his veto pen that are \u201ctaking away health care from millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court may hand Republicans a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity next June to get market-oriented health-care reform passed by Congress and signed by a leftist president.
