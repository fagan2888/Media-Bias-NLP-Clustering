He apparently didn\u2019t feel good about asking for money that wasn\u2019t going to buy anything. He did like to travel, though. The prop that his speech, which was delivered in a wood-panelled barn in Columbus, seemed to lack was a Kodak carousel of slides from his trips to New Hampshire (\u201cI visited these beautiful, beautiful towns\u201d), Florida (\u201cthe energy of Miami Beach\u201d), California (\u201cbeing able to sit in traffic in Los Angeles!\u201d), and Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula (\u201cI never knew it was actually located above Wisconsin\u201d). He recalled that, when he arrived in that part of Michigan with his campaign staff members, he told them, \u201cWould you all please put down your phone, because this is a winter wonderland. This is magical.\u201d He did not mention the name that they may have been reading on their phones while he exhorted them to stare at the snow: Donald Trump.\n\nThe passivity of certain Republican leaders in the face of the coming Trump nomination will take any number of forms. Some will talk about picking the lesser of two evils; some, like the two Bush Presidents, will \u201csit it out\u201d; some, like Senator Kelly Ayotte, of New Hampshire, will keep lexicographers busy explaining the difference between endorsing and supporting; others will persuade themselves that they have an obligation to join Trump\u2019s team to make him a little better\u2014careerism in the guise of a patriotic duty. Paul Ryan told Jake Tapper, of CNN, that he was still thinking about whether to support Trump (\u201cI am not there right now. I hope to and want to\u201d). And then there\u2019s Kasich, taking a close look at his own role in the 2016 Republican Presidential primaries and concluding, with a note of pleasure, that he just might have done something to help the tourism industry in Ohio.\n\nKasich spent hours on debate stages and in close quarters with Trump; he mentioned those encounters in his announcement, but only to congratulate himself for having made it to the main events and, in his mind, for having won a couple of debates. The theme of Kasich\u2019s goodbye was that his very Kasich-ness had improved the tone of the enterprise, and that this was contribution enough. One doesn\u2019t want to be ungrateful for small blessings. But maintaining a minimal level of dignity is a starting point, not a triumph. Glorifying politeness can be its own trap, leading to distortions, linguistic and otherwise. Calling Kasich \u201cmoderate\u201d became an observation about his unwillingness to discuss his opponents\u2019 body parts, rather than his own policies, which were not all that moderate. (Cruz wanted to defund Planned Parenthood, and compared the organization to a gang of felons; in Ohio, Kasich did defund it.) His role seemed to be to inspire encomiums about how decency didn\u2019t stand a chance these days, an argument that would have been more persuasive if he\u2019d ever really made it a fighting chance, rather than a chuckling one. His vanity about his own good cheer\u2014\u201cAnd they love me,\u201d he said of his supporters\u2014could, at times, make him prickly (a trait that emerged in odd places, including a Judaica bookstore in Brooklyn). A friend of his told ABC News that Kasich\u2019s great fear was that people would \u201cstart making jokes\u201d about him. Before he decided to withdraw, his campaign put out a Web ad in the style of the opening scroll of a \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie, in which he was called \u201cOur Only Hope\u201d\u2014not against Trump but against Hillary Clinton. (The dark times that might come otherwise involved increased spending on Obamacare and gun control.) In a moment that might have called for some engagement\u2014some reckoning with the bigotry and xenophobia of his party\u2019s standard-bearer\u2014Kasich congratulated himself on his disengagement.\n\nThe only grappling in his farewell speech came in the form of an ode to hugs. \u201cWe all remember that hug in South Carolina,\u201d he said. For those who do not, it occurred when a young man at a town hall talked about a series of wrenching personal crises and Kasich came down off the stage and embraced him. \u201cHe just wanted to give me a hug,\u201d Kasich said, \u201cand the country marvelled.\u201d That marvelling, as he told it, continued through a season of hugs in multiple states, like the time a woman in Michigan talked about losing her son. \u201cEverybody in that hall embraced that woman,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cSee, stories like this occurred all across our country. And I think it\u2019s frankly because, for whatever reason, God gave me the grace to make people feel safe and comfortable.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump seems to have felt safe and comfortable enough, after Kasich\u2019s announcement, to say that he might vet him for the Vice-President\u2019s job (though the next morning he told CNBC that he was unlikely to actually choose him). If Trump has been your opponent\u2014if you were, momentarily, his only opponent, as Kasich was after Ted Cruz withdrew, on Tuesday night\u2014an admonition might be a more suitable exit note than a gleeful recitation of your own personal charms. But the only political passion that Kasich showed in his goodbye speech was in a broad call to lower taxes and to get rid of regulations; of the issues facing the country, he said, there was \u201cfrankly, nothing more imperative\u201d than passing a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Otherwise, people should listen to one another and be good neighbors, with a charitable spirit. \u201cWhen we help someone else to rise, it opens us up to receive the things that we need in our lives,\u201d Kasich said. But what did he ever need from Donald Trump?", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160526204643, "description": "Amy Davidson on John Kasich\u2019s decision to suspend his campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination.", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "The Ohio governor did not mention, in the course of his speech, the campaign of Donald Trump.", "title": "John Kasich Drifts Away - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Davidson-Kasich-Drifts-Away-1200x630-1462477538.jpg", "height": 630}, "updated_time": "2016-05-06T12:15:52-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/john-kasichs-short-goodbye", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Ohio governor did not mention, in the course of his speech, the campaign of Donald Trump.", "creator": "@tnyCloseRead", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Davidson-Kasich-Drifts-Away-1200x630-1462477538.jpg", "title": "John Kasich Drifts Away - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"3199927\",\"title_alt\":\"John Kasich Drifts Away\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2016\\/05\\/Davidson-Kasich-Drifts-Away-728x375-1462477515.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "Amy Davidson", "tag": "Presidential Candidates", "published_time": "2016-05-05T17:02:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-06T12:15:52-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 3199927, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "2016 Presidential campaign, John Kasich, Presidential Candidates"}, "article_summary": "(Cruz wanted to defund Planned Parenthood, and compared the organization to a gang of felons; in Ohio, Kasich did defund it.)\n\u201cEverywhere I went in America, I told people about our beautiful, beloved state,\u201d Governor John Kasich, of Ohio, said on Wednesday, when he announced that he was suspending his campaign for the Presidency.\n\u201cWhen we help someone else to rise, it opens us up to receive the things that we need in our lives,\u201d Kasich said.\nA friend of his told ABC News that Kasich\u2019s great fear was that people would \u201cstart making jokes\u201d about him.\nThe passivity of certain Republican leaders in the face of the coming Trump nomination will take any number of forms."}
