Burwell, isn\u2019t a constitutional case. It\u2019s a straightforward, (and deeply ridiculous) statutory interpretation case. But Roberts could easily combine the flexibility he showed in the mandate ruling with the logic of the Medicaid ruling, and save the law one more time. In fact, in a world of pure intellectual consistency, there\u2019s no way for Roberts to avoid this conclusion.\n\nTo oversimplify for a moment, the issue in King is whether five decontextualized words in the ACA statute\u2014\u201cExchange established by the State\u201d\u2014mean that the IRS can\u2019t lawfully subsidize health plans on exchanges facilitated by the federal government. If you want to know why this interpretation amounts to a baseless solicitation of right-wing judicial activism, read this or watch this.\n\nJust because the case is ludicrous, though, doesn\u2019t mean conservative justices won\u2019t do the right\u2019s bidding. Roberts, too, could agree with the challengers that the plain language of the statute unambiguously precludes the provision of subsidies to states that don\u2019t set up their own exchanges. But that doesn\u2019t have to be the end of the story.\n\nBecause if that\u2019s how you read the statute, then you\u2019re positing that Congress has used its spending and regulatory powers to compel states to set up their own exchanges. But if it\u2019s unconstitutionally coercive for the federal government to say \u201ctake this [i.e. Medicaid expansion money], or lose all of your existing federal Medicaid funds,\u201d it might also be unconstitutional for the federal government to say, \u201cdo this [i.e. set up an exchange] or we\u2019ll break the insurance markets in your state.\u201d\n\nObviously, the line between constitutional incentive and unconstitutional coercion is completely arbitrary, and Roberts might just shrug and say that the Medicaid expansion and the exchange subsidy scheme fall on different sides of the same line. But it\u2019s easy to imagine at least a few Healthcare.gov states freaking out about the possibility of a bad ruling, and ramping up their own exchanges, which they weren\u2019t inclined to establish in the first place. Which would go to show that they were coerced into doing something they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have done.\n\nIn a similar spirit, several states, including swing states like Virginia and North Carolina, along with conservative redoubts like Arkansas and Mississippi, have argued in an Amicus brief that the challengers' reading of the statute renders the subsidy scheme unconstitutional because, per the so called Pennhurst doctrine, Congress can't use its spending power to penalize states without giving them a heads up. \"Congress must give States clear notice of conditions imposed under Spending Clause statutes,\" the brief reads. \"[T]here was no such clear notice here.\"\n\nBut if the Court\u2019s reading of the subsidy scheme renders the statute unconstitutionally coercive or injurious, then, per U.S. v Booker, the Court should ask \u201cwhat 'Congress would have intended' in light of the Court\u2019s constitutional holding.\" And in so doing, Roberts et al would probably have to make the establishment of an exchange optional, with no penalty for using the federal fallback, just like they did when they made the Medicaid expansion optional. Along similar lines, Roberts could find for the government by invoking the principle that the Court ought to interpret the statute in a plainly constitutional way, rather than trespass into difficult constitutional questions.\n\nThe beauty of this scenario is that in addition to being a logically and intellectually consistent conclusion for Roberts to reach, it would also raise an elegant middle finger to all of the people on the right who called his integrity into question after he saved the ACA. I wouldn't bet on this outcome. But let\u2019s hope he doesn\u2019t read this article anyhow.\n\nHalbig Burwell State Amicus by The New Republic\n\nThis article has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Because the Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in King vs. Burwell, the odds that the Court\u2019s five conservative justices will void Affordable Care Act subsides in states that didn\u2019t set up their own exchanges just spiked, from low to frighteningly high.
