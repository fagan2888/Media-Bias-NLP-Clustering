Chris Murphy Chris MurphyOvernight Healthcare: IRS doubted legality of ObamaCare payments, ex-official says Week ahead: Pressure builds on Zika funding Dems pressure Obama on vow to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees MORE (D-Conn.) on Tuesday defended President Obama\u2019s decision to wait before expanding military action against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, saying that the terror group couldn\u2019t be defeated in the \u201cshort term.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't think you are going to defeat ISIS in the short term. You essentially have to dramatically weaken them and stop this perceived inevitable momentum,\u201d Murphy said in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cAnd so, the president is right for the time being to conduct these strikes inside Iraq that are going to substantially stop their momentum.\u201d\n\nMurphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the U.S. wouldn\u2019t be able to unilaterally weaken the group and must gather support from allies.\n\n\u201cThe only way you're gonna stop ISIS is by rallying Sunni and Shiite regions and countries to the cause as well. So they need to be stopped, but it can't be done by the United States alone,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Democrat echoed Obama\u2019s plea for regional allies to get involved. Obama last week tasked Secretary of State John Kerry with building such a coalition. Murphy, however, expressed skepticism that U.S. allies, such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt would intervene.\n\n\u201cI think it's going to be very difficult,\u201d Murphy said. He noted that, in some cases, it was U.S. adversaries like Iran that shared American interests and took action.\n\n\u201cBut this is going to be an incredibly tricky dance,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd I think that is why the president needs to take his time here. The American public do not want us rushing into a conflict.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to go into Syria with military power, he's gotta come to Congress,\u201d Murphy added.\n\nPressure on Obama to take aggressive military action on ISIS in Syria has been intensifying, but the president said last week the administration doesn\u2019t have a comprehensive strategy yet.\n\nCritics who say Obama is not taking the threat from ISIS seriously seized on the remarks. The White House said the president was only referring to the question of expanding current strikes against ISIS in Iraq to Syria.\n\nOver the weekend, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the president has been \u201ctoo cautious\u201d with the U.S. response to ISIS.\n\nMurphy dismissed that criticism.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, I have a lot of respect for Sen. Feinstein, but I think he's right to take his time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to think first and shoot second rather than the opposite.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
