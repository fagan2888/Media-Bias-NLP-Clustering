The Cavs managed without him, going 17-7 to start the season. But Cleveland is more complete with the All-Star point guard healthy and back.\n\nMatthew Dellavedova made four 3-pointers and added 20 points for the Cavs, who improved to 12-1 at home and are eyeing a Christmas Day game against the Warriors. James didn\u2019t play in the fourth quarter, logging a season-low 26 minutes.\n\nNerlens Noel had 15 points and 12 rebounds for the brutal Sixers, now 0-17 on the road and on their second double-digit losing streak.\n\nIrving received a warm ovation from the crowd during pregame introductions. He waved in appreciation and was soon cheered again as he dribbled the ball up the floor for the first time, a sight Cleveland fans have been waiting months to see.\n\nIrving missed his first five shots before scoring on an uncontested layup after James made a steal near mid-court. Following the assist, James walked over to Irving, who moments earlier had a shot rejected by Noel, patted his teammate on the head as they walked toward the bench and said, \u201cWelcome back.\u201d\n\nThe Cavs plan to ease Irving into the rotation, building up his stamina before extending his minutes. After he was taken out in the first quarter, Irving immediately began riding a stationary bike to stay loose.\n\nIrving scored just two points in the first half, but had seven in the third quarter when he showed a couple moves that have made him one of the league\u2019s premier backcourt players. He made a signature crossover dribble and scored on a twisting layup before dropping a 3-pointer to give the Cavs a 62-40 lead.\n\nWhen the Cavs pushed their lead to 28 after three, it appeared Irving\u2019s long-awaited debut was over. But coach David Blatt brought him in for five more minutes in the fourth quarter. Irving made a 3-pointer and tossed a perfect alley-oop pass to Jared Cunningham, who caught it with his right hand and dunked in one motion.\n\nCleveland outscored Philadelphia 34-13 in the second quarter to take control.\n\nJames seemed intent on net letting the Sixers gain any confidence. He scored 11 points in the quarter, finishing a 9-0 run with a two-handed dunk off a lob pass from J.R. Smith. James hung on the rim and kicked his legs like a little kid to punctuate the play.\n\nTIP-INS\n\n76ers: Sixers coach Brett Brown coached Irving\u2019s father in Australia and has known the 23-year-old since \u201che was two days old.\u201d Brown unsuccessfully tried to recruit Irving for the Australian national team. \u2026 Newly hired associate coach Mike D\u2019Antoni will join the team on Philly\u2019s upcoming trip that starts Dec. 26 in Phoenix. \u2026 The Sixers came in last in the league in shooting percentage (.418) and points per game (91.4).\n\nCavaliers: The crowd roared when Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel\u2019s touchdown pass against Seattle was shown on the arena scoreboard. Fans gathered around TVs at halftime to catch up on the action. \u2026 G Mo Williams missed his second straight game with a sprained right thumb. \u2026 G Iman Shumpert returned after sitting out one game with a strained groin. He had three points in 15 minutes.\n\nUP NEXT\n\n76ers: Host Memphis on Tuesday night.\n\nCavaliers: Host New York on Wednesday night.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kyrie Irving returns, Cavaliers rock lowly 76ers, 108-86", "title": "Kyrie Irving returns, Cavaliers rock lowly 76ers, 108-86", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/20/kyrie-irving-returns-cavaliers-rock-lowly-76ers-108-86/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151112_103645_kyrie-irving.jpg", "height": 450}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151112_103645_kyrie-irving.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-20T14:10:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:42:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After he was taken out in the first quarter, Irving immediately began riding a stationary bike to stay loose.\nCLEVELAND \u2014 Kyrie Irving scored 12 points and played 17 minutes in his season debut and LeBron James had 23, leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 108-86 victory Sunday over the Philadelphia 76ers, who lost their 10th straight and fell to 1-28.\nCleveland outscored Philadelphia 34-13 in the second quarter to take control.\nIrving missed his first five shots before scoring on an uncontested layup after James made a steal near mid-court.\nHe scored 11 points in the quarter, finishing a 9-0 run with a two-handed dunk off a lob pass from J.R.
