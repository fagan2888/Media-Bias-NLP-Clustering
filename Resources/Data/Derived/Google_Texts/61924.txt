The Junque Factory, which sold repurposed and vintage merchandise, has closed.

Owner and founder Sara Alexander delivered the message on Facebook this week: Though operating the store has been a “blast...it’s time for us country folk, to head back to the farm,” Alexander wrote.

The store opened in April 2011 in downtown Papillion.

Alexander is also the founder of Junkstock, held twice a year on her family’s farm at 315 South 192nd Street (192nd and Dodge). The festival, which is held in June and October, features music, vintage, antique and repurposed merchandise.

In recent months, Junkstock took on a life of its own, forcing her to choose between running a retail store and planning the festival.

“I literally had to choose -- it was one or the other,” Alexander said. “I’ve got two small children and planning Junkstock is really a full-time job.”

The fourth Junkstock is planned from Oct. 11 through Oct. 13, and will feature more than 100 vendors, she said. Last June, Junkstock drew more than 15,000 visitors, she said.

Alexander said she may host a “couple of great sales a year at our old stompin’ grounds, in the chicken coop.”
