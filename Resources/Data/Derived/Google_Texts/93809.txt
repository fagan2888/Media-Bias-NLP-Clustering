SANTA CLARA, Calif. — David Amerson did not play for the Washington Redskins in their 17-13 loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday because he missed at least part of a team meeting late last week, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.

It’s unclear whether Amerson, one of the Redskins‘ two starting cornerbacks, was not present for the start of the meeting or missed it altogether. Coach Jay Gruden confirmed Amerson broke a team rule but did not share what he did when asked, saying only that “it’s just an in-house deal.”

“It was my decision not to play David,” Gruden said. “He’s going to play for us for a very long in the future, but, you know, unfortunately, it was not today.”

Amerson, who started the first 10 games of his second season and has 42 tackles, will be available next week for the Redskins‘ game at Indianapolis. He joined the rest of his teammates on the trip from the team hotel in Palo Alto to Levi’s Stadium on Sunday morning, even going so far as to warm up before the game.

With Amerson out, Tracy Porter started alongside rookie Bashaud Breeland, with strong safety Trenton Robinson serving as the nickelback for most of the game. The Redskins began with Porter sliding over to cover the slot receiver with E.J. Biggers assuming Porter’s role on the right side, but Biggers left the game with 12:46 remaining in the first quarter — the 49ers’ third offensive snap — after colliding with inside linebacker Perry Riley and sustaining a concussion.

But then Porter left the game in the third quarter after sustaining a right shoulder injury, leaving Breeland and Greg Ducre, an undrafted rookie who joined the Redskins prior to their game at Arizona on Oct. 12, as the only healthy corners. Ducre, who had not played a snap on defense in two games, intercepted a pass intended for Anquan Boldin on his third play.
