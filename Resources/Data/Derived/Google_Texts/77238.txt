Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee did battle Monday with the ladies of ‘The View’ and boy did it get heated.

Whoopi Goldberg started right in with the old liberal argument about banning only “some guns” as if they would stop after just some.

“Criminals do not obey the laws we have,” Huckabee said. “You could pass 100 new laws and they’re not gonna suddenly say ‘Oh well now that you’ve passed that one I’ll start abiding by it.’ You’re just taking firearms away from people who have every right to own them and who aren’t dangerous.”

When the subject switched to Syrian refugees things got even more heated.

Goldberg suggested that the writing on the Statue of Liberty would have to change if America denies entry to Syrian refugees.

“The Statue of Liberty is very clear,” he said. “Bring your tired, your weary “It didn’t say bring terrorists.”

“We hear ‘don’t worry we’ll vet them.’ This lady that just shot up the party, she had been vetted, she had been thoroughly vetted. So if the same people that gave us the Obamacare website and gave us the vetting of this particular terrorist…” he said before Goldberg interrupted him.

“If you’re gonna blame this on President Obama I’m gonna kick you in the leg,” she fired back in jest.

On the topic of the Islamic State Huckabee said ground troops would be “on the table” if he were president.

“I would never, ever, ever tell our enemy what our limits are,” he said. “What we have to do is look at this rather than by what were going to do, make it that what were going to do is we’re gonna defeat those guys. We’re gonna take it to them. Were going win, they’re going to lose.”
