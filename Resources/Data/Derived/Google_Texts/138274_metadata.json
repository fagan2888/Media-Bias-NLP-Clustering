Obamacare repeal vote fails in Senate\n\nThe Senate on Sunday voted down a Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, the GOP\u2019s first attempt to get rid of the president\u2019s health law since the party took control of the chamber in January.\n\nThe effort fell 49-43, exactly along party lines, with eight senators not voting in the rare weekend session. Three-fifths of the Senate would have had to vote to add Obamacare repeal to a highway funding bill.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) is expected to ask the Senate \u2014 likely Monday \u2014 to reconsider the Obamacare amendment. He would propose a procedural motion to change Senate rules in order to try to repeal the Affordable Care Act with just 51 votes.\n\nSuch a momentous change in the Senate\u2019s rules is unlikely. But conservatives have suggested that they would chastise Republicans who would block a rule change that could lead to repealing the health law that they detest.\n\nRepublican Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) all initially voted against repeal but changed their votes within minutes after the apparent mistakes. Paul\u2019s aide was spotted on the floor talking with the senator after the initial vote was cast. Collins and Sasse corrected their votes at the same time and shared comments on the Senate floor.\n\nOther than that, Sunday\u2019s repeal vote played out as expected. No Republican or Democrat has expressed any hint that they would break from their party\u2019s firmly held position on Obamacare.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) predicted that outcome on Friday as he railed against Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s decision to hold the vote, saying it was done to placate conservatives who were angry that another vote was called to authorize the Export-Import bank.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a vote on repealing Obamacare. The Republicans will all vote yes, the Democrats will all vote no. It will be at a 60-vote threshold, it will fail,\u201d Cruz said then. \u201cIt will be an exercise in meaningless political theater.\u201d\n\nYet the vote does allow Republicans \u2014 particularly freshman lawmakers \u2014 to say that they\u2019ve cast a vote to repeal the ACA. Several had said they wanted a chance to get on the record on a campaign promise they\u2019d all made.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do in my short time here is look at the commitments I made to the constituents and voters of Alaska and follow through on those commitments,\u201d first-term Sen. Dan Sullivan said last week. \u201cAnd that was a commitment, and I want to follow through on it.\u201d\n\nBut Sullivan, like many other Republicans, also said he\u2019d like to see the Senate act on changes to the health law that have a chance of becoming law, such as repealing its medical-device tax or changing its definition of \u201cfull time\u201d work from 30 hours to 40 hours.\n\n\u201cObviously a full repeal and replace is going \u2026 to be unsuccessful,\u201d Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said before the vote was scheduled. \u201cSo I would like to see us do things like move the work week to 40 hours.\u201d\n\nDemocrats used Sunday\u2019s vote as an opportunity to praise the health care law.\n\n\u201cThe House has voted 55 times. The Supreme Court said it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re reaching 20 million Americans who now have health care,\u201d Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said Friday. Repeal \u201cwould hurt too many people, it would create chaos.\u201d\n\nThe Senate has voted three other times on legislation to fully repeal Obamacare \u2014 in March 2010, February 2011 and March 2013. All were on party lines. The Senate has voted about three dozen times on bills to repeal or defund all or part of the health care law since it was passed in 2010.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The party line vote plays out predictably.", "title": "Obamacare repeal vote fails in Senate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/obamacare-repeal-vote-fails-in-senate-120638.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/26/20150726_mike_lee_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Congress,Ben Sasse,Repeal,2016 Elections,Ted Cruz 2016,Affordable Care Act,Elections,Senate,Health Care,Republicans,Susan Collins,Rand Paul,Mike Lee,Rand Paul 2016,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The party line vote plays out predictably.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Obamacare repeal vote fails in SenateThe Senate on Sunday voted down a Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, the GOP\u2019s first attempt to get rid of the president\u2019s health law since the party took control of the chamber in January.\nThree-fifths of the Senate would have had to vote to add Obamacare repeal to a highway funding bill.\nRepeal \u201cwould hurt too many people, it would create chaos.\u201dThe Senate has voted three other times on legislation to fully repeal Obamacare \u2014 in March 2010, February 2011 and March 2013.\nOther than that, Sunday\u2019s repeal vote played out as expected.\nThe Senate has voted about three dozen times on bills to repeal or defund all or part of the health care law since it was passed in 2010."}
