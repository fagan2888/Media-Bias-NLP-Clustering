Ironically, that\u2019s partly because of surveillance of a different sort \u2014 \u201cCitizenfour\u201d (the code name chosen by Snowden) is a real-time reveal of Snowden spilling secrets to Poitras as well as journalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill. Viewers watch as a then-unknown Snowden opens a global debate on surveillance \u2014 and on Snowden himself.\n\n\u201cCitizenfour\u201d is history, but not histrionic. The pace alternates between tedious and tense, but more than any emotion the movie\u2019s mood is claustrophobic, even paranoid, as Snowden, holed up in a Hong Kong hotel room, is afraid to leave, let alone answer the phone.\n\nThe mood also serves as a metaphor for the surveillance state, which Snowden \u2014 as well as many citizens and lawmakers \u2014 believe is closing in on fundamental freedoms.\n\nSnowden wants this issue to get the media\u2019s attention, not him. The \u201cmodern-media focus is on big personalities,\u201d he says in the film. \u201cI\u2019m not the story here.\u201d\n\nBut he is, at least in \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d where he\u2019s often shown in a white shirt on a white bed in a nearly all-white room. A black hat doesn\u2019t seem fitting, even to those who consider him a traitor, not a whistleblower. In fact, in \u201cCitizenfour,\u201d Snowden is shown sympathetically \u2014 technically intelligent and personally principled, albeit geopolitically naive (there are more appropriate places to advocate against tyranny than China and Russia).\n\n\u201cCitizenfour\u201d opened Friday, just days after Tuesday\u2019s election wins by resurgent Republicans. While former House Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill\u2019s dictum that \u201call politics is local\u201d still stands, the midterms were nationalized as a referendum on President Obama.\n\nAmong the disappointments driving some to vote against a president not on the ballot were NSA surveillance and an increasingly intrusive government. For others, their perception that Obama\u2019s foreign policy has led to a less-secure world may have motivated votes. Some voters may have been moved by both issues.\n\nAs Congress presses the president on immigration, tax policy and health care, among other issues, the balance between security and surveillance may emerge as surprisingly defining for not only Obama\u2019s lame-duck years, but for the contest to succeed him in 2016.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the legislative or executive branches that were Election Day epicenters. On the same Tuesday, a federal appeals court heard Larry Klayman, a conservative legal activist, call collecting bulk phone records \u201cperhaps the biggest violation of freedom and constitutional rights in history.\u201d Not true, countered the Justice Department\u2019s Thomas Byron, who said: \u201cThere is no protected constitutional interest that has been invaded by the mere collection of business records.\u201d\n\nKlayman was representing himself and two other clients who said they were direct targets of scrutiny by the government. On a broader basis, competing interpretations by different courts of the constitutionality of collecting metadata are working their way through the legal system. And beyond challenges from Congress, corporate America is also concerned that the surveillance stigma is bad for business, particularly overseas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s become more challenging because foreign governments are using this as a reason to try to localize IT services and capabilities back into their own countries,\u201d Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor who is now the CEO of the Financial Services Roundtable, said in an interview. \u201cA legitimate question arises as to how much of that is security and privacy, and how much of that is trying to ring-fence business in a trade-protection state.\u201d\n\nPawlenty was on a panel at the World Affairs Councils of America conference in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. The panel\u2019s title, \u201cCybersecurity: U.S. Priorities and Responsibilities,\u201d encapsulates the complexities of an issue involving the Constitution, national security, diplomacy and business, among other factors.\n\n\u201cThese are all important issues, but too often they all get conflated together,\u201d Christopher Painter, coordinator of cyberissues at the State Department, said in an interview. Painter, a panelist along with Pawlenty, added: \u201cWe do and we should and we have had a proper debate about surveillance issues and what the proper oversight is. My boss, Secretary [of State John] Kerry, has said watchwords are rule of law, proper purpose, transparency and oversight. A lot of countries don\u2019t have them, and clearly a lot of repressive regimes don\u2019t have them. \u2026 When we talk about what the long-term goals are \u2014 an open Internet, a secure Internet and an operable Internet \u2014 I think countries that we\u2019ve had these debates with in Europe and other places understand that the dangers of not prevailing on our collective vision of this technology, the dangers of having a more fragmented \u2018splinternet,\u2019 the dangers of having sovereign borders drawn around your Internet as some countries want to do, are too great. This is such a social and economic driver, we have to make sure that we prevail on that larger vision.\u201d\n\nThis larger vision includes privacy and free expression, which will need to be remembered as Obama and the new Congress continue to assess U.S. surveillance policies.\n\nJohn Rash is a Star Tribune editorial writer and columnist.
