(Photo: Piotr Adamowicz/Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nNetworked-home maven Arlo Gilbert recently published a cri de coeur about a Google decision that left him hanging. And it\u2019s a story that raises a lot of questions: Questions about the \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d about property rights in physical objects and about whether American intellectual property law goes too far. And at the moment, I think the answers to those questions are that the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d is stupid, property rights in physical objects don\u2019t get nearly enough respect and American intellectual property law definitely goes too far. As the nation\u2019s mood shifts in a decidedly populist direction, perhaps lawmakers will take a look.\n\nBut back to Gilbert\u2019s story. He\u2019s a gadget fan, and Google has left him hanging. Here\u2019s how he tells it: \u201cSeventeen months ago, Google acquired Revolv, a very cool home automation hub. It is a small circular device about the size of a small container of hummus that uses a variety of common home automation radios to communicate with light switches, garage door openers, home alarms, motion sensors, A/C controllers etc. ... When I arrive home my lights turn on. In lieu of motion detecting lights, I have a Z-wave motion detector that notifies my Revolv when there is motion on any side of our home and turns on the appropriate lights. Although I do set a home alarm, there is really no more effective vacation security than the programmatic turning on, dimming, and turning off of lights in a manner that would indicate that people are home. After buying my Revolv I put my outdoor landscaping light on it and threw away the old timer. Now at sunset my landscape lighting turns on. Holiday lighting does the same. It\u2019s magical.\u201d\n\nBut as we all know, in the fairy tales the \u201cmagical\u201d tool that makes everything wonderful always has a catch. In Gilbert\u2019s case, the catch is that Google will shut down his device. They won\u2019t just stop updating it, or end support. They\u2019ll turn it off. Even though it \u201cbelongs\u201d to Gilbert.\n\nGilbert notes: \u201cOn May 15th, my house will stop working. My landscape lighting will stop turning on and off, my security lights will stop reacting to motion, and my homemade vacation burglar deterrent will stop working. This is a conscious intentional decision by Google/Nest.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re \u201cbricking\u201d his device, making it an inanimate lump of circuitry that is no more useful than a brick. Or, actually, less useful, since you can build things with bricks.\n\nThey can do this because although you own the hardware, you don\u2019t actually own the software in your devices; technically, when you buy the device, you just get a license to use the software. (In a similar situation, General Motors and John Deere have said that they still own the software in the cars and other vehicles you buy.)\n\nIf these manufacturers have their way, you may buy things from them, but you\u2019ll never really own anything. So long as they control the software \u2014 and the Bill Clinton-era Digital Millennium Copyright Act ensures that they always will \u2014 they really control your devices.\n\nAnd yet we keep hearing that the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d is the next big, er, thing. But if Google is willing to do this to its customers for one product, who\u2019s to say it won\u2019t be willing to do it to others? As designer Michael Burgstahler tweeted: \"Google 2017: 'We acquired this smart pacemaker company!' Google 2020: 'Sorry, we don't support it anymore, will shut down all old devices.'\"\n\nAnd even if that\u2019s a bit far-fetched, it raises serious questions of whether consumers will be able to trust the \u201cInternet of Things.\u201d Evidence already suggests that the \u201cThings\u201d will be a hacker\u2019s dream, with repeated examples of poor security and vulnerability to cyber-infiltration. Now it looks as if they might also be a consumer nightmare.\n\nOwnership ought to mean something. When you buy a cellphone, or a car, or a home-automation controller, it should belong to you, not the company that \u201csold\u201d it to you. And if intellectual property law says otherwise, then Congress should change it.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor, is the author of \"The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1S1uGLT", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Thanks to intellectual property laws, companies sell you \"things\" but still own the software.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Thanks to intellectual property laws, companies sell you \"things\" but still own the software.", "title": "Do we even own things anymore?", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/columnists/2016/04/08/do-we-even-own-things-anymore/82792654/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thanks to intellectual property laws, companies sell you \"things\" but still own the software.", "title": "Do we even own things anymore?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/03649daf7a537e0b814759680f9b18af9d7ae8f2/c=758-0-3733-2975&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/08/WIGroup/Wausau/635957140709975778-ThinkstockPhotos-513684662.jpg", "creator": "@wausauherald", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Google, Revolv, Glenn Harlan Reynolds, intellectual property, Internet of things"}, "article_summary": "And it\u2019s a story that raises a lot of questions: Questions about the \u201cInternet of Things,\u201d about property rights in physical objects and about whether American intellectual property law goes too far.\nAnd yet we keep hearing that the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d is the next big, er, thing.\nAnd if intellectual property law says otherwise, then Congress should change it.\nIf these manufacturers have their way, you may buy things from them, but you\u2019ll never really own anything.\nAnd at the moment, I think the answers to those questions are that the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d is stupid, property rights in physical objects don\u2019t get nearly enough respect and American intellectual property law definitely goes too far."}
