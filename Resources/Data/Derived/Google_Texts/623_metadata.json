In typical fashion, Cruz made sure to blame President Barack Obama and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for his supposed loss of coverage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, you know who one of those millions of Americans is [sic] who\u2019s lost their health care because of Obamacare? That would be me. I don\u2019t have health care right now.\u201d\n\nPrior to the aforementioned PPO plan, Ted Cruz\u2019s family was covered through his wife Heidi\u2019s employer-sponsored health insurance plan. However, Heidi Cruz went on an unpaid leave from her job with Goldman Sachs in March 2015, planning to focus full-time on her husband\u2019s campaign. After the Cruz family was no longer covered through her employer, Ted Cruz chose not to get continuing health coverage through the Washington, D.C. healthcare exchange, even though his job as a United States Senator entitles him to a 75 percent government\u2019s employer subsidy. Many assume that, though this would unequivocally be the cheapest option for the Cruz family, Ted Cruz would find it politically untenable to give an ostensible endorsement of \u201cObamacare\u201d by using the ACA-created local exchange to find a health insurance plan for his family \u2014 let alone admitting that it is the most affordable option.\n\nBusted: Senator Ted Cruz Lied About Losing Health Insurance To Make Obamacare Look Bad https://t.co/swEsMrJCj4 pic.twitter.com/lc5hQ8Ff35 \u2014 Groopspeak (@groopspeak) January 25, 2016\n\nAt the beginning of Heidi Cruz\u2019s unpaid job leave, the Cruz family purchased a PPO plan directly from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, which did recently cancel its PPO plans due to rising costs \u2014 but that\u2019s where Ted Cruz\u2019s understanding of the situation seemed to end, at least as of Thursday. Blue Cross Blue Shield automatically enrolled the Cruz family in an HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) plan immediately, meaning that there was no lapse in coverage.\n\nDue to Ted Cruz\u2019s obvious eagerness to blame the president and Obamacare, the question that is currently burning up social media is the following: did Cruz know this, and was he lying? He acknowledged at the Manchester campaign stop on Thursday that he received a letter in the mail from his health insurance provider informing him of the cancellation of his PPO plan, but those letters usually also inform their recipients that they have been automatically enrolled in a new plan. Yet, he said that his wife was angry with him for \u201cletting their insurance lapse.\u201d Did both Ted and Heidi Cruz fail to comprehend the letter they received, or was he being dishonest?\n\nYES, Ted Cruz is SMART. But, is he HONEST? Can I/You Trust Him?https://t.co/eUh7FEN4L8 \u2014 Dan Bogdan (@Difference30360) January 25, 2016\n\nIn an attempt to alleviate the confusion and suspicion that mounted throughout the business day on Friday, Ted Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier passed the blame to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. Frazier told press that Cruz\u2019s insurance broker told him personally that he had lost his insurance coverage when his PPO plan ended on December 31.\n\n\u201cSenator Cruz believed the family was uninsured and asked the broker to pull quotes immediately for a new policy. The Cruz family is currently covered by a Blue Cross HMO.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that Ted Cruz has decided to cancel this plan and enroll in a PPO plan with Humana that bears a stronger similarity to the plan he had before, effective March 1. He claims, through Frazier, that this will cost him 50 percent more than what he had been paying for his Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas PPO. Putting aside that the Cruz family could easily save this money by purchasing a plan through the Washington, D.C. exchange and making use of Ted Cruz\u2019s employer subsidy, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) reports that, when running an average, premiums in the state of Texas have only gone up 4 percent, making his latest claim suspect as well.\n\nLos Angeles Times columnist Michael A. Hiltzik reports that some plans in Texas actually have decreased premiums since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and the HHS does not report a single plan premium that has increased by 50 percent.\n\n[Image courtesy of Gage Skidmore/CC 2.0]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) is in hot water with press & social media after it's discovered his claim regarding his own family's loss of health insurance was false.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) is in hot water with press & social media after it\u2019s discovered his claim regarding his own family\u2019s loss of health insurance was false.", "title": "Ted Cruz Campaign Damage Control: He Has Health Insurance", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2735764/ted-cruz-campaign-damage-control/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ted-Cruz-1-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-24T21:17:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-08T05:20:36+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ted-Cruz-1-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2016-01-24T21:17:38+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "ted cruz,health insurance,election 2016,texas,affordable care act,obamacare,gop primary,republican primary,2016 republican primary,2016 gop primary,obamacare,2016 republican nomination,2016 republican primaries,healthcare,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ted-Cruz-1-900x440.jpg", "width": 900, "height": 440}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) is in hot water with press & social media after it\u2019s discovered his claim regarding his own family\u2019s loss of health insurance was false."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "I don\u2019t have health care right now.\u201dPrior to the aforementioned PPO plan, Ted Cruz\u2019s family was covered through his wife Heidi\u2019s employer-sponsored health insurance plan.\nYES, Ted Cruz is SMART.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield automatically enrolled the Cruz family in an HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) plan immediately, meaning that there was no lapse in coverage.\nFrazier told press that Cruz\u2019s insurance broker told him personally that he had lost his insurance coverage when his PPO plan ended on December 31.\nDue to Ted Cruz\u2019s obvious eagerness to blame the president and Obamacare, the question that is currently burning up social media is the following: did Cruz know this, and was he lying?"}
