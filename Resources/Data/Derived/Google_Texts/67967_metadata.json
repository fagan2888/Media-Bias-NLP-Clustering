One woman in Russia still has not given up on that dream, even at age 30, after being told she was too short to be a model at age 17. Alexandra Transer has grown a total of 2.5 inches from 5-foot-4 after surgically fracturing her legs via the Ilizarov apparatus method.\n\n\"I had tried to get into modelling school when I was 17 but was told by the director that because I had stopped growing the only way I would ever be the right height was if I grew leg extensions. So that\u2019s exactly what I decided to do. At first, my parents were really against it. My mum is only 5.2-foot and my dad 5.5-foot, so we are a family of shorties,\u201d said Transer, the Mirror reported.\n\nAspiring model has surgery to make legs longer after being told she was too short for catwalk http://t.co/7sb3qFMCK8 pic.twitter.com/76nh2Ge1E6 \u2014 Daily Mirror (@DailyMirror) February 6, 2015\n\nThe aspiring model underwent the Ilizarov apparatus, which is meant to lengthen bones. Transer\u2019s surgery involved surgically fracturing her legs and fitting a metal cage \u2014 a ring apparatus \u2014 to each leg. Based on the principle \u201ctension stress,\u201d bone and soft tissue, including skin, muscle, and neurovascular structures, will heal and regenerate in a predictable manner under tension, according to an article in the journal Physical Therapy.\n\nTranser\u2019s fractured bone began to grow together as she recovered. Meanwhile, she had to turn a screw on each cage four times a day, moving the healing fracture apart by approximately 0.10 centimeters a day. After nine months, Transer\u2019s legs grew a total of 2.3in.\n\n\u201cThe first operation went really well, and in nine months I grew by 6cm. I am now planning two more operations in the next couple of years, and by 2018 I will be 6ft,\u201d Transer said. The 30-year-old, aware of her age, realizes she may be too old to model, but says, \u201cI'll dye my hair blonde and at least I will look and feel like one.\u201d\n\nThe surgical procedure has helped patients like 21-year-old Xu Juan from China, who underwent the intensive surgery to lengthen her left leg by 9in. Her left leg was damaged after an infection left her thigh bone eroded by bacteria as a child, the Daily Mail reported. The woman\u2019s left leg was left 9in. shorter than her right due to the lack of proper medical care. Doctors were able to extend her left leg to make it evenly long, and then replace the left knee joint and left hip joint in a second surgery.\n\nThese leg extensions can help treat certain medical conditions, and even aspiring models, apparently.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "leg extension, supermodel, aspiring model, female model, ilizarov apparatus, fractures, bones, legs, alexandra transer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An aspiring 30-year-old model \u201cgrew\u201d over 2 inches after undergoing leg extension surgery to become 6 feet tall.", "title": "Aspiring Model Surgically Fractures Legs To Become 6 Feet Tall [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/alexandra-transer-aspiring-model-grows-2-inches-after-leg-extension-surgery-321848", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/11/transer-and-her-leg-extensions.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An aspiring 30-year-old model \u201cgrew\u201d over 2 inches after undergoing leg extension surgery to become 6 feet tall.", "title": "Aspiring Model Surgically Fractures Legs To Become 6 Feet Tall [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/alexandra-transer-aspiring-model-grows-2-inches-after-leg-extension-surgery-321848", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/11/transer-and-her-leg-extensions.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/11/transer-and-her-leg-extensions.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2015-02-11T17:01:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-12T14:23:41-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An aspiring 30-year-old model \u201cgrew\u201d over 2 inches after undergoing leg extension surgery to become 6 feet tall."}, "article_summary": "The woman\u2019s left leg was left 9in.\nHer left leg was damaged after an infection left her thigh bone eroded by bacteria as a child, the Daily Mail reported.\nAlexandra Transer has grown a total of 2.5 inches from 5-foot-4 after surgically fracturing her legs via the Ilizarov apparatus method.\nDoctors were able to extend her left leg to make it evenly long, and then replace the left knee joint and left hip joint in a second surgery.\nAfter nine months, Transer\u2019s legs grew a total of 2.3in."}
