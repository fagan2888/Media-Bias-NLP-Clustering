College teams from all over the nation traveled to Wichita this weekend for a basketball tournament. The reason is simply because Wichita is centrally located. The athletes that played are incredibly talented. The division: Intercollegiate Wheelchair Basketball.

UT Arlington's clutch late-game free throw shooting sealed an overtime win for them on Saturday.

Sophomore Guard Rose Hollermann recalled, "The intensity was up, our bench was live, everyone was just hyped. So I think that's really what brought us the win."

It was a big win for them because there are only four women's teams and ten men's teams in the nation.

"We come from all over the place and there are only four teams," explained Abby Dunkin, a Sophomore guard. "You just always know of the coaches growing up. Our coach is one of the best players in the world."

Actually, most of the athletes that participated at the Farha YMCA in South Wichita this weekend are among the very best. There are a number of paralympians represented on the 14 total collegiate wheelchair basketball teams.

"I've been on the USA team since I was 15 so I've been to like 20 countries because of basketball," said Hollermann.

The athletes all agree the experiences they've gained are great. And they all really love playing the game itself. But it's the community they've found through wheelchair basketball that has impacted their lives the most.

"I wanted to continue playing a game that I grew up loving and now it's more than just a game," said Dunkin. "It's the people that I play with, that I've played with that I've grown and learned the game with."

Hollermann added, "It's one of those things where like you get disabled and you don't know what's next and you find a sport and meet all these other people with disabilities and you fall in love with it."
