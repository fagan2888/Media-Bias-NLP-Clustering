A certain type of plan could leave you stuck with huge hospital bills. It happened to some employees in our area.\n\nThe problem lead to a revision in the Affordable Care Act, but that doesn\u2019t mean you are in the clear.\n\nDiane Lee tells us why you should avoid \u201cskinny healthcare plans\u201d in this 7 News special report.\n\nSKINNY HEALTHCARE PLANS:\n\nIn so many ways, starting a family has been priceless for Sara Wagner, except when it comes to the actual cost. That\u2019s been a nightmare.\n\nThe Campobello mother showed us some of her hospital bills. The main birth cost was $10,500, anesthesia $1,500, and nearly $3,000 for the baby\u2019s care. Those are all out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nYou might assume the nurse didn\u2019t have health coverage. But she did, through her employer Lake Emory Post Acute Care in Inman.\n\nLets rewind to when Wagner was 8-months pregnant. During open enrollment she learned the nursing home was switching providers for 2015. Good news, she thought, her new plan\u2019s premium would drop by 78 dollars a paycheck.\n\n\u201cI was like, oh well yeah, this is great and I got to reading it and I was like, oh, this is not going to cover hospitals.\u201d\n\nIn writing it says \u201chospitalization not covered\u201d in the only plan Lake Emory offered.\n\nThe company did tack on what\u2019s called a hospital indemnity plan, but it only covers $300 dollars a day.\n\nA normal child birth runs well into the thousands of dollars per day.\n\nWagner knew weeks before she even gave birth how painful the bill was going to be.\n\n\u201cI cried! I called my mom crying, balling my eyes out and even after I got off the phone with her I sat there and I was like Ok, it\u2019s going to be OK, and then after I started crying again,\u201d said Wagner.\n\nSo how is it possible?\n\nHer new plan called Keysolution took advantage of a shortcoming in the affordable care act which failed to explicitly require substantial coverage of hospital and physician services.\n\nThe plan met the original healthcare law calculations for minimum coverage, barely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it adequately protects anyone. In fact it doesn\u2019t protect them, it\u2019s garbage,\u201d said Hank Steinberg, the President of Steinberg & Associates.\n\nThe independent independent insurance expert doesn\u2019t mince words when he describes how financially devastating this type of plan can be.\n\n\u201cIt leaves the employee potentially liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Ninety-five percent of the bill could fall on the employee\u2019s shoulders and that\u2019s just not right. I think that\u2019s morally wrong.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s perfectly legal.\n\nBy the time the US Treasury realized a handful of companies were offering what the industry refers to as \u201cskinny plans,\u201d companies like Lake Emory had already signed a binding agreement with the insurance provider.\n\nWe went to Lake Emory to ask them why an organization based on patient care, would only offer a healthcare plan with such limited coverage for hospital stays. They declined our request for an on camera interview, and so did their provider, key benefit administrators.\n\nThe US Treasury revised the healthcare rule so employers now face a large fine if they don\u2019t provide substantial hospital coverage.\n\nBut a lawyer for Lake Emory\u2019s parent company, Fundamental Administrative Services told us quote: \u201cThere is an exception for certain employers that adopted plans prior to November 4, 2014.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury Department says that exception only lasts until the end of this year.\n\nStill, keep this in mind, moving forward companies can keep offering these skinny plans. They pay the fine only if they fail to also offer a comprehensive plan that limits your out of pocket costs.\n\nBe aware, the skinny plans may be less expensive, but they have no cap on how much you have to pay for hospital bills.\n\nMonths later Wagner says she\u2019s not even close to paying off her medical bills.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like feeling like I can\u2019t take care of my child because I\u2019m pouring all this money into these hospital bills,\u201d she said.\n\nEven with a new job, she says caring for a new baby is hard enough on your wallet, when you don\u2019t have to pay more than $15,000 for the birth.\n\nTAKE HOME MESSAGE:\n\nWith a comprehensive plan, one that offers substantial hospital coverage, there is a cap on your out-of-pocket expense for in-network care.\n\nIt\u2019s less than seven thousand.\n\nAgain, with a \u201cskinny plan\u201d there is no limit to how much you may have to pay if you land in the hospital.\n\nSo consider carefully the risk of one of these less expensive skinny plans. It could cost you much more in the long-run.\n\nSIDE NOTE:\n\nAnother expensive issue you may encounter during open enrollment is what\u2019s called the family glitch.\n\nThat\u2019s when an employer pays 100% of the premium for workers, but contributes nothing toward the cost of adding a spouse and kids.\n\nYou can always shop for coverage on the Marketplace, but in that case, your family members won\u2019t be eligible for tax credits to help pay the premium. When people are eligible for employer-sponsored coverage, they can only qualify for Marketplace premium tax credits if the employer-sponsored coverage is considered unaffordable.\n\nCoverage is considered unaffordable only if your cost for coverage for yourself, alone, under the employer plan is more than 9.56% of your income in 2015. The cost of adding your spouse and children to family coverage is not taken into consideration.\n\nSo although you may feel your family coverage is unaffordable in practical terms, it is considered technically affordable.\n\nIf your family members end up uninsured because family coverage is unaffordable, they will not have to pay a tax penalty under the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A certain type of plan could leave you stuck with huge hospital bills.
