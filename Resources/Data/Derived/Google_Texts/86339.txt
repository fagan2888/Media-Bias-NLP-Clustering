Beijing may be better known for its pollution than its bucolic charms. But that isn’t stopping the government from trying to develop a rural region northwest of the city into a Napa Valley-style attraction.

Last month, the government hosted the 11th International Conference on Grapevine Breeding and Genetics in Beijing’s Yanqing county, a five-day affair involving wine tasting competitions and networking among grape breeders and geneticists from around the world.

In addition to hosting such a conference, the government also recently finished the construction of a so-called “International Grape Exhibition Garden,” which will consist of vineyards that they hope will attract an increasingly wine-loving public.

“We want to build our own Bordeaux in China,” said Pang Rongnian, the International Grape Exhibition Garden’s deputy director. He declined to comment on how much the government has invested in the garden’s creation.

The garden is home to 750,000 square meters of vineyards, along with a 2,500 square-meter greenhouse that will help nurture more than 1,000 kinds of grapes from more than 40 countries.

According to Vinexpo, which hosts regular wine and spirits exhibitions, China consumes more wine than any other country in the world. Last year, China consumed more than 1.9 billion bottles of red wine in 2013, up 136% compared to 2008.

Also last year, auction house Christie’s set up the world’s first estate agency for wealthy Chinese to buy vineyards.

In addition to the vineyards, the Yanqing garden will also include a museum about grapes, as well as sculptures of grapes made by Italian architecture firm Italian Archea Studio. Entrance fees will be priced at $10 per adult, with organizers hoping that engaged couples might also choose to hold their weddings on the premises, or at least take their wedding photos there. So far, response to the park has been strong, organizers say, with some 2,000 visitors arriving on the second day of its opening.

Part of the attraction, visitors told China Real Time over the opening weekend, was the large plots of what they described as lavender growing in the garden. However, a garden guide explained that plots weren’t actually lavender, after all.

“We know that Chinese are fond of taking wedding dress photos in gardens of lavender. The purple color is very attractive,” the guide said. “So we chose the same color, but used cheaper plants—salvia and verbena. They look like lavender but actually they are not.”

If lavender isn’t the draw, will the quality of Beijing-area wines ever become a magnet? Organizers point to the fact that Beijing’s Yanqing county is actually located on the same latitude as Bordeaux, the famed French wine-producing region.

However, Duan Changqing, professor with China Agricultural University, said that when it comes to grape production, “it’s meaningless to talk about latitude.”

“It’s a combination of other elements,” Mr. Duan said. “Basically, there are four elements of grape cultivation—temperature, illumination, water and soil.”

That being said, Mr. Duan added that apart from its exceptionally dry winters, the region would seem well-suited for such a purpose. Air pollution, he said, could actually be helpful for grape cultivation. “The dirt could help to reduce some illumination intensity,” he said, which would assist with the development of grapes. “Beijing has too much sunshine.”
