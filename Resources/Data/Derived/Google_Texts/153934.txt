The news crew violated an agreement to voluntarily quarantine themselves for 21 days, according to the New Jersey Health Department

A mandatory quarantine has been issued for the NBC news crew that was exposed to Ebola while on assignment in Liberia.

In a statement, the New Jersey Health Department explained that the news crew failed to adhere to a previous agreement to voluntarily quarantine themselves for 21 days.

"Before returning to the United States, the NBC crew made an agreement with the New Jersey Department of Health and local health officials to voluntarily self-confine themselves for the remainder of the 21 days following their low risk of exposure on Oct. 1 to an individual who is being treated for Ebola," the statement read.

"Unfortunately, the NBC crew violated this agreement, and so the Department of Health on Friday evening issued a mandatory quarantine order to ensure that the crew will remain confined until Oct. 22," the statement added. "The NBC crew remains symptom-free, so there is no reason for concern of exposure to the community."

News broke Oct. 2 that freelance NBC News cameraman Ashoka Mukpo was diagnosed with the disease. He returned to the U.S. on Sunday with NBC chief medical editor and correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman plus three other crewmembers.

A spokesperson for NBC News issued the following statement to The Hollywood Reporter: "Upon returning from Liberia, our team was deemed to be low-risk and agreed to follow guidelines set by local health authorities. We fully support those guidelines and continue to expect that they be followed. Our team are all well with normal temperatures, which they check multiple times a day, and they are also in daily contact with local health officials."
