They join eight MinuteClinic locations inside select CVS/pharmacy stores in the Las Vegas area in Southern Nevada. MinuteClinic is the largest and fastest growing provider of walk-in medical clinics in the United States with more than 950 clinics in 31 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe clinics are located at the CVS/pharmacy store at 1695 Robb Dr. in Northwest Reno and 680 N. McCarran Blvd. in Sparks. Two additional clinics in Northern Nevada are expected to open in 2015.\n\nMinuteClinic is open seven days a week with no appointment necessary. Most major health insurance is accepted. For patients paying cash or credit, treatment prices are posted at each clinic and on www.minuteclinic.com. The cost for most services starts at $79.\n\n\"The first MinuteClinic location in Nevada opened at a CVS/pharmacy store on the Las Vegas Strip in 2007 and since then thousands of residents and visitors have taken advantage of the increased access to high-quality, convenient and affordable medical care that is offered,\" said Andrew Sussman, M.D., president, MinuteClinic and senior vice president/associate chief medical officer, CVS Health. \"The demand for MinuteClinic services will grow in Nevada due in part to the shortage of primary care physicians, the aging Baby Boomer population and the influx of newly insured patients through the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nMinuteClinic nurse practitioners and physician assistants specialize in family health care and can diagnose, treat and write prescriptions for common illnesses such as strep throat and ear, eye, sinus, bladder and bronchial infections. Minor wounds, abrasions, skin conditions and joint sprains are treated, and common vaccinations such as influenza, tetanus, pneumonia and Hepatitis A & B are available at most locations. Walk-in camp, sports and college physicals are available daily.\n\nIn addition, MinuteClinic administers a series of wellness services designed to help patients identify lifestyle changes needed to improve their current and future health, including screenings and monitoring for diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\n\nMinuteClinic practitioners use a software program that at the conclusion of each visit generates educational material and a prescription (when clinically appropriate) for the patient, as well as a diagnostic record that can be sent via electronic health record, fax or mail to a primary care provider with patient permission.\n\nSussman says MinuteClinic is committed to helping patients find a medical home and believes it can play a complementary role in working with primary care providers.\n\n\"About 50 percent of visits occur on evenings, weekends and holidays when patients may not be able to get an appointment with their primary care provider,\" Sussman said. \"And about half of the patients seen at MinuteClinic do not have a personal physician.\"\n\nPatients who visit MinuteClinic without a primary care provider are provided a list of physicians in the area who are accepting new patients.\n\nThe MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics in Northern Nevada operate from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., Monday through Friday; 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Saturday; and 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Sunday.\n\nAbout MinuteClinic\n\nCVS/minuteclinic is the retail medical clinic of CVS Health (NYSE: CVS), the largest pharmacy health care provider in the United States.
