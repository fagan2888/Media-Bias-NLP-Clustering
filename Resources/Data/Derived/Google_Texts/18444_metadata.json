But on consideration, it is something far more sophisticated and sinister than mere feminist hyperventilating. Hillary Clinton faces an image problem, and the deep thinkers on her propaganda team know it. In a debate during the 2008 primary campaign, Barack Obama alluded to it when he called her \u201c likable enough ,\u201d a backhanded compliment/slap that stung. The woman who as first lady demanded that military service personnel assigned to the White House not look her in the face is an imperious, demanding, and frosty sort of person.\n\nThus the need to disarm critics in advance. Glenn Reynolds of Instapundit calls it \u201cbattlespace preparation,\u201d shaping the terrain to her advantage.\n\nThere are many other reasons to scorn this campaign. Mollie Hemingway comes up with 7 of them, the first of which is \u201cBanning words is un-American,\u201d and the most telling of which is, \u201cMaking people feel bad for using adjectives is pretty bossy.\u201d\n\nDespite Hillary\u2019s lead in polls matching her against potential GOP presidential nominees, she is not a strong candidate. The anti-Romney campaign demonstrated that demonization works, and likability is a primary factor in the choices of low information voters. With her tendency to screech, her indifference to the deaths of her employees in Benghazi, her demonstrable lying, her miraculous commodities trading success in Arkansas, and her overall personality, Hillary actually isn\u2019t likable enough.\n\nThus the need to pre-emptively insulate her form criticism. The ban bossy movement is just one step in the process. There will be more.\n\nHat tip: Instapundit", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/03/pure_coincidence_the_ban_bossy_movement_and_hillarys_campaign.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2014-03/191828_1_.png", "title": "Blog: Pure coincidence?
