Paul Ryan, R-Wis., stepped down as head of the House Budget Committee this year, federal employees likely exhaled a collective sigh of relief.\n\nDuring his four-year tenure as the panel\u2019s chairman, Ryan laid out several blueprints for the government\u2019s budget. They attempted to eliminate the federal deficit, which meant draconian cuts to federal agencies\u2019 spending levels. It also meant direct attacks on federal employees, including proposals for: a 10 percent cut in the size of the workforce, higher retirement pension contribution levels, the elimination of the annuity supplement for certain young federal retirees and the end of student loan repayment for federal employees.\n\nRyan\u2019s budget proposals twice passed the House, but were held up in the Senate. That could all change with Republicans taking control of the upper chamber. While Ryan has moved on to the position of the House\u2019s top tax man, his ideas linger over the congressional budget committees. His successor, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., and the Senate budget leader, Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., will bring separate proposals forward next week. Both are expected to seek a balanced budget by 2025.\n\n\u201cA balanced budget is essential for strong economic growth and job creation,\u201d Enzi said at a hearing this week. \u201cWorking together, we can deliver real solutions, real results and real progress if we find common ground and cooperate to get things done.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOver the past six years, we have learned that wasteful Washington spending doesn\u2019t solve problems, it only side-steps them. By spending responsibly and putting our fiscal books in order in a balanced and responsible way, we can restore the trust that we have broken with the American people.\u201d\n\nEnzi\u2019s ranking member, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said this will likely spell a rehash of old ideas.\n\nThe Republican budget will look \u201ca heck of a lot\u201d like Ryan\u2019s proposals, Sanders said at a press conference this week. A spokesman for Enzi declined to comment on which federal workforce provisions will be included in the senator\u2019s plan.\n\nThe resurfacing of Ryan\u2019s budget priorities would not come as a surprise to federal employees, with unions warning after the midterm election its return could squeeze the workforce at time when its responsibilities are growing.\n\nNot everyone thought it was a good idea to balance the budget on the backs of federal workers. Mark Blyth, a professor of political economy at Brown University, told Enzi\u2019s committee in prepared testimony at this week\u2019s hearing that funding feds can help spark the economy:\n\nNow consider a government employee whose income is generated by taxes, taxes that also bought the Apple Computer that she uses to process a [National Institutes of Health] grant that goes to a researcher at a state university. That researcher, funded by the federal government, goes on to invent a molecule that the pharmaceutical industry buys and turns into a major new therapy. Yet we tend to see this as \u2018unproductive spending.\u2019 Yet what is the difference between the two, especially when that same federal worker goes to the supermarket and shops with her government paycheck at the end of the week, and spends more than our heroic author? Does that not add to the economy either? Somehow we seem to think not.\n\nDemocrats pledged to inject their priorities into the plan by offering amendments. Former Budget Committee Chairman Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said she hopes to build off of the two-year agreement she reached with Ryan in 2013. That measure partially rolled back sequestration cuts, though it also required new feds to pay more into their retirements.\n\n\u201cHopefully it won\u2019t take another government shutdown for Republicans to join us,\u201d Murray warned.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Eric Katz", "description": "GOP promises next week\u2019s proposals will balance the budget, which could spell bad news for feds.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "GOP promises next week\u2019s proposals will balance the budget, which could spell bad news for feds.", "title": "Will Republicans Target Feds With a Return to the Ryan Budget?", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/oversight/2015/03/will-republicans-target-feds-return-ryan-budget/107517/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/03/13/031315ryan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP promises next week\u2019s proposals will balance the budget, which could spell bad news for feds.", "creator": "@EricM_Katz", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/03/13/031315ryan/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Will Republicans Target Feds With a Return to the Ryan Budget?", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-13T18:37:27Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/03/13/031315ryan.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Will Republicans Target Feds With a Return to the Ryan Budget?", "keywords": "paul ryan, pay freeze, hiring freeze, 2016 budget, retirement benefits, republican budget", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/03/13/031315ryan/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "paul-ryan,hiring-freeze,2016-budget,republican-budget,channel-oversight,type-story,length-medium,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "GOP promises next week\u2019s proposals will balance the budget, which could spell bad news for feds."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc97\"", "article_summary": "Ryan\u2019s budget proposals twice passed the House, but were held up in the Senate.\nA spokesman for Enzi declined to comment on which federal workforce provisions will be included in the senator\u2019s plan.\nDuring his four-year tenure as the panel\u2019s chairman, Ryan laid out several blueprints for the government\u2019s budget.\nWhile Ryan has moved on to the position of the House\u2019s top tax man, his ideas linger over the congressional budget committees.\nWhen Rep.
