Yet, when the media asked him to give his best impersonation of his presidential opponent Jeb Bush at a press conference for his new book, \u201cCrippling America: Make America Great Again,\u201d Tuesday in New York, he refused to. He didn't want to portray someone \u201csleeping at a podium.\"\n\nThat was just his first burn.\n\nTrump went on to criticize Ben Carson for his lack of energy and Marco Rubio for his weak stance on illegal immigration and awful history with credit cards. \u201cMarco Rubio is overrated,\u201d he said.\n\nHis presser wasn\u2019t all about insulting his competitors, however. He spent the first part of his remarks promoting his new book, ensuring the media it would be \u201chard hitting.\u201d He also repeated his own policy ideas, including the platform we now all know by heart: He is going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it.\n\nAnother entertaining exchange occurred when a Telemundo reporter told Trump there would be protesters at his event. \u201cWelcome to Trump Tower,\u201d he said. That would give him \u201cmore publicity.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s favorite question, however, came from a CNN reporter, who asked him if he thought some of the other GOP candidates should exit the race. He said those who are polling at zero percent especially need to go.\n\n\u201cThere are too many people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get personal, but look at the poll numbers.\u201d\n\nThe businessman is meeting with \"SNL\" Producer Lorne Michaels in New York tonight to prep for Saturday's show.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prepping for SNL?.05/27/2016 9:13:42AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Prepping for SNL?", "title": "At Entertaining Presser, Trump Says Jeb \u201cSleeps at the Podium,\u201d Rubio is \"Overrated\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/11/03/at-entertaining-presser-trump-says-jeb-sleeps-at-the-podium-carson-has-no-energy-n2075182", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/306/b9cd0b30-b74e-4275-815f-90306f55605b.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Prepping for SNL?", "title": "At Entertaining Presser, Trump Says Jeb \u201cSleeps at the Podium,\u201d Rubio is \"Overrated\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/11/03/at-entertaining-presser-trump-says-jeb-sleeps-at-the-podium-carson-has-no-energy-n2075182", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/306/b9cd0b30-b74e-4275-815f-90306f55605b.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "At Entertaining Presser, Trump Says Jeb \u201cSleeps at the Podium,\u201d Rubio is \"Overrated\", Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMarco Rubio is overrated,\u201d he said.\nTrump went on to criticize Ben Carson for his lack of energy and Marco Rubio for his weak stance on illegal immigration and awful history with credit cards.\nAnother entertaining exchange occurred when a Telemundo reporter told Trump there would be protesters at his event.\nDonald Trump is hosting \"Saturday Night Live\" this weekend and will have a litany of impressions to practice.\nYet, when the media asked him to give his best impersonation of his presidential opponent Jeb Bush at a press conference for his new book, \u201cCrippling America: Make America Great Again,\u201d Tuesday in New York, he refused to."}
