The finding comes from new research led by HSPH, based on data from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study and published in the Journal of Public Health. The study\u2019s senior author, SV Subramanian, professor of population health and geography in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences, offers some explanations: \u201cIt\u2019s possible it\u2019s a grief-related mechanism, or that providing care for the sick spouse causes illness in the surviving spouse, or that, as one\u2019s spouse gets sicker, the surviving spouse stops taking care of his or her own health.\u201d\n\nBile acid treatment could prevent type 1 diabetes\n\nA naturally occurring bile acid can target a cellular stress mechanism in type 1 diabetes, according to a new study led by Harvard School of Public Health. In a surprising finding, treatment with the bile acid prevented the disease in mouse models. Senior author G\u00f6khan S. Hotamisligil, chair of the Department of Genetics and Complex Diseases, explains that such molecules could someday be used to \u201ckeep those at risk for type 1 diabetes disease-free for long periods of time, or even prevent the disease altogether.\u201d The study appeared in Science Translational.\n\nKeeping up with health care reform\n\nHSPH, in collaboration with the news organization Reuters, is now offering regular updates on the status of the Affordable Care Act and its influence on health care in the U.S.\n\nCatch the new web-based program \u201cHealth Reform Watch\u201d at hsph.me/health-reform-watch.\n\nTranslating the talk between liver and muscle\n\nResearch conducted jointly by HSPH, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, and Harvard University\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Sciences has revealed a novel mechanism that controls how fat-making in the liver communicates with fat-burning in skeletal muscle. \u201cThis finding uncovers a joint effort of the liver and muscle to maintain balanced fat production and burning\u2014a biological process tailored to match the body\u2019s energy demands and maximize fuel-burning efficiencies during the day versus night,\u201d says Chih-Hao Lee, senior author and associate professor of genetics and complex diseases. The researchers hope that the study, which was published in Nature, generates greater understanding of normal metabolism in liver and muscle and paves the way for new therapies to treat fatty liver, obesity, and diabetes.\n\nCould 2035 be the last year of global health disparities?\n\nCan world health disparities disappear within two decades? A major new report in The Lancet details an investment plan through which governments and private donors could reduce infectious, maternal, and child deaths in all countries to the levels of the best-performing countries in a single generation. The report, \u201cGlobal Health 2035: A World Converging within a Generation,\u201d projects that if its recommendations are followed, about 10 million lives could be saved by 2035 in low- and middle-income countries. Two of the report\u2019s authors are from Harvard School of Public Health\u2014HSPH Dean Julio Frenk and Sue J. Goldie, the School\u2019s Roger Irving Lee Professor of Public Health and director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. \u201c[G]ood investments in health are good in themselves, but they also promote economic growth,\u201d Frenk told the Harvard Gazette. \u201cThe main idea is that by 2035, we can achieve what\u2019s called a grand convergence, closing the most egregious equity gaps we still have between poor and rich populations around the world.\u201d\n\nSick ecosystem = sick people\n\nApocalyptic forest fires. Melting ice caps. Dammed rivers. Dwindling animal and plant habitats. Humans\u2019 alterations of the earth\u2019s natural systems pose grave risks to human health\u2014especially among the world\u2019s poor, who are singularly vulnerable to the health impacts that result from degraded natural systems. Samuel Myers, research scientist in HSPH\u2019s Department of Environmental Health, and his colleagues in the HEAL (Health & Ecosystems: Analysis of Linkages) consortium have proposed a new health research framework that focuses on the health effects of environmental changes. In a perspective paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the authors argue that such research can inform future policymaking for land use, resource allocation, and public health.\n\nSounding the alarm on human rights abuses, discrimination\n\nA recent report by Siddharth Kara, a fellow with the Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bagnoud (FXB) Center for Health and Human Rights, reveals pervasive human rights abuses in India\u2019s carpet industry. The report, Tainted Carpets: Slavery and Child Labor in India\u2019s Hand-Made Carpet Sector, describes illegal forced labor practices in production sites belonging to 172 carpet exporters. \u201c[T]he working conditions uncovered were nothing short of subhuman,\u201d the report notes, pointedly contradicting claims that slavery and child labor have been eliminated from the sector.\n\nA second report by the FXB Center, Accelerating Patterns of Anti-Roma Violence in Hungary, alerts the United Nations and the international community to persistent patterns of violent attacks and actions against the Roma (pejoratively called Gypsies). It argues that Hungary\u2019s mounting incidence of hate crimes, racist propaganda, discrimination, and exclusionary ideologies demands measures to ensure the physical and psychological safety of the Roma and other minority groups.\n\nStemming the tide of diabetes in Asia\n\nThe Asian Diabetes Prevention Initiative website\u2014launched as a joint initiative between the Harvard School of Public Health Department of Nutrition and the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore\u2014aims to give health professionals, public health practitioners, and the public quick and easy access to science-based information. The website serves as a factual resource about the causes of type 2 diabetes, its health consequences, and what can and must be done to decrease the prevalence of this disease on the world\u2019s most populous continent.\n\nFor more information visit www.asiandiabetesprevention.org\n\n\u2014 Luisa Cahill\n\nPhoto Credits: \u00a9Purestock / Alamy; \u00a9Strauss / Curtis / Corbis; \u00a9Handout / REUTERS; \u00a9REUTERS; Nicky Loh / REUTERS\n\nDownload a PDF of Spring 2014 Frontlines", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The President and Fellows of Harvard College", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "msapplication-TileColor": "#A51C30", "fb": {"admins": "14102788,173700233,100001178456994", "pages": 166496921771}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/wp-content/themes/hsph/images/ms/ms-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Quick updates about the latest public health news from across the School and beyond."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e94\"", "article_summary": "Stemming the tide of diabetes in AsiaThe Asian Diabetes Prevention Initiative website\u2014launched as a joint initiative between the Harvard School of Public Health Department of Nutrition and the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore\u2014aims to give health professionals, public health practitioners, and the public quick and easy access to science-based information.\nTwo of the report\u2019s authors are from Harvard School of Public Health\u2014HSPH Dean Julio Frenk and Sue J.
