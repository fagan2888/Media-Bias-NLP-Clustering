Instead, she says, Dems should back her so she can save ObamaCare.\n\nNot so fast, Hillary.\n\nObamaCare is on the ropes, and Hillary hasn\u2019t shown us a plan to fix it. Humana just became the third major insurer \u2014 following UnitedHealthcare and Cigna \u2014 to report huge losses selling ObamaCare plans. Industry experts say they\u2019re likely to abandon ObamaCare altogether at the end of this year.\n\nMore bad news: Enrollment figures for 2016 aren\u2019t looking good, with fewer young adults (profitable for insurance companies) signing up than in the past. ObamaCare is in what the insurance industry calls a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n\nBut Hillary isn\u2019t acknowledging that. Instead, she\u2019s proposing minor adjustments, such as Alzheimer\u2019s research and new autism programs. That\u2019s like buying wiper blades when your transmission is shot.\n\nHillary\u2019s challenge from the left is forcing her to misrepresent the health law, calling its problems mere \u201cglitches\u201d and deceiving the public on its impact on the nation\u2019s budget. Hillary defends ObamaCare, saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to rip it up and start over.\u201d\n\nSanders proposes a Medicare-for-all system popular with Democratic primary voters. Hillary claims Sanders\u2019 proposal would increase the deficit and necessitate middle-class tax hikes. \u201cWe think the voters in Iowa should be able to hear how Sen. Sanders would pay for that proposal,\u201d her campaign said yesterday.\n\nWhat she\u2019s not telling voters \u2014 though the writing is on the wall \u2014 is that ObamaCare is already hugely in the red, and taxes would have to be hiked substantially to make it \u201cpaid for.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office just reported that over the next 10 years, ObamaCare\u2019s entitlements will cost $516 billion more than the law\u2019s taxes and penalties will take in.\n\nHillary promises her approach is \u201ca responsible way, paid for in ways we can afford.\u201d Paid for? Impossible, unless her vow not to raise taxes on the middle class is a blatant lie.\n\nShe\u2019s touting her soak-the-rich 4 percent surcharge on millionaires. But it will raise only $150 billion over 10 years. That\u2019s chump change compared with the ObamaCare deficit, never mind the many other spending programs she\u2019s proposing.\n\nHillary\u2019s also ignoring the discouraging news rolling in daily about ObamaCare plans. Insurers have already racked up billions in losses selling ObamaCare plans, and nonprofit co-ops selling them are in the red, too. More than half the co-ops are already bankrupt.\n\n\u201cUnless some fundamental flaws are corrected,\u201d said Aetna in a letter to the Obama administration, \u201cthere is a grave risk that the federal exchange will not operate as a viable, competitive market in 2017.\u201d\n\nAlso, add Blue Cross Blue Shield to the list of panicked insurers.\n\nHillary pledges tougher regulations on health insurers. It\u2019s a campaign crowd-pleaser but hardly the answer with insurers already heading for the exits. Once they leave, ObamaCare is dead.\n\nWhy the losses? Too few customers are signing up, and those who do are too old and sick to keep insurers profitable. This year so far, 26 percent of signups are in the young-adult age group, down from 28 percent.\n\nThe trend is bad. Young, healthy people are staying away, despite having to pay big penalties for going uninsured.\n\nLast year, a whopping 7.5 million paid the penalty, and millions more weaseled exemptions. More than half the uninsured eligible for ObamaCare chose not to sign up.\n\nObama is willing to take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. Don\u2019t count on Hillary to be so forgiving.\n\nIn the past, she\u2019s told Congress that if people don\u2019t sign up for mandatory health insurance, they should be automatically enrolled. If they fail to pay, their wages should be garnished.\n\nYikes. It\u2019s doubtful Americans would put up with that.\n\nThe truth is, electing Hillary won\u2019t save ObamaCare. Claiming it will is a lie.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton is attacking rival Bernie Sanders, calling his plan to replace ObamaCare with a socialist single-payer system a \u201crisky deal\u201d and unaffordable.
