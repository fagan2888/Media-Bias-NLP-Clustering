The Disney and Marvel superhero pic brought in $24.8 million over the weekend, bringing its domestic total to $106.1 million according to Rentrak estimates Sunday.\n\n\u201cPixels,\u201d meanwhile, just barely missed first place with a $24 million debut. While studios always hope for the bragging rights of a No. 1 debut, the real issue here is whether or not the Adam Sandler end of the world comedy will make up its $88 million production budget.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a little competitive in the marketplace when you consider the extent of the performance of \u2018Jurassic\u2019 and \u2018Inside Out,'\u201d said Sony\u2019s President of Worldwide Distribution Rory Bruer. \u201cTo get to where we opened to was quite good.\u201d\n\nCritics were not fond of \u201cPixels,\u201d which shows 1980s video arcade game characters attacking Earth, but younger audiences still turned out to theaters \u2014 an estimated 62 percent were under the age of 25.\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, Rentrak\u2019s senior media analyst, said Sandler can still attract an audience, but the expensive film has a lot of ground to make up.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really going to have to count on the international component. That\u2019s going to be key,\u201d he said.\n\nOverall, the box office is down 3 percent from the same weekend last year, when \u201cLucy\u201d opened particularly strong. Dergarabedian said that though some are attempting to link last week\u2019s theater shootings to any dip in the box office this weekend, \u201cthe numbers just don\u2019t bear it out.\u201d\n\nHoldovers \u201cMinions\u201d and \u201cTrainwreck\u201d took the third and fourth spots with $22.1 million and $17.3 million, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the R-rated boxing drama \u201cSouthpaw\u201d surpassed expectations and landed a place in the top five with its $16.5 million opening.\n\nDergarabedian said that its performance is likely due to star Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s enthusiastic promotion of the film and also the fact that it provides an alternative to the standard summer blockbuster fare.\n\n\u201c\u2018Southpaw\u2019 felt like a really good fall movie,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPaper Towns,\u201d an adaptation of John Green\u2019s coming-of-age novel, opened in sixth place with $12.5 million. The Fox film only cost $12 million to produce, but considering Green\u2019s fan base and last year\u2019s massive $48 million debut of \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d which Green also wrote, it\u2019s a bit disappointing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018Ant-Man\u2019 inches past \u2018Pixels\u2019 to take first-place spot", "title": "\u2018Ant-Man\u2019 inches past \u2018Pixels\u2019 to take first-place spot", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\u2018Ant-Man\u2019 inches past \u2018Pixels\u2019 to take first-place spot", "title": "\u2018Ant-Man\u2019 inches past \u2018Pixels\u2019 to take first-place spot", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/26/ant_man_inches_past_pixels_to_take_first_place_spot/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/box-office.jpeg9-1280x871.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u2018Ant-Man\u2019 inches past \u2018Pixels\u2019 to take first-place spot", "title": "\u2018Ant-Man\u2019 inches past \u2018Pixels\u2019 to take first-place spot", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/box-office.jpeg9-1280x871.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsey Bahr", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cAnt-Man\u201d crept past new opener \u201cPixels\u201d to claim the top spot at the box office this weekend by an ant-sized margin.\n\u201cPixels,\u201d meanwhile, just barely missed first place with a $24 million debut.\nOverall, the box office is down 3 percent from the same weekend last year, when \u201cLucy\u201d opened particularly strong.\n\u201cPaper Towns,\u201d an adaptation of John Green\u2019s coming-of-age novel, opened in sixth place with $12.5 million.\nThe Disney and Marvel superhero pic brought in $24.8 million over the weekend, bringing its domestic total to $106.1 million according to Rentrak estimates Sunday."}
