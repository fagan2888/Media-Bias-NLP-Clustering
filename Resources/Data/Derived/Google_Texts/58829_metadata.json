They shared a large bowl of crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e and digested the historic evening that was.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get much sleep,\u201d Scherzer said with a smile Sunday morning. \u201cBut that\u2019s from a good reason.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: LOVERRO: Max Scherzer\u2019s no-hitter went just as the Nationals had planned\n\nScherzer threw the second no-hitter in Washington Nationals history Saturday in a 6-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates. He recorded 10 strikeouts, allowed only one baserunner and left the field with six bottles of chocolate syrup dripping off his jersey.\n\nThe hours afterward were a blur. There was a quick shower and a press conference, then phone calls with SportsCenter and MLB Network Radio. A television appearance on MLB Network followed. Meanwhile, a clubhouse attendant carried his hat, still covered in syrup, through the clubhouse in a white plastic bag. More than 120 text messages were piling up on Scherzer\u2019s phone.\n\n\u201cJust on a high. Just a high from the game,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that you can\u2019t describe.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Nationals\u2019 record-setting first inning wraps up a productive weekend\n\nAmid all of that, the 30-year-old pitcher with a $210 million contract made time to bring his father a plate of food from the clubhouse. His parents were in town for just the second time this year, and the first time since Opening Day. They watched the game with their daughter-in-law from Section 121. It was the eve of Father\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cIt was a perfect Father\u2019s Day present,\u201d Brad Scherzer said outside the clubhouse afterward. \u201cRegardless of what happened in the game, it was a perfect Father\u2019s Day present.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what my dad wanted,\u201d Max Scherzer added Sunday. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want a tie. I gave him a no-hitter, so he was pretty happy.\u201d\n\nThe morning after the feat, Scherzer\u2019s teammates were still marveling at what they had seen. It wasn\u2019t merely that the right-hander had pitched a no-hitter, or racked up 10 strikeouts along the way. It was that, six days earlier, Scherzer had been almost as dominant, throwing a one-hit shutout with 16 strikeouts against the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nIn his past two starts, Scherzer has allowed one hit with one walk and 26 strikeouts over 18 scoreless innings. A few teammates chuckled at the absurdity of those numbers. Denard Span said he has never seen anything like it.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I can think of is Mark Buehrle, maybe back when he was with the White Sox,\u201d Span said. \u201cIt was something like 17 scoreless innings, but it wasn\u2019t dominating strikeouts, overpowering hitters [like Scherzer].\u201d\n\nThe balls from the two performances now sit next to one another in Scherzer\u2019s locker, each clearly marked. A baseball is one of the only souvenirs Scherzer will keep from Saturday\u2019s no-hitter. He also plans to frame a jersey from the evening, and a photo to commemorate the moment.\n\nThe day after was mostly a celebration for Scherzer and his teammates, but there were also still questions about what could have been.\n\nWith two outs and two strikes in the ninth inning, Scherzer threw a slider that didn\u2019t break as expected and hit Jose Tabata in the elbow with the pitch. Nationals fans believed that Tabata intentionally leaned into the path of the ball to get on base and break up the perfect game, and they made those beliefs known during Sunday\u2019s 9-2 victory, booing Tabata at every possible opportunity. He was booed when he was introduced, before his at-bats, after his at-bats, and even when he caught a fly ball in right field.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of hitting a good pitch, that\u2019s my job, and he got me,\u201d Tabata told reporters Saturday night. \u201cHe threw a slider that came back to me and he got me. I know he throw a perfect game, so I want to do my job. I know he one of the best pitchers in the league.\u201d\n\nScherzer was visibly frustrated when his pitch hit Tabata but said it took him \u201ctwo seconds\u201d to refocus and seal the no-hitter. He has yet to complain about the play.\n\nFor Scherzer, the first no-hitter of his major-league career was something to be celebrated, not doubted. Twelve hours later, in a calm Nationals clubhouse, the achievement was still sinking in.\n\n\u201cWhen you put it in the context of what I\u2019ve done the past two games, it\u2019s a major personal accomplishment,\u201d Scherzer said. \u201cBut at the same time, we\u2019ve also won two games as well. We\u2019ve done it as a team. Guys are playing really hard behind me as well. That\u2019s what puts a smile on my face.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scherzer was still letting the reality of the no-hitter sink in on Sunday, a day after he struck out 10 batters and was able to celebrate the accomplishment with his parents in town.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Scherzer was still letting the reality of the no-hitter sink in on Sunday, a day after he struck out 10 batters and was able to celebrate the accomplishment with his parents in town.", "title": "Max Scherzer still smiling a day after finishing off Nationals\u2019 second no-hitter", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/21/max-scherzer-still-smiling-nationals-no-hitter/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/21/1a064efc89ecf71b790f6a7067007cb7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/21/1a064efc89ecf71b790f6a7067007cb7.jpg", "description": "Scherzer was still letting the reality of the no-hitter sink in on Sunday, a day after he struck out 10 batters and was able to celebrate the accomplishment with his parents in town.", "card": "summary", "title": "Max Scherzer still smiling a day after finishing off Nationals\u2019"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Max Scherzer"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut that\u2019s from a good reason.\u201dSEE ALSO: LOVERRO: Max Scherzer\u2019s no-hitter went just as the Nationals had plannedScherzer threw the second no-hitter in Washington Nationals history Saturday in a 6-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nTwelve hours later, in a calm Nationals clubhouse, the achievement was still sinking in.\nJust a high from the game,\u201d Scherzer said.\n\u201cRegardless of what happened in the game, it was a perfect Father\u2019s Day present.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what my dad wanted,\u201d Max Scherzer added Sunday.\nI know he throw a perfect game, so I want to do my job."}
