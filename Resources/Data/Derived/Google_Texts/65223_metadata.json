The Senate refused.\n\nAs he watched the resulting 16-day shutdown of the federal government, Lewis said, he felt compelled to do something about the partisan gridlock.\n\n\u201cI came to the conclusion that the U.S. House is basically keeping this country from moving forward,\u201d said the 36-year-old Democrat who faces Republican Ryan Zinke in the Nov. 4 election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got one seat in the House,\u201d he added. \u201cThere are 435 members and we\u2019ve got one seat and one voice there, and I\u2019m concerned about the future of this country.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019 journey\n\nBy then, the fourth-generation Montanan and father of two was something of a professional Congress watcher.\n\nFor 12 years, he had been aide to U.S. Sen. Max Baucus, first in Washington, D.C. as a legislative assistant and then as a Montana-based state director of Baucus\u2019 efforts to solve problems for individuals, business and local governments.\n\nThat work took him to all 56 Montana counties. It included helping older Montanans get their Social Security checks and helping veterans get benefits. He helped organize Baucus\u2019 economic development summits and directed efforts in 2011 to help central Montana flood victims get federal disaster help.\n\nMuch of Lewis\u2019 life has been spent in Montana. Born in Billings, he is one of six children in a blended family. His mother was an educator, a Forest Service employee and small-business woman. His father was a land planner and his stepdad a smokejumper.\n\nLewis graduated from Missoula\u2019s Sentinel High School, and in 2001 he earned a bachelor\u2019s in political science from Western Washington University. Returning to Montana shortly thereafter, he began working on political campaigns, going door to door. It was that work that eventually led him to Baucus\u2019 staff.\n\nHe was in Helena when U.S. Rep. Steve Daines decided to seek Baucus\u2019s Senate seat and put his House seat up for grabs. Though he had never run for elected office before, Lewis took the plunge.\n\nHe won easily over rival Democrat John Driscoll, who offered a token challenge in the primary. From there, the campaign would get much rougher.\n\nDefining differences\n\nBoth candidates struggled after the primary to distinguish themselves with the independent voters who will likely decide the election.\n\nBut the fight was on when Zinke began to run ads comparing his combat and leadership experience as a U.S. Navy Seal with Lewis\u2019 youth and his work \u201chelping to write the disastrous Obamacare legislation.\u201d\n\nLewis, who was back in Montana when the law was drafted, has said he had no role in writing Obamacare. But he told a statewide TV audience recently that he supports its efforts to provide health coverage for working families, including tens of thousands who have benefited.\n\nThe law needs fixing, Lewis said, adding that it needs more flexibility, less paperwork and more competition from private insurers. But it shouldn\u2019t be abandoned like a sinking ship, as Zinke has suggested.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear \u2018abandon ship\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018jump ship\u2019 with no plan to get people to shore,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nLewis also draws a line between his stance on energy and Zinke\u2019s. Both candidates support the Keystone XL pipeline and an energy policy that calls for development of oil, gas and coal and renewable energy, but Lewis said his plan focuses more on renewables and the need to battle climate change.\n\nThe two also differ on abortion, with Lewis saying he would fight for a woman\u2019s right to choose. Zink is pro-life, but says he\u2019ll abide the U.S. Supreme Court decision declaring abortion legal.\n\nLewis has also criticized Zinke\u2019s support for legislation proposed by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan to balance the federal budget in 10 years. It includes proposals to privatize Medicare and Social Security and cut Pell Grants.\n\nZinke has said he opposes such tactics but likes the Ryan budget as \u201ca framework,\u201d a statement Lewis calls contradictory. Ryan\u2019s goal of balancing the budget falls apart without such savings, Lewis said.\n\nEndorsements\n\nAs voters look for differences between the candidates they should look at who\u2019s supporting them, said Lewis, who notes proudly that more than 70 percent of the donors to his campaign were Montanans. By contrast, most of Zinke\u2019s donors are from California, Texas and Florida, Lewis told a statewide TV audience recently.\n\nAmong Lewis\u2019 backers is former Montana Congressman Pat Williams, the last Democrat to win election to Congress in Montana\u2019s single at-large district.\n\n\u201cJohn is cooperative instead of confrontational,\u201d said Williams, who served in Congress from 1979 to 1997. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good listener. He\u2019s uniquely qualified to have the seat.\u201d\n\nHe said Congress is full of politicians like Zinke, and that\u2019s not what Montana, or the country needs, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are too many chest-thumpers in there who want to do it their own way,\u201d Williams said.\n\nLewis\u2019 Washington experience would help him get legislation through Congress if he\u2019s elected, Williams added.\n\nIt\u2019s a point that Lewis makes himself.\n\n\u201cWhen I see Congress going from crisis to crisis, which is what led to the government shutdown last fall, it concerns me,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to take to change that, but I am somebody that\u2019s willing to work with both sides. I\u2019m solution-oriented and I put myself out there.\u201d\n\nIn a recent TV debate, Lewis urged voters to keep that in mind as the campaign rhetoric heats up.\n\n\u201cIf you want a show horse in this race, then Mr. Zinke is your guy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want a work horse, then I\u2019m your guy.\u201d\n\n--By BJORN BERGESON\n\nUM School of Journalism", "article_metadata": {"category": "Montana News", "description": "John Lewis\u2019 decision to run for Congress was born of frustration.
