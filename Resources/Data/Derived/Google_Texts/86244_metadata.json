It would seem, however, that the news outlet\u2019s patience with their ally in the White House is diminishing. On issues ranging from drone warfare, to the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance tactics, to intervention in Syria, NPR is firing a series of shots across the bow of the USS Obama on Monday.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long, disappointing year for many of President Obama\u2019s most ardent supporters,\u201d a dispirited Liz Halloran writes for NPR. \u201cFrom drones and Syria, to immigration and the Keystone XL pipeline, the list of issues on which the president has induced frustration and disillusionment is not a short one.\u201d\n\nShe notes that a series of polls have observed that \u201ckey members\u201d of Obama\u2019s \u201cwinning coalition\u201d are registering their disapproval with the president \u2013 including Hispanics, women, self-described liberals, and young voters.\n\nOn drones, Halloran notes that the White House has all but ignored Democratic activists who have demanded that the rules of engagement governing the use of unmanned aerial vehicles be reformed to reduce civilian casualties. She quotes Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson who called the inaction a \u201cgreat moral failure\u201d in stark contrast to the \u201cmoral triumph\u201d of the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRELATED: Mission Accomplished: Obama\u2019s Base-Rallying Speech \u2018Relieving\u2019 for MSNBC\u2019s Alex Wagner\n\nOn \u201cspying,\u201d the NPR reporter notes that Obama\u2019s unconvincing assertion that he was unaware of programs which spied on foreign leaders has been rendered utterly hollow by his White House\u2019s refusal to reform surveillance procedures.\n\nThis week, a U.S. Court weighed in with a decision that excoriated the NSA\u2019s collection of Americans\u2019 phone calls as \u201calmost Orwellian,\u201d and an infringement on Fourth Amendment protections from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nOn intervention in Syria, Halloran notes that liberals were \u201cdivided\u201d on what to do about the humanitarian crisis in that Mediterranean nation. However, she observes that the administration\u2019s inaction damaged its credibility. Further, Halloran asserts that Obama eagerly embraced an ill-supported diplomatic solution to the crisis which \u201cis now in shambles.\u201d\n\nFinally, Halloran sees the White House\u2019s repeated insistences that the Keystone XL pipeline is necessary for the country\u2019s economic security may not necessarily result in its construction. However, the opportunity to pursue strict legislative reforms addressing climate change using the pipeline as leverage has largely passed.\n\nShe closes with a final depressing note for the Democratic base, observing that a \u201cdiminished\u201d president will find it difficult in 2014 to move forward on progressive legislative reforms addressing issues like \u201cgun control, immigration reform, and a bump in the minimum wage.\u201d\n\n[Photo via AP]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n> >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "National Public Radio\u2019s editorial vision is often viewed as one that is friendly toward Democratic policy objectives and particularly those of President Barack", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/obama-fans.jpg", "title": "NPR Takes Shot at Obama for \u2018Disappointing the Liberal Base\u2019 in 2013"}, "twitter": {"description": "National Public Radio\u2019s editorial vision is often viewed as one that is friendly toward Democratic policy objectives and particularly those of President Barack Obama.
