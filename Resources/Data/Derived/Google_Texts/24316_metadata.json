'We were making the season.'\n\n'We literally couldn\u2019t fit it in to our schedules,' Key added 'with regret,' according to the magazine.\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\n\nActors Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele, a.k.a. President Barack Obama's anger translator Luther and President Obama, say POTUS wanted to do an Obamacare sketch with them but they turned him down\n\nInstead, Obama appeared on Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis. Key and Peele left the door open to a future collaboration with the president, though\n\nPeele went on to say that he and his acting partner 'actually had to relieve the president of his duties.'\n\n'We couldn\u2019t help him out on that one particular time,' he said, leaving the door open for a future collaboration with the nation's leader when the 2015 open enrollment period for Obamacare begins in November.\n\n'But this is a country where we technically have status over our elected officials. So you gotta remember, Obama works for us,' he noted.\n\nHHS LOWERS EXPECTATIONS FOR 2015 OBAMACARE ENROLLMENT Health and Human Services Secretary Slyvia Burwell sought on Wednesday to downplay a government report claiming that 13 million people will be eligible to for health care under the Affordable Care Act in the upcoming open enrollment period. 'One of things we are doing right now is applying analytics to how should we think about that goal,' she said, according to the LA Times. During the first sign-up period 7.3 million Americans signed up for Obamacare, surpassing the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office's estimate of 6 million. But HHS appears to be concerned that it won't be able to replicate its past success and nearly double the number of enrollees in 2015.\n\nKey and Peele are known for their portrayal of the president's anger translator Luther, played by Key, and President Obama, acted out by Peele, in skits on their Comedy Central show of the same name, Key & Peele.\n\nLast night the show launched into it's fourth season with a skit featuring 'Obama' at the end of a press conference, sans sidekick Luther, code-switching as he takes a different tone with white supporters than he does black supporters as he interacts with them.\n\nKey and Peele told Vulture over the summer that at some point this season they would unveil former Secretary of State and presumed 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's anger translator on the show, expanding on the popular bit that now includes impersonations of Michelle Obama, as well.\n\n'Whereas Michelle\u2019s translator Contendra felt like she owned a beauty salon, maybe somewhere on Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta, I think Hillary\u2019s translator would be more trailer bait,' Peele told Vulture.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Obama,asked,Key,Peele,Obamacare,video,duo,turned,POTUS,busy", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2769575/Obama-asked-Key-Peele-Obamacare-video-duo-turned-POTUS-busy.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "But the duo left the door open for a future collaboration with the nation's leader when the 2015 open enrollment period for Obamacare begins in November.", "title": "Key & Peele said no to video with Obama because they were too busy", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2769575/Obama-asked-Key-Peele-Obamacare-video-duo-turned-POTUS-busy.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/25/1411655721901_wps_28_Key_and_Peele_as_Obama_an.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2769575/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2769575/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2769575, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Obama,asked,Key,Peele,Obamacare,video,duo,turned,POTUS,busy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-09-25T14:36:58.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Francesca+Chambers+for+MailOnline", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-09-25T14:59:05.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Obama asked Key Peele Obamacare video duo turned POTUS busy"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "But the duo left the door open for a future collaboration with the nation's leader when the 2015 open enrollment period for Obamacare begins in November.", "title": "Key & Peele said no to video with Obama because they were too busy", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2769575/Obama-asked-Key-Peele-Obamacare-video-duo-turned-POTUS-busy.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/09/25/1411655721901_wps_28_Key_and_Peele_as_Obama_an.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2014/03/1418450360_3327594612001_obama.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "But the duo left the door open for a future collaboration with the nation's leader when the 2015 open enrollment period for Obamacare begins in November."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9875\"", "article_summary": "Key and Peele are known for their portrayal of the president's anger translator Luther, played by Key, and President Obama, acted out by Peele, in skits on their Comedy Central show of the same name, Key & Peele.\nPresident Barack Obama's anger translator Luther and President Obama, say POTUS wanted to do an Obamacare sketch with them but they turned him downInstead, Obama appeared on Between Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis.\n'We had to turn him down,' Peele told EW.\n'Whereas Michelle\u2019s translator Contendra felt like she owned a beauty salon, maybe somewhere on Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta, I think Hillary\u2019s translator would be more trailer bait,' Peele told Vulture.\nZach Galifianakis' weed-loving sketch comedy program Between Two Ferns wasn't President Barack Obama's first choice for his Obamacare-themed cameo this spring, duo Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele claim."}
