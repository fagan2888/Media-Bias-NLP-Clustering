Many people have said it \u2014 politicians of both parties, economists, pundits, business leaders \u2014 but millions of GOP primary voters don't seem to be listening. Much of the Republican base has taken leave of its senses, a flight blamed alternately on inchoate anger, disgust with inside-the-Beltway candidates and misplaced affection for a plain-speaking cartoon character who often seems to utter whatever nonsense comes into his head. Regardless of the reason for his popularity, the bombastic billionaire continued his soon-to-be unstoppable march toward the nomination Tuesday, racking up resounding victories in primaries across the American South and in the Northeast.\n\nWhat do you think? Discuss this editorial on our Facebook page >>\n\nThe reality is that Trump has no experience whatsoever in government, interacting with the machinery of state only as a supplicant. He has shamefully little knowledge of the issues facing the country and the world, and a temperament utterly unsuited to the job. He is a racist and a bully, a demagogue. He has proposed killing the families of terrorists, a violation of international law so blatant that a former CIA director predicted that U.S. troops would refuse to carry out such an order.\n\nHe mocked a disabled person at a campaign rally. He has vowed to reinstate waterboarding and forms of torture that are \u201cmuch worse.\u201d He intends to seize and deport 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally. He would bar all Muslims from entering the country until further notice. He would \u201copen up our libel laws\u201d so that news organizations are punished for writing critical \u201chit\u201d pieces. He wants to build a wall along the entire Mexican border, on the fantastical premise that he could force the Mexican government to pay for it. He has threatened to start trade wars with two of the country\u2019s biggest trading partners, Mexico and China, by slapping on the kind of protectionist tariffs that U.S. leaders have been trying for decades to eliminate worldwide.\n\nOften enough he says nothing at all, promising to replace Obamacare, for instance, with \u201csomething great\u201d or assuring listeners vaguely that a winner such as himself \u2014 someone who never tires of telling the world he\u2019s rich, successful and famous \u2014 will make it all work out one way or another.\n\nIt isn't easy to tell how much of Trump's performance is merely shtick and how much is real. In the aftermath of his victories Tuesday, Trump struck a less adversarial tone and talked about how he was \u201cbecoming diplomatic.\u201d Yet at the same time, he said this of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), one of several GOP leaders who suggested Trump hadn\u2019t disavowed an endorsement by former KKK leader David Duke forcefully enough: \u201cPaul Ryan, I don\u2019t know him well, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to get along great with him. And if I don\u2019t, he\u2019s going to have to pay a big price, OK?\u201d That\u2019s about as diplomatic a message as a dead fish wrapped in newspaper.\n\nWe hope we won't have to learn who the real Donald J. Trump might be. Not that we find much to like about his Republican opponents, with whom we disagree sharply on issues that include climate change, environmental protection, healthcare and reproductive rights. In fact, on issues where it\u2019s possible to discern where Trump stands, his views are more moderate at times than those of his principal GOP rivals. And in their zeal to slow Trump\u2019s momentum, some have begun sinking to the Donald\u2019s level as a campaigner, slinging personal insults (at times vulgar ones) instead of focusing on the problems with his record and his campaign. Nevertheless, those candidates are more rational, knowledgeable, understandable and predictable \u2014 all of which are necessary (albeit not sufficient) qualities in the Oval Office. Trump\u2019s blustery temperament and authoritarian notion of the presidency are unique in the field and uniquely disqualifying.\n\nSubscribe to the Essential Politics newsletter>>\n\nTrump\u2019s popularity may simply be the product of a toxic brew of a polarized two-party system and nihilistic tactics on the campaign trail and Capitol Hill (such as shutting down the government and threatening to default on U.S. debts) that, either by design or in effect, have convinced many Americans that their government is irreparably broken and corrupt. But Trump isn\u2019t the answer \u2014 he\u2019s just a cynical manipulator playing on the very real frustrations of voters tired of a government that takes big, difficult problems and makes them intractable. Those voters still have time to choose a better standard-bearer.\n\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook\n\nMORE FROM OPINION\n\nWhy conservatives need to get behind #NeverTrump\n\nHow Mexican immigrants ended 'separate but equal' in California\n\nPost-Scalia Supreme Court to rule on the most important abortion case in two decades", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States.
