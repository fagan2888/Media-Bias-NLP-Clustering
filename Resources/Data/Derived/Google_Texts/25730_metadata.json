In fact, our factories, while not thriving, are growing. It\u2019s the jobs that aren\u2019t. The question is why.\n\nAs the chart alongside shows, we\u2019re still 3.3% below the 2007 peak in factory output \u2014 although, since 2000, output is actually up 13%. Jobs, however, are down for both periods. Since the factory downturn that began in President Clinton\u2019s last year, U.S. manufacturers have shed 5 million jobs.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog cites a study by the liberal Economic Policy Institute blaming the job loss on \u201ctrade deficits and declining factory output.\u201d\n\nSorry, but trade deficits do not cause factory output to decline. Just look at the 1990s, when trade deficits surged yet factory output nearly doubled.\n\nMore recently, since the start of the 2007 financial crisis, factory output has fallen 3.3% as jobs have plunged 10.2%. But the trade deficit has shrunk by 10%.\n\nLong-term, the picture is complicated. Factories now are driven by productivity gains from automation that make it easier to produce far more goods with fewer people. So even amid growth, fewer jobs are created.\n\nBut there\u2019s no doubt the recent trend is worrisome.\n\nPresident Obama vowed in 2013 to add a million factory jobs in his second term to boost the middle class. He\u2019ll be lucky to get half that. Despite paying lip service to creating jobs, his policies have made it harder than ever for manufacturers to hire.\n\nTake just two recent examples.\n\nNew Environmental Protection Agency regulations to slash carbon emissions 30% by 2030 will have a devastating effect on factory jobs. A study by the Heritage Foundation found that this regulation by itself would cost each American $7,000 in income while killing 500,000 factory jobs and 45% of all coal-industry jobs.\n\nThen there\u2019s the just-released ozone standards, also from the EPA\u2019s job-killing policy shop. A study by NERA Economic Consulting for the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) estimated a $140 billion hit to GDP and as many as 1.4 million jobs lost each year.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the new proposed ozone standard is so over the top, even places with no industrial activity for miles around will be considered noncompliant,\u201d said Jay Timmons, president and CEO of NAM.\n\nThe government\u2019s own Energy Information Administration estimates that electricity prices will rise 7% as a result of this rule.\n\nSince Obama took office, thousands of new regulations have gone into effect. In 2012, regulation cost the U.S. economy about $2 trillion, or 12% of GDP. And manufacturers have been hit hardest. The average factory today spends $19,564 per worker to comply with regulations. For small manufacturers, it\u2019s bigger: $34,671 per worker.\n\nAdd to this the 40% top corporate tax that U.S. manufacturers face \u2014 the highest in the developed world. Just cutting this to the OECD average of 25% and making a few other badly needed tax tweaks would add millions of new jobs over the next decade.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget ObamaCare. Kaiser Family Foundation data show that the average cost of a family health plan for manufacturing under the \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act has soared 33%, from $12,441 in 2009 to $16,538.\n\nAmid high taxes and a regulatory siege, the administration and its clueless progressive supporters wonder why factory jobs are barely growing. The wonder is that they\u2019re growing at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Economy: A Washington Post blog laments a decline in manufacturing that's brought about a loss in high-paying factory jobs.
