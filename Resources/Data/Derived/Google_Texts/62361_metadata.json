If we\u2019ve learned anything about the Broncos this season, it\u2019s that.\n\nAnd it was a point that reiterated Sunday, when the Broncos\u2019 outside linebacker turned the end zone into a dance floor after DeMarcus Ware\u2019s game-sealing sack in the fourth quarter of Denver\u2019s divisional playoff victory over the Steelers. The ball popped out of Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s hands, and Miller scooped it up and ran it back into the end zone. (Coach Gary Kubiak said Monday he felt the play should have been ruled a touchdown.)\n\nDance off! @Millerlite40 style! #BroncosCountry pic.twitter.com/BOCPLMwVfP \u2014 Jeff Howe (@sportsdenver) January 18, 2016\n\nThe first sequence is a favorite of Miller, as evidence but his unsolicited dances at practices. But the ending \u2014 that was new.\n\n\u201cIt comes from (Derek) Wolfe,\u201d Miller said. \u201cDerek, when he signed his new contract, that was the dance that he hit. Let me ring it up. What a better time to do it? I thought it was a touchdown. It was a great game, great day.
