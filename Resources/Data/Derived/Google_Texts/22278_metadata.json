This season, she had only three podium results - until this race.\n\n\u201cWhen you win a lot you don\u2019t learn much,\u201d Maze said. \u201cWith my ups and downs it\u2019s a lot of learning.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks ago, Maze made a staff change in her personal team, which is run by her boyfriend and coach Andrea Massi. They replaced Walter Ronconi with former Switzerland coach Mauro Pini.\n\nThe switch seems to have paid off and the timing couldn\u2019t have been better - in the final downhill before the Sochi Games, where the women\u2019s downhill is scheduled for Feb. 12.\n\nPini urged Maze to put more emotion into her skiing.\n\n\u201cThat was really good because Andrea was always saying to ski without feelings,\u201d Maze said. \u201cBut sometimes that\u2019s not possible.\n\n\u201c(Pini) brought a lot of peace to our team because compared to Andrea and I he\u2019s one step in front of us,\u201d Maze added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we were expecting from someone in that position. He came really motivated and that makes us easygoing and we have more energy for ourselves.\u201d\n\nPini was formerly Lara Gut\u2019s personal coach and he led the Swiss men\u2019s squad at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, when Didier Defago won gold in downhill. He then coached the Swiss women\u2019s team and more recently was a TV commentator.\n\n\u201cI could sense a good feeling from the first words we shared with each other,\u201d Pini said. \u201cTina never forgot how to ski. She was always capable, she just needed to focus her energy better and get rid of those negative vibes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this level a couple different words here or there can create all the difference,\u201d Pini added. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we had to start over from scratch.\u201d\n\nWith the skies perfectly clear to show off the jagged peaks that provide some of the most spectacular scenery in the Dolomite Range, Maria Hoefl-Riesch finished fourth to follow up her victory in Friday\u2019s downhill. The German said she felt some pain in her left knee after landing a jump awkwardly a day earlier.\n\nStill, Hoefl-Riesch maintained her lead in the overall and downhill standings.\n\nIn another strong showing from the U.S. Ski Team without injured Lindsey Vonn, Stacey Cook matched her fifth-place finish from Friday and teammate Julia Mancuso placed seventh to match her best result of the season from a super-G two days earlier.\n\n\u201cIt always stings when you are so close to the podium, but I know this is a positive move heading toward Sochi,\u201d Cook said.\n\nThis was the third of four races in four days. Elisabeth Goergl won a super-G on Thursday and another super-G is scheduled for Sunday.\n\nWeirather finished fourth and second in the opening two races this week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to have four good races in a row but I will try,\u201d she said.\n\nTwo of the races were originally scheduled for last weekend in Cortina but were wiped out by heavy snowfall. The other two were moved from Garmisch-Partenkirchen due to a lack of snow in the German resort.\n\nThe women\u2019s circuit then moves to Kranjska Gora for a giant slalom and slalom next weekend - the final races before Sochi and Maze\u2019s home event.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited to ski that slope,\u201d Maze said\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew Dampf at http://twitter.com/asdampf", "article_metadata": {"description": "Defending overall World Cup champion Tina Maze finally got her first victory of the season, winning the prestigious Cortina downhill Saturday to signal a return to form just in time for the Sochi Olympics.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Defending overall World Cup champion Tina Maze finally got her first victory of the season, winning the prestigious Cortina downhill Saturday to signal a return to form just in time for the Sochi Olympics.", "title": "Maze finally gets a win _ just in time for Sochi", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/25/maze-wins-womens-downhill-in-cortina/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/25/72545f9b87c1eb03490f6a706700afef.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/25/72545f9b87c1eb03490f6a706700afef.jpg", "description": "Defending overall World Cup champion Tina Maze finally got her first victory of the season, winning the prestigious Cortina downhill Saturday to signal a return to form just in time for the Sochi Olym", "card": "summary", "title": "Maze finally gets a win _ just in time for Sochi"}, "Author": "ANDREW DAMPF", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Tina Maze, Tina Weirather, Mauro Pini, Andrea Massi"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac16\"", "article_summary": "He then coached the Swiss women\u2019s team and more recently was a TV commentator.\nThe switch seems to have paid off and the timing couldn\u2019t have been better - in the final downhill before the Sochi Games, where the women\u2019s downhill is scheduled for Feb. 12.\n\u201cWhen you win a lot you don\u2019t learn much,\u201d Maze said.\nThe women\u2019s circuit then moves to Kranjska Gora for a giant slalom and slalom next weekend - the final races before Sochi and Maze\u2019s home event.\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited to ski that slope,\u201d Maze said___Follow Andrew Dampf at http://twitter.com/asdampf"}
