GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- Twenty-four Michigan hospitals are seeing reductions in Medicare payment this year as a penalty for patient infection and injury rates.

Under a provision of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare reductions are required for hospitals that rank in the worst-performing quartile on a Hospital-Acquired Condition score. Their payments are reduced by 1 percent for the fiscal year that began in October, according to the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services.

This year, 758 hospitals are being penalized nationwide, compared to 724 last year. More than half of those hospitals were fined last year.

Twenty-one Michigan hospitals made the list last year.

Hospitals receive a Hospital-Acquired Condition score between 1 and 10. Penalties were imposed to hospitals that received a score greater than 6.75.

The overall score is based on four measures: central line-associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, surgical site infections (colon and hysterectomy), and a patient safety indicator assessed to each hospital. The patient safety rating looks at the frequency of ulcers, sepsis, punctures, hip fractures, collapsed lungs, as well as other infections and injuries.

These are the 24 Michigan hospitals that ranked in the bottom quartile nationally, according to the Economic Alliance for Michigan:

• Borgess Medical Center in Kalamazoo

• Carson City Hospital in Carson City

• DMC Detroit Receiving Hospital in Detroit

• DMC Harper University Hospital in Detroit

• DMC Sinai-Grace in Detroit

• Doctor's Hospital of Michigan in Pontiac

• Genesys Regional Medical Center in Grand Blanc

• Henry Ford Macomb in Clinton Township

• Hurley Medical Center in Flint

• McLaren Flint in Flint

• McLaren Macomb in Mt. Clemens

• Mercy Health Saint Mary's in Grand Rapids

• MidMichigan Center-Clare in Clare

• North Ottawa Community Health Center in Grand Haven

• Oaklawn Hospital in Marshall

• Oakwood Hospital in Dearborn

• ProMedica Monroe Regional in Monroe

• Spectrum Health Big Rapids in Big Rapids

• Spectrum Health Butterworth in Grand Rapids

• St. Joseph Mercy Oakland in Pontiac

• St. Joseph Mercy Port Huron in Port Huron

• Tawas St. Joseph Hospital in Tawas City

• Three Rivers Hospital in Three Rivers

• West Branch Regional Medical Center in West Branch

Among the West Michigan hospitals on the list, Spectrum Health Butterworth scored 8.75, Mercy Health Saint Mary's scored 7, and North Ottawa Community Health Center scored 8.

In a statement, Spectrum Health said it takes infection control seriously with the goal of avoiding every possible infection.

Butterworth Hospital reduced catheter-associated infections to below the national average after performing worse than the national benchmark last year.

"Preventing Hospital Acquired Conditions (HACs) is the focus of intensive and ongoing process improvement efforts throughout our system. With focus, diligence, and the hard work of our team, Spectrum Health has reduced the reported catheter associated infections to below the national average. We consider this a significant accomplishment, especially considering the complexity of the patients we serve," the statement says.
