Two separate standoffs in the Lowcountry on Sunday ended peacefully, according to officials.

Both incidents involved individuals who barricaded themselves into their homes after welfare checks â€” one in North Charleston and the other in Mount Pleasant.

The first began about 9:35 a.m. in the 3400 block of Pinoca Lane in the Pepper Hill subdivision when a woman barricaded herself in a residence and threatened to harm herself. It ended just before 3:30 p.m. when she exited the home after numerous attempts throughout the day by police and the SWAT team to get her out.

The unidentified woman was turned over to medical professionals, according to North Charleston police spokesman Spencer Pryor.

The Mount Pleasant standoff began just before noon Sunday in the 600 block of Merrifield Court, off National Drive in the Charleston National subdivision. Officers responded for a welfare check and the incident became a man barricaded in a residence.

Police negotiators spent several hours trying to talk with the man, identified as 53-year-old David Schach. The standoff ended just after 7:30 p.m. when Schach surrendered to police. Inspector Chip Googe said no charges were filed and Schach was sent to a local hospital to be evaluated.
