Showtime has set a summer premiere date for the third seasons of “Ray Donovan” and “Masters of Sex,” respectively. Both will return on July 12 for 12 one-hour episodes.

“Ray Donovan,” starring Liev Schreiber as an “L.A. fixer,” remains Showtime’s highest-rated freshman series ever, with an average 5.3 million weekly viewers in its sophomore year. “Masters of Sex,” starring Michael Sheen and Lizzy Caplan as the famous sex research couple, averaged 3.4 million weekly viewers in its sophomore year. Both series won multiple Emmy nominations.

“Ray Donovan” will feature Ian McShane and Katie Holmes in guest roles this season, with Elliott Gould returning.

“Masters of Sex” moves the narrative forward to 1966, as the Masters & Johnson sex study gains national notoriety.
