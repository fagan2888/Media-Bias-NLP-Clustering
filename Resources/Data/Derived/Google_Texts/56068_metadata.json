You\u2019d think that the Kochs would at least insist that Paul come to the fete to do a dramatic reading of John Galt\u2019s \u201cAtlas Shrugged\u201d speech for the billionaires in attendance, but he didn\u2019t show. Some reports suggest that he was invited, but declined. Perhaps his feelings are hurt that they also invited Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and even Carly Fiorina, when he believes that he should have been anointed by all the rich men in the world by acclamation. He is, after all, the One True Libertarian of the bunch.\n\nOr is he? Paul has been spending so much time in recent days talking about the horrors of Planned Parenthood, you\u2019d think he was a Catholic priest or a member of Ralph Reed\u2019s Bible study group. In fact, both of the Pauls, father and son, have always played fast and loose with their libertarian principles when it comes to reproductive health; the only individual property right they don\u2019t recognize is a woman\u2019s ownership of her own body. Since the followers of the Pauls tend to be those who find such concerns irrelevant to their own freedom \u2014 being that they are mostly young, white males \u2014 that may make some sense from a practical standpoint. Rand has to build a coalition with someone, so why not the religious right, since their main concern in life is keeping women in their place, and the Paulites seem to find this to be a position they can work with.\n\nAnd so it is becoming clear that for all the former Beltway excitement over Paul\u2019s alleged magical ability to transform the Republican Party from it\u2019s aggressively hawkish global ambitions and theocratic, authoritarian domestic aspirations into an isolationist, tolerant, pluralistic party, he just can\u2019t seem to make any headway. He can\u2019t raise much money and nobody, it turns out, is very interested in his ideas.\n\nThus, the true believers are depressed. One of them wrote a piece for Politico about what\u2019s gone wrong, titled, \u201cWhy I\u2019m tired of defending Rand Paul.\u201d The piece was written by Jonathan Bydlak, someone who\u2019s been with the Paul family for years, serving as director of fundraising on Ron\u2019s 2008 campaign; a loyal lieutenant who truly believes that Rand Paul could be president. But unfortunately for Bydlak, it turns out that Rand Paul also believes that, which means that these days he\u2019s acting like just another Republican.\n\nBydlak writes:\n\nAfter months of skepticism of U.S. involvement in Syria and Iraq, Rand Paul called for airstrikes\u2014authorized by Congress. He later sought to \u201cdeclare war\u201d on ISIL and put boots on the ground. He\u2019s done a complete 180 on the threat from Iran, signing the Tom Cotton letter opposing the recent nuclear deal. And while being one of the more nuanced voices opposing the deal, he\u2019s still relied on the sort of fear mongering and misleading rhetoric his father rejected. Ron Paul proudly thumbed his nose at Republican orthodoxy, fearlessly voicing his beliefs no matter how hated his position might make him among the GOP. His son, of course, cannot win a primary by following that exact model. But he has failed to make the Republican base trust him, while risking losing his own. He said gay marriage \u201coffends\u201d him, and called for tent revivals to combat America\u2019s \u201cmoral crisis\u201d while simultaneously supporting ending marriage licenses altogether. He supports lowering sentences for drug offenses, and is publicly courting the marijuana industry, while very consistently making clear he opposes legalization. And in recent weeks, he\u2019s gone so far as to apparently jump onto the Trump bandwagon in seeking to defund \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d He spent months reaching out to minority communities and branding himself as a \u201cdifferent kind of Republican\u201d on police brutality and criminal justice reform\u2014but when Baltimore was burning following Freddie Gray\u2019s suspicious death in police custody, Paul couldn\u2019t have been more tone deaf, scoffing how glad he was his \u201ctrain didn\u2019t stop\u201d in Baltimore, and offering what seemed to be 1990s-era Moral Majority musings on the downfall of the family.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It wasn't too long ago that Rand Paul was viewed as a serious threat to the GOP nomination.
