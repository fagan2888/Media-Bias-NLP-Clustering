The drug has no recognized medical use. Stogner wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s frightening about this emerging street drug is that users themselves may not be aware that they are ingesting it,\u201d Stogner said in a press release. \u201cA patient may report heroin use and have symptoms consistent with heroin overdose, but an emergency physician may find that the standard dose of antidote (naloxone) doesn\u2019t work. Larger or additional doses are necessary when acetyl fentanyl is responsible. It\u2019s never good to lose time between overdose and treatment.\u201d\n\nIn February, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services declared a health advisory after three people died from injecting acetyl fentanyl. Going back to last October, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had to announce a warning about the drug after 14 people died in Rhode Island. Last June, 50 overdoses were recorded in Pennsylvania, along with five non-fatal overdoses.\n\nLike many other designer drugs, especially synthetic weed, the drug gets a pass legally because it contains fentanyl. Manufacturers only have to label it as \u201cnot for human consumption\u201d to keep its analog, containing acetyl, legal.\n\n\u201cClever and well-informed drug distribution networks will likely take advantage of the legal loophole and profit by replacing or cutting a highly-regulated drug with this less regulated one,\u201d Stogner said. \u201cOne of the many downsides of illegal drugs is you just can\u2019t trust your drug dealer. The trend of adulterants being worked into street drugs to make them more potent is dangerous.\u201d\n\nIndeed, this trend has been seen in the past with cocaine, and most recently, with ecstasy, which is frequently mixed with bath salts, jewelry cleaner, or other synthetic cathinones. According to the White House\u2019s website, synthetic drug use has exploded over the last few years. Whereas there were only four new synthetic cathinones in 2009, there were 31 in 2012. Often, the creation of these new compounds outpaces regulation.\n\nSource: Stogner J.
