Again.\n\nThe program, already years behind schedule, won\u2019t be ready for operational testing until mid-2018, a year later than expected, Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, told a House Armed Services Committee subpanel on Wednesday.\n\nRelated: Why the F-35 May Not Be Combat-Ready Until 2022\n\nThe delay is due to a variety of issues, including the jet\u2019s vulnerability to cyber-attacks and a problem with the fifth-generation fighter\u2019s radar software that caused the system to restart once every four hours of flight time.\n\n\u201cWe need the system to be much more stable than that,\u201d according to Gilmore, adding that a reboot once every eight to ten hours would be better.\n\nAir Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the F-35\u2019s program chief, noted \u201cit is not unusual\u201d for legacy aircraft or newer warplanes \u201cevery now and then\u201d to reset systems, or have an automatic reset, within that length of time. \u201cThat is not an uncommon situation,\u201d the three-star said.\n\nThe U.S. Marine Corps declared last July that its version of the F-35 had an initial operational capability and the Air Force plans its F-35 debut by December. However, Gilmore\u2019s testimony clearly indicates that the jet, which has cost nearly $400 billion to develop, would prove of little use if thrown into combat.\n\nRelated: More Bad News for the Snakebit F-35\n\nThe new snag means that the results of the combat testing, which could take about a year to complete and months more to analyze properly, might not be available until 2020, according to Gilmore\u2019s math.\n\nIt isn\u2019t all gloom and despair \u2013 again \u2013 for the F-35. The aircraft is now projected to cost the Defense Department $379 billion or $12.1 billion less than the $391.1 billion forecast last year, according to written testimony by Michael Sullivan, a senior official with U.S. Government Accountability Office.\n\nThe reasons for the new estimate will be disclosed on Thursday as part of the Defense Department\u2019s annual roll out of so-called Selected Acquisition Reports.\n\nRelated: Another F-35 Glitch Requires Restarting the Radar System \u2013 in Flight\n\nThe new price tag isn\u2019t exactly a clear-cut reason for celebration, Sullivan warned.\n\nThe F-35 \u201cstill poses significant affordability challenges for the department and the Congress,\u201d he said, adding the department is expected to spend about $14 billion annually on the effort over the next decade and will average about $13 billion per year over the next 22 years until all planned purchases are complete in 2038.\n\n\u201cThese annual funding challenges will compound as the program begins to stack its funding needs against other large acquisitions, such as the Bomber Program, the Tanker Program that is ongoing, the Ohio Class Submarine Replacement -- the new carrier, and many other very large programs,\u201d according to Sullivan.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The timeline for the long-troubled F-35 Joint Strike Fighter just moved to the right.
