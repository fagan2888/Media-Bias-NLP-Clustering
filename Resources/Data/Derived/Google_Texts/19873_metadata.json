The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which is the Fed's preferred measure, gained 1.7 percent in the 12 months ended in February.\n\nThe core inflation readings exclude food and energy prices. The Fed is targeting a 2 percent core PCE reading.\n\nInflation typically undermines the dollar's strength by diminishing its spending power. Differences in inflation rates between the United States and the euro zone have been the main force behind the dollar's value against the euro since 2000, according to a research report from Fundstrat Global Advisors.\n\nWhile expectations for higher inflation once tended to ramp up bets on a swifter pace of Fed rate hikes and, in turn, boost the dollar, strategists say the perceived improbability of a Fed rate hike until at least June has reinstated inflation\u2019s traditional role of eroding the dollar\u2019s value.\n\n\"If inflation in the U.S. is relatively high, but interest rates aren\u2019t expected to move higher... that doesn\u2019t ultimately bode well for the dollar,\" said Shahab Jalinoos, global head of FX strategy at Credit Suisse in New York.\n\nJalinoos sees the euro hitting $1.17 against the dollar within the next three months. That suggests 2.7 percent more downside for the dollar against the euro.\n\nIan Gordon, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York, says the Fed could wait before hiking rates even if core PCE reached its 2 percent target. He notes Yellen expressed skepticism last month that gains in inflation were sustainable.\n\nA Reuters poll on Friday showed the median expectation among top Wall Street banks that deal directly with the Fed was for a year-end inflation rate of 0.875 percent, implying just two rate hikes this year.\n\nGordon says investors have to be cautious in boosting long-dollar positions \"over the coming months until we get more evidence that the pickup in inflation is sustainable and the Fed is going to respond to it.\"\n\nData from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday showed speculators slashed their bullish bets on the dollar to the lowest in nearly two years.\n\nThe greenback has an advantage over regions such as Europe and Japan, where yields are extremely low given ultra-accommodative monetary policies. U.S. 10-year Treasury notes last yielded 1.73 percent, compared with a 0.10 percent yield for the 10-year German Bund.\n\nBut the dollar has already tumbled this year on traders' views that the Fed would not be able to follow through with the four rate hikes it projected in December. The Fed confirmed traders' skepticism last month by cutting projections to just two rate hikes.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six major currencies, fell 4.1 percent in the first quarter, its biggest quarterly percentage drop in five and a half years.\n\nThomas Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat in New York, says the index would likely fall another 5 percent or so by summer.\n\n\"I do see USD downside,\" Lee said. \"(The Fed) is likely to be very patient\" despite rising inflation.\n\n(Reporting by Sam Forgione; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Currency market strategists are predicting greater weakness in th", "title": "Rising U.S. inflation would take a bite out of the dollar", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/05/Rising-US-inflation-would-take-bite-out-dollar", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/global-forex_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/05/Rising-US-inflation-would-take-bite-out-dollar", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/global-forex_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Currency market strategists are predicting greater weakness in th", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The core inflation readings exclude food and energy prices.\nU.S. inflation has firmed in recent months, with the core Consumer Price Index rising 2.3 percent in the 12 months through February to mark the largest increase since May 2012.\nThe dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six major currencies, fell 4.1 percent in the first quarter, its biggest quarterly percentage drop in five and a half years.\n\"(The Fed) is likely to be very patient\" despite rising inflation.\nThe Fed confirmed traders' skepticism last month by cutting projections to just two rate hikes."}
