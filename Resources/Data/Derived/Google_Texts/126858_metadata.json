Lembo submitted written testimony instead.\n\nHe said the reasons drug prices are rising include market consolidation, new pricing models and \u201coutright profiteering.\u201d\n\n\u201cProjections indicate no future relief as pharmacy costs are expected to continue to rise at an exorbitant rate in the coming years. Meanwhile, pharmaceutical companies are recording historic profits,\u201d Lembo said. \u201cThese drugs \u2013 lifesaving, life-changing medications \u2013 are not yachts, private jets, and other material icons of wealth reserved only for the privileged few.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s hearing was held by the Democratic Steering Committee, a maneuver that allows House Democrats to convene a hearing in a chamber controlled by Republicans.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, is a member of the steering committee. She is also a member of a new Affordable Drug Pricing Task Force created by House Democrats.\n\nAt Wednesday\u2019s hearing, DeLauro lambasted drug companies like Turing Pharmaceuticals, which hiked the price of Daraprim \u2014 a 62-year-old drug that treats rare parasitic infections \u2014 from $13.50 to $750 a pill.\n\nDeLauro also cited the drug pricing practices of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and of Gilead Sciences, a drug company that charges $1,000 a pill for a hepatitis C treatment.\n\n\u201cEvery day we see the threat that spiraling drug costs pose to Medicare, Medicaid and HIV treatments,\u201d DeLauro said.\n\nGilead Sciences did not have an immediate response.\n\nPhRMA, the trade association for the nation\u2019s drug companies, said those concerned about the cost of prescription drugs should look at spending across the health care system \u201cand not just at the share of spending that goes toward life-changing medicines.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew medicines are transforming care for patients fighting debilitating diseases like cancer, hepatitis c, high cholesterol and more,\u201d said PhRMA spokeswoman Holly Campbell. \u201cAt the same time, the share of spending on medicines has been consistent for more than 50 years.\" Campbell said drug companies have been able to hold prices down \u201cdue to a competitive marketplace for medicines where generic utilization rates are high and robust competition among brand name medicines.\u201d\n\nShe also said there should be a greater focus on the high cost sharing required by many insurance companies and restrictions on access to certain drugs by insurers that make certain medicines unaffordable.\n\nDemocrats like Hillary Clinton, her party\u2019s frontrunner for the White House, have seized on the issue of the high cost of drugs, which she says is driving health care costs up and putting needed drugs out to the reach of some patients, even under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHealth insurers have also redoubled their efforts to press Congress to do something about the high cost of drugs.\n\nAfter 18 months of investigation, the Senate Finance Committee issued a report Tuesday that said Gilead Sciences knew its $1,000-a-pill price would put hepatitis C treatment out of reach of many patients and cause \u201cextraordinary problems\u201d for government health programs.\n\n\"This investigation underscores the disconnect between drug company rhetoric and reality,\u201d said America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans President Marilyn Tavenner. \u201cIt's time for drug companies to be held to the same access and affordability standards that apply to the rest of the health system, and that starts with greater transparency in drug pricing.\"\n\nIn his written testimony, Lembo said that as the state comptroller, he administers health benefits for more than 200,000 state and municipal employees, retirees and their dependents.\n\n\u201cThe sharp rise in pharmacy costs comes at a time when we are seeing great success in limiting medical spending by promoting preventive care and chronic disease management through the state\u2019s Health Enhancement Program,\u201d Lembo said. \u201cThe drastic increases in pharmacy costs are undermining our medical cost savings.\u201d\n\nBrian Lehman, head of the pharmacy benefits program of the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System; Jeremy Green, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University; and Lynn Quincy of Consumers Union testified on the impacts of high-cost medicine.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear what steps, if any, Congress can take to slow the rise in pharmaceutical prices. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., backs legislation that would repeal the ban preventing Medicare from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe American Medical Association recently decided to lobby Congress to ban \u201cdirect-to-consumer\u201d drug advertising that urges people to \u201cask their doctor\u201d if a certain drug is right for them.\n\nAMA Board Chair-elect Patrice A. Harris said support for an ad ban \u201creflects concerns among physicians about the negative impact of commercially driven promotions, and the role that marketing costs play in fueling escalating drug prices.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/12/02/lembo-helps-dems-in-d-c-sharpen-attack-on-high-drug-costs/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Washington, Affordable Drug Pricing Task Force, AHIP, AMA, drug pricing, Gilead, Hepatitis C, Hillary Clinton, Kevin Lembo", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/12/02/lembo-helps-dems-in-d-c-sharpen-attack-on-high-drug-costs/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "In testimony Wednesday, Connecticut Comptroller Kevin Lembo joined a growing Democratic attack on high drug prices, an issue expected to be at the center of many Democratic election campaigns next year.", "title": "Lembo helps Dems in D.C. sharpen attack on high drug costs", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/12/02/lembo-helps-dems-in-d-c-sharpen-attack-on-high-drug-costs/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2015/09/Lembo-e1443550971729-1170x1198.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@radelat"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/12/02/lembo-helps-dems-in-d-c-sharpen-attack-on-high-drug-costs/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEvery day we see the threat that spiraling drug costs pose to Medicare, Medicaid and HIV treatments,\u201d DeLauro said.\nArielle Levin Becker / CTMirror.org File PhotoWashington \u2013 Connecticut Comptroller Kevin Lembo has joined a growing Democratic attack on high drug prices, an issue expected to be at the center of many Democratic election campaigns next year.\nAt Wednesday\u2019s hearing, DeLauro lambasted drug companies like Turing Pharmaceuticals, which hiked the price of Daraprim \u2014 a 62-year-old drug that treats rare parasitic infections \u2014 from $13.50 to $750 a pill.\nHealth insurers have also redoubled their efforts to press Congress to do something about the high cost of drugs.\n\u201cIt's time for drug companies to be held to the same access and affordability standards that apply to the rest of the health system, and that starts with greater transparency in drug pricing.\""}
