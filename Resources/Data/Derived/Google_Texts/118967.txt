Story highlights Mississippi Republican Sen. Thad Cochran is endorsing Jeb Bush on Tuesday

The former Florida governor is polling in the low single digits, but he's had establishment support from sitting members of Congress

Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi, is backing Jeb Bush for president, the former Florida governor's campaign is announcing Tuesday.

The endorsement marks Bush's fourth Senate endorsement and 30th total from a member of Congress.

"Jeb Bush is the proven leader the American people need as we face grave threats from abroad and continued economic challenges at home. Jeb is a serious leader with executive experience and a forward-looking vision," said Cochran, who's now in his seventh term in the Senate.

Bush also has support from Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Dean Heller of Nevada, and Susan Collins of Maine. The Republican candidate, who now finds himself in the low-single digits in national polls, leads the GOP presidential field with Senate endorsements, falling just ahead of Sen. Marco Rubio who's backed by three of his colleagues.

Cochran narrowly survived a conservative primary challenge last year by Chris McDaniel. Despite heavy anti-Washington sentiment that rocketed McDaniel to tea party fame, Cochran won a closely-watched runoff in part thanks to Democratic voters who turned out in support of the pragmatic, incumbent senator.
