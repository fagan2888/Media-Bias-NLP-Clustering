His coverage of Hurricane Katrina, the Iraq War, and the 2006 Lebanon War are being called into question. He seems to have a history of conflating, or embellishing, events in his stories. In the case of his Iraq War exploits, it turns out that was a straight up lie. Adding to the awkwardness is this 2004 snippet found by CNSNews.com\u2019s Brittany Hughes, where Williams said at the National Conference of the Society of Professional Journalists that \u201cintegrity\u2026is all we have\u201d as broadcast journalists.\n\nWilliams discusses the painstaking process that is involved in editing a story for live television; it goes through senior editors, writers, and the executive producer who gives it the green light to be read on air.\n\nWhen you create a story at NBC Nightly News\u2013when I sit down to write copy for air, I assign it in the computer a one. It then goes through a series of traps, where writers and senior editors assign it a two, three, four, and then it is \u2018X\u2019d by the executive producer; no item can be read on the air without carrying an \u2018X.\u2019 If it needs to be amended, I go back into the document to see what they\u2019ve done to my\u2026poetry really [laughter], and, but -- I\u2019m joking, but this is how we make sure\u2013and we toil and sometimes argue, and fuss, and fight, over every word that goes out over the air; this is what we do. Talk about integrity, this is all we have.\n\nNow, Mr. Williams surely didn\u2019t exude the same tedious process when it came to guest appearances on talk shows, or interviews with other journalists, where he detailed his past exploits. NBC News executives reportedly told him to quit telling the Chinook story in public, which has since put his career in jeopardy. Oh, and this fish tale was broadcast over live television\u2013and described the incident as \u201cBlack Hawk Down meets Saving Private Ryan.\u201d As for the radio chatter in the Williams video at the time, Travis Tritten of Stars and Stripes said that Williams and his news team held a microphone to the headset \u201cso that they could pick up the radio communications between the company that they were in and another company of Chinooks that was flying a separate mission in the opposite direction. So what you\u2019re hearing is that radio chatter from that other company that was coming under fire.\u201d\n\nAs mentioned in a previous post, Williams\u2019 stories about gangs overrunning his hotel in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina have also been called into question. The former general manager of the Ritz-Carlton hotel Williams stayed in, Myra DeGersdorff, said that there were no floating bodies. She stocked her hotel with medicine, got doctors, and housed some police officers in the some of the 452 rooms available, according to the Washington Post. In short, she was prepared, earning her the Ritz-Carlton President\u2019s Award for her preparations:\n\nDeGersdorff was surprised to flip on the news this week and see a perplexing story about NBC News anchor Brian Williams and the hotel she once managed. His recollection of what happened there didn\u2019t match hers. In interviews that surfaced over the past week that she had never seen, Williams said the hotel was anything but secure. In fact, he told Tom Brokaw last summer, gangs had \u201coverrun\u201d the place. He spoke of seeing a dead body floating past the hotel. Williams also once told a book author that he got dysentery during Katrina. During his stay at the hotel, he said he declined an IV and then \u201chad no medicine, nothing.\u201d \u2026 \u201cMaybe he misremembered,\u201d she told The Post of Williams\u2019s claims. \u201cI\u2019m not going to judge him, because it was such an unpleasant week and there were times to be concerned. \u2026 And when there is that kind of concern, you can misremember. And maybe he was out there, and it wasn\u2019t impossible he could have encountered a body, but I don\u2019t think it was in the French Quarter. The French Quarter only got inches\u201d of flooding.\n\nNow, the New Orleans Advocate did post photos of flooding in the French Quarter by the Ritz, but the depth could not be verified. It was shallow enough to see the sidewalk at the bottom.\n\nSo, is everything that Williams has said a lie? This Chinook story has some people looking back into the 1970s, with some folks in Red Bank, New Jersey challenging the story that the embattled news anchor was held up at gunpoint while delivering Christmas trees.\n\nYeah, it\u2019s come to this. Right now, NBC News is still debating what to do with Williams. As National Review's Eliana Johnson wrote, contingency plans were reportedly discussed, each possibly effecting the network's revenue stream, especially the plan to move Matt Lauer from Today to Nightly News. With Meet the Press and the Today show losing their dominance in the ratings, the piece alleged that NBC News President, Deborah Turness, and Chairwoman of NBC Universal news group, Pat Fili-Krushel, are fearing for their jobs if Nightly News drops to number two in the ratings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oh geez....05/26/2016 1:47:06AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Oh geez...", "title": "Matt Vespa - That Time When Brian Williams Said, 'Integrity...Is All We Have'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/02/10/that-time-when-brian-williams-said-integrityis-all-we-have-n1955469", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/2/10/26.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Oh geez...", "title": "Matt Vespa - That Time When Brian Williams Said, 'Integrity...Is All We Have'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/02/10/that-time-when-brian-williams-said-integrityis-all-we-have-n1955469", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/2/10/26.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "That Time When Brian Williams Said, 'Integrity...Is All We Have', Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4081\"", "article_summary": "The former general manager of the Ritz-Carlton hotel Williams stayed in, Myra DeGersdorff, said that there were no floating bodies.\nIn interviews that surfaced over the past week that she had never seen, Williams said the hotel was anything but secure.\nBrian Williams has had a rough week.\nAdding to the awkwardness is this 2004 snippet found by CNSNews.com\u2019s Brittany Hughes, where Williams said at the National Conference of the Society of Professional Journalists that \u201cintegrity\u2026is all we have\u201d as broadcast journalists.\nWilliams also once told a book author that he got dysentery during Katrina."}
