Not so fast.\n\nIt seems that truth is not so simple anymore, despite the fact that so many people, so many voters wish it were so.\n\nA recent Non Sequitur cartoon in the Austin American-Statesman shows a long line of people going to an \u201canswers\u201d booth. To the left is the sign \u201csimple but wrong\u201d. To the right is \u201ccomplex but right\u201d.\n\nSurprising, but true. Most of the people in the cartoon strip are heading to the \u201csimple but wrong\u201d side, while only one or two take the \u201ccomplex but right\u201d side.\n\nAnd so it seems to be in politics, in education, in world policies, in our healthcare.\n\nNothing is simple anymore \u2013 and probably never was.\n\nWhen looking at politics, take the recent Sarah Palin endorsement of Donald Trump. Both of these politicians espouse \u201csimple, black-and-white\u201d answers. Their supporters want an easy answer to a very complex world.\n\nCertainly, Palin\u2019s recent speech fit the bill. Her bizarre speech, which included made up words, was simply a bit incoherent and didn\u2019t follow a theme. It was just a bunch of sayings thrown together.\n\n\u201cQuit footin\u2019 the bill for these nations who are oil-rich,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re paying for some of their squirmishes that have been going on for centuries.\u201d (Yes, she said squirmishes.)\n\nWell, if that doesn\u2019t say simple, does Trump\u2019s idea that he is going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it sound any better?\n\nSimple sayings that rally their supporters but mean nothing in the real world \u2013 that\u2019s the drivel that voters are being fed.\n\nJeb Bush has tried to give more complex answers, but, by and far, he has been pushed by the wayside as Trump and Ted Cruz, who also speaks in one-line quotables without anything behind them, take over the top spots.\n\nIs it better on the Democratic side? To a bit, but the real person who spoke in complex truths \u2013 Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley has all but dropped out \u2013 or rather been dumped out \u2013 of the race. Bernie Sanders has some ideas that make for good sound tracks, and Hillary Clinton is just too complex, for the most part, for the wide range of voters.\n\nBecause they all want simple, black-and-white answers.\n\nMove on to science and medicine and vaccinations and more.\n\nObamacare? It\u2019s complex. Period. Who ever said that trying to cover everyone in this country would be easy? It takes a lot of people working together on actuarials, putting together a lot of numbers to make this work.\n\nBut too many politicians promise that they will \u201cget rid of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nOkaaayyy ... And they will replace it with what?\n\nObamacare has opened up healthcare to more people than ever before. Yes, prices continue to go up. But they are leveling out. According to the Health Research Institute, U.S, medical inflation is expected to drop to 6.5 percent in 2016. While still an increase, it is much less than the high-inflation medical years before 2012.\n\nThere is no easy answer, just a complex system that seems to be oh-so-slowly working.\n\nMove on to the world stage and we get people putting their heads in the sand, trying to avoid the truth that refugees are fleeing Syria.\n\nAgain, it is not a simple answer. There is constant fighting, with ordinary people caught in the middle, only wanting a better life for their children.\n\nThey want jobs, a home, food, education. It\u2019s what everyone wants.\n\nBut the answer to how to solve this world crisis is difficult. Europe is being inundated with refugees. Denmark is instituting a policy of taking some of the funds and property that refugees bring into its country to try to stem the tide and discourage more people from coming there.\n\nTurkey, Greece, Italy, Germany, Sweden ... look at any country in the path of Syrian refugees and you will see that they are talking about how they can help the refugees, protect their country\u2019s economy, and figure out a way to get Syria under control and more.\n\nComplex issues require complex solutions.\n\nSo, the next time you tell someone to just give you the simple answer, figure on a long explanation.\n\nThe world is inter-connected these days, our lives are part of a bigger picture.\n\nThere are not simple truths. There are complex problems.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "description": "Hays Free Press News | View Hays County's best local news online", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "www.haysfreepress.com", "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "7 days", "keywords": "HaysFreePress | Hays Free Press", "email": "news@haysfreepress.com", "viewport": "width=100%, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The number of times people say to us, \u201cThe simple truth is ...\u201dWhoa.\nSo, the next time you tell someone to just give you the simple answer, figure on a long explanation.\nIt seems that truth is not so simple anymore, despite the fact that so many people, so many voters wish it were so.\nAgain, it is not a simple answer.\nSimple sayings that rally their supporters but mean nothing in the real world \u2013 that\u2019s the drivel that voters are being fed."}
