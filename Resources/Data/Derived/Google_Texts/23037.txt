The Washington Free Beacon’s Ellison Barber joined The Blaze TV’s “Real News” Thursday to discuss potential “Black Swan” moments for China in 2014, saying that a more powerful ASEAN (The Association of South East Asian Nations) could curtail China should the regional power step out of line.

Said Barber, “There have been steps taken to deal with China. I think of ASEAN…which the State Department has ramped up efforts since 2009 to make a stronger organization.”

If ASEAN acts like the European Union, Barber said, it would be an organization “better suited to deal with China should they step out of line. I see that as an area where there may be a Black Swan, but they’re building up a mechanism to potentially deal with it.”
