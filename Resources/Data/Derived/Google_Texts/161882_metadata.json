John Blake, writing at CNN, claims that \u201cThis may be President Obama\u2019s time, but it\u2019s still Ronald Reagan\u2019s era.\u201d\n\nYes, Ronald Reagan, the guy Republicans most like to lie about, when they\u2019re not lying about Obama. Who could ever forget, as Scott Walker has reminded us, how Reagan ended the Cold War by busting not the Bolsheviks, but unions? Or Sarah Palin sodomizing his legacy on his 100th birthday?\n\nBlake ignores uncongenial facts and instead argues that,\n\nObama has helped negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, normalized relations with Cuba, and watched his approval ratings recently hit a two-year high after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Obamacare. But has he become a \u201ctransformational\u201d president like Ronald Reagan?\n\nThen, to illustrate his complete lack of bias, Blake cites Tom Nichols, a political blogger and author of a column \u201cFantasyland: Obama Is No Ronald Reagan\u201c: \u201cHe\u2019s simply plowing the ground Reagan cleared 30 years ago.\u201d\n\nIn a sense, you have to admit Nichols has a point: We are still trying to dig ourselves out of the mess Reagan made of the country. As far as being no Ronald Reagan, we can be thankful for that. This is a man about whom actor James Garner said,\n\nI was a vice president of the Screen Actors Guild when he was its president. My duties consisted of attending meetings and voting. The only thing I remember is that Ronnie never had an original thought and that we had to tell him what to say. That\u2019s no way to run a union, let along a state or a country.\u201d\n\nAs for Barack Obama, Garner said, Adlai Stevenson was \u201cthe most intelligent presidential candidate we\u2019ve ever had. I think Obama runs a close second.\u201d\n\nSo perhaps the question should be less one of \u201cCan Obama hold Reagan\u2019s jock-strap\u201d to one of \u201cCan a political meatpuppet be a transformational president\u201d?\n\nThat depends on how you define \u201ctransformational.\u201d Blake is using it as a positive, but isn\u2019t destruction also transformational? In that sense, George W. Bush, another political meatpuppet, is transformational. He destroyed Iraq, and very nearly his own country at the same time, bringing the world\u2019s economy crashing down for good measure.\n\nBlake claims that four things define transformational presidents (technically, riding a velociraptor while slaughtering America\u2019s enemies is not one of them):\n\n\n\nThey change the conversation: \u201cThe country is a different place after they leave the office.\u201d To make his point, Blake invents a few \u201cfacts\u201d about St. Ronnie:\n\n\u201cReagan helped tilt the nation away from FDR\u2019s New Deal in a way that no president had done before, historians say. When Reagan declared in his inaugural speech that government wasn\u2019t the solution but the problem \u2014 and backed it up with small-government, anti-tax policies \u2014 he took on FDR.\u201d\n\nHow is this possible when Reagan raised taxes 11 times from 1981 to 1989 and actually grew the size of government? Fact: Obama in 2011 had 273,000 fewer federal employees than Reagan. Far from cutting the size of government, he added a new department \u2013 Veterans\u2019 Affairs \u2013 and increased defense spending. Reagan, compared to Obama, was a \u201ctax and spend liberal\u201d out of Republican nightmares.\n\nYet Blake cites Charles Gallagher, a sociologist at La Salle University in Pennsylvania: \u201cHe single-handedly defined government as something that was bad.\u201d Yes, it was so bad that we needed more of it.\n\nTransformational presidents deliver great lines: Because President Obama hasn\u2019t said something as catchy as \u201cMr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\u201d Never mind that somebody as intellectually vapid as the Reagan Garner depicts could never have come up with that himself. Reagan, Blake says, was dubbed \u201c\u2018The Great Communicator.\u2019 But what about Obama? Any memorable words?\u201d Blake can\u2019t think of any. But then, Obama has original \u201cbig syllable\u201d thoughts of his own and isn\u2019t an actor playing a part (take that, Jeb).\n\nTransformational presidents poach followers from the enemy camp: \u201cReagan was a master at persuading people who didn\u2019t normally vote Republican to vote for him in such great numbers that a new term was invented: Reagan Democrats.\u201d\n\nBlake cites Jennifer Walsh, a political science professor at Azusa Pacific University in California as saying \u201cThere is no such thing as an Obama Republican.\u201d Well, a very good reason for this is that Obama is black, and the Republican Party is driven by high levels of racism and guided by Fox News, factors that would preclude Republicans becoming supporters of the \u201canti-colonialist Kenyan Muslims terrorist sympathizer\u201d that is Obama. This is not a fair comparison at all.\n\nRemember, when Obama outperformed Reagan on the economy? Fox News immediately cried, \u201cBenghazi!\u201d They didn\u2019t mention the economy.\n\nTransformational presidents become beloved figures: Reagan, Blake says, \u201cbecame one of the nation\u2019s most beloved presidents because people simply liked him. Even his enemies responded to Reagan\u2019s geniality.\u201d Well, meatpuppet. Yet even Reagan blogger Nichols admits that Obama could cure cancer and people wouldn\u2019t like him.\n\nBlake argues that \u201cReagan made conservative cool. He strengthened the Republican Party.\u201d I don\u2019t know about that. Bill Maher compared JFK to James Bond, while Reagan is Matlock. We might be defining \u201ccool\u201d differently, or perhaps Republicans just don\u2019t know what \u201ccool\u201d is.\n\nObama \u201chowever, doesn\u2019t fire up the Democratic base like Reagan did his party, some historians say.\u201d Right. He didn\u2019t fire it up enough to win two elections. Blake says Sanders and Warren are better at firing up the Democratic base. Only problem here is that neither of them have become president yet, so they\u2019re not really part of the conversation, however much you may like them. And, after all, Trump fires up the Republican base. So let\u2019s leave non-presidents out of it.\n\nWhat is interesting is that as Blake makes this claim about how well loved Reagan was compared to Obama, Obama has become more popular than Bush and equal to Reagan, and he has a far-better sense of humor. Sorta takes the wind out of your sails, doesn\u2019t it, Mr. Blake? And let\u2019s not forget that Reagan\u2019s memory is so blessed in California that they set his statue on fire. It\u2019s all the rage today in expressing love.\n\nBlake lists his four transformational qualities, but I wonder if giving America a persecution complex and victim mentality is also a transformational quality? Or how about Reagan welcoming religious conservatives into government by telling them he was one of them, pushing creationism not only as governor of California but as president? That\u2019s pretty transformational too.\n\nI wrote yesterday of the Republican war on science. It was Reagan who made this \u201ccool\u201d too: \u201cThey say the world has become too complex for simple answers. They are wrong. I say there are simple answers to our problems and they are found within the covers of the Bible.\u201d\n\nSimple answers for a simple man.\n\nThat is the Reagan legacy. If Reagan is going to be called transformational, we are going to have to take the bad with the good, and there is a lot of bad, even by Republican standards, if they would only admit to the historical Reagan, and forget the Reagan of their dreams.\n\nReagan velociraptor by SharpWriter at DeviantArt, shared under Creative Commons.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CNN showed its Fox News side in unfavorably comparing Obama to a Reagan who never existed, claiming Reagan is a transformational president", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "CNN showed its Fox News side in unfavorably comparing Obama to a Reagan who never existed, claiming Reagan is a transformational president", "title": "CNN Tells us that Obama is No Reagan, Like it's a Bad Thing", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/07/21/cnn-tells-obama-reagan-bad.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-18-at-12.46.06-PM-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-21T08:00:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-07-21T08:00:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-21T08:00:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c21\"", "article_summary": "Transformational presidents become beloved figures: Reagan, Blake says, \u201cbecame one of the nation\u2019s most beloved presidents because people simply liked him.\nBut has he become a \u201ctransformational\u201d president like Ronald Reagan?\nAs far as being no Ronald Reagan, we can be thankful for that.\nThat depends on how you define \u201ctransformational.\u201d Blake is using it as a positive, but isn\u2019t destruction also transformational?\nTransformational presidents deliver great lines: Because President Obama hasn\u2019t said something as catchy as \u201cMr."}
