Officials have asked the legislature\u2019s Joint Budget Committee for $700,000 to hire a contracted doctor and four staff members, including two nurses.\n\nColorado is one of only 10 states without a medical director overseeing the foster care system.\n\nRising numbers of foster children nationwide are prescribed potent psychotropic medications because of behavioral problems, anxiety and depression, often brought on by trauma in their lives. Child advocates have called for fewer drugs and more therapy to treat the root cause of the children\u2019s behavioral problems.\n\nCritics say that few studies have examined side effects on children and that heavy doses make kids seem detached and sedated.\n\nAbout 4,300 of Colorado\u2019s 16,800 foster children were prescribed psychotropic drugs in 2012, according to a University of Colorado analysis released to The Denver Post under open-records laws and published in \u201cPrescription Kids,\u201d an investigative series in April. Among teens in foster care, 37 percent were prescribed psychotropic drugs.\n\nFoster children were prescribed the mood-altering drugs at a rate five times greater than other children in the Medicaid system, the study found.\n\nAnother study found that one-fourth of children in Colorado\u2019s foster care system were taking four or more mental health drugs at one time, above the average of nine states included in the 2011 study by Medicaid Medical Directors.\n\nIn their budget request, Colorado child welfare officials listed three reasons for the high prevalence of psychotropic drug use among foster kids, all of which a medical director could investigate, they said.\n\nCounty child welfare departments have the advice of only the prescribing physician or psychiatrist when trying to determine whether foster children are taking appropriate medications or doses, the request said. Also, officials are concerned that children in rural Colorado are taking psychotropic medications because there is limited access to mental health treatment.\n\nAnd, the request said, it\u2019s possible children who have been abused or neglected are receiving mental health drugs to treat the symptoms of the trauma.\n\nThe medical director would have the authority to examine child case files, draft policies regarding psychotropic medications and act as a consultant to county caseworkers.\n\n\u201cCaseworkers aren\u2019t necessarily trained medical professionals, so to be able to have that higher level of consultation is really important,\u201d said Julie Krow, director of the Office of Children, Youth and Families in the Colorado Department of Human Services. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense not to have a medical director who can advise us about best practices.\u201d\n\nThe medical director would not have as much authority as in some states, where the director can approve or reject prescriptions for children. The director could start July 1 if the budget request is approved, Krow said.\n\nStephanie Villafuerte, executive director of the Rocky Mountain Children\u2019s Law Center, called the request \u201cbold and necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope this proposal garners support in the legislature quickly, because our kids cannot wait,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we discuss this issue, too many kids will continue to be prescribed inappropriate medications in unacceptable doses.\u201d\n\nConcerns about use of psychotropic medications within the Colorado youth corrections system were revealed in a state audit in August.\n\nAuditors found that in some cases, corrections staff members did not obtain consent to prescribe psychotropic drugs to youths in custody. Also, there was \u201calmost no evidence\u201d in many cases studied that corrections medical staffers monitored teens\u2019 blood pressure, weight or heart rate after changing doses of medication, which is the national standard.\n\nThe child welfare department\u2019s request includes $150,000 to study what general medical needs are lacking for children and teens in foster care and youth corrections.\n\nIt also seeks $35,000 to link the computer systems used by child welfare and the state Medicaid office so child protection workers can see insurance claims for medical treatment and psychotropic medications for children under their care.\n\nThe lack of a bridge between those two computer systems \u201cmakes it a cumbersome and inaccurate process\u201d for caseworkers to figure out what medications foster children are taking, the request says.\n\nThe legislature\u2019s budget committee is expected to hear the request next week.\n\nJennifer Brown: 303-954-1593, jenbrown@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jbrowndpost\n\nPrescriptions\n\nA CU study found that foster children in the state were prescribed psychotropic drugs at a rate five times greater than other children in the Medicaid system in 2012. Children 5 and younger were more than four times likelier to be given the drugs.\n\n\u2022 Percent of foster children on psychotropics: 4.9% ages 5 and under; 24.3% ages 6-11; 37.6% ages 12-17; and 25.7% ages 17 and under\n\n\u2022 Percent of nonfoster children on psychotropics: 1.0% ages 5 and under; 5.5% ages 6-11; 8.5% ages 12-17; and 4.5% ages 17 and under\n\nSource: CU\n\nPRESCRIPTION KIDS: Read the Denver Post special report on use of psychotropic drugs in the Colorado foster care system.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado may appoint doctor to oversee foster kids\u2019 prescriptions", "title": "Colorado may appoint doctor to oversee foster kids\u2019 prescriptions", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/12/colorado-may-appoint-doctor-to-oversee-foster-kids-prescriptions/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141212__cdxxFOSTER_HHR_1349p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141212__cdxxFOSTER_HHR_1349p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-12T11:48:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:54:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7c9\"", "article_summary": "PRESCRIPTION KIDS: Read the Denver Post special report on use of psychotropic drugs in the Colorado foster care system.\nColorado is one of only 10 states without a medical director overseeing the foster care system.\nRising numbers of foster children nationwide are prescribed potent psychotropic medications because of behavioral problems, anxiety and depression, often brought on by trauma in their lives.\nAuditors found that in some cases, corrections staff members did not obtain consent to prescribe psychotropic drugs to youths in custody.\nAbout 4,300 of Colorado\u2019s 16,800 foster children were prescribed psychotropic drugs in 2012, according to a University of Colorado analysis released to The Denver Post under open-records laws and published in \u201cPrescription Kids,\u201d an investigative series in April."}
