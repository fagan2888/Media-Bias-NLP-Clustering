The processional was led by Saanya Kwaan, the Cape Fox dancers, and by now the Sealaska\u2019s biennial Celebration is in full tilt.\n\nSponsored by the Sealaska Heritage Institute, it\u2019s the largest cultural event in Alaska, according to KTOO News radio. Its sole purpose is to bring together multiple generations of Tlingit, Haida and Tsimshian people together to celebrate their culture.\n\nThe kickoff event was the June 11 awards ceremony for Sealaska\u2019s Juried Art Show and Competition, at which Tlingit carver and artist Wayne Price of Haines won the top award, Best of Show, for his Dancing Raven Hat, a painted hat of red cedar and otter fur, KTOO reported.\n\nCelebration has been held every two years since 1982, and it draws much more than Native Alaskans. There were people like Patricia McGraw and her husband Gary, who came all the way from Pensacola, Florida just to attend, KTOO reported.\n\n\u201cWhen I was young the Native traditions were totally disrespected,\u201d said McGraw, who is non-Native, to KTOO. \u201cAnd you know kids knew. I was told not to play with the Native kids. But kids know what\u2019s right, what\u2019s wrong, and I\u2019ve always felt quite strongly that they needed their traditions and we needed to honor their traditions.\u201d\n\nThe finale on Saturday June 14 offers a full day of dancers, a parade and of course the Grand Exit. And for those who are far-flung and could not get up to Alaska as McGraw did, the events are being livestreamed online at the website 369north.org.
