According to RGH Spokeswoman Amber Hamilton, they plan to complete the necessary changes within the next six months.\n\nRGH staff said the change is much more than an expensive program; patients will get to reap the benefits too.\n\nDirector of Nursing Services Mercedes Lopez, a member of the core team to launch the program, said the goal is to connect all components of the hospital to the patients. About 1,200 patients have been registered in the system since its inception, according to Lopez.\n\nHere are a few highlights of the new system RGH staff say will benefit patients and streamline hospital visits:\n\n\u2022 Faster service\n\nHamilton said when patient information is first put into the system, a profile is created. From that point on, patients will only have to verify information instead of going through a tedious sign-in process.\n\nThe RGH community will have access to the same files, according to Lopez. For example, if a patient is seen at the clinic and then admitted to the hospital, doctors in the hospital will have access to the same files and won\u2019t have to ask patients repetitive questions.\n\n\u201cIt helps the duplication process go faster,\u201d Lopez said.\n\n\u2022 Patient safety\n\nWith doctors and staff having the same patient information, Hamilton said this reduces chances of error in subjects such as allergies and medicine information. She said patients can often forget what medications they are taking or the allergies they have.\n\n\u201cIt ensures safety so you don\u2019t repeat or miss anything,\u201d Hamilton said.\n\n\u2022 Access\n\nPatients will have access to their electronic charts and be able to view all of their results and documents online. Lopez said patient-access will keep patients in the loop and will allow patients to review their medical records at any time.\n\n\u2022 Security\n\nThough most of RGH staff will have access to the system, Lopez said there are many security checks in the system to ensure only the right doctors have access to patient information. The system\u2019s information is backed up in another state to ensure its safety.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Portales News-Tribune", "description": "By Christina Calloway PNT senior writer ccalloway@pntonline.com As part of a federal mandate of the Affordable Care Act, Roosevelt General Hospital installed a new patient registration system that is completely electronic in late-January.
