The directors also must deal with pressure on spending.\n\nMark Trail, a former Medicaid director for Georgia, said, \u201cJerry will be very hard to replace.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe proved himself both a competent clinician, as well as a thoughtful and deliberate business manager,\u201d said Trail, managing principal at Health Management Associates in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cThe job entails both some measure of clinical and policy competence, but also a very strong understanding of costs and cost drivers,\u201d Trail said. \u201cAll of this is mixed with the political overlay that a Medicaid director has to deal with.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s Medicaid rolls have increased recently, even though Georgia is not one of the states that have expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act. One reason is that many Georgians who were already eligible were enrolled in Medicaid during the ACA exchange enrollment process.\n\nMatt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, said Monday that Dubberly has been \u201ca very, very good Medicaid director\u201d and also has served well as a member of the national organization\u2019s board.\n\nThe job as Medicaid director, Salo said, \u201cis to provide the best possible health care to as many people as possible under unrelenting budgetary constraints.\u201d\n\nThe average tenure of a state Medicaid director is about two years, Salo added. Dubberly has served for six years.\n\nDubberly, a native of Jesup, is a pharmacist, and previously served in a Medicaid pharmacy benefits management post.\n\nEnjoy Georgia Health News?
