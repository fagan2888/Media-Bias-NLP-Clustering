I would love to see them get back together.\u201d\n\nOne thing that is reportedly holding Bruce back is his reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians. A report in the Examiner claims that Bruce and Kris will probably wait until the end of the show to divorce. That would make the divorce less of a public mess and could simplify money issues as well.\n\nKeeping Up With The Kardashians will last until at least 2015. It\u2019s unclear if Kim or the rest of the family will try to extend their contract past 2015.\n\nKris and Bruce Jenner may be waiting to officially file the papers but according to son Brody the two are basically divorced already. Kris currently lives in Calabasas and Bruce has been living in Malibu,\n\nIf Kris and Bruce really do divorce they\u2019ll have to split up their multi-million dollar fortune. Bruce Jenner is reportedly worth more than $100 million while Kris Jenner adds another $20 million to the table. Kris and Bruce were married in 1991. It\u2019s unclear if they have any sort of pre-nuptial agreement.\n\n[Image Via s_bukley / Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bruce Jenner is reportedly ready to end his 22 year marriage to his wife Kris.
