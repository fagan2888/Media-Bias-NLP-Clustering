Finkenauer will lead a team of organizers and volunteers in raising awareness about family economic issues in the months prior to the Iowa caucus such as equal pay, affordable child care, paid parental leave, and earned sick days.\n\n\u201cMake It Work is highlighting examples from Iowa families every single day and I\u2019m excited to be part of the campaign,\u201d said Finkenauer.\n\n\u201cMost Presidential candidates and elected officials pay lip service to the idea that our economy needs to work for everyday Iowans, and we will work every day to make sure they hear from moms like Katie Rock, who was only able to spend two weeks at home with her prematurely born baby; or dads like Detavious Smith, whose child care costs are more than $1200 per month. For families in Iowa and across the country, we need our leaders to know that words aren\u2019t enough. If we claim to stand for family values, we need policies that truly value families.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to have a state leader like Representative Finkenauer on board,\u201d said Tracy Sturdivant, Co-Founder of Make It Work. \u201cHer leadership in the legislature on family economic issues and her ability to take our efforts statewide make her a valuable part of the team in Iowa and nationally.\u201d\n\nMake it Work is a national, nonprofit campaign working to advance economic security for women, men and families across the country. We are a community of women and men who share the belief that hardworking Americans shouldn\u2019t have to choose between being there for family and earning a living.
