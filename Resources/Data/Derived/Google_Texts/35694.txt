Pictures of the suspects charged in last Thursday's mass shooting at Cornell Square Park are put on display during a press conference at police headquarters on September 24, 2013 in Chicago, Illinois. The four men charged are Kewane Gatewood, 20, Bryon Champ, 21, Brad Jett, 22, and Tabari Young, 22. Police believe the shooting was carried out in retaliation for an unreported shooting earlier in the day when Champ received a graze wound. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)
