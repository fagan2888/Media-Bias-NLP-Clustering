More than 2,000 runners took part in Friday morning's Color Run at Pier Park.

The Color Run is known as the "happiest 5K on the planet." It gives runners the chance to enjoy a course that's creative and imaginative.

The run featured red, white and blue color zones in honor of America's birthday and veterans.

"Well it's part of my job to be fit at all times so I did't really train up for it I just am in that shape, what do you do for a living,I'm in the army," Erin Engelhardt said.

The color run kicked off the 4th of July Star Spangled Spectacular, a weekend long series of festivities in Panama City Beach.
