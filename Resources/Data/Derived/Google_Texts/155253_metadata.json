Others said it\u2019s too provocative for the public.\n\n\n\nBanned billboard Sacramento International Airport Photos The banned billboard (June 12, 2014) Courtesy photo\n\nEither way, a controversial billboard has been banned from the Sacramento International Airport.\n\n\n\nView the banned billboard\n\n\"The Capitol feels like it was fine but the airport feels like it\u2019s too controversial,\" said Daniel Zingale, senior vice president of the California Endowment. \"So, we are mystified.\"\n\n\n\nWatch report: Controversial billboard banned from Sacramento International\n\nBusy travelers at the airport's Terminal B might not even know there\u2019s anything missing, but a black canvas near Gate 18 is now a placeholder for the banned ad, which featured undocumented immigrants promoting health care for all.\n\n\n\n\"Thousands of versions of this ad have run all over the place,\" Zingale said. \"It is the first time we have ever run into resistance.\"\n\n\n\nThe resistance is because the billboard violates the airport\u2019s advertising display policy.\n\n\n\nAirport officials declined to be interviewed on camera, but in a statement sent to KCRA 3, they said, \"In-terminal advertising at Sacramento International Airport is managed by Clear Channel Airports under a contract with the Sacramento County Department of Airports. The California Endowment ad was declined because it did not meet the advertising display policy set forth in the agreement we established with Clear Channel, which requires that under no circumstances shall advertising be displayed that would 'involve the country or the airport in controversial, social, moral, political or ethical issues.'\"\n\n\n\nThe folks from California Endowment, a nonprofit health foundation, were stunned their ad was rejected, despite a $40,000, three-year contract for ad space at the airport.\n\n\n\n\"Ads like this have run in convenience stores and small markets and laundromats,\" Zingale said. \"They have been on billboards all over the state.\"\n\n\n\nThe group also has placed similar ads on TV.\n\n\n\nBut placing messages like that at the airport is a different matter.\n\n\n\nTravelers seemed surprised by the ban \u2013 and confused by the replacement ad.\n\n\n\n\"And the thing I don\u2019t understand is, it just says 'health for all.' Great, where is it?\" said Kathy Posey, a traveler from Marysville. \"I think it should be put up so people are informed. That doesn\u2019t inform me of anything.\"\n\n\n\nJerry Adamson of Portland, Maine, concurred.\n\n\n\n\"It should be there because it\u2019s a free country,\" he said. \"This country was founded under God, you know. It\u2019s supposed to be a free country.\"\n\n\n\nUndocumented immigrants can receive emergency care, but under the Affordable Care Act, they are not eligible to receive benefits through Covered California.\n\n\n\nThe state\u2019s health care exchange is available only for legal residents of the United States.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Thu, 12 Jun 2014 20:21:30 PDT", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Mike Luery", "og": {"site_name": "KCRA", "description": "A controversial billboard has been banned from the Sacramento International Airport.", "title": "Controversial billboard banned from Sac airport", "url": "http://www.kcra.com/news/controversial-billboard-banned-from-sac-airport/26467870", "image": "http://www.kcra.com/image/view/-/26468760/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/p3i89u/-/replacement-ad-img-061214.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.kcra.com/news/controversial-billboard-banned-from-sac-airport/26467870", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "kcra://content/article/26467870", "iphone": "kcra://content/article/26467870", "googleplay": "kcra://content/article/26467870"}, "name": {"ipad": "kcra", "iphone": "kcra", "googleplay": "kcra"}, "id": {"ipad": 505581274, "iphone": 505581274, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}}, "site": "@kcranews", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "kcra://content/article/26467870", "app_name": "kcra", "package": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}, "ios": {"url": "kcra://content/article/26467870", "app_store_id": 505581274, "app_name": "kcra"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 102798321191}, "keywords": "Sacramento International Airport, controversial airport ad, Affordable Care Act, health care, health for all, Clear Channel, travelers, Mike Luery, kcra, kcra3, kcra 3, kcra news, kcra channel, kcra.com", "google-site-verification": "lseesGPufjGiNJ4blx9-qW5A0JKGfgPc9Mw6RTc9Ulo", "news_keywords": "Sacramento International Airport, controversial airport ad, Affordable Care Act, health care, health for all, Clear Channel, travelers, Mike Luery, kcra, kcra3, kcra 3, kcra news, kcra channel, kcra.com", "description": "A controversial billboard has been banned from the Sacramento International Airport."}, "article_summary": "Banned billboard Sacramento International Airport Photos The banned billboard (June 12, 2014) Courtesy photoEither way, a controversial billboard has been banned from the Sacramento International Airport.\nThe state\u2019s health care exchange is available only for legal residents of the United States.\nView the banned billboard\"The Capitol feels like it was fine but the airport feels like it\u2019s too controversial,\" said Daniel Zingale, senior vice president of the California Endowment.\nThe resistance is because the billboard violates the airport\u2019s advertising display policy.\nWatch report: Controversial billboard banned from Sacramento InternationalBusy travelers at the airport's Terminal B might not even know there\u2019s anything missing, but a black canvas near Gate 18 is now a placeholder for the banned ad, which featured undocumented immigrants promoting health care for all."}
