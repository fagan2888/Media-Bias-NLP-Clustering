He has a deep background in policy. He is smart as a whip. He is plenty tough. And he is conservative, but he\u2019s not angry about it.\n\nBut, to be honest, I don\u2019t know what \u201cright to rise\u201d means.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf you have to take more than 10 seconds to explain your campaign slogan, you need to change it.\n\nI get what he is trying to say, I think. Folks in the middle class have a right to rise to the upper class. Or does he mean that people in the lower class have a right to rise to the middle class? Or maybe he means that the folks in the lower class have a right to rise to the upper class.\n\nIt could be he is talking about incomes and how they have a right to rise, although that would be really bad economic policy. There\u2019s no sure thing in this world.\n\nIn any event, Bush needs a campaign slogan that actually says something that makes visceral sense to the vast majority of the American people. \u201cRight to rise\u201d sounds to me like a jingle for a bread maker.\n\nRonald Reagan had a great slogan: \u201cPeace through strength.\u201d It said something that the American people could understand, especially in comparison to the disastrous years of Jimmy Carter\u2019s administration.\n\nBarack Obama had a good one, too with \u201cChange you can believe in.\u201d Voters, amid a market meltdown and the long and increasingly unpopular Iraq War, wanted the country to go in a completely different direction, not more of the same.\n\nBill Clinton hit the nail on the head with \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d George H.W. Bush was overly focused on the end of the Cold War, and didn\u2019t have much of a domestic agenda. Clinton hit him hard at his weakest point by focusing like a laser beam on jobs and economic growth, which was nicely summed up in his slogan.\n\nA good campaign slogan says more about the desires of the voters than it does about the candidate.\n\nHerbert Hoover offered a \u201cchicken in every pot and a car in every garage.\u201d\n\nWarren Harding promised a \u201creturn to normalcy\u201d after the tumult of World War I.\n\nFDR promised \u201cHappy days are here again,\u201d a campaign slogan that offered hope during the depths of the Depression.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s \u201cright to rise\u201d is consistent with his family\u2019s tradition of reforming Republicanism. The first President Bush promised a \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d America, a response, I suppose, to Reagan\u2019s unkind and rough era. The second Bush offered \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d because he believed that conservatives aren\u2019t all that compassionate on their own.\n\nBut in the post-Obama age, the American people won\u2019t need a muted, diluted and mealy-mouthed response to the vacillation, weakness, second-guessing and malaise of the eight years under his administration. It needs a full-throated, vibrant and clear defense of our American values and our American way of life.\n\nWe don\u2019t need more hand-wringing. We need more leadership.\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t need more introspection. It needs a kick in the pants.\n\nAnd the world doesn\u2019t need America to be just one of the gang, just another country that is one of many in the United Nations. The world needs America to be the last true and best hope of Western civilization, a bulwark against dictators and a defender of freedom and our way of life.\n\nIf Jeb Bush wants to win the White House, he should offer a bigger, bolder message that will make the American people feel good about being American again.\n\n\u201cRight to rise\u201d just doesn\u2019t cut it.\n\nFeehery is president of QGA Public Affairs and blogs at www.thefeeherytheory.com.
