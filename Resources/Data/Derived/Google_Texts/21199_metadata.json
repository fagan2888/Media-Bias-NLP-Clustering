Yes, but that ignores his first 13 months in office and a net loss of public sector jobs. Total employment growth during his time in office is about 6.4 million.\n\nObama also boasted that \u201cmore of our people are insured than ever before.\u201d But that\u2019s based on an administration analysis that compares the second quarter of 2014 to years past. We don\u2019t have the full 2014 federal numbers yet.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe president delivered his sixth State of the Union address at a joint session of Congress on Jan. 20. But it was his first under a Congress controlled by Republicans. Much of his speech was devoted to the improving economy.\n\nManufacturing Jobs\n\nObama made the inflated claim that \u201cmore than half of manufacturing executives have said they\u2019re actively looking to bring jobs back from China.\u201d\n\nThe president was referring to an August 2014 survey of 252 senior manufacturing executives in the U.S. conducted by the Boston Consulting Group. But the survey\u2019s findings don\u2019t exactly back up the president\u2019s claim.\n\nWhile 54 percent of those surveyed \u201cexpressed interest in reshoring,\u201d only 16 percent said they are \u201calready bringing production back from China to the United States,\u201d a 20 percent increase from the 2013 survey. And 20 percent of those polled said that \u201cthey would consider returning production in the near future,\u201d up 24 percent from 2013.\n\nObama also said that since 2010 \u201c[o]ur manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs.\u201d That\u2019s true enough, but there has been a net loss of manufacturing jobs during the president\u2019s time in office.\n\nSince January 2010, the time frame used by the president, the U.S. has seen an increase of 777,000 manufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But since January 2009, when Obama took office, the U.S. has seen a net decline of 321,000 manufacturing jobs, the same BLS data show.\n\nIn a recent study, the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation rejected talk of a \u201cmanufacturing renaissance,\u201d calling it a \u201cmyth,\u201d and noting there still is a long way to go. Even with the recent increase in manufacturing jobs, there are still nearly 1.8 million fewer manufacturing jobs than there were in January 2007, BLS figures show.\n\n\u201cMuch of the growth since 2010 appears to be caused by a cyclical recovery as demand, particularly for motor vehicles and other durable goods, returns,\u201d the ITIF report said.\n\nEconomic Growth\n\nThe president fudged a bit when he said economic growth and job gains are the best in 16 years.\n\nObama: Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.\n\nNot quite.\n\nAs for how fast \u201cour economy is growing,\u201d official figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis put the gain in real gross domestic product at an annual rate of 5.0 percent in the third quarter of last year. Those are the most recent figures available, and they represent the best quarterly gain in some time. But not since 1999.\n\nThe BEA\u2019s figures show real GDP grew at a rate of 6.9 percent in the third quarter of 2003, and at 7.8 percent in the second quarter of 2000.\n\nAnd as for \u201ccreating jobs,\u201d the White House has pointed to a preliminary figure of 2.95 million jobs gained in 2014, which is the best since 1999 if it holds up when the BLS completes its normal revisions of job figures, which could go up or down.\n\nBut the president spoke in present tense \u2014 saying the economy \u201cis \u2026 creating jobs\u201d at the fastest clip since 1999. And by more immediate measures the pace is not quite the most rapid since 1999. BLS puts the gain in total nonfarm employment during the most recent three-month period (ending in December) at 866,000 jobs. That\u2019s a respectable number, but not the best three-month gain since 1999.\n\nThe BLS figures show other three-month stretches in 2010, 2006, 2004 and 2000 when even more jobs were added.\n\n3-Month Net Change (in thousands)\n\nTotal Nonfarm Employment, Seasonally Adjusted\n\nSource: Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nSick Pay\n\nObama exaggerated when he said the United States was \u201cthe only advanced country on Earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee paid sick leave.\u201d\n\nWhile Canada and Japan have social insurance programs that would cover an extended leave for cancer treatment, they don\u2019t have guaranteed paid leave for an illness that lasts a few days. And Obama made the claim in calling for \u201ca bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.\u201d\n\nA 2009 report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a group funded by various labor groups and foundations, examined policies in 22 countries \u201cranked highly in terms of economic and human development.\u201d It says in the first paragraph that the U.S. is \u201cthe only country that does not guarantee that workers receive paid sick days or paid sick leave,\u201d but it goes on to say that neither Canada nor Japan has a policy for financial support for short-term leave, for an illness such as a five-day flu. Those countries do have social insurance that would cover some of the pay for an employee needing 50 days off for cancer treatment. Those are the two scenarios examined in the study.\n\nThe report says that 11 countries guaranteed full pay for an illness requiring five sick days. Others paid for some missed time, but not all five days (and in a few cases not even one full day), because of waiting periods before the financial support would kick in.\n\nObama also said that the U.S. was the \u201conly advanced country on Earth that doesn\u2019t guarantee \u2026 paid maternity leave to our workers.\u201d A 2014 report from the United Nation\u2019s International Labour Organization found: \u201cOnly two out of 185 countries and territories currently provide no statutory cash benefits during maternity leave.\u201d The two countries were Papua New Guinea and the United States, both of which provide some kind of maternity leave but no requirement for paid leave.\n\nThe U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act requires 12 weeks of unpaid leave for new mothers who have worked for one year for employers with more than 50 workers. Employers may require a substitution of paid sick or vacation days for the FMLA leave.\n\nHowever, the International Labour Organization report went on to say that the benefits in more than half of those 185 countries \u201cwere neither generous nor sufficiently long-lasting.\u201d It calls for 14 weeks of pay equal to two-thirds of previous earnings, a standard met by 85 percent of developed countries.\n\nAnd not all women are eligible for benefits. \u201cOnly 28.4 per cent of employed women worldwide would receive cash benefits in case of maternity,\u201d the report said.\n\nPrivate Sector Job Growth\n\nThe president was correct when he said the U.S. has gained 11 million private sector jobs in the past five years.\n\nObama: And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.\n\nThat\u2019s true as far as it goes. The economy gained 11,215,000 private sector jobs between February 2010 and the preliminary figures for December of last year.\n\nOf course, the president said nothing of the 4,210,000 private sector jobs that were lost during the first 13 months of his tenure as president, due to the savage recession that was raging at the time he took office.\n\nOverall, since Obama took office, the net gain in private sector employment is just over 7 million. And the gain in total employment during his time in office is lower than that \u2014 just under 6.4 million. That\u2019s because of a net loss in government jobs, particularly in local school systems.\n\nAbortion and Teen Pregnancies in Decline\n\nObama was right when he said \u201cteen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows.\u201d\n\nObama: We still may not agree on a woman\u2019s right to choose, but surely we can agree it\u2019s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs.\n\nThe rate of teen pregnancies in the U.S. has been on the decline for decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Division of Vital Statistics. In 2013, there were 274,641 babies born to females aged 15 to 19, a rate of 26.6 births for every 1,000 teen mothers. That was a 10 percent decline from 2012 and \u201cthe lowest number of teen births ever reported for the United States.\u201d According to CDC, it was also 57 percent lower than in 1970, the peak year for teen births.\n\nHowever, despite this progress, teen pregnancies in the U.S. still outpace many other developed countries including Canada and the United Kingdom, according to United Nations statistics.\n\nAs for abortions, the Guttmacher Institute reported in July 2014 that the rate of abortions in 2011 was the lowest since 1973. In 2011, \u201c1.06 million abortions were performed, down 13 percent from 1.21 million in 2008.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s \u2018Commitment\u2019 on Emissions\n\nIn a section of his speech dealing with efforts to address climate change, Obama touted a recent agreement with China.\n\nObama: In Beijing, we made an historic announcement \u2013 the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions.\n\nCommitted? Not exactly.\n\nIn a joint announcement on Nov. 12, 2014, both the U.S. and China said they \u201cintend to achieve\u201d emissions targets. For its part, the U.S. said it \u201cintends to achieve an economy-wide target of reducing its emissions by 26%-28% below its 2005 level in 2025 and to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28%.\u201d China, meanwhile, said it \u201cintends to achieve the peaking of CO2 emissions around 2030 and to make best efforts to peak early and intends to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20% by 2030.\u201d\n\nThe agreement was hailed by the Natural Resources Defense Council as \u201ca turning point in the fight against global warming.\u201d But the deal was derided by many Republican leaders, including Sen. Jim Inhofe, a Republican senator from Oklahoma and new chair of the Senate Environment Committee, who released a statement condemning the deal as a \u201cnon-binding charade.\u201d\n\nAs we wrote in a story about the climate deal with China, it\u2019s true, as Inhofe said, that the deal is not a legally binding treaty, which would need Senate ratification. As the language in the announcement makes clear, the countries said they \u201cintend to achieve\u201d specific targets, but that\u2019s not quite a binding commitment.\n\nHealth Insurance\n\nObama\u2019s boast about the decline in the uninsured is supported by early estimates from inside and outside his administration.\n\nObama: And in the past year alone, about 10 million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.\n\nThat figure is echoed by a quarterly survey conducted by the Urban Institute and a report by researchers with the Department of Health and Human Services and Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nBut we don\u2019t yet know if Obama can claim that \u201cmore of our people are insured than ever before,\u201d as he said earlier in his speech. An analysis of the percentage of uninsured by the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers shows that, but compares the second quarter of 2014 to years past. We don\u2019t have the full 2014 federal numbers yet.\n\nThe Urban Institute\u2019s Health Reform Monitoring Survey says the number of the uninsured dropped by 10.6 million nonelderly adults between September 2013 and September 2014. (The Affordable Care Act\u2019s first open enrollment period for policies purchased by individuals was from Oct. 1, 2013, through March 31, 2014.)\n\nAn earlier estimate from researchers with the Department of Health and Human Services and Harvard School of Public Health put the decline of the uninsured at 10.3 million adults from January 2012 through June 2014. Their report, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, noted that \u201cdepending on the model and confidence intervals, our sensitivity analyses imply a wide range from 7.3 to 17.2 million adults.\u201d\n\nEstimates from the most recent National Health Interview Survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics show a drop of 6.8 million people (of all ages) who were without health insurance at the time they were interviewed in the first six months of 2014, compared with 2013 (see Table 2). Those numbers were just released in December, so we won\u2019t have a fuller look at the changes between 2013 and 2014 overall for some months.\n\nObama cited a statistic from his own Council of Economic Advisers in saying that \u201cmore of our people are insured than ever before.\u201d The CEA used National Center for Health Statistics data and estimated that \u201cthe nation\u2019s uninsured rate is now at or near the lowest level recorded across five decades of data.\u201d\n\nThe data go back to 1963, and CEA had to make some adjustments due to changes in survey construction over the years. As we said, figures for all of 2014 aren\u2019t yet available, so CEA compares the percentage of uninsured for the second quarter of 2014 (11.3 percent) to figures from past years. That\u2019s the lowest rate in CEA\u2019s chart, but only 0.1 percentage points below the rate in 1974, 1978 and 1980 (see the table on page 11).\n\nThe figure for the first six months of 2014, not just the second quarter, is higher, however, at 12.2 percent (see Table 1). It remains to be seen how 2014 as a whole will compare to the past.\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 trend numbers for those without health insurance under age 65 (see Table 3) show that the first six months of 2014 had a lower percentage of uninsured than most of the past years \u2014 but not all. The percentage of the uninsured under age 65 was lower in 1974, 1978, 1980 and 1982.\n\nDeficits\n\nIn ticking off his accomplishments, Obama listed this one: \u201cour deficits cut by two-thirds.\u201d That\u2019s accurate, but as we have written before, the deficits have fallen from high levels and are on pace to return to high levels.\n\nWhen Obama took office in January 2009, the federal deficit for fiscal year 2009 was already on pace to be $1.2 trillion and topped $1.4 trillion by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, 2009. Annual deficits remained above $1 trillion for three more years before dropping to $680 billion in fiscal 2013.\n\nThe U.S. finished the most recent fiscal year with a deficit of $483 billion \u2014 roughly down two-thirds from what it was in fiscal 2009, as the president said.\n\nBut, as we noted in our quarterly report on Obama\u2019s presidency, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that annual deficits will soon rise again if Congress doesn\u2019t act. In a report it issued in August, CBO projected that under current law the deficit will rise above $500 billion in fiscal 2016 and hit nearly $950 billion by 2022.\n\nDrones\n\nObama said his administration has \u201cworked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained.\u201d Whether the use of drones has been \u201cproperly constrained\u201d is a subjective matter. The Stimson Center, a global security think tank, for one, warned in 2014 that heavy reliance on drones \u201crisks increasing instability and escalating conflicts.\u201d\n\nBut as a matter of independent analysis, Obama has ordered many more drone strikes than his predecessor, George W. Bush.\n\nObama: As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we\u2019re threatened, which is why I\u2019ve prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained.\n\nNo official figures are available, and for a time the Obama administration would not even publicly admit that such CIA-controlled attacks were taking place. But independent reports have found a dramatic increase in the use of covert, remote-controlled drones and missiles to attack targets in Pakistan and Yemen.\n\nAn independent estimate by the nonpartisan New America Foundation, based on what it deems to be \u201ccredible news reports,\u201d puts the number of attacks at more than 450 since Obama took office, more than nine times as many as took place while Bush was in office. In Pakistan, the group concludes, somewhere between 1,838 and 3,041 people were killed by drones approved by Obama. Most of them were militants, the report states, but about 150 of them were civilians. As we noted in a story in April 2013, estimates by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in Britain, while slightly different, give a similar picture.\n\n\u2014 by Eugene Kiely, Brooks Jackson, Lori Robertson, Robert Farley, D\u2019Angelo Gore, Carolyn Fante and Eden Everwine\n\n\n\nSources\n\nBoston Consulting Group. \u201cU.S. Executives Remain Bullish on American Manufacturing, Study Finds.\u201d Press Release. 24 Oct 2014.\n\nWhite House. \u201cYear in Review: Creating Economic Opportunity for All Americans in 2014.\u201d Press Release. 18 Dec 2014.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cTable 1.1.1.
