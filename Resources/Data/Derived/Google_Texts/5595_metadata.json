On Jan. 1, it will go the way of the dodo bird.\n\nOn Jan. 1, 2012, the manufacture and importation of 100-watt incandescent bulbs were discontinued. A year later, the 75-watt version was put out to pasture, too. 2014 will mark the bulb\u2019s final phase-out \u2014 no more 40- or 60-watt bulbs. In their place, we\u2019ll be forced to use either the squiggly-looking compact fluorescent light bulbs or LED lights, according to The Wichita Eagle.\n\nI actually gave the fluorescent bulbs a try a few years ago. I needed a 75-watt bulb and picked out a very expensive GE \u201cEnergy Smart\u201d 75, with disappointing results. That\u2019s when I read the fine print.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t really a 75-watt bulb \u2014 it was a 20-watt bulb with what GE claimed was the light intensity of a traditional 75-watt bulb. Balderdash! It had 25 watts, maybe \u2014 not 75.\n\nNot only did the light lack intensity, it\u2019s quality was lousy. Instead of the warm, full-spectrum glow we\u2019ve all become accustomed to, it cast those in its weak glow in a ghastly pallor straight from \u201cNight of the Living Dead.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I read the really fine print. If you break one \u2014 and who among us hasn\u2019t broken a light bulb \u2014 you\u2019re cautioned to retreat from the premises immediately and do everything short of calling in the hazmat team. That\u2019s because they\u2019re packed with mercury.\n\nEven worse, it now appears that the bulbs are hazardous to our health, even if they\u2019re not broken.\n\nGermany\u2019s ALAB Laboratory, based in Berlin, discovered two years ago that the bulbs emit carcinogens when turned on, especially for extended periods of time, according to The Telegraph.\n\n\u201cFor such carcinogenic substances, it is important they are kept as far away as possible from the human environment,\u201d Peter Braun, who carried out the tests, told the British newspaper. \u201cI, therefore, use them only very economically. They should not be used in unventilated areas and definitely not in the proximity of the head.\u201d\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t use them to settle down with a good book. That last chapter may kill you.\n\nIncidentally, the package of that overpriced 20-watt GE \u201cEnergy Smart\u201d bulb claimed it \u201clasts 5 years.\u201d Apparently, that\u2019s only true if you never actually turn it on. Within five months, I was giving it last rites.\n\nThat\u2019s when I gave LEDs a try. I bought an inexpensive desk lamp with about 30 tiny light-emitting diodes to illuminate my computer keyboard. Within a few weeks, it turned into a cross between an emergency strobe light and a \u201870s disco ball, with each of the diodes flashing on and off in no particular order. It drove me and my eyes nuts.\n\nWhen I returned the lamp to the store, I was told my complaint was pretty common.\n\nSo Jan. 1 is it, folks. There are some exceptions to the ban, according to The Wichita Eagle, including three-way bulbs, appliance bulbs, grow lights, black lights, yellow bug lights and infrared lamps.\n\nWith that, I wish everyone a Merry Christmas, and may your days be merry and, most of all, bright.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Thanks to an overreaching federal government, the American public will soon be forced to purchase a product that\u2019s severely overpriced, hazardous to our health and doesn\u2019t live up to all its hype \u2014 and I\u2019m not talking about Obamacare.
