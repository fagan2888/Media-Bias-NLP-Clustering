John McCain speaks to reporters at a Wall Street Journal-hosted breakfast in Washington, D.C., Sept. 11.\n\nSen. John McCain isn\u2019t merely a critic of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad; he\u2019s also a passionate defender of the opposition forces seeking to overthrow him.\n\nSpeaking at a Wall Street Journal breakfast Wednesday morning, Sen. McCain (R., Ariz.) sharply disagreed with those who assert that Syrian opposition forces are so populated with Islamic radicals that they don\u2019t deserve American aid.\n\nInstead, he insisted that his regular contacts with the opposition convince him that Islamic extremists, including those who hail from the radical al Nusra offshoot of al Qaeda, \u201care in the minority\u201d and lack a large following among Syrians.\n\n\u201cThe Syrian people are moderate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Syrians are not going to stand to be governed by al Nusra and foreign fighters. They\u2019re not. They\u2019re the most highly educated, most literate nation in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cAnd to somehow believe they are going to fall prey to al Qaeda and al Nusra is not a possibility.\u201d\n\nBut, Sen. McCain argued, a lack of American support for the opposition might increase the popular appeal of Islamist forces as the alternative to the Assad regime.\n\n\u201cIf they feel abandoned, I worry about the consequences,\u201d he said. Regime foes will, he said, \u201cturn to whoever will help them in this struggle.\u201d\n\nThough Sen. McCain generally praised President Barack Obama\u2018s speech to the nation Wednesday night, he faulted the president for failing to include any notes of support for the opposition, led by Gen. Salim Idris, head of the Free Syrian Army.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you I\u2019m going to hear from Gen. Idris today, and he\u2019s going to say, \u2018Have you abandoned us? Have you abandoned us?\u2019 \u201d\n\nWatch video from the Wall Street Journal breakfast in which Sen.
