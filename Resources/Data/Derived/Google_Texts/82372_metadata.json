Gloria, her half-brother and his two daughters had all tested positive.\n\nThis was long before Angelina Jolie announced she\u2019d had first her breasts, then her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to reduce her BRCA cancer risk. At the time my cousin wrote, I was dimly aware that some women chose this path. But I could not imagine offering up my healthy body to a surgeon who would slice into my flesh like a butcher, cutting out my organs and breasts. It felt like too high a price to improve the odds.\n\nSo I did nothing.\n\nTwo years later I was diagnosed at age 57 with a rare and aggressive uterine cancer. Its discovery was a fluke; anxiety about a friend\u2019s ovarian cancer had propelled me into my OB-GYN\u2019s office months before my routine visit. Luckily, post-hysterectomy analysis revealed the cancer had not spread.\n\nThere were no protocols about chemotherapy for such an early stage. The surgeon advised, \u201cIt depends on whether or not you\u2019re the kind of person who likes extra insurance.\u201d\n\nThat night, I dreamed a docile lion was outside our house. But we knew it would soon come prowling for red meat. And so I chose chemo.\n\nGiven my cancer\u2019s cell type and the family history I had disavowed, the doctors suspected BRCA, and recommended testing. A week later I got the results: positive for the mutation, which meant a 50-85 percent lifetime risk of getting breast cancer.\n\nI felt doomed. The previously abstract dilemma of how to cope with a potential time bomb inside one\u2019s body was now horribly mine. Prophylactic mastectomies\u2014the clinical term I regarded as a euphemism for amputation\u2014could reduce my breast cancer risk by 90 percent. But there was no guarantee. There\u2019d be even less if I chose high-risk surveillance: a long-term commitment that involves frequent breast MRIs, mammograms, self- and clinical breast exams, false positives and anxiety. Unfortunately, surveillance doesn\u2019t prevent cancer; it only reduces the risk of dying from it by catching it early, when it\u2019s highly treatable.\n\n\u201cWhat a difficult choice,\u201d people said, a few implying that I\u2019d be an idiot if I didn\u2019t choose surgery.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re not there yet,\u201d others commented when I\u2019d indicate I was leaning toward surveillance.\n\nIt\u2019s as if they believed I hadn\u2019t given my situation a moment\u2019s thought, and would come to my senses as soon as I awoke from my coma of denial. Not everyone disapproved of my decision to keep my breasts, but I magnified the responses of those who did out of fear that I was making the wrong choice. A friend whose BRCA-positive wife opted for prophylactic mastectomies after nearly dying from ovarian cancer treated the question like a no-brainer. \u201cYou can live without a lot of body parts,\u201d he assured me.\n\nThe prospect of more cancer was a nightmare from which I could not awake. Radical surgery trying to outfox a disease that might never strike seemed an even worse option. I had always loved my breasts. They had been a delectable handful for partners and had nourished two daughters. How could I take away such a vital part of myself unless it was necessary?\n\nI had seen photographs of post-mastectomy women. Character and courage were on display in those pictures, but all I could see was mutilation, made worse by my shame at being unable to overcome my revulsion. I envisioned waking up from the anesthetic, nothing under the bandages except a scarred expanse, my body plundered while unconscious, too late to change my mind.\n\nAnd what if my husband couldn\u2019t take it? Jonathan listened patiently as I spilled my fears, but he was slow to put his arms around me and promise he wouldn\u2019t leave me. We were so unlike the couples I read about who seemed unburdened by ambivalence and aversion. The men did not even blanch at the prospect of mastectomies, pronouncing their partners beautiful no matter what. The women without breasts but with unfaltering mates seemed just as chipper. I longed to hear of others who feared for the survival of their marriages along with their fears of cancer. But apparently, I was alone, which left me feeling even more depressed and ashamed as well as doubting what I\u2019d once thought of as a strong and loving relationship.\n\nDread was not the only reason I hesitated to cut off my breasts. Unless I could make peace with a flat, marred chest, I\u2019d face arduous reconstructive surgery. This would involve months of procedures under general anesthesia, pain, skin grafts, permanent loss of sensation, the risk of botched outcomes, and harm to my livelihood.\n\nIf I waited, there could be advances in prevention and diagnosis, even gene therapy to mitigate the BRCA risk. Or, should cancer return, safer, more effective treatments; better ways to ameliorate the side effects of chemo and the ordeal of breast removal and reconstruction. In holding out for promising advances, was I holding onto false hope?\n\nAt least with my ovaries gone, I no longer needed to worry about deadly ovarian cancer. And since I carried the less-risky variant of the BRCA mutation, my lifetime odds for breast cancer fell on the lower end of the probability scale. Perhaps I\u2019d be among the lucky women who didn\u2019t get it. Reluctant to take drastic action against a possibility, I wanted to be guided by prudence, not denial or paranoia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Faced with the same diagnosis as the star, I took a more conservative path -- and suffered the judgment for it", "author": "Lorrie Goldin", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Faced with the same diagnosis as the star, I took a more conservative path -- and suffered the judgment for it", "title": "My decision to keep my breasts: When Angelina Jolie\u2019s choice is different from your own", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/29/my_decision_to_keep_my_breasts_when_angelina_jolies_choice_is_different_from_your_own/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/woman_covering_breasts.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Faced with the same diagnosis as the star, I took a more conservative path -- and suffered the judgment for it", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/woman_covering_breasts.jpg", "title": "My decision to keep my breasts: When Angelina Jolie\u2019s choice is different from your own", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "My decision to keep my breasts: When Angelina Jolie\u2019s choice is different from your own", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Angelina Jolie, BRCA, Cancer, Life stories, Prophylactic Mastectomies", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde877\"", "article_summary": "This was long before Angelina Jolie announced she\u2019d had first her breasts, then her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed to reduce her BRCA cancer risk.\nIts discovery was a fluke; anxiety about a friend\u2019s ovarian cancer had propelled me into my OB-GYN\u2019s office months before my routine visit.\nIf I waited, there could be advances in prevention and diagnosis, even gene therapy to mitigate the BRCA risk.\nProphylactic mastectomies\u2014the clinical term I regarded as a euphemism for amputation\u2014could reduce my breast cancer risk by 90 percent.\nAt least with my ovaries gone, I no longer needed to worry about deadly ovarian cancer."}
