Experts from the University of Illinois Hospitals will explain the changes that the implementation of the Affordable Care Act will entail. The event is open to the public.\n\nAlso known as \"ObamaCare,\" the Affordable Care Act is intended to improve healthcare for Americans.

The options available to undocumented immigrants and their families will also be explained.\n\nThe forum will offer guidance regarding the healthcare rights and options available to residents, regardless of their legal status. Certificates for free health examinations will also be available.\n\nRohr-Max and the Spanish-language newspaper Hoy, in their continuing support of the Latino community, invite Illinois residents to come learn about the changes and benefits the Affordable Care Act has to offer.\n\nDon't miss this opportunity to be better informed about the Affordable Care Act, Saturday, November 23 at 10:00 am at Little Village High School located at 3120 South Kostner Avenue, in Chicago.
