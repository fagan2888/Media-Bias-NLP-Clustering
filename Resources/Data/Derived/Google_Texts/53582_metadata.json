That\u2019s one of the best feelings in the world.\u201d\n\nShiffrin didn\u2019t try to merely defend her 0.80-second lead over Zettel from the opening run but went out attacking in her second as well.\n\n\u201cMikaela was amazing, so super strong,\u201d said Zettel, adding she was \u201creally happy\u201d with coming runner-up to the American. \u201cMikaela is from a different planet. It looks like nothing can go wrong, it looks so smooth and easy and she\u2019s obviously having a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nFrida Hansdotter of Sweden placed fourth to retain her lead in the discipline standings with 320 points, though Shiffrin has closed the gap to a single point. Tina Maze is 25 points behind Shiffrin in third, and the Slovenian skier stayed atop the overall standings after placing fifth in Sunday\u2019s slalom.\n\nSarka Strachova, who was third after the opening run, straddled a gate and failed to finish, while Sweden\u2019s Maria Pietilae-Holmner and Austria\u2019s Nicole Hosp, who both won slaloms this season, also skied out.\n\nSara Hector of Sweden, who won a GS for her maiden victory last week, started in 61st position but placed ninth for her first top-10 finish in slalom.\n\nThere is one more slalom before the world championships \u2014 in Flachau, Austria, on Jan. 13.\n\nA men\u2019s night slalom on the same course is scheduled for Tuesday, while the women\u2019s World Cup continues with speed races in Bad Kleinkirchheim, Austria, next weekend.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mikaela Shiffrin dominates field to win World Cup slalom", "title": "Mikaela Shiffrin dominates field to win World Cup slalom", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/04/mikaela-shiffrin-dominates-field-to-win-world-cup-slalom/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150104__shiffrinp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150104__shiffrinp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-04T13:12:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:03:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Alpine skiing, Freestyle skiing"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdac7\"", "article_summary": "A men\u2019s night slalom on the same course is scheduled for Tuesday, while the women\u2019s World Cup continues with speed races in Bad Kleinkirchheim, Austria, next weekend.\nShiffrin won the slalom World Cup the past two seasons but failed to reach a podium in the first three races this season until dominating in Kuehtai, Austria, last week, where she also won both runs.\nZAGREB, Croatia \u2014 American skier Mikaela Shiffrin continued her recent resurgence in slalom by convincingly winning her second straight World Cup race, leaving her rivals in awe four weeks before she defends her world title in Beaver Creek.\n\u201cMy skiing is good right now, it\u2019s kind of back on track and my equipment feels really good.\u201dIt was the American\u2019s 12th career World Cup win and 11th in slalom, matching a World Cup record set in 1980 by France\u2019s Perrine Pelen for most slalom wins as a teenager.\nThere is one more slalom before the world championships \u2014 in Flachau, Austria, on Jan. 13."}
