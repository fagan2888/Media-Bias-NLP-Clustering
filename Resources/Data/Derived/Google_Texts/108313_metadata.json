Chris Christie (R) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) taking heat for appearing to pander to anti-vaccination hysteria.\n\nOn Sunday, Carson \u2014 a former pediatric neurosurgeon \u2014 told Wallace, \u201cWhat we really have to look at is that we\u2019ve learned a lot about immunology and the science behind vaccinations. And we\u2019ve made tremendous progress in eliminating some devastating diseases over the decades.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened a few years ago,\u201d continued Carson, \u201cis that information was disseminated inappropriately about terrible side effects from vaccinations. All of that was carefully investigated and debunked.\u201d\n\nThere are still people who are \u201clegitimately concerned,\u201d he said, but they just need to be educated. There are minuscule risks associated with vaccines, yes, but \u201cyou have to look at the overall good.\u201d\n\nWallace asked Carson if he feels that it\u2019s fair for some people to label the Republican Party as people \u201cwho deny science, whether it is vaccinations or climate change or evolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not fair at all,\u201d said Carson. \u201cIt\u2019s not a partisan issue. You look in California, the places where outbreaks have occurred are blue areas, Democratic areas where people have said \u2018We don\u2019t need this anymore.'\u201d\n\nNonetheless, he said, \u201cit\u2019s not a Democratic or Republican issue at all. A lot of people want to make everything partisan.\u201d\n\nThis moderate take is unusual for Carson, who in the past has staked out positions to the far right of even some fellow Republicans.\n\nWomen must be \u201cre-educated,\u201d he said in 2013, to not get so \u201criled up\u201d about their access to abortion.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is re-educate the women to understand that they are the defenders of these babies,\u201d he said.\n\nCarson is a staunch marriage equality opponent, saying that to allow same-sex marriages to stand jeopardizes \u201ceverything in the Bible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen people come along and try to change the definition of marriage, they are directly attacking the relationship between God and his people,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the reason it\u2019s so important for them to change the definition, because if you can get rid of that, you can get rid of everything else in the Bible too.\u201d\n\nCarson has also compared same-sex relationships to pedophilia and bestiality.\n\nIn 2014, Carson said that Obamacare, if implemented, will be \u201cthe worst thing that\u2019s happened to this nation since slavery.\u201d\n\nWatch the video, embedded below:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/cnn_nr_carson_words_141203a1-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "In rare lucid moment, Ben Carson tells Republicans not to pander to anti-vaccination hysteria"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b58\"", "article_summary": "Chris Christie (R) and Sen.
