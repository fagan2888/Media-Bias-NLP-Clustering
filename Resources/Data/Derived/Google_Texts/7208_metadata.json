The claim is that wealthy celebrities who oppose industrial-scale pollution supposedly shouldn\u2019t fly in airplanes that use fossil fuels. The group, along with its subsidiary, the American Energy Alliance, churns out a steady stream of related content, from Facebook memes criticizing the Environmental Protection Agency, to commercials demanding approval of new oil projects like the Keystone XL, to a series of television campaign advertisements this year attacking Democratic candidates in West Virginia, Colorado, North Carolina and Alaska. On Capitol Hill, IER aggressively opposes any effort to repeal tax breaks afforded to the oil and gas industry.\n\nDocuments obtained by Republic Report reveal for the first time that the group was actually founded by none other than Charles Koch, the petrochemical, manufacturing, and oil refining tycoon worth an estimated $52 billion.\n\nIER has no information about its founding members on its website, and only lists a board composed of seemingly independent conservative scholars and businessmen. Earlier reports revealed that IER/AEA has received grants from Koch-funded foundations, and its leadership includes several individuals who have at times worked for Koch or Koch-related interests. But this is the first time it has been revealed that Charles personally founded the organization.\n\nIn October of 1984, Charles, then using a Menlo Park, California address founded a non-profit called the Institute for Humane Studies of Texas. That organization briefly lost its charter in 1989 for failure to pay the Texas state franchise tax. Four years later, incorporation documents reveal, the group rebranded as the Institute for Energy Research, or IER, which later formed a subsidiary called the American Energy Alliance.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New documents reveal the mega-rich libertarian is the mastermind behind the Institute for Energy Research", "author": "Lee Fang", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New documents reveal the mega-rich libertarian is the mastermind behind the Institute for Energy Research", "title": "Report: Charles Koch founded anti-environment group to protect big oil industry handouts", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/report_charles_koch_founded_anti_environment_group_to_protect_big_oil_industry_handouts_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/03/Koch-brothers-e1447778154333.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New documents reveal the mega-rich libertarian is the mastermind behind the Institute for Energy Research", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/03/Koch-brothers-e1447778154333.png", "title": "Report: Charles Koch founded anti-environment group to protect big oil industry handouts", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Report: Charles Koch founded anti-environment group to protect big oil industry handouts", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Big Oil, Campaign Finance, Charles Koch, Institute for Energy Research", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Documents obtained by Republic Report reveal for the first time that the group was actually founded by none other than Charles Koch, the petrochemical, manufacturing, and oil refining tycoon worth an estimated $52 billion.\nFour years later, incorporation documents reveal, the group rebranded as the Institute for Energy Research, or IER, which later formed a subsidiary called the American Energy Alliance.\nIn October of 1984, Charles, then using a Menlo Park, California address founded a non-profit called the Institute for Humane Studies of Texas.\nBut this is the first time it has been revealed that Charles personally founded the organization.\nOn Capitol Hill, IER aggressively opposes any effort to repeal tax breaks afforded to the oil and gas industry."}
