According to the CBO it has three general effects:\n\nIt includes some tax increases, which modestly reduce incentives to earn more income.\n\nIt allows more people to buy health insurance even if they aren't employed, which modestly reduces incentives to work.\n\nIts benefits decline as income goes up, which reduces incentives to work (in some cases) or to work more (in other cases).\n\nCBO's specific estimates of reduced work incentives may be wrong\u2014they strike me as a bit high\u2014 but their general conclusion is both correct and well-known. Tax increases do reduce incentives to work. Decoupling insurance from employment does reduce the number of people who work solely because they need the insurance. And means-tested benefits do create the equivalent of high marginal tax rates as income increases, which reduces the incentive to work more.\n\nThere's nothing new here. Obamacare does change work incentives in certain ways, though the effect is small: about 1-2 percent of the workforce by 2025. But it doesn't force anything. There are no \"broken promises\" or \"catastrophic failures\" to rant about. Just some small marginal effects that shouldn't surprise anyone who's been paying attention.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/12/no-obamacare-isnt-forcing-people-work-less", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "No, Obamacare isn't forcing people to work less"}, "twitter": {"title": "No, Obamacare isn't forcing people to work less", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/12/no-obamacare-isnt-forcing-people-work-less", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ebb\"", "article_summary": "Its benefits decline as income goes up, which reduces incentives to work (in some cases) or to work more (in other cases).\nObamacare does change work incentives in certain ways, though the effect is small: about 1-2 percent of the workforce by 2025.\nIt allows more people to buy health insurance even if they aren't employed, which modestly reduces incentives to work.\nCBO's specific estimates of reduced work incentives may be wrong\u2014they strike me as a bit high\u2014 but their general conclusion is both correct and well-known.\nAccording to the CBO it has three general effects:It includes some tax increases, which modestly reduce incentives to earn more income."}
