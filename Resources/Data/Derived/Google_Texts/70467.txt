The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) today submitted its reports on the performance of various sectors in Andhra Pradesh government, finding "deficiencies" in implementation of selected schemes and the resultant losses caused to the exchequer during the previous Congress rule for the year ended March 2013.

The six CAG reports on revenue, economic sector, public sector undertakings, local bodies, general and social sectors and directorate of mines and geology were tabled in the state Assembly on the last day of Budget session.

The weaker section housing schemes, social security pension schemes, works of irrigation department, implementation of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act and the functioning of some PSUs came in for sharp scrutiny by the central auditor.

This was reflected in the fact that construction of 12.87 lakh units was not even commenced out of 64.32 lakh sanctioned after a lapse of six years.

"Due to lack of input and validation controls, inadequate scrutiny of applications and incorrect processing of cases, some ineligible beneficiaries had derived benefits from the scheme.

"Monitoring was ineffective and in that the department has not taken action for recovery of amounts from ineligible beneficiaries," the auditor remarked.

"There were cases of taking up
