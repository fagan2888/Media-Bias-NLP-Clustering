Sure, I\u2019d think about that. But not mayor again. I did it, and it was a great job, and now somebody else gets a chance to do it,\u201d Giuliani said on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d\n\nHe did not specify any particular public office he would pursue.\n\nGiuliani\u2019s appearance mainly focused on the opening of the National September 11 Memorial Museum, which he visited on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult. In some ways more difficult, because it\u2019s been so long,\u201d he said about his visit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGiuliani, 69, ran New York's City Hall as mayor from 1994 until 2001 and said he has to move on from that experience.\n\n\u201cI believe you can\u2019t go back,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, you do a job with all your heart, all your soul, you do a lot of good things; you make some mistakes; now it\u2019s history and you move on to other things.\u201d\n\nAt an event in Manhattan on Monday, former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-Fla.) joked that he would lead a future campaign for Giuliani if he chose to run for mayor again in 2017.\n\n\"But I would like to take this opportunity tonight to confirm that if asked, I would be willing to chair the Rudy 2017 campaign against Bill de Blasio,\u201d Bush joked, drawing loud applause.\n\nGiuliani mounted a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008. Bush is currently considering a presidential run in 2016.\n\nThe former mayor said Thursday that he\u2019s been busy advising the Colombian government on how to reduce crime in its country.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cAs to would I run for another office?
