Many were hoping its candidate, Guy Sebastian, would take home the trophy, giving it a place in next year's contest. But Australia, given a wild-card entry this year due to its enthusiastic fan base, came fifth, not enough to secure a spot in 2016.\n\nMans Zelmerlow representing Sweden speaks to Conchita Wurst, who won the 2014 ESC for Austria, as he celebrates with the trophy after winning the final of the Eurovision Song Contest in Austria's capital Vienna, Sunday, May 24, 2015.

Only Ireland has been more successful, with seven triumphs.\n\nIn his pop number \"Heroes,\" the Swede chose to forego the usual elaborate stage effects, relying instead on his strong singing and an innovative backdrop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheers greeted his win. But the crowd's reaction to Gagarina struck a jarring note for those who believed in the contest's slogan, \"Building Bridges.\"\n\nKiev did not send a candidate this year. With many in the West viewing Moscow as the aggressor in Ukraine, the Russian's song, \"A Million Voices,\" and its message of peace and understanding raised some eyebrows during the qualifiers leading up to Saturday's final.\n\nAs scattered boos rang out after points were given to her Saturday, one of the hosts reminded the audience that \"music should stand over politics tonight.\"\n\nWith many Russians critical of last year's winner, the bearded cross-dressing Austrian diva Conchita Wurst, some of the negative reaction may also have been directed at Russia's generally repressive official climate against homosexuality.\n\nWurst rejected the boos, calling them \"incomprehensible,\" and noted that Gagarina \"cannot be blamed for the rules\" in her home country.\n\nPromoting homosexuality is against the law in Russia. Many there view Wurst as a threat to traditional family values, and a win by Gagarina would have brought the event to Moscow, a scenario viewed with alarm by the Orthodox Church.\n\nMans Zelmerlow representing Sweden celebrates as he wins the final of the Eurovision Song Contest in Austria's capital Vienna, Sunday, May 24, 2015.

Approximately 10,000 people followed the contest live in Vienna's mammoth Stadthalle, with 25,000 others crowding the main public viewing venue in front of Vienna's City Hall.\n\nBeyond Abba, other Eurovision winners who went on to pop fame are Celine Dion and Johnny Logan, who triumphed three times as a performer and songwriter.\n\nFans of Australia pose for photos in the song contest park in front of the City Hall prior to the final of the Eurovision Song Competition in Austria's capital Vienna, Saturday, May 23, 2015.
