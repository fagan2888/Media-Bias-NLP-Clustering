Marco Rubio recently told voters there is no place for the federal government in local public schools and that America needs to focus on vocational education for students who aren\u2019t likely to attend college and are more interested in the trades.\n\nWhile on the campaign trail, Rubio has commanded the attention of parents who have opposed the Common Core standards and the federal intrusion into local education that has come with the reform. In addition, he has honed in on the issue of rising college education costs coupled with massive student debt and yet often no jobs for college graduates to show for it.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAnn Marie Banfield, grassroots parent activist and education liaison with the New Hampshire-based Cornerstone Action, asked Rubio at a campaign stop about federal involvement in K-12 public education, and shared a recording of his responses with Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the federal government has any role to play in local schools\u2026and I don\u2019t think you even need a Department of Education,\u201d Rubio responded. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should have a Department of Education. There\u2019s no federal role in local schools. We don\u2019t need a national school board.\u201d\n\nThe candidate has made it increasingly clear he views Common Core as a tool of the Obama administration to further federalize education.\n\n\u201cCommon Core has been used by the Obama administration to turn the Department of Education into a national school board,\u201d Rubio says on his website. \u201cThis effort to coerce states into adhering to national curriculum standards is not the best way to help our children attain the best education, and it must be stopped.\u201d\n\nWhile Rubio did vote against the Senate\u2019s version of the controversial reauthorization of the federal No Child Left Behind bill, he skipped the vote on the final conference legislation called the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), yet another Washington, D.C. \u201cbipartisan\u201d measure that was largely negotiated behind closed doors and signed by President Obama almost immediately after its approval by Congress.\n\nIn a statement to Breitbart News, the Florida senator said, \u201cWhile the Every Student Succeeds Act takes important steps in restoring some control over education decisions back to the states, it does not go far enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the bill does not grant states autonomy in all education decision-making, expands the federal government\u2019s role in Pre-K, and fails to include important measures that broaden school choice,\u201d he added. \u201cDue to these shortcomings, I am unable to lend my support to this bill.\u201d\n\nIn fact, many Common Core experts say the ESSA hardly restores much in the way of local control at all.\n\nZe\u2019ev Wurman, former senior policy adviser for the U.S. Department of Education under President George W. Bush, told Breitbart News in December the ESSA does little \u2013 if anything at all \u2013 to eliminate Common Core.\n\n\u201cESSA still talks about \u2018post-secondary readiness,\u2019 albeit in sotto voce,\u201d he explains. \u201cFurther, the Secretary of Education still has to approve state standards as a part of state plans, which allows the Secretary to push his way around.\u201d\n\nComing from the left, former assistant secretary for the U.S. Education Department Peter Cunningham recently wrote about the ESSA \u2013 which was spearheaded by Sen. Lamar Alexander: \u201c[T]he new law that the senator from Tennessee is so proud of, the Every Student Succeeds Act [ESSA], now mandates the very thing he rails against.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the new law, every state must adopt \u2018college- and career-ready\u2019 standards,\u201d Cunningham explains. \u201cThus, the new law all but guarantees that Common Core State Standards\u2014or a reasonable imitation under a different name\u2014will likely remain in place in most states.\u201d\n\nRubio has been a supporter of school choice and has sponsored federal legislation for tax-credit scholarships, which data have shown present less additional regulatory burden on participating private schools than school vouchers. Andrew Coulson\u2019s 2010 study at Cato found that voucher programs are more likely to \u201csuffocate the very markets to which they aim to expand access,\u201d because state funds\u2014which invariably are tied to state regulations\u2014are directly transferred, in the form of vouchers, to parents to spend in an alternate education setting.\n\nTax credit scholarships, however, involve no state funds directly expended on private schools. Instead, taxpayers, both individual and businesses, can receive full or partial tax credits when they donate money to nonprofits that provide private school scholarships. Coulson writes that such school choice programs have been found to \u201csimultaneously boost achievement for students who switch to private schools, do the same for students who remain in public schools, and save taxpayers millions of dollars every year\u2026\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Coulson cautions \u201cit is ill advised to pursue such a program (or other school choice programs) at the federal level.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s education agenda issues that have drawn the most fire from both the left and the right are that of student loan debt and school accountability, and his promotion of vocational education.\n\n\u201cI do believe our existing model of higher education is out of date,\u201d he said in New Hampshire.\n\nThe senator is a co-sponsor of the Student Right to Know Before You Go Act, which claims to make colleges more accountable.\n\nRubio explained the proposal in New Hampshire:\n\nBefore you take on a loan, the school has to tell you \u2013 here\u2019s how much people make from our school when they graduate with the degree that you\u2019re seeking \u2013 why is that important? Let me tell you why that\u2019s important\u2026because maybe you\u2019re trying to choose between two schools. One of them costs $20,000 and people that graduate from there with your degree make $50 grand. The other school costs $100,000 and people who graduate from there made $50 grand. So, two schools \u2013 you graduate and you make the same amount of money \u2013 but one costs $100,000 and a lot of loans, and the other costs $20,000. We don\u2019t have that information now. Students have to make up their mind based on reputation, based on what they read in U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThe senator addressed concerns about privacy rights in collecting the data to find out how much alumni from the schools are actually making:\n\nThe other thing is, what about your major? Before you borrow $100,000 to major in something that doesn\u2019t lead to a job, you should at least know what the job prospects are, and you don\u2019t have to violate privacy rights to collect that information. Go on LinkedIn\u2026LinkedIn has all kinds of people who say \u201cHere\u2019s where I graduated,\u201d \u201cThis is what my degree was,\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s where I work.\u201d And you can from that surmise a lot of information. And so, this is also a voluntary system, people aren\u2019t going to be required to report how much they make. But, these alumni associations know how much people make \u2018cause that\u2019s who they\u2019re targeting to raise money for their schools. And, so, my point to you is it is important for students to have access to this information. We have a trillion dollars of student loan debt, oftentimes borrowed by people who graduated with a degree, and then the degree did not lead to a job. Because in the 21st century it is not enough to have a college degree, it has to be the right degree.\n\nRubio next addressed his campaign for an increase in vocational education in the United States.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about cost benefit, we need more vocational training in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why we got rid of it in the first place\u2026\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\nHere\u2019s what I believe, and, as president, I\u2019ll be able to help with this. If you are a high school student, and you have decided that what you want to do is fix airplanes for a living, then I believe you should be able to go to high school in the morning and take your basic courses, then in the afternoon be able to go to trade school, using federal financial aid if your school doesn\u2019t offer it \u2013 why? Because when you\u2019re 18 years of age and you graduate, they\u2019re going to hand you a high school diploma and they\u2019re going to hand you an industry certification that says, \u201cYou are now certified to work as a welder, as a plumber, as an airplane mechanic, as a car technician.\u201d 18 years of age, making $45-50,000 a year. Instead, what are we doing with these kids? They drop out, \u2018cause they don\u2019t like what they\u2019re studying, they\u2019re not interested. They drop out and we lose them. Or they graduate and then they go to trade school. Let\u2019s do it now. Let\u2019s get more people to work in these important jobs. And it\u2019s a choice \u2013 it will be an option that every student will have available to them if that\u2019s what they choose to do.\n\nLast week, in an op-ed at the Huffington Post, Hofstra social studies educator Alan Singer, blasted Rubio from the left over what he described as the senator \u201cdeclaring war on college education.\u201d\n\nSinger writes:\n\nAccording to Senator Rubio, liberal arts colleges are \u201cindoctrination camps\u201d that are only kept in business because the political left wants to protect \u201call their friends\u201d that \u201cwork there.\u201d This comes from a Presidential candidate whose political life has been kept afloat for years by one major campaign donor, Norman Braman, a billionaire Florida car dealer who also employees Rubio\u2019s wife as a \u201cconsultant.\u201d Braman pledged $10 million to the Rubio Presidential campaign and over the years has hired Rubio as a lawyer at his company, Braman Management, donated $100,00 toward Rubio\u2019s salary as an instructor at Florida International College in Miami, and gave Rubio use of his private plane.\n\nIf Rubio\u2019s idea of promoting voc ed among high school students is not based on \u201cschool-to-work\u201d data collection that hopes to channel students from the lower grades into various trades for the benefit of business and industry, conservatives could likely support it. However, conservatives are also mindful of the fact that Rubio led the charge in the Gang of Eight immigration bill. As Breitbart News reported, Ramesh Ponnuru, writing at Bloomberg, said the bill represented an agenda that \u201cwould increase legal immigration, allow many illegal immigrants to become citizens, and start them on that path even if new enforcement measures against further illegal immigration turn out to be ineffective.\u201d\n\nPromoting a vocational education agenda if he is also promoting amnesty begs the question of whether Rubio\u2019s voc ed federal financial aid will give priority to American students.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce has championed both the Common Core standards and amnesty for illegal immigrants \u2013 as a means to keep inexpensive labor within the United States. The Chamber also promotes \u201cwork-study\u201d programs similar to that developed by small manufacturing company Quality Work Floats. The program mirrors Rubio\u2019s:\n\nStudents attend academic classes in the morning and work on the shop floor in the afternoon. They test their skills on approved equipment, assist with prep work, and explore different roles in the firm. Students receive school credit for participating in the program and benefit from coaching on soft skills. In turn, Quality Float Works has an opportunity to identify promising young talent that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.\n\nThe program sounds all well and good. However, as Kirsten Lombard, editor of Common Ground on Common Core: Voices from across the Political Spectrum Expose the Realities of the Common Core State Standards, told Breitbart News last February, \u201cAmericans often allow themselves to be fooled by \u2018workforce development\u2019 and \u2018school-to-work\u2019 language because it has the sound of the private sector and business.\u201d\n\nInstead, Lombard said such rhetoric belongs \u201cfirmly in the realm of planned economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil we as a people firmly reject the premise that government has a role in assisting business with the acquisition of workers, we will continue to be entrenched in policies and programs that unethically predetermine the pathways that will be open to our children,\u201d she asserted.\n\nBreitbart News asked the Rubio campaign to clarify whether his vocational education initiative was part of a greater \u201cworkforce development\u201d effort, but the campaign did not respond to the request.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In New Hampshire GOP 2016 contender Sen.
