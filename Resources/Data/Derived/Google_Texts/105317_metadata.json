At the same time, the need for long-term care services has increased \u201cdramatically\u201d over the past 20 years, Chernof pointed out, but just one-third of Americans ages 40 and older have saved money to pay for such care.\n\n\u201cContained in the ACA are important provisions focused on the needs of vulnerable adults that start to address these challenges,\u201d Chernof wrote. Those elements \u201care quietly having a profound impact on today\u2019s health care landscape,\u201d Chernof added in a separate opinion piece this month. However, \u201ca great deal of work remains to institutionalize system change that offers value to individuals, providers, payers and regulators,\u201d he said.\n\nOf all the states that have embraced the ACA, California \u201cis a leading state in exploring and adopting new models of care\u201d under the law, according to Chernof.\n\nEfforts in California\n\nThe California Department of Health Care Services told California Healthline that the ACA \u201ccreated many new opportunities for states to redesign their delivery systems in ways that promote high-quality care and lower costs,\u201d adding, \u201cCalifornia has participated in several of these programs.\u201d\n\nA SCAN Foundation policy brief highlights California\u2019s efforts \u201cto improve care for older adults and people with disabilities.\u201d Many counties are testing at least one new care delivery model under the ACA. For instance:\n\nCal MediConnect, the state\u2019s dual eligibles demonstration initiative, has been implemented in six counties, with another scheduled to be added in August;\n\nOne integrated dual eligible special needs plan is operating in the state, covering about 8,000 individuals in Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties;\n\n8 community-based care transition programs are operating in the state, covering residents in Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego and San Francisco counties;\n\n35 accountable care organizations are operating in the state, covering nearly 450,000 residents across 35 counties; and\n\nMedi-Cal health homes are expected to be launched in the same counties as Cal MediConnect in January 2016, with the program expanded to the remaining counties by July 2016.\n\nAll of the models are focused on improving coordinated care.\n\nHowever, even in California \u201cimplementation varies by county,\u201d creating \u201cchallenges in understanding the multitude of changes as well as how to engage in these new systems of care,\u201d according to Chernof.\n\nBarriers to Progress\n\n\u201cCalifornia, along with the rest of the nation, is facing workforce shortages to care for our aging population, particularly in our most rural areas,\u201d DHCS said. The agency added that Medi-Cal beneficiaries, caregivers, senior residents and individuals with disabilities must use a \u201cfragmented\u201d and \u201cdisconnected\u201d system to receive care.\n\n\u201cThis fragmentation often leads to beneficiary confusion, delayed care, inappropriate utilization and unnecessary costs,\u201d DHCS told California Healthline.\n\nMeanwhile, health information technology limitations also could affect the success of care delivery reforms under the ACA. Rhonda Richards, senior legislative representative for AARP\u2019s Government Affairs Health and Family Team, in an interview with California Healthline cited the importance of \u201cmaking sure long-term services providers are connected and able to communicate with other providers electronically or otherwise to share information and better coordinate care \u2026 along an array of care settings.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Richards said the inclusion of family caregivers in delivery system reforms will be a key to their success. While the infrastructure in place often lacks measures that ensure the inclusion of family caregivers, Richards said that \u201cefforts are underway to develop better quality measures.\u201d She added, \u201cSometimes [the measures] may be good and strong, but sometimes there are areas for improvement there.\u201d\n\nHowever, DHCS said programs to reform health care delivery \u201care an important way to surmount some of these challenges and reflect a new approach to delivering services,\u201d adding, \u201cThese challenges in the current system make programs that improve integration and coordination of care essential to improving population health.\u201d\n\nCalif., Other States Must Continue Momentum\n\n\u201cContinued efforts are critical, building on successes and lessons learned, including understanding which components of the programs work best to meet the range of needs among the state\u2019s diverse older adult population,\u201d according to the SCAN Foundation policy brief.\n\nChernof wrote that stakeholders\u2019 next steps should be to:\n\nCreate quality benchmarks that focus on the patient\u2019s idea of success;\n\nExpand the health assessment process to include functional needs as a rationale for comprehensive care; and\n\nPromote quality improvement evaluations at both the local and state levels to determine which programs are and are not working.\n\nIn California, the brief suggests officials also should focus on:\n\nDeveloping a strategy for oversight and implementation of long-term services and supports;\n\nIncreasing the affordability of long-term services and supports, as just 5% of Californians over age 40 are covered by long-term care insurance; and\n\nRecognizing and supporting the role of family caregivers, considering the state\u2019s low ranking \u2014 49th \u2014 in AARP\u2019s 2014 State LTSS Scorecard.\n\nIn addition, the SCAN Foundation has released a request for proposals to boost aging and disability coalitions in California. Such regional coalitions currently cover 95% of the state.\n\nWhat Does Success Look Like?\n\nMoving forward, Richards said, \u201cRegardless of the particular [care delivery] model, I think things that will be important are looking at how to make sure consumers who are using the models understand what will happen and how it works,\u201d as well as \u201cwhat changes will impact them and what it means for their care.\u201d\n\nAccording to Chernof, the \u201clast five years have produced real progress \u2026 at both the federal and state levels\u201d in better coordinating long-term care services. \u201cFor older adults, the ACA has fostered delivery system innovation at the state and regional levels.\u201d\n\nHowever, he noted, \u201cMost of these new models \u2026 are in the early stages of implementation\u201d and \u201cjudging the full success of these programs \u2026 will require more time and thoughtful evaluation.\u201d\n\nAround the Nation\n\nCutting off funding. GOP Sens. David Vitter (La.) and Ted Cruz (Texas) are aiming to cut off federal contributions that members of Congress and their staff use to purchase coverage through Washington, D.C.\u2019s small-business exchange.\n\nThe end draws near.
