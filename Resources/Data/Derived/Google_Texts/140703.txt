Michelin is recalling around 104,000 BF Goodrich tires used for light trucks and recreational vehicles because the sidewalls can rupture under severe use conditions.



The tire maker says no injuries or deaths have been tied to the problem.



Michelin North America Inc. says the recall involves several types of commercial and rugged terrain tires made in 2014 and 2015 and sold in the United States.



The tires are used on commercial trucks; full-size, heavy-duty vans; small RVs; and some one-ton pickup trucks.



The tire maker will send letters starting next week to affected customers, explaining the issue and telling them how the tires can be replaced at no charge.
