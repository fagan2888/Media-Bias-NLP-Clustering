(He directed a tiny film, \"What Do You Do All Day?\" starring himself, well before he was famous, though it was never released.) Among those who have brought a \u201ccinematic\u201d quality to television, he\u2019s one of the finest practitioners, having helped develop a house visual style that\u2019s as meticulous as the writing.\n\n\u201cAre You Here,\u201d by contrast, is a sloppy mess, albeit one that (though it doesn\u2019t seem so initially) is atypically ambitious \u2014 not in how much it tries but in the unusual thing it\u2019s trying to do. Owen Wilson plays Steve Dallas, a hedonistic weatherman who regularly shows up to the job minutes before airing. His best friend is Ben (Zach Galifianakis), a stoner and wannabe poet who suddenly loses his wealthy father, and must attend to the small town, Pennsylvania estate he's received. The idea is to take a broad comedy \u2014 say the kind that would star Owen Wilson and Zach Galifianakis \u2014 and gradually slip reality into its goofy confines.\n\nLaura Ramsey, center, is one of the only strong parts of \"Are You Here.\"\n\nCredit: Millenium Entertainment\n\nThat\u2019s not easy to do, especially for someone still green as a filmmaker. Experienced as Weiner is \u2014 and he cut his teeth on sitcoms before getting involved with \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d \u2014 he can\u2019t quite make the tonal transition work. It doesn\u2019t help that the comedy parts aren\u2019t too hot, with quips not even John Slattery could sell. More importantly, the characters simply aren\u2019t very interesting \u2014 not enough for a feature length film, or even something shorter than that. They\u2019re all stock: Wilson is the self-destructive guy who learns he\u2019s been crying on the inside the whole time; Galifianakis is a Galifianakisian holy fool who at one point streaks; Amy Poehler is a cold shrew who\u2019s also warmer on the inside.\n\nThing is, once it starts getting more serious, it sometimes actually works. Ignore a misjudged kiss in the rain during a pivotal moment; in its final stretch this unfunny comedy with characters who go through routine changes starts getting weird, almost mysterious. The final shot is the kind of bold, cryptic image that would close out a \u201cMad Men\u201d episode (although it\u2019s not that mesmerizing \u2014 more in comparison to all the preceded it). All of the actors handle the more melancholic, recognizable human parts of their characters well; as in \u201cIt\u2019s Kind of a Funny Story,\u201d Galifianakis excels at drama when he\u2019s at his most quiet. But it\u2019s too little too late. The only one who holds her own throughout is Laura Ramsey, who plays the mistress to Galifianakis\u2019 dead father and avoids every gold digger stereotype. Whatever maturity \u201cAre You Here\u201d has is there when she\u2019s onscreen.\n\nFollow Matt Prigge on Twitter @mattprigge", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review: Sadly, Matthew Weiner's 'Are You Here' is a surreally sloppy dramedy", "author": "Matt Prigge", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "Review: Sadly, Matthew Weiner's 'Are You Here' is a surreally sloppy dramedy", "title": "Sadly, Matthew Weiner's 'Are You Here' is a surreally sloppy dramedy", "url": "http://www.metro.us/entertainment/sadly-matthew-weiner-s-are-you-here-is-a-surreally-sloppy-dramedy/tmWnht---47byZo8qJ2CyI/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$lkfjij32v4pywsgnb90w309yqs3qr1k/WEK_AreYouHere_0821-614x409.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "Review: Sadly, Matthew Weiner's 'Are You Here' is a surreally sloppy dramedy", "creator": "Matt Prigge", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$lkfjij32v4pywsgnb90w309yqs3qr1k/WEK_AreYouHere_0821-614x409.jpeg"}, "title": "Sadly, Matthew Weiner's 'Are You Here' is a surreally sloppy dramedy", "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "mediatype": "Article", "keywords": "Movies,Region National,movies,Amy Poehler, Are You Here, Laura Ramsey, Matthew Weiner, movies, Owen Wilson, reviews, Zach Galifianakis", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "date": "2014-10-10", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,US Legacy Import Automatic", "section": "/entertainment/movies", "published_time": "2014-08-20T19:12:22Z", "modified_time": "2014-08-20T19:12:22Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Movies,Region National,movies,Amy Poehler, Are You Here, Laura Ramsey, Matthew Weiner, movies, Owen Wilson, reviews, Zach Galifianakis"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab63\"", "article_summary": "Owen Wilson plays Steve Dallas, a hedonistic weatherman who regularly shows up to the job minutes before airing.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the comedy parts aren\u2019t too hot, with quips not even John Slattery could sell.\nOwen Wilson and Zach Galifianakis bro down in \"Are You Here.\"\nCredit: Millenium Entertainment\u2018Are You Here\u2019Director: Matthew WeinerStars: Owen Wilson, Zach GalifianakisRating: R2 (out of 5) GlobesThere\u2019s no joy in reporting the lousiness of \u201cAre You Here,\u201d the first big movie directed by \u201cMad Men\u201d creator and showrunner Matthew Weiner.\nThe idea is to take a broad comedy \u2014 say the kind that would star Owen Wilson and Zach Galifianakis \u2014 and gradually slip reality into its goofy confines."}
