The Democratic presidential hopefuls are neck-and-neck in the polls and are ramping up efforts to claim the critical state.\n\nWhile Sanders was considered a longshot when he joined the race in May 2015, the self-described socialist has gained massive momentum in the months leading up to the first \u2013 and arguably most critical \u2013 electoral event of the nomination season, the February 1 Iowa Caucus.\n\nREAD MORE: Bernie gains double-digit lead on Hillary in New Hampshire \u2013 poll\n\nThis newfound competition has prompted Clinton, the establishment favorite, to accelerate her attacks against the Vermont senator.\n\nClinton has long used electability as the bread-and-butter of her attacks against Sanders, painting him as a candidate who is too idealistic and perhaps too radical to beat a Republican in the general election. While campaigning in Indianola, Iowa on Thursday, she said that she\u2019s \"not interested in ideas that sound good on paper but will never make it in the real world,\u201d referring to Sanders\u2019 plan of a European-style single-payer healthcare system.\n\nHowever, this argument is beginning to lose its punch. A recent New Hampshire poll shows Sanders defeating all top Republican contenders by a much larger margin than Clinton.\n\n\"@HillaryClinton says Dems should look at which candidate is most electable. We couldn\u2019t agree more.\u201d - Jeff Weaver pic.twitter.com/kOUVJx4Ycq \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) January 24, 2016\n\n\u201cIf you want somebody who is going to beat Donald Trump, who is going to beat the other Republicans, I think Bernie Sanders is that candidate,\" Sanders said while campaigning in Iowa last Tuesday.\n\nThe independent senator has hit back with attacks of his own, accusing Clinton of running a \u201cdesperate\u201d campaign, as well as leveraging the fact that the former secretary of state has deep ties to Wall Street.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that you can get huge speaking fees from Goldman Sachs and then with a straight face tell the American people that you\u2019re prepared to do what is necessary to take on the greed and illegal behavior on Wall Street,\u201d Sanders said at a recent campaign stop, according to the Washington Post.\n\nPerhaps attempting to not telegraph an air of desperation and negativity that Sanders has already criticized, Clinton has dialed back her attacks in the days leading up to the Iowa Caucus. Clinton, who served for four years as secretary of state in the Obama administration, is repositioning her rhetoric to say that she\u2019s the true heir to President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy.\n\n\"Let's build on what we have. We have been moving, in our nation, thankfully, in a positive, progressive direction. Maybe not as fast as some hope, but we keep moving forward,\" Clinton said Sunday on a stop in Marion, Iowa, according to CNN.\n\nClinton\u2019s tapped into something obvious but important: Many Democrats like Obama, and are proud of Obamacare. \u2014 Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) January 18, 2016\n\nSanders, however, has compared his competition with Clinton to her 2008 Iowa Caucus battle with then-candidate Obama, who won Iowa and the presidency despite criticism over his experience and policy proposals \u2013 criticism that mirrors what the two-term senator is facing today.\n\n\"Eight years ago, Obama was attacked for everything. He was unrealistic. His ideas were pie in the sky. He did not have the experience that was needed. But you know what, the people of Iowa saw through those attacks then and they're going to see through those attacks again,\" Sanders said.\n\nIowa newspaper in Council Bluffs: \"Bernie Sanders would build on Obama\u2019s legacy, challenge establishment\" https://t.co/b2IYAXlZhX \u2014 Zaid Jilani (@ZaidJilani) January 24, 2016\n\nObama chimed in on the campaign in a Monday interview with Politico, and seemed to favor Clinton\u2019s approach to the race. He said that he didn\u2019t think that Sanders\u2019 comparison of his Iowa run to the president\u2019s own 2008 campaign was accurate.\n\n\"I think Bernie came in with the luxury of being a complete longshot and just letting loose,\" Obama said. \"I think that what Hillary presents is a recognition that translating values into governance and delivering the goods is ultimately the job of politics, making a real-life difference to people in their day-to-day lives.\u201d\n\nHowever, the president admitted that Vermont senator is the more authentic of the two candidates. The Sanders campaign hasn\u2019t been weighed down by a sense that he will shift in any direction to gain vote like Clinton\u2019s has, such as with her sudden opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership; her new, stricter position on guns; or her change of heart on gay marriage.\n\nYou can't question Bernie Sanders authenticity. He's been saying/believing in the same things for over 30 years. \u2014 Landon Leuck (@landonleuck) January 25, 2016\n\n\"Bernie is somebody who, although I don't know as well because he wasn't, obviously, in my administration, has the virtue of saying exactly what he believes, and great authenticity, great passion, and is fearless,\" Obama said. \"His attitude is, 'I got nothing to lose\u2019.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "With only a week before primary season kicks off in Iowa, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders face each other in a final debate.
