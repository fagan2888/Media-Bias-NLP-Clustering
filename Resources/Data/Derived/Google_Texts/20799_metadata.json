On July 14, 1789, the French King Louis XVI didn\u2019t even take note of the beginning of the storming of the Bastille\u2014that is, the beginning of the French Revolution. In his diary that day, Louis simply wrote the word Rien\u2014\u201cnothing.\u201d And similarly, here in America, on May 5, 2015, the media, and the punditariat in general, failed to notice Mike Huckabee\u2019s paradigm-shifting argument on health care.\n\nSo perhaps a little explanation is in order: In the long run, history will demand it.\n\nAs is obligatory for every Republican these days, Huckabee, in his presidential announcement, attacked President Obama\u2019s signature national health insurance scheme, and yet he mentioned \u201cObamacare\u201d just twice. By contrast, he mentioned the word \u201ccures\u201d five times. As Huckabee put it, \u201cReal health care reform is going to focus on prevention and cures, rather than costly intervention. Because hope comes from finding cures for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer\u2019s.\u201d And that\u2019s the point: Health insurance is an important issue, and yet it is not as important as health itself.\n\nIn his folksy way, Huckabee recalled the public-health successes of his own childhood in his own little hometown of Hope: \u201cWe once lined up at the courthouse in the 1950s and took our vaccines and eradicated polio.\u201d That was not only a great humanitarian victory\u2014-a victory over the fearful epidemic of polio, as recalled recently by Philip Roth in his 2010 novel, Nemesis\u2014but a huge economic victory, as well. Medical philanthropist Michael Milken observes, \u201cWhen I was a child in the early 1950s, economists estimated that by the year 2000, treating polio would cost the United States $100 billion annually. Today\u2019s polio immunization programs cost one thousand times less than that and have virtually eliminated the disease.\u201d\n\nNot bad. And those are the sorts of exponential savings that only breakthrough science can bring. Indeed, according to University of Chicago economists Kevin Murphy and Richard Topel, recent savings to the economy because of better health technology amount to more than $3 trillion.\n\nIf that sort of number-crunching is unfamiliar to most Americans, that\u2019s because, for the last quarter-century, the issue of health has been mostly dominated\u2014both on the left and on the right\u2014by discussions of health insurance. Yes, the finance of health care is important, but the science of health care is more important. Think about it: When you go to the doctor, the first words out of your mouth are likely to be a discussion of the pain, or the lump, or recollection of what killed your relatives. You go to the doctor to seek a cure, not to make a payment.\n\nAnd if we get cancer, God forbid, the words that come to us spontaneously are the words of fighting and combat, not economic consumption. We say, with gritty determination, \u201cI am going to beat this cancer,\u201d or, \u201cI am going to kill this cancer.\u201d We don't say, blandly and economistically, \u201cI am going to consume oncological services.\u201d And we certainly don\u2019t embrace the Washington wonk talk, left or right: That is, nobody says, \u201cIn my cancer treatment, I will fulfill President Obama\u2019s injunction to bend the health care-cost curve downward.\u201d Nor do we say, \u201cIn my cancer treatment, I will vindicate the free-market theories of Adam Smith or Ayn Rand.\u201d\n\nHuckabee gets that. His Cure Strategy is all about saving money by helping people stay and become healthy. As he said on Tuesday, \u201cCures, real cures, could give real hope to families who hear a dreaded diagnosis and are sentenced to a slow and agonizing death. Alzheimer\u2019s disease alone will cost well over $1 trillion by the year 2050. Focusing on cures instead of treatments saves money, lives and families.\u201d\n\nYes, diseases such Alzheimer\u2019s are a middle-class issue\u2014AD robs people, both patient and caregiver alike, of time, money, identity, and dignity. Moreover, as the Alzheimer\u2019s Association has documented, the current AD epidemic will be completely unaffordable in the decades ahead. Unabated, AD costs will make a hash of everyone\u2019s health insurance plan, public, private, or in-between. Indeed, by mid-century, we will either go bankrupt or be forced to consider euthanizing our elderly\u2014two grossly unacceptable outcomes.\n\nHappily, in his new initiative, Huckabee has finally found a plausible way to save money on entitlement spending. The frontal assault on Social Security and Medicare has always been a political loser for decades: It\u2019s one thing to ask Republicans to take career risks to achieve budget savings; it\u2019s another to ask them to commit political suicide. From a Republican point of view, there\u2019s nothing worse than the dolorous scenario of GOPers voting for entitlement cuts, losing the next election, and then seeing the victorious Democrats defiantly prop up elder spending.\n\nMeanwhile, paradoxically, even as health care spending goes up, the number of new cures has been going down. As Washington has wrangled over first Clintoncare and then Obamacare, the \u201cpipeline\u201d of new cures has been stifled by regulation, litigation, and price controls. And so new drug approvals, while up in the last few years, are actually lower than they were 20 years ago. We might ask ourselves: What else, in the realm of technological accomplishment, is worse today than it was in the \u201990s? The answer: nothing.\n\nThe sad reality of medicine in our time is summed up in what wags call \u201cEroom\u2019s Law,\u201d which is Moore\u2019s Law spelled backwards. And that\u2019s what has happened to cures: We get less, even as spending for the ravages of disease continues its inexorable rise.\n\nOf course, Huckabee is not the only leader who has noticed this cure-pipeline blockage. In 2014, Representative Fred Upton (R-MI), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has teamed with Representative Diana DeGette (D-CO) to develop a bipartisan legislative initiative that they and their colleagues call #Path2Cures. And on the other side of the Capitol, Republican Senators Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin are exploring new ways to incentivize cures, such as X-Prizes. Even President Obama is on board; his Precision Medicine Initiative, announced this year, offers vastly more hope for real savings in health care than another round of price controls. And once again, the underlying argument is simple: A cure is cheaper than care. It costs less to beat than to treat.\n\nBut now the time has come to raise the saliency of the Cures Cause. As is said of Islamic jihadism, you can\u2019t defeat an enemy that you can\u2019t or won\u2019t name. And so if we want to win the war against AD, cancer, and diabetes\u2014to name just three costly killers\u2014we will have to declare war. Thankfully, some of Huckabee\u2019s rivals for the 2016 Republican nomination, including Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz, are working on Cure Strategies of their own.\n\n\n\nIndeed, in the wake of Huckabee\u2019s announcement, potential Democratic presidential candidate Jim Webb tweeted out, \u201cWe need to find a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s. I know we can solve this problem.\u201d That\u2019s the right idea: When you see a problem, solve it, party label be damned.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

President Kennedy didn\u2019t live to see that come true. But I did. And it made me believe that America could do anything it set its mind to.\u201d\n\nHuckabee himself may never become president. But he has put forth a vision, the old \u201cCan Do\u201d American spirit, which is more important than anyone\u2019s personal ambition. It\u2019s that Kennedyesque \u201cmoon shot\u201d determination\u2014as JFK said in 1962, \u201cto organize and measure the best of our energies and skills\u201d\u2014that will deliver the cure for Alzheimer\u2019s and other dreaded diseases.
