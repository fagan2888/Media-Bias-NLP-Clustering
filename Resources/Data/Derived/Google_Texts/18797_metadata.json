The Obama Labor Department didn\u2019t see the law the same way, however, and issued a re-interpretation.\n\nThis was a worrying development for the Mortgage Bankers Association, which represents banks that relied on the original interpretation and whose interests were greatly affected by the re-interpretation, but were given neither notice nor the chance to comment on the change. The MBA thus sued the Labor Department, arguing that the re-interpretation violated the Administrative Procedure Act, the 1946 law that determined (among other things) the processes that agencies must go through when exercising their \u201cinterpretive\u201d and \u201clegislative\u201d powers\u2014that is, when they interpret laws and when they make their own regulations.\n\nUnder the APA, agencies have to give affected parties notice and the opportunity for comment when making legislative rules, but do not have to do so when they merely make interpretive rules. The MBA argued that the APA requires an agency to go through the notice-and-comment process when it changes its interpretation of a law or regulation to such a degree that it is effectively making a legislative rule.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit agreed with the MBA, and now the Supreme Court has decided to review the case. The government argues that agencies are due deference when they change the application of a law through interpretive rules\u2014so long as they come in the form of an interpretation\u2014and that the courts don\u2019t get a say regarding when this action becomes a legislative rulemaking.\n\nCato disagrees with the government\u2019s position\u2014if there\u2019s anything our country needs, it\u2019s not fewer checks on the administrative state\u2014and has filed a brief supporting the MBA, joined by the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Judicial Education Network, and with former White House Counsel Boyden Gray as co-counsel. In our brief, we examine the APA\u2019s framers\u2019 goal of rebutting the government\u2019s assertion of administrative power. We argue that the boundary between \u201cinterpretive\u201d and \u201clegislative\u201d rules is a blurry one that should be policed by the courts. The APA\u2019s architects assumed that the courts would play such a role; they wouldn\u2019t have made interpretive rulemaking so procedurally easy otherwise. Scholarly sources and legislative history agree that judicial review is necessary\u2014for example, determining when \u201cinterpretive\u201d flip-flopping necessitates greater due-process protection\u2014to protect those whose livelihood depends on relying on and complying with agency interpretations.\n\nIn sum, our brief looks to history to make clear a few important points that only the government would dispute. In a time when more people\u2019s lives are staked on administrative rulings than ever before, we shouldn\u2019t weaken the APA\u2019s due-process protections. This case boils down to the government\u2019s desire for agencies to more easily exercise power and for the subjects of regulations to have a harder time challenging that awesome authority. We, with the APA\u2019s framers, think it should be the other way around.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear oral argument in Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Association on December 1.\n\nThis blogpost was coauthored by Cato legal associate Julio Colomba.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Labor Department attempts to change the rules of the mortgage game without regard to those who built their businesses around the previous rules.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "The Labor Department attempts to change the rules of the mortgage game without regard to those who built their businesses around the previous rules.", "title": "Now More Than Ever, Courts Should Police Administrative Agencies", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/now-more-ever-courts-should-police-administrative-agencies", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/now-more-ever-courts-should-police-administrative-agencies", "title": "Now More Than Ever, Courts Should Police Administrative Agencies", "description": "The Labor Department attempts to change the rules of the mortgage game without regard to those who built their businesses around the previous rules.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2014/10/16", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-17T10:07:00-04:00"}, "publication_date": "2014/10/17", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e29\"", "article_summary": "We argue that the boundary between \u201cinterpretive\u201d and \u201clegislative\u201d rules is a blurry one that should be policed by the courts.\nUnder the APA, agencies have to give affected parties notice and the opportunity for comment when making legislative rules, but do not have to do so when they merely make interpretive rules.\nIn our brief, we examine the APA\u2019s framers\u2019 goal of rebutting the government\u2019s assertion of administrative power.\nThe APA\u2019s architects assumed that the courts would play such a role; they wouldn\u2019t have made interpretive rulemaking so procedurally easy otherwise.\nIn a time when more people\u2019s lives are staked on administrative rulings than ever before, we shouldn\u2019t weaken the APA\u2019s due-process protections."}
