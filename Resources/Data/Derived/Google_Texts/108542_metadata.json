Pat Roberts in calling on Congress to expand agricultural trade with Cuba.\n\n\u201cAgriculture has long been used as a tool \u2014 not a weapon \u2014 for peace and stability,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt is my hope that Cuba will embrace the practices of free trade, enterprise and commerce, so that both countries will gain from increased relations.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019 remarks opened a hearing of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. The Kansas Republican is chairman of the committee.\n\nAlong with officials from the U.S. Agriculture, Commerce and Treasury departments, the Senate committee heard from members of the agricultural business community.\n\nDoug Keesling, owner of Keesling Seed Farms in Chase, provided written testimony. Keesling, a Kansas wheat commissioner, traveled to Cuba last month with the U.S. Agriculture Coalition for Cuba, a group that advocates for enhanced trade between the two countries.\n\n\u201cFrom what I could see, there is a lot of potential in Cuba: potential in its own agriculture sector and potential as a market for U.S. agricultural exports,\u201d Keesling testified. \u201cAs a Kansas wheat farmer, that potential was obvious every time a meal included bread.\u201d\n\nAccording to Keesling, Cuba imports 30 million bushels of wheat annually. \u201cThat would be over 10 percent of all the wheat grown in Kansas, going to this one island just a couple days sail from U.S. ports,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile commonly consumed on the island country, very little wheat is grown in Cuba. Cubans import grain from Canada and Europe but not the U.S. because of trade restrictions between the U.S. and Cuba dating back to the 1960 embargo.\n\nIn his State of the Union address this January, President Barack Obama urged Congress to begin lifting the Cuban embargo. The president has since re-established diplomatic ties with the Caribbean country.\n\n\u201cForeign policy does not happen in a vacuum,\u201d Roberts said Tuesday. \u201cWe have to take a realistic approach and work out a step-by-step plan towards lifting the embargo.\u201d\n\nIn January, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., called for ending the embargo with Cuba, in part due to the possibility of enhanced agricultural trade for Kansas farmers.\n\n\u201cWhen wheat, for example, is not sold to Cuba, it\u2019s not that they\u2019re not buying wheat, it\u2019s that wheat\u2019s being purchased from some other place: our competitors,\u201d Moran said in a speech Jan. 8.\n\nIn his testimony Tuesday, Keesling said federal restrictions on trade with Cuba are putting U.S. farmers at a competitive disadvantage.\n\n\u201cI can put my wheat in an elevator in Kansas, send it by rail down to the Gulf of Mexico, and put it on a ship that\u2019s just a couple days away from the Havana Harbor,\u201d Keesling explained. \u201cBut my wheat is still going to lose out to wheat that has to be on a boat for a week from Canada or two weeks from France.\u201d\n\nThe reasons for that, according to Keesling, are laws such as the requirement that American exporters receive cash before they are allowed to unload their product in a Cuban port. By not allowing Cubans to purchase wheat on credit, American exporters are losing out to Canadian and European companies that don\u2019t require cash transactions, Keesling said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to me that if somebody wants to buy the wheat I grow, they have to jump through all sorts of regulatory hoops,\u201d Keesling testified. \u201cNo matter what kind of government a country has, everyone should have access to affordable food, and we should do everything we can with our policies to facilitate access to American food products.\u201d\n\nKeesling called on Congress to repeal regulatory obstacles and trade sanctions on Cuba.\n\n\u201cCuba has enormous economic potential, and while it certainly remains a communist country, that hardly justifies the scale of the sanctions, especially when trade relations with other communist countries are growing deeper all the time,\u201d he testified.\n\nIn a news release Wednesday, Kansas Secretary of Agriculture Jackie McClaskey said Cuba deserves consideration as Kansas farmers seek to expand their markets.\n\n\"Kansas ranchers and farmers produce some of the best beef and pork in the world and our wheat and feed grains are sought out around the world,\" McClaskey said. \"It makes sense that we should be looking to add new trading partners.\"", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, State, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "In U.S. Senate testimony Tuesday, a former chairman of the Kansas Wheat Commission joined Sen.
