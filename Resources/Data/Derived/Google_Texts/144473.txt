CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy — A women’s World Cup downhill slated for Saturday has been postponed due to heavy snowfall, delaying Lindsey Vonn’s pursuit for the all-time wins record again.

Organizers announced the decision early Saturday, moving the downhill to Sunday and a super-G that had been scheduled for Sunday to Monday.

Vonn needs one win to match Annemarie Moser-Proell’s record of 62 victories. The American was only 10th in Friday’s downhill in Cortina, which was won by Elena Fanchini of Italy on a shortened course.

Friday’s race was originally scheduled for Bad Kleinkircheim last weekend, which was postponed due to difficult weather conditions in the Austrian resort.

The snowfall in Cortina is expected to slow by Sunday.

Vonn tweets, “Way too much snow. Hoping tomorrow it will be clear #backtobed”
