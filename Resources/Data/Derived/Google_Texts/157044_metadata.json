No longer is he certain to be available when the Nuggets pick in the No. 7 slot.\n\nHezonja is the best player at his position in the draft. At 6-foot-8 and 200 pounds, his athleticism is off the charts, and he shoots the ball with accuracy well beyond 3-point range.\n\nHe has a connection to Denver too: Nuggets center Jusuf Nurkic. They are friends.\n\n\u201cI talk to him every day,\u201d Nurkic said. \u201cI think he\u2019s at this age the best shooting guard.\u201d\n\nHezonja, 20, didn\u2019t participate in predraft workouts or do interviews with NBA teams because his team in Europe, FC Barcelona, was still playing. But teams in the NBA are well versed on his talent.\n\nWATCH: Who are the true playmakers in the NBA Draft?\n\nStill, just in case Nuggets general manager Tim Connelly needs an extra nudge, Nurkic fully endorses Hezonja. But he smiled when asked if he really would tell Connelly whom to draft.\n\nNo,\u201d Nurkic said, laughing. \u201cBut it would be great if he comes.\u201d\n\nHezonja\u2019s upside. It starts with his athleticism. He attacks the rim with fire and flair. He has the quickness and speed to fill lanes on the fast break, and he gets to the rim with a desire to dunk.\n\n\u201cHe can jump,\u201d Nurkic said, then grinned, adding, \u201cWhite guy can jump.\u201d\n\nHezonja is effective in a pick-and-roll offense, particularly when he keeps the ball, but he also has the ability to make good decisions with the ball as a passer in pick-and-roll situations.\n\nHezonja is capable of creating his own shot. A 38 percent 3-point shooter in Euroleague play, he can \u201ccatch and shoot\u201d with ease and has a good jumper off pull-up dribbles.\n\nDefensively, he has the ability to be active with pressure on the ball and is good fighting through screens. If he is posted up, he works to fight off the challenge from a heavier player.\n\nHezonja\u2019s downside. Though he is good defensively, his effort on that end of the court isn\u2019t always there. And as with many other young players, he gets caught watching the ball at times and gets beaten on backdoor cuts. While he does have good length and decent lateral quickness, he will get beaten off the dribble.\n\nBut of most concern to many is the type of teammate he would be in the NBA. The rap on Hezonja is he might be too cocky for his own good and gets selfish on the offensive end. Nurkic, though, disputes that notion.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good guy,\u201d Nurkic said. \u201cLike me, he just has confidence.\u201d\n\nNuggets\u2019 fit? Hezonja projects as a shooting guard with the Nuggets, but he also could play small forward, depending on what they need. He would improve their shooting and finishing at the rim.\n\nComing Monday: Justise Winslow\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost\n\nMario hezonja\n\nAge: 20\n\nHeight, weight: 6-foot-8, 200 pounds\n\nHometown: Dubrovnik, Croatia\n\nDraft projection: No. 5 to No. 9 pick", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets evaluating offensively gifted Mario Hezonja for NBA draft", "title": "Nuggets evaluating offensively gifted Mario Hezonja for NBA draft", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/20/nuggets-evaluating-offensively-gifted-mario-hezonja-for-nba-draft/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150620__hezojap1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150620__hezojap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-20T17:30:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T13:59:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "With the NBA draft coming Thursday, few prospects are creating more buzz than Croatian shooting guard Mario Hezonja.\nEditor\u2019s note: First of a series on top players in this week\u2019s NBA draft whom the Nuggets are considering for the No.\nWATCH: Who are the true playmakers in the NBA Draft?\nHezonja projects as a shooting guard with the Nuggets, but he also could play small forward, depending on what they need.\nStill, just in case Nuggets general manager Tim Connelly needs an extra nudge, Nurkic fully endorses Hezonja."}
