Sioux Falls, SD

The KELOLAND News team is honored to have a new trophy in our collection.

KELOLAND This Morning anchor Matt Holsen and Meteorologist Brian Karstens won the 2014 Sioux Falls Ministry Center's Third Annual Celebrity Chili Cook Off. It was a team effort that included vegetables from the Karstens' family garden, a food processor from KELOLAND This Morning co-anchor Casey Wonnenberg, and a recipe from assignment editor Dexter Gronseth.

The event was a fundraiser for the Sioux Falls Ministry Center, which provides operational cost savings and empowerment to Christian outreach ministries by creating a "one-stop ministry mall."

We've had viewers ask for it and we wanted to share the now award-winning recipe for Cabin Fever Chili, which came from a recipe card picked up at a Safeway store.
