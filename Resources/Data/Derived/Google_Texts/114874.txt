Speaking at the Benefits Selling Expo is an exciting way to showcase the success stories of our partners and how they have been able to help their clients save money. The financial burden of health care leans heavily on employers and employees alike. Employers are looking for low-cost solutions to offset increasing premiums, which has ultimately led them to offer employees high-deductible health plans with HSAs.

Products such as Teladoc with a $0 consult fee, Health Advocate, or dental, vision, and pharmacy can help employees save on out-of-pocket expenses while driving claims off the groupâ€™s policy. For around $5 to $10 per employee per month, employers can save money by reducing their claims experience while giving back to their employees.
