From celebrity meltdowns and shocking deaths to political struggles and international gaffes, 2013 had plenty of \u201cOh no she better don\u2019t!\u201d moments.\n\nBelow, check out the Top 10 shockers, scoundrels and hot messes of 2013.\n\nSHOCKERS\n\nCory Monteith Dies Of An Overdose\n\nGleeks the world over were speechless when Monteith was found dead in a Vancouver hotel room on July 13. The coroner\u2019s report eventually pinned his death on an overdose of heroin and alcohol.\n\nAt the Teen Choice Awards in August, Lea Michele offered her co-star boyfriend a touching tribute, saying \u201cWhether you knew him personally or just as Finn Hudson, Cory reached out and became a part of all of our hearts \u2014 and that\u2019s where he\u2019ll stay forever.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court Overturns DOMA and Prop 8\n\nAll of gay America and her allies were freaking out as the Supreme Court took its damn sweet time issuing verdicts in Hollingsworth vs. Perry and United States vs. Windsor, two cases with profound implications for marriage equality in America. On June 26, our prayers were answered and the highest court in the land ruled that DOMA and Prop 8 were unconstitutional.\n\nOf course we still need to find a man to marry.\n\n\n\nWentworth Miller Comes Out As A Gay\n\nHe\u2019d been off the scene for a few years, but when Prison Break was on the air, Wentworth Miller was something of a household name (and the subject of our fantasies). The actor-director decided to come out this year after being invited to attend a film festival in St. Petersburg, Russia, which recently passed a gay-propaganda ban. \u201cAs a gay man, I must decline,\u201d he told organizers.\n\nCEO of Barilla Pasta Burns Gays\n\nIn September Guido Barilla, CEO of Barilla Pasta, said he\u2019d never cast a gay person in his commercials, adding \u201cIf the gays don\u2019t like it they can go and eat another brand\u201d.\n\nAny gays who still ate carbs dumped their Barilla and a series of clever advertisements by other, less hateful pasta companies emerged to stick it to the prejudiced pasta company. Eventually the CEO issued an apology, but we\u2019re sticking with Chef Boyardee.\n\nShangela Breaks A Leg\n\nHallelu! Everyone\u2019s favorite post-modern pimp-ho smashed up her leg something fierce while attempting a death-drop at the RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Halloween party. All queens on hand swore on a stack of RuPaul CDs that they hadn\u2019t sabotaged Shangie, who is recovering at home in Texas after several weeks in a New York hospital.\n\nMiley Cyrus Twerks Like Lolita\n\nThe twerk that launched a thousand think pieces: Miley\u2019s inmfamous VMA performance instantly became one of the biggest shockers of 2013, with responses ranging from applause to concern-trolling to outright anger. Scandalizing America when she got up on Robyn Thicke, Miley enabled both of them to become the most popular Halloween costumes of the year.\n\nPaul Walker Dies In Fiery Car Crash\n\nOn November 30, fans were shocked to learn Walker had perished in a fiery automobile crash alongside friend Roger Rodas. The fact that he was most famous for the successful Fast and Furious action-flick franchise only added to the senseless tragedy.\n\nTom Daley Starts Dating A Guy\n\nThe dreamiest of dreamboats, Tom Daley, came out in a simple but touching YouTube video this December. Soon enough, rumors began to surface that the boyfriend whose love encouraged Daley to share his story was none other than Milk screenwriter Dustin Lance Black. In recent days pictures have surfaced that seem to confirm the gossip. Get it, girl!\n\nKinky Boots Ruins Thanksgiving\n\nConservatives were livid that the Kinky Boots cast performed during the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day parade, complaining that drag queens ruined the wholesome and spiritual nature of what is essentially a five-hour commercial for Mr. Peanut, Disney and Ocean Spray. Fortunately, Billy Porter and the Boots cast responded in the best way possible: with a Macy\u2019s shopping spree in drag.\n\nIndia Re-criminalizes Homosexuality\n\nWhile international attention was focused on Russia\u2019s abysmal record on LGBT rights and the passage of a \u201cgay-propaganda\u201d ban, India surprised us when the country\u2019s highest court reversed an earlier decision decriminalizing homosexuality. The judges\u2019 ruled that it was up to the legislature to repeal Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, but the end result is that it\u2019s now a crime to be gay in the world\u2019s largest democracy.\n\nSCOUNDRELS\n\nVladimir Putin\n\nIn case you don\u2019t, y\u2019know, read, Vladimir Putin is the Russian president who\u2019s overseen the passage of a nationwide ban on gay propaganda (in essence any public mention or demonstration of homosexuality). What stunned us even more was that he was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize this year. What the what?!?\n\nAlec Baldwin\n\nIn 2013, the 30 Rock star lashed out at paparazzi with homophobic slurs\u2014twice!\u2014and saw stalwarts of public decency Anne Coulter and Joan Rivers rush to his defense. MSNBC, meanwhile, canceled his low-rated talk show.\n\nChris Brown\n\nAfter a lengthy history of violence, abuse and illegal acts, it almost seemed like Chris Brown was on the road to recovery. We even took note of his attempts at pro-LGBT advocacy. But then Brown ruined it all by getting in another slur-laden brawl. Way to drop the ball, Breezy.\n\nDayna Morales\n\nHey, gay people can be scumbags, too: Dayna Morales, a waitress in Bridgewater, New Jersey, told reporters that instead of a tip, a customer left her a nasty note informing her that \u201cI don\u2019t agree with your lifestyle & how you live your life.\u201d\n\nMembers of the public sent in thousands of dollars to Morales, a former Marine who claimed she was donating the money to the Wounded Warrior Project. But within a few days it became apparent she forged the note and had invented the whole incident.\n\nSince that revelation, Morales has been fired. She probably can\u2019t set foot inside her local lesbian bookstore, either.\n\nEminem\n\nWe thought we were done with Eminem\u2019s homophobic lyrics\u2014mainly because we thought we were done with Eminem. But Slim Shady emerged in October 2013 to drop a new album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, and a new anti-gay track, \u201cRap God.\u201d With Em stating that \u201call you faggots think the same\u201d and his desire to \u201cbreak a motherfuckin\u2019 table over the back of a couple of faggots,\u201d it\u2019s clearly the heartwarming love ballad of the year.\n\nScott Lively\n\nThis Massachusetts minister doesn\u2019t just preach against the gays\u2014he helped Uganda draft it\u2019s \u201cKill the Gays\u201d bill. This year, he bragged about having inspired Russia\u2019s ban on gay propaganda. \u201cI believe I did have something to do with that,\u201d Lively told fellow scoundrel Bryan Fisher. \u201cI included [these suggestions] in my letter to the Russian people that I published in the very last city of the tour, which was St. Petersburg, and of course, St. Petersburg turns out to be the first city that adopted this law.\u201d\n\nLively called his influence on the legislation \u201cone of the proudest achievements of my career.\u201d Well that\u2019s not setting the bar very high, is it?\n\nPaula Deen\n\nTestifying in a racial-discrimination suit filed by a former staffer, Paula Deen shocked America when she admitted she used the N-word and dreamed of hosting a plantation wedding with black servants in \u201ccrisp, white tuxedos\u201d.\n\nThe butter queen offered a few teary-eyed apologies, but that ish was not easily forgotten. Especially when she tried to use the Supreme Court\u2019s Prop 8 ruling to say that, because they were both white, Deen\u2019s accuser wasn\u2019t personally affected by her racism.\n\nOrson Scott Card\n\nOrson Scott Card is the author of Ender\u2019s Game a wildly popular sci-fi novel that was poised to become a wildly successful movie. But Card is also a lunatic homophobe\u2014a board member of the National Organization for Marriage who has written that homosexuality is caused by a \u201cdisturbing seduction or rape or molestation or abuse\u201d and that gays prey on children.\n\nHe\u2019s also said that if gays were allowed to marry he would \u201cdestroy that government.\u201d\n\nSince Card would directly profit from Ender\u2019s Game ticket sales, a boycott was led by GeeksOut. It didn\u2019t destroy the film\u2019s box office, but it forced Lionsgate and the Ender\u2019s cast to address the issue. Card also stepped forward, telling EW everyone should just forget what he has said over the years:\n\nEnder\u2019s Game is set more than a century in the future and has nothing to do with political issues that did not exist when the book was written in 1984. With the recent Supreme Court ruling, the gay marriage issue becomes moot\u2026 Now it will be interesting to see whether the victorious proponents of gay marriage will show tolerance toward those who disagreed with them when the issue was still in dispute.\u201d\n\nDude is twisted.\n\nPat Robertson\n\nNaming Pat Robertson a scoundrel is almost too easy. But the heartless televangelist really outdid himself in August 2013, declaring gay men in San Francisco wore sharp rings in order to cut people and give them HIV. Just a month prior, he revealed he wished there was a \u201cVomit\u201d button on Facebook for whenever he saw a photo of a same-sex couple kissing.\n\nYou can just feel Christ\u2019s love oozing out of this man.\n\nCongressional Republicans\n\nOkay, GOP, we get it: You don\u2019t like the Affordable Care Act. That doesn\u2019t mean you can just shut down the government until you have your way. Grow up or sashay away.\n\nHOT MESSES\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nWe weren\u2019t going to put Miley on this list, but the girl declared herself a hot mess: In her documentary, The Movement, Cyrus described her twerktastic VMAs performance as \u201ca strategic hot mess.\u201d Showing wisdom beyond her years, she added \u201cYou\u2019re always going to make people talk. You might as well make them talk for like two weeks, rather than two seconds.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s a hot mess like a fox!\n\nLindsay Lohan\n\nOprah interviews, rehab, alcoholic parents, disastrous Lifetime movies: Almost everything Lilo did in 2013 was touched by scandal. Her on-set behavior was even examined by the New York Times, while her post-rehab partying continues to be tabloid fodder. But she did give us one undeniably great thing this year: this gif.\n\nAmanda Bynes\n\nWe had some fun playing with Amanda\u2019s bad hair-dids, but the schizophrenic sweetie went from humorously disastrous to straight-up sad when she started calling random celebrities ugly and revealing she wants Drake to \u201cmurder\u201d her vagina. (Well, we\u2019re with you on that last one, Mandy.)\n\nTila Tequila\n\nNow that it seems Bynes has settled down, Tequila has snatched her cray-cray crown: The bisexual reality star started posting anti-Semitic screeds and declaring Paul Walker\u2019s death was a ritual murder. Has anyone seen her wearing bad wigs lately?\n\nRob Ford\n\nWe didn\u2019t think Canada even had hot messes, but between Justin Bieber and Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, our neighbor to the north seems to be making up for lost time. In October a video surfaced of Ford smoking crack, though he claimed he had never touched the stuff. Days later, another video showed him ranting about wanting to kill someone. Ford then made a lewd reference to a sexual act with his wife during a press conference. And the guy still refused to step down!\n\nJames Franco\n\nDon\u2019t get us wrong, we still totally would. But James Franco\u2019s public behavior in 2013 has just been one big, homoerotic hot mess: Making out with himself, kissing a guy on the streets of L.A, taking his first shirtless selfie, doing a \u201cBound 2\u2033 parody with Seth Rogen, designing a fuck pad and, of course, posting those \u201c50 Shades Of Batman\u201d photos (above).\n\nKeep it coming in 2014, Mr. Franco.\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nKanye West\u2019s babymama didn\u2019t quite reach Lohan or Bynes level of hot-messiness. But she was clearly out of her mind when she wore a sofa to the Met Costume Institute Gala. And when she appeared in Yeezy\u2019s music video for \u201cBound 2,\u201d riding a motorcycle while Kanye rode her. (It did, however, give us this amazing parody.)\n\nJustin Bieber\n\nMonkey-abandoning, graffiti-loving, fan-spitting, fat-shaming, bucket-peeing narcisisstic brat Justin Bieber went on quite the tear in 2013: Perhaps the Beeb\u2019s most egregious Hot Mess Moment was when he visited Anne Frank\u2019s house in Amsterdam and wrote in the guest book that \u201chopefully she would have been a Belieber.\u201d\n\nGet real\u2014Anne was a total One Directioner.\n\nLady Gaga\n\nShe didn\u2019t quite reach Miley or Amanda level hot-messery, but Mother Monster was a bit all over the place as she cranked up the publicity machine for ARTPOP.\n\nHighlights include a bizarre Wizard of Oz-inspired performance on Good Morning America, wearing a huge ratty wig everywhere (above), wearing a Hovercraft dress at her artRave in Brooklyn, the brown condom dress she wore during her Thanksgiving special, channeling Marilyn Monroe in a JFK-inspired performance of \u201cDo What U Want\u201d with R Kelly at the AMAs and essentially becoming Donatella Versace in the new Versace ad campaign.\n\nOh, and lets not forget her decision to perform in space.\n\nPrince George of Cambridge\n\nWe just can\u2019t anymore with this baby. Ever since the bonny wee prince arrived in July, it\u2019s been a nonstop parade of pooping, belching, teething and spitting up. What is this, Untucked?\n\nGeorgie Girl, you better get it together in 2014!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tom Daley, Cory Monteith, Wentworth Miller, Russia, India, Alec Baldwin,", "og": {"site_name": "LOGO News", "description": "Tom Daley, Cory Monteith, Wentworth Miller, Russia, India, Alec Baldwin,", "title": "What A Year: 2013's Top 30 Shockers, Scoundrels And Hot Messes!", "url": "http://www.newnownext.com/top-10-scandals-of-2013/12/2013/", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:uma:image:logotv.com:10688316?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "height": 810}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newnownext.com/top-10-scandals-of-2013/12/2013/", "image": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:uma:image:logotv.com:10688316?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=500&height=375", "description": "Tom Daley, Cory Monteith, Wentworth Miller, Russia, India, Alec Baldwin,", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What A Year: 2013\u2019s Top 30 Shockers, Scoundrels And Hot Messes!"}, "sm4": {"category": "News Articles - Life News", "parent": "mgid:wordpress:siteloc:www.newnownext.com:hp", "pubdate": "2013-12-14 12:50:56 AM +0000", "creator": "20D502000002D52000010002D520", "author": "Eric Shorey", "alias": "post", "mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:www.newnownext.com:134823", "type": "post"}, "fb": {"admins": "unset", "app_id": "unset"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:www.newnownext.com:134823"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "MTVNVevoHelper": {"beacon": "D4F4BE78-454E-44C3-B142-F9D269B9303E"}, "thumbnail": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:newnownext.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-in-review-tom-daley-miley-cyrus-300x152.jpg?quality=0.8&format=jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17e9\"", "article_summary": "You might as well make them talk for like two weeks, rather than two seconds.\u201dShe\u2019s a hot mess like a fox!\nHOT MESSESMiley CyrusWe weren\u2019t going to put Miley on this list, but the girl declared herself a hot mess: In her documentary, The Movement, Cyrus described her twerktastic VMAs performance as \u201ca strategic hot mess.\u201d Showing wisdom beyond her years, she added \u201cYou\u2019re always going to make people talk.\nBelow, check out the Top 10 shockers, scoundrels and hot messes of 2013.\nEveryone\u2019s favorite post-modern pimp-ho smashed up her leg something fierce while attempting a death-drop at the RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Halloween party.\nFortunately, Billy Porter and the Boots cast responded in the best way possible: with a Macy\u2019s shopping spree in drag."}
