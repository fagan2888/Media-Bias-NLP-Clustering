Now speculation makes it look like Shawn and Kaitlyn might have taken a huge step in their relationship. They have been spending a lot of time at his house in Nashville and it is starting to look like Kaitlyn might have moved in with Shawn. E! Online recently shared what all Shawn and Kaitlyn have shared that has their fans wondering if she is living with him. These two have not really been apart since the show ended filming.\n\nhttps://instagram.com/p/76WRJAwDs-\n\nShawn went to Snapchat and shared that Kaitlyn was packing a lot of suitcases. Bristowe is actually hanging out with him in Nashville now and talking about feeling domestic. They are not being shy about the fact that Kaitlyn is staying there with him right now, but nobody really knows for sure if she has actually moved into his house and got rid of her own home. Kaitlyn went to Snapchat as well and spoke out.\n\n\u201cHow do you live like this. The guy does not match up his socks, so I have to do it for him. I\u2019m so domesticated. There\u2019s something about wearing an engagement ring and folding your man\u2019s socks.\u201d\n\nKaitlyn Bristowe has been sharing that she was leaving Vancouver to head to the U.S.A. Bristowe and Booth have never actually said that Kaitlyn moved down here, but they are really making it look that way. Shawn and Kaitlyn are constantly posting on social networks that they are together. At this time, Kaitlyn is at least staying with him in Nashville. Things are looking pretty good for this couple.\n\nRumors flew not long ago that Kaitlyn Bristowe and Shawn Booth could be faking their love story just to continue getting paid and making money from endorsements and appearances. Sources have even shared that the two are sleeping in separate beds, but these recent developments make it hard to believe that this is true. The sources made it sound like their love story is already over. Shawn and Kaitlyn really do seem like things are going great though, if you check Shawn and Kaitlyn\u2019s social networks.\n\nLeaving Marina del Rey after a productive weekend!! LOVED staying at @marinadelreyhotel but excited to get to Nashville with @shawn_booth18 A photo posted by Kaitlyn Bristowe (@kaitlynbristowe) on Sep 30, 2015 at 8:15am PDT\n\nHollywood Take recently shared that a source claimed that Kaitlyn Bristowe and Shawn Booth had plans to spend time in both Nashville and Vancouver before deciding where they would live together long term. This could be exactly what they are doing right now. If Shawn and Kaitlyn are going to find their own place, they need to decide where they want to be at forever. The source even said that they would settle down in Nashville for a bit before making a final decision. The two are engaged, but there has not been any talk about wedding plans so far for Kailtyn Bristowe and Shawn Booth. Considering that ABC hasn\u2019t been doing Bachelor weddings lately, more than likely this one will not end up airing on television like some have in the past. Shawn did share that they are not in any rush to get married. He did recently say that a TV wedding could happen.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t ruled out a televised wedding yet but what we definitely want to do is something small and closer with our friends, without cameras. So maybe do two separate weddings. We\u2019re not sure. Still stuff we got to kind of figure out.\u201d\n\nDo you feel like Kaitlyn Bristowe and Shawn Booth are living together now? Will these two ever actually get married?
