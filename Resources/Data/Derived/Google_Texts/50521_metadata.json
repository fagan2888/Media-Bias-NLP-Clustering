The firm said only that the service would reach \u201clarge parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe two companies will share satellite capacity, with Eutelsat focusing on premium and professional customers. Facebook\u2019s efforts will be aimed at bringing people online who otherwise could not get access \u2014 the mission of its Internet.org arm.\n\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s mission is to connect the world and we believe that satellites will play an important role in addressing the significant barriers that exist in connecting the people of Africa,\u201d said Chris Daniels, the vice president of Internet.org, in a statement.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Internet.org efforts have been met with mixed reactions.\n\nIts primary product so far is a package called Free Basics, phone apps that users in the developing world can access without paying their providers for data.\n\nThe social networking giant says it only wants to help people who can't afford to do so on their own get access to vital services, such as mobile banking and healthcare.\n\nCritics see something more insidious. They argue Facebook\u2019s primary motive in bringing more of the world online is to create more potential customers for its products. They also suggest that it is a blow to the principle of net neutrality, which says that all traffic on the Internet should be treated the same way, when Facebook\u2019s services are much more accessible for users.\n\nUsing satellites to beam Internet into areas of the world not served by wired Internet is something Facebook has been experimenting with through Internet.org, though it has yet to become as prominent a part of its efforts as the basic services. The company also reportedly abandoned a plan this summer to build and run its own satellite.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Facebook has focused on connecting the developing world through its Internet.org arm.", "description": "Facebook has focused on connecting the developing world through its Internet.org arm.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "David McCabe", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Facebook has focused on connecting the developing world through its Internet.org arm.", "title": "Facebook to beam free Internet service to Africa with satellites", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/255906-facebook-makes-deal-to-beam-internet-service-into-africa", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/hillstaffersfacebook_021215getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/255906-facebook-makes-deal-to-beam-internet-service-into-africa", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-05T10:23-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "David McCabe", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-05T10:23:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/255906-facebook-makes-deal-to-beam-internet-service-into-africa", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Facebook has focused on connecting the developing world through its Internet.org arm.", "card": "summary", "title": "Facebook to beam free Internet service to Africa with satellites"}, "dcterms.title": "Facebook to beam free Internet service to Africa with satellites"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf89\"", "article_summary": "Facebook and satellite company Eutelsat will start beaming Internet service to parts of Africa under a new deal announced Monday.\nFacebook\u2019s Internet.org efforts have been met with mixed reactions.\nFacebook\u2019s efforts will be aimed at bringing people online who otherwise could not get access \u2014 the mission of its Internet.org arm.\nBoth companies will \u201cdeploy Internet services designed to relieve pent-up demand for connectivity from the many users in Africa beyond range of fixed and mobile terrestrial networks,\u201d according to a Eutelsat statement.\nUsing satellites to beam Internet into areas of the world not served by wired Internet is something Facebook has been experimenting with through Internet.org, though it has yet to become as prominent a part of its efforts as the basic services."}
