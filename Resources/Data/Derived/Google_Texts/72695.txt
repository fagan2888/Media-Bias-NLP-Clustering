Denver-based DaVita HealthCare Partners said Monday it has signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Health to run as many as 80 dialysis treatment centers in the kingdom.

The centers will treat about half of the 10,000 dialysis patients under the ministry’s care. The agreement represents the company’s largest deal outside the United States, and DaVita will build most of the new centers.

“This is another important step in our vision for expanding our kidney care services internationally,” Kent Thiry, DaVita’s co-chairman and CEO, said in a statement.

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease has worsened in Saudi Arabia over the past three decades, triggered by a sharp rise in diabetes that follows rising affluence and a more sedentary lifestyle, according to the World Health Organization.

Besides treating patients, DaVita will also work with the health ministry to identify ways to prevent kidney disease before dialysis is necessary.
