The improvements were required as a condition of OptumHealth\u2019s multi-year state contract to be the single entity that would manage Medicaid behavioral health programs statewide.\n\nKennicott explained that as those improvements went into place, they uncovered \u201cpotential red flags, starting with one provider in the southern part of the state.\u201d Further work, he said, led to the finding of red flags at 15 other providers, which led DHS leaders to \u201ctake a look\u201d with the detailed audit process. PCG was used, Kennicott said, because it was well qualified and was readily available to the state via an existing GSA (governmental services agreement) with the federal government.\n\nOn June 24, with audit results in hand, HSD took the unprecedented step of halting payments the 15 organizations, 11 of whom are members of the National Council for Behavioral Health, whose membership includes 24 agencies in New Mexico and about 2,000 nationwide. The audit is said to detail $36 million in overpayments to the 15 organizations who together serve some 30,000 of the state\u2019s most seriously mentally ill individuals and, according to HSD, consume about 85% of the state\u2019s $340 million in state Medicaid mental health spending annually.\n\nAlmost immediately, it became clear to these non-profit provider organizations that if the payment suspension persisted for long, they would run out of money and be forced to reduce hours, cut services, lay off staff and, perhaps within a month or two, be forced to close their doors. And, because the audit results had been handed over for review to the New Mexico Attorney General\u2019s office, they could only speculate about the actual fraud allegations they faced, or read an 18-page summary provided by HSD. The uncertainty spread quickly to the state\u2019s consumers who wondered whether the treatment relationships they had built with provider staff would endure beyond their next scheduled appointment. What would happen to their provider, to services, and to their own recovery?\n\nAmid the chaos came word from North Carolina, where State Auditor Beth Wood examined a similar PCG audit conducted at a cost of $3.2 million more than a year before. Although the audit reported $38.5 million in Medicaid overpayments to providers in North Carolina, state officials said that less than 10 percent of that amount was recovered. In her final report, Wood stated that \u201crecoupments identified by PCG have not proven to be reliable, so the actual benefit derived from the contract [for the audit] is unclear.\u201d\n\nAn extraordinary circumstance\n\nThe huge de-funding, Kennicott acknowledged, \u201cis definitely an extraordinary circumstance.\u201d\n\nThe HSD\u2019s decision to proceed with it, as well the Department\u2019s controversial exercise of the Affordable Care Act provision that made it possible, have captured the attention of behavioral health providers nationwide. Why? Because there\u2019s every possibility that what is extraordinary in New Mexico today \u2014 involuntary closure, reorganization, and transition of 15 community-based behavioral health organizations to the control of state-appointed managers \u2014 could become more commonplace tomorrow.\n\nOn July 14, with the providers\u2019 case still pending in Armijo\u2019s court, Kennicott released a statement from Brian Cook, Director of Media Relations for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) that defended the HSD\u2019s decision: \"Based on information currently available,\" said Cook, \"CMS believes HSD acted in accordance with federal regulation and CMS guidance in imposing the temporary payment suspension.\"\n\nBut, say many observers, there are other ways to \u201cact in accordance\u201d with Medicaid regulations that don\u2019t necessitate secret audits, immediate payment suspensions, or state-funded management changes, even when there are allegations of potential fraud involved.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no problem, no question about the issue of auditing providers, even with unannounced on-site visits,\u201d said Patric Hooper, a Los Angeles-based healthcare attorney who has filed two court actions on behalf of the affected providers. He points out that with regard to audits, \u201cthe usual course is to audit providers one at a time, then share specifics of any findings in an \u2018exit conference\u2019 with the provider.\u201d After that, he continued, \u201cthere\u2019s a full-blown hearing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92da\"", "article_summary": "Because there\u2019s every possibility that what is extraordinary in New Mexico today \u2014 involuntary closure, reorganization, and transition of 15 community-based behavioral health organizations to the control of state-appointed managers \u2014 could become more commonplace tomorrow.\nThe improvements were required as a condition of OptumHealth\u2019s multi-year state contract to be the single entity that would manage Medicaid behavioral health programs statewide.\nAlthough the audit reported $38.5 million in Medicaid overpayments to providers in North Carolina, state officials said that less than 10 percent of that amount was recovered.\nAnd, because the audit results had been handed over for review to the New Mexico Attorney General\u2019s office, they could only speculate about the actual fraud allegations they faced, or read an 18-page summary provided by HSD.\nPCG was used, Kennicott said, because it was well qualified and was readily available to the state via an existing GSA (governmental services agreement) with the federal government."}
