Other threats include street crime, organized crime gangs, terrorism, poor communications infrastructure, and transportation gridlock.\n\nSEE ALSO: Brazil World Cup song fails to strike right tone\n\nBrazil will mobilize an unprecedented number of police officers and military troops to patrol sensitive areas. Some 170,000 security personnel will be on duty during the four-week soccer tournament, where 32 international teams will compete in 12 cities in this South American nation.\n\n\u201cWhen you see the military hardware in the street, it is pretty impressive,\u201d Mr. Wiencek said.\n\nElizabeth Leeds, co-founder and honorary president of the Brazilian Forum for Public Safety, expressed concern that the security force\u2019s new \u201cninja uniforms\u201d might be inappropriately intimidating.\n\nSEE ALSO: Brazil\u2019s weak service makes WCup Tweets unlikely\n\nTo bolster security, Brazilian forces have received extra training, and the government plans to deploy new equipment, such as Israeli-manufactured aerial drones. For Brazilians who envision a Russian-style clampdown like that during the Sochi Winter Olympics, many wonder whether Brazilian authorities can pull it off.\n\n\u201cThe Brazilian law enforcement and security capabilities are completely untested,\u201d Mr. Wiencek said. \u201cSao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro might have good capabilities, but in other places, it is a patchwork.\u201d\n\nBrazil\u2019s tourism capital, Rio de Janeiro, will receive particular attention, especially as it hosts the World Cup final July 13. The International Olympic Committee, which selected Rio for the 2016 Summer Games, will be watching closely.\n\nA few weeks ago, IOC Vice President John Coates called Rio\u2019s preparations for the Olympic Games \u201cthe worst that I\u2019ve experienced\u201d and compared them unfavorably with those of 2004 in Athens. Still, the IOC rejects speculation that Rio could be stripped of the 2016 Games.\n\nIn the favelas\n\nThe World Cup offers a showcase for Rio\u2019s high-profile Pacifying Police Unit. The program, which began in 2008, created permanent police stations in the city\u2019s notorious shantytowns, known as favelas, to combat violence and reduce the influence of drug gangs.\n\n\u201cFor 30 years, we had the war on drugs model. The police would enter a favela, shoot a few people and leave to return six months later,\u201d said Ignacio Cano, a former adviser for the Rio police and a sociologist at Rio de Janeiro State University. \u201cNow they stay.\u201d\n\nSix years into the program, Rio has 37 police units staffed by 2,000 officers, mostly new recruits. Mr. Cano criticizes some aspects of the program, including an all-too-frequent \u201cold-style\u201d confrontational approach by police, but his studies have concluded that the police units have reduced violence and encouraged citizens to report nonlethal crimes such as theft and rape.\n\nMost units are in favelas dotting the otherwise middle-class neighborhoods of southern Rio, notably in Copacabana and Ipanema, where most foreign visitors frequent.\n\n\u201cThe idea of the UPPs is to transform Rio into an international tourism and business center,\u201d Mr. Cano said.\n\nSecurity specialists say favelas are havens for drug gangs and petty crime. Some suspect that Rio gangs fueled street protests last year, but nobody can say, Ms. Leeds said.\n\nA few months ago, wiretaps suggested that Sao Paulo\u2019s branch of First Command of the Capital \u2014 the country\u2019s largest crime organization, with more than 13,000 members \u2014 might try to disrupt the World Cup. But opinions about the likelihood of the threat are divided.\n\n\u201cThose are credible threats. We have seen what they have been able to do in the past, wreaking havoc in Sao Paulo,\u201d said Frank Holder, chairman of the Latin American region of the U.S.-based FTI Consulting.\n\n\u2018Anybody could do anything\u2019\n\nGraham Denyer Willis, a researcher at the University of Toronto\u2019s Center for Criminology and Sociolegal Studies, downplayed the threat, saying the crime syndicate would \u201chave little to gain\u201d by disrupting the tournament.\n\nMr. Cano predicts that the violent side of organized crime will be muted. With thousands of revelers descending on the country, he said, \u201cthey see this as an opportunity to sell drugs. They do not want to upset that.\u201d\n\nPetty crime is a different beast.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to street crime, you need to make the point that Brazil is not like the U.S. or Europe,\u201d Mr. Wiencek said. \u201cEuropeans are more adventurous, and they may put themselves in harm\u2019s way because they assume that Brazil is all about samba and having fun.\u201d\n\nOfficials have downplayed terrorism as a threat during the World Cup.\n\n\u201cBrazil does not take the terrorism angle seriously,\u201d Mr. Holder said. \u201cThey have not suffered attacks on their soil in recent history, and Brazil has pretty good relations with everyone.\n\n\u201cIt is not like having the World Cup in Israel, Yemen or the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they do need to take seriously anything at a venue with 1 billion spectators. Anybody could do anything.\u201d\n\nOne of the best indictors of violence might be the performance of the Brazilian team.\n\n\u201cIf the team goes to the final, people might just watch the matches,\u201d Mr. Cano said.\n\nMr. Wiencek agreed. \u201cIf the Brazilian team does well, it is going to galvanize people in a good way. If it does not do well, the World Cup will come to symbolize a lot of inequality.\u201d\n\nMr. Holder said, \u201cHopefully they win and everybody goes away happy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the opening of an unfinished stadium less than a month away, a flurry of street protests, police strikes and rioting across Brazil have raised concerns about the country's ability to provide adequate security for visitors during the World Cup tournament.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With the opening of an unfinished stadium less than a month away, a flurry of street protests, police strikes and rioting across Brazil have raised concerns about the country\u2019s ability to provide adequate security for visitors during the World Cup tournament.", "title": "World Cup security a wild card for Brazil\u2019s police force", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/25/world-cup-security-a-wild-card-for-brazils-police-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/25/5_252014_brazil-wcup-security-78201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/25/5_252014_brazil-wcup-security-78201.jpg", "description": "With the opening of an unfinished stadium less than a month away, a flurry of street protests, police strikes and rioting across Brazil have raised concerns about the country's ability to provide adeq", "card": "summary", "title": "World Cup security a wild card for Brazil\u2019s police force"}, "Author": "Bill Hinchberger  \u2014  Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0727\"", "article_summary": "SEE ALSO: Brazil World Cup song fails to strike right toneBrazil will mobilize an unprecedented number of police officers and military troops to patrol sensitive areas.\n\u201cSafety and security are wild cards,\u201d said David Wiencek, managing director of the U.S.-based International Security Group Inc., a risk consultancy that produces bulletins about World Cup preparations.\nProtests top the list of security threats since Brazilian Spring demonstrations last year that overshadowed the FIFA Confederations Cup, a warm-up for the World Cup championship.\n\u201cIt is not like having the World Cup in Israel, Yemen or the United States,\u201d he said.\nIn the favelasThe World Cup offers a showcase for Rio\u2019s high-profile Pacifying Police Unit."}
