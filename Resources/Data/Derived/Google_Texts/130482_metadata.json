If anti-vaxxers would rather rely on findings from a debunked study and choose to ignore the recommendations from almost every doctor with a medical license, then maybe talk show host Jimmy Kimmel can convince them. And if not, maybe more doctors.\n\n\u201cJimmy feels that all of this anti-vaccination silliness is starting to snowball, so he invited some real doctors to address it,\u201d the video description reads. \u201cThese are actual medical professionals so hear them out and then decide for yourself.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 154 people from 17 states and Washington D.C. contracted measles between January 1 and February 20, 2015 following an outbreak at Disneyland in California. Kimmel points out that around 20 percent of students in the same state where the outbreak began are not vaccinated because \u201cparent\u2019s here are more scared of gluten then they are of smallpox.\u201d\n\nRates of parents deciding not to vaccinate their children have more than doubled since 2007. Anti-vaccination rates continuing to rise is even more perplexing considering a pertussis, also known as whooping cough, outbreak in 2012 that affected more than 9,000 people and killed 10 infants. The majority of hospitalized patients were infants under 3 months old who had not been vaccinated.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "jimmy, kimmel, anti, vaxxers, talk, show, host, sets, record, straight, anti, vaccination", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel explains why anti-vaxxers need to get with the times and why vaccinating children is so important.", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Sounds Off On Anti-Vaxxers With A Little Help From Actual Doctors [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/jimmy-kimmel-anti-vaxxers-talk-show-host-sets-record-straight-anti-vaccination-323776", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/02/27/jimmy-kimmel-anti-vaxxers-talk-show-host-sets-record-straight-anti-vaccination.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel explains why anti-vaxxers need to get with the times and why vaccinating children is so important.", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Sounds Off On Anti-Vaxxers With A Little Help From Actual Doctors [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/jimmy-kimmel-anti-vaxxers-talk-show-host-sets-record-straight-anti-vaccination-323776", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/02/27/jimmy-kimmel-anti-vaxxers-talk-show-host-sets-record-straight-anti-vaccination.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/27/jimmy-kimmel-anti-vaxxers-talk-show-host-sets-record-straight-anti-vaccination.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-27T12:01:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-27T12:01:01-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel explains why anti-vaxxers need to get with the times and why vaccinating children is so important."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf56f\"", "article_summary": "If anti-vaxxers would rather rely on findings from a debunked study and choose to ignore the recommendations from almost every doctor with a medical license, then maybe talk show host Jimmy Kimmel can convince them.\n\u201cJimmy feels that all of this anti-vaccination silliness is starting to snowball, so he invited some real doctors to address it,\u201d the video description reads.\nThe majority of hospitalized patients were infants under 3 months old who had not been vaccinated.\nAnti-vaccination rates continuing to rise is even more perplexing considering a pertussis, also known as whooping cough, outbreak in 2012 that affected more than 9,000 people and killed 10 infants.\nAnd if not, maybe more doctors."}
