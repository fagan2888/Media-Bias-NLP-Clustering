Priyanka Chopra beats Jimmy Fallon in a hot-wings eating contest

Actress Priyanka Chopra and host Jimmy Fallon have a hot wing eating contest on March 3, 2016.

During a visit in 1974 on the “Tonight Show,” Martin appeared in a white suit and a spade-studded tie. The two then dug into plates of Atomic Wings slathered in the signature “nuclear” sauce, which are the company’s hottest wings.

The cast of the show, which just began performances on Broadway, performed the number “Sun’s Gonna Shine”, as seen in the clip above.

“I don’t want to do this show / I used up all my material / I don’t want to do this show“, Martin sang while the Tonight Show audience waited for him. While she’s already proved her acting prowess in India, the sexy actress has taken the West by storm, as well.

“I heard from The Tonight Show, and they said they had been following along with the Instagram account, which is awesome”, O’Conor said. “The face helped convey how you were feeling about the song…’80s and ’70s music puts a strut in your thing”. Emmy Award- and Grammy Award-winning comedian Jimmy Fallon brings a high-tempo energy to the storied NBC franchise with his welcoming interview style, love of audience participation, spot-on impersonations and innovative sketches.
