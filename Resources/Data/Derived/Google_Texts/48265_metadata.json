Boosting quality and cutting costs, they said, \u201cdepends directly on having patients engaged with their care team \u2014 usually a primary care practice.\u201d\n\nThe two authors still see an important role for \u201ccarefully designed\u201d consumer cost sharing, which can induce patients to \u201cmake wise decisions about what discretionary care they truly need and want.\u201d\n\nBut the high out-of-pocket costs embedded in a growing number of health plans can deter people from getting the preventive primary care they need to stay healthy, Lee and Fisher warned. They urged state-based insurance exchanges and employers who sponsor coverage for their workers to offer health plans that make it easier for people to get medical care.\n\n\u201cWe need to change the culture of medicine to be about primary care and care coordination,\u201d Lee said in an interview last week. \u201cEmployers and health plans in the public sector have benefit designs that directly conflict with the goal of the ACA.\u201d\n\nSo much of the health reform law, Lee added, is about ensuring access to care. Yet, high out-of-pocket costs in many plans can block that objective he said.\n\nThat is particularly true among those who get health coverage through an employer. And that\u2019s a large number: 147 million people, or 54.6 percent of the non-elderly U.S. population, according to a 2015 survey on employer-sponsored insurance by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Health Research & Educational Trust. [Kaiser Health News, which publishes California Healthline, is an editorially independent program of the foundation.]\n\nLee and Fisher noted that the proportion of Americans who have employer-sponsored coverage with deductibles of more than $1,000 has increased from 10 to 46 percent in the past decade.\n\nThey cited a 2015 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research showing that plans with high deductibles in a population with relatively high income led to a 10 percent decline in the use of preventive care and an 18 percent drop in physician visits. The biggest reduction in care was among the sickest patients.\n\n\u201cWe want consumers to be able to see their doctor when necessary, so their health care needs can be met in the most effective and efficient way possible,\u201d Fisher said in a news release.\n\nFisher and Lee noted that Covered California has taken a different approach \u2014 an example they said can help avoid a collision between insurance plans with high deductibles and the ongoing effort to improve the quality and reduce the cost of care. (By cost, Lee and Fisher mean health care costs overall; with high deductible plans, the cost to employers goes down.)\n\nUse Our Content This story can be republished for free ( details ).\n\nAmong 1.3 million Covered California enrollees as of June 2015, they noted, 75 percent could obtain primary care without being subject to a deductible and with \u201cmodest co-payments\u201d that varied depending on whether they qualified for federal subsidies.\n\nYet the other 25 percent of Covered California enrollees \u2014 316,000 people \u2014 had chosen the lowest-tier \u201cbronze\u201d option as of mid-2015. Patients in the bronze plan receive one free primary care visit and three visits not subject to the annual deductible. After that they face a $5,000 deductible for primary care visits and other care.\n\nErin Trish, an assistant research professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics, said the reason why many people chose bronze is simple: despite the high deductibles, people are pulled toward the cheaper premiums.\n\n\u201cThey might be able to get these three primary care visits [not subject to the deductible], but if they need other services, it will be at a considerable cost, and that adds to financial hardship,\u201d Trish said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about the cost. Plans catering to patients\u2019 best interests should be easier to navigate, many agree. Too many plan benefit designs, they say, are confusing and convoluted for the average consumer.\n\nFisher and Lee noted that Covered California \u2014 joined by a handful of other states \u2014 has standardized deductibles, copayments and other shared costs for its contracted health plans at each of the four levels of coverage: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. That means shoppers can compare plans at each tier of coverage based only on the premium and which doctors and hospitals are in the network.\n\nNot all state exchanges are designed this way, they observed. Consumers in many states are left to choose among a multitude of insurance policies from a wide range of carriers, with differing deductibles and co-payments. Many of the health plans in this \u201cconfusing array of products\u201d will undermine initiatives in delivery-system reform,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced it would allow health insurance companies to standardize benefit designs on the federal exchange next year.\n\nShana Alex Charles, an associate professor at California State University, Fullerton\u2019s Department of Health Science, said the fact that the federal government is looking to carry out a benefit design similar to Covered California\u2019s is good news for consumers.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t always want to have a lot of choices; it is difficult and overwhelming,\u201d Charles said. \u201cThey want a good product within a limited range of options.\u201d\n\nShe said Covered California\u2019s model is probably the most consumer-friendly currently available. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising other states aren\u2019t doing the same,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to Lee, more people are paying attention to what California is doing. \u201cWe\u2019re raising the warning flags,\u201d the exchange director said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t improve the pathway for people to see their primary care doctor, we all lose.\u201d\n\nCalifornia exchange officials plan to continue pounding the drum. In April, Covered California\u2019s Board of Directors will consider a new rule that would ensure every single patient covered through the exchange has a doctor within 30 days of signing up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Too few doctor visits means sicker people and higher costs down the line, his New England Journal of Medicine article asserts.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Too few doctor visits means sicker people and higher costs down the line, his New England Journal of Medicine article asserts.", "title": "Preventive Care And High Deductibles Work At Cross Purposes, Covered Cal Chief Says", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/preventive-care-and-high-deductibles-work-at-cross-purposes-covered-cal-chief-says/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://californiahealthline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/peterlee_770.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://californiahealthline.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/peterlee_770.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-03-16T09:00:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T09:00:18+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe need to change the culture of medicine to be about primary care and care coordination,\u201d Lee said in an interview last week.\n(By cost, Lee and Fisher mean health care costs overall; with high deductible plans, the cost to employers goes down.)\nAfter that they face a $5,000 deductible for primary care visits and other care.\nPatients in the bronze plan receive one free primary care visit and three visits not subject to the annual deductible.\nYet the other 25 percent of Covered California enrollees \u2014 316,000 people \u2014 had chosen the lowest-tier \u201cbronze\u201d option as of mid-2015."}
