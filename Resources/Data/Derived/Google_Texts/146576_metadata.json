Chris Christie was back in Seaside today, and he gave a brief update on the damage assessment to Thursday\u2019s fiery destruction of parts of the boardwalk in Seaside Park and Seaside Heights.\n\nStanding just two blocks north of the fire line, where the flames finally stopped, he told reporters that while he didn\u2019t want to minimize the losses, he was relieved the damage was contained.\n\n\u201cThis could have been significantly worse,\u201d he said, before heading off to a private meeting with his cabinet and local business owners.\n\nChristie said that although he spoke to business owners Thursday night as they watched their shops burn to the ground, this afternoon will be the first time he\u2019ll be meeting all of them \"face-to-face.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take a few questions and then we\u2019re going to get to work,\u201d he said.\n\nSpurred by 30 mph winds, the fire, which took nine hours to be extinguished, burned down or significantly damaged dozens of small businesses along the boardwalk that had been recently rebuilt after Hurricane Sandy.\n\n\u201cFor those people on those four blocks, it\u2019s awful,\u201d Christie said. \u201cBut we could have lost all of this.\u201d\n\nSeaside Heights Police Chief Thomas Boyd estimated the damage will likely be between $5 million and $10 million.\n\nChristie received a warm reception from locals and onlookers at the boardwalk.\n\n\u201cMost people are just saying \u2018thank you for being here,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what this job is all about.\u201d\n\nThe governor canceled a trip to Florida with his wife Mary Pat, whose birthday is Sunday.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a champ,\u201d he said of his wife. \u201cWe both also know this is the job.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','chris-christie','seaside-fire','seaside-heights','seaside-park'", "title": "Seaside Boardwalk fire: Christie meets with business owners affected by blaze", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Seaside Boardwalk fire: Christie meets with business owners affected by blaze \", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/seaside_boardwalk_fire_christie_meets_with_small_business_owners_affected_by_the_blaze.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/09/13410047-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11243681\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-14T18:31:45Z\", \"author\": \"David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"chris-christie\",\"seaside-fire\",\"seaside-heights\",\"seaside-park\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/09/13410047-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@Giambusso", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "This afternoon will be the first time Gov.
