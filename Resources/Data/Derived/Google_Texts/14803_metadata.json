The convoy comprises U.S. Army units throughout the region and is meant to show NATO\u2019s commitment to its eastern allies in the wake of the Ukraine conflict.\n\nWhile Iron Troop was parked at a static display in the parking lot of a supermarket in Marijampole, Lithuania, NATO quick reaction aircraft (QRA) were being scrambled from a Lithuanian air base to intercept Russian warplanes off neighboring Latvia\u2019s coast.\n\nThe two Russian TU-22M Backfire bombers and two Su-27 Flanker fighter jets, which were in international airspace, were flying without their transponders on and were not talking with air traffic control, a military official told The Daily Signal. Additionally, the TU-22M bombers were moving at supersonic speed.\n\nThough not technically illegal, these actions put other aircraft at risk and are considered by pilots and military officials to be unusual and provocative.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t speculate as to why the Russian aircraft failed to follow proper procedures,\u201d said Lt. Cmdr. Frank Magallon, a spokesman for U.S. European Command, in an email to The Daily Signal. \u201c[B]ut the QRA (quick reaction aircraft) conducted a highly professional intercept.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to Magallon, Danish and Italian fighter jets intercepted the four Russian warplanes around 8 a.m. Tuesday, escorting them to Kaliningrad, which is nestled between Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic Sea.\n\nAs part of the intercept, Italian Eurofighters launched from Siauliau Air Base, Lithuania\u2014about 100 miles from where the Dragoon Ride convoy was located at the time.\n\n\u201cNATO remains vigilant,\u201d Magallon said, \u201cand all the measures they are taking are defensive and in line with our international obligations.\u201d\n\nRegional tensions between Russia and NATO have been steadily escalating in Europe, manifesting in a series of recent military exercises and weapons deployments by both sides.\n\n\u201cRussian heavy bombers flew more out-of-area patrols in 2014 than in any year since the Cold War,\u201d said Adm. William Gortney, commander of U.S. Northern Command, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 12. He added that the uptick was a political message to NATO.\n\n\u201cWhile these patrols serve a training function for Russian air crews, some are clearly intended to underscore Moscow\u2019s global reach and communicate its displeasure with Western policies, particularly with regard to Ukraine,\u201d Gortney said.\n\nLast week, Russia launched snap military exercises in the Arctic and across Russia, which were meant to test the readiness of Russia\u2019s Northern Fleet, according to the Kremlin. The exercises, however, also included the deployment of Iskander missiles to the Kaliningrad region as well as TU-22M bombers to the breakaway region of Crimea.\n\nBoth the Iskander missiles and the TU-22M bombers are designed to carry nuclear weapons.\n\nAdding to the tension, Russia\u2019s ambassador to Denmark, Mikhail Vanin, said in an interview published Saturday that Danish warships would be targeted by Russian nuclear weapons if Denmark agreed to join NATO\u2019s missile defense shield.\n\nUnderscoring a pervasive worry throughout the Baltic countries, Estonian Prime Minister Taavi R\u00f5ivas warned last month that Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine were a game-changer for European security.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s aggression in Ukraine has fundamentally changed the security situation in the whole of Europe and NATO has responded to it with higher readiness,\u201d R\u00f5ivas said at a Feb. 13 meeting with NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe Gen. Philip Breedlove, according to an Estonian government statement.\n\nThe U.S. and NATO say Russia is sending supplies, weapons and troops into Ukrainian territory to support pro-Russian separatists. The Kremlin denies assisting the separatists.\n\nWhile the Ukraine cease-fire continues to hold despite daily fighting, a former NATO top official recently said the Russian security threat extends beyond Ukraine\u2019s borders.\n\n\u201cThis is not about Ukraine. Putin wants to restore Russia to its former position as a great power,\u201d said Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the former secretary-general of the Atlantic alliance, in a Feb. 5 interview with The Telegraph.\n\n\u201cThere is a high probability that he will intervene in the Baltics to test NATO\u2019s Article V,\u201d he added.\n\nArticle V of NATO\u2019s charter directs the alliance to collectively retaliate against an attack on a member nation. The only time Article V has been invoked was in response to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "WARSAW, Poland\u2014 As a U.S. Army Stryker convoy crossed from Lithuania to Poland Tuesday\u2014within about 12 miles of the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad\u2014nearby NATO warplanes...
