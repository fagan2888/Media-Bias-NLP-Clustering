KATHLEEN SEBELIUS (9/30/2013): I think success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of March 2014.

Come on! 7 million enrollees with a website you couldn't log on to for a month, and government mandated abortion panels for puppies? You'll never get there!



ERIC BOLLING (2/26/2014): In five months, 4 — allegedly, 4 — million people have signed up. They expect to get 3 more million in one month? Wow, this is going to be a disaster.

So deadline passed. Give us the total.



BARACK OBAMA (4/1/2014): 7.1 million Americans have now signed up for private insurance plans through these marketplaces. 7.1.

STEVE DOOCY (4/2/2014): How real are those numbers? CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER (4/1/2014): This is a phony number. FOX NEWS GUEST (4/1/2014): I actually think the White House is straight up lying about these numbers. BRAD BLAKEMAN (4/3/2014): This is a sham! SEN. JOHN BARRASSO, R-WY (3/30/2014): I think they're cooking the books on this.

So how do you explain this rather fortuitous increase?



BARACK OBAMA (4/1/2014): 7.1 million folks have health insurance because people got the word out. And we didn't make a hard sell.

Word of mouth, really? You didn't make a hard sell? The signup was the centerpiece of your State of the Union address. You talked it up on Ellen, on Rachel Ray, on The Tonight Show, enlisted an army of professional athletes,

every actor in Hollywood,

you sat between two ferns! (audience applause)

And then, there was whatever the hell this is!







So listen to me,

A talking pup you see,

If you get health insurance

Preventive care is now free.

Didn't give the hard sell?? For God's sake, you taught a dog to rap about health insurance! Even the Taco Bell chihuahua was like, "Yo quiero we get it." (audience laughter)

But apparently, according to Brent Bozell of the conservative Media Research Bullshit — I mean, Center (audience laughter) — the government had a secret Obamacare enrollment selling weapon.



BRENT BOZELL (3/31/2014): For more than a year, the Spanish-language television network Univision has embarked on their own company-wide effort to get Latinos signed up for the exchanges.
