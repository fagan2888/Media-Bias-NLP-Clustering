Mitchell, SD

A serious illness is the cause of death for a Dakota Wesleyan University athlete.

The South Dakota Department of Health says a meningococcal infection killed freshman basketball player Beau Keeter Wednesday.

The meningococcus bacteria can cause a severe bacterial infection of the bloodstream and the lining covering the brain and spinal cord. It spreads by direct close contact with nose or throat discharges of an infected person.

Those closest to Keeter are being offered antibiotic prophylaxis in case they became exposed.

In the wake of the death, state officials are encouraging vaccination.

There is a vaccine that will protect against four of the strains of meningococcus. It is recommended for children eleven through 18 years of age and college freshmen.

Meningococcal vaccine is available from family health care providers and campus student health centers.

Nine meningococcal cases have been confirmed in South Dakota within the last five years.
