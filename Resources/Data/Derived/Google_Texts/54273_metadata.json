That number is now about 4,000 and sometimes exceeds that.\n\nTo meet the demand, there has been a corresponding increase in providers; from 19 to 27. RIPTA remains the largest provider. During May, when the system provided 85,000 rides, RIPTA provided 16,500 of the total.\n\nSousa didn\u2019t have more current breakdowns, but said RIPTA continues to be the largest provider. Prior to the LogistiCare\u2019s contract, RIde, a division of RIPTA and a call center operated by LogistiCare, handled the scheduling of rides. In addition to scheduling, LogistiCare, now as the broker, contracts with providers and pays for the rides. LogistiCare has a three-year contract with the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) that is renewable in one-year increments for an additional three years.\n\nSousa and LogistiCare senior vice president Robert Harrison both see an upward trend in rides (referred to as \u201cmembers\u201d). They attribute that to the Affordable Care Act. There may be other factors at play, although Sousa notes that ridership usually drops off during the summer. Wednesdays and Thursdays are the busiest days. Sousa speculates that could be attributable to physicians scheduling appointments to take advantage of a longer weekend.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a reasonable explanation,\u201d Thomas Martin, implementation program director for EOHHS, said of the impact of the Affordable Care Act. He also pointed out that providers are getting the word out to beneficiaries.\n\nFrom the perspective of some providers, LogistiCare got off to a bumpy start. Systems and routines that had been in place for many years were changed. People who were accustomed to having the same driver for daily and weekly appointments were abruptly faced with another provider unfamiliar with the routine. Providers were faced with new compliance procedures, including billing.\n\nBay Taxi of Warwick was among those companies still waiting in late June to be paid for rides in May. Bay had outstanding bills totaling almost $50,000. RIPTA was also on the unpaid list. Checks were issued by early July.\n\n\u201cI think things are getting a bit better,\u201d Lillian Romano of Bay Taxi said yesterday.\n\nThe company has received two checks, although there remains a dispute over payments.\n\nWhat she has noticed is that LogistiCare is providing many rides in ambulances, which carry public plates. This enables LogistiCare to contract for a flat rate for ambulances, whereas cabs with taxi plates are required to charge by the meter.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saving a lot of money,\u201d said Romano.\n\nWhat she has noticed is that Bay is getting many shorter runs.\n\nSousa said there were a number of \u201churtles\u201d to overcome when LogistiCare took over. He said the state did not have contracts with providers and payments were based on rides without consideration to mileage. Under the LogistiCare system, payments are based on three mile increments, which, he said, has resulted in some providers being paid less and others more.\n\n\u201cIt was a weakened network when we came in.\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Sousa said providers have been given a 60-day grace period to adjust to the system, LogistiCare has the power to \u201cliquidate\u201d providers for money if they repeatedly fail to show up for scheduled rides. He\u2019s pleased but not completely satisfied with the 99.3 percent rate of rides for May. The statistic indicates that less than 1 percent of scheduled rides failed to happen. Given the 85,000 rides in May, that would be about 500 missed rides.\n\nThat concerns Sousa, who said the company\u2019s overall performance rate is 99.9 percent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not delivering Home Depot lumber,\u201d Sousa said of medical appointments and other rides.\n\nMartin said the number of missed trips has dropped, which is a good sign. Looking ahead, he said, he sees the system expanding its capacity.\n\nThe system is costly. The LogistiCare contract is for $24 million this year.\n\n\u201cThis is Medicaid money designed for those who have no other means of transportation,\u201d said Sousa.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://warwickonline.com/stories/ridership-up-with-new-contract-for-medicaid-transportation,94593", "site_name": "Warwick Beacon", "type": "article", "description": "Since being awarded the state contract to coordinate transportation to adult day care services, dialysis, medical appointments and services for those on Medicaid, LogistiCare has seen a spike in  \u2026", "title": "Ridership up with new contract for Medicaid transportation"}, "description": "Since being awarded the state contract to coordinate transportation to adult day care services, dialysis, medical appointments and services for those on Medicaid, LogistiCare has seen a spike in  \u2026", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbca\"", "article_summary": "The LogistiCare contract is for $24 million this year.\n\u201cThis is Medicaid money designed for those who have no other means of transportation,\u201d said Sousa.\nFrom the perspective of some providers, LogistiCare got off to a bumpy start.\nPrior to the LogistiCare\u2019s contract, RIde, a division of RIPTA and a call center operated by LogistiCare, handled the scheduling of rides.\nDuring May, when the system provided 85,000 rides, RIPTA provided 16,500 of the total."}
