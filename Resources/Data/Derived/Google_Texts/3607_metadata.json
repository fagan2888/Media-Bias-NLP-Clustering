It\u2019s the holidays\u2014a season to give thanks for our many blessings. The love of family. The joy of good friends. The bonds of community. The freedom we cherish as Americans. The peace and justice we seek in the world.\n\nAs we go about our days, as we gather with loved ones and friends, it\u2019s important to remember: our way of life\u2014the freedom, prosperity and security that we enjoy as Americans\u2014is not a gift that is simply handed to us. It has to be earned\u2014by every generation. And no one sacrifices more to preserve our blessings than our extraordinary men and women in uniform.\n\nThat\u2019s why, on Monday, I\u2019ll be visiting our troops at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey\u2014to salute them for their service and thank them for their sacrifices. Since our nation was attacked on 9/11, these men and women, like so many others in uniform, have met every mission we\u2019ve asked of them. They deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. In more than a decade of war, this 9/11 Generation has worked with the Afghan people to help them reclaim their communities and prevent terrorist attacks against our own country.\n\nNow, many of our troops are returning from Afghanistan, and on Monday, I\u2019ll be proud to help welcome them home. That\u2019s because, this month, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over. Our war in Afghanistan is coming to a responsible end.\n\nOf course, the end of our combat mission in Afghanistan doesn\u2019t mean the end of challenges to our security. We\u2019ll continue to work with Afghans to make sure their country is stable and secure and is never again used to launch attacks against America. The troops I\u2019ll visit on Monday have been part of our mission to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria. They\u2019ve been supporting our efforts in West Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic and save lives. Because in times of crisis and challenge, the world turns to America for leadership. And when the world calls on America, we call on the brave men and women of our armed forces to do what no one else can.\n\nSo this holiday season, as we give thanks for the blessings in our own lives, let\u2019s also give thanks to our men and women in uniform who make those blessings possible. Even as some are coming home for the holidays, many more will be far from their families, who sacrifice along with them.\n\nThere are so many ways we can express our gratitude to our troops, their families and our veterans\u2014everyone can do something. To find out what you can do, just go to JoiningForces.gov. As a nation, as Americans, let\u2019s always keep striving to serve them as well as they have always served us.\n\nThanks, have a great weekend, and God bless our troops and their families.\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "As we go about our days, as we gather with loved ones and friends, it\u2019s important to remember: our way of life\u2014the freedom, prosperity and security that we enjoy as Americans\u2014is not a gift ...", "title": "After a tough week, Obama expresses gratitude to troops and their families in weekly address", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/12/13/1351418/-After-a-tough-week-Obama-expresses-gratitude-to-troops-and-their-families-in-weekly-address", "image": "http://assets.dailykos.com/assets/fb_default-83551080ce5aec223661e373eaf232ea.png", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "As we go about our days, as we gather with loved ones and friends, it\u2019s important to remember: our way of life\u2014the freedom, prosperity and security that we enjoy as Americans\u2014is not a gift that is ...", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary", "title": "After a tough week, Obama expresses gratitude to troops and their families in weekly address"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb0d9\"", "article_summary": "There are so many ways we can express our gratitude to our troops, their families and our veterans\u2014everyone can do something.\nThe troops I\u2019ll visit on Monday have been part of our mission to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL in Iraq and Syria.\nThanks, have a great weekend, and God bless our troops and their families.\nNow, many of our troops are returning from Afghanistan, and on Monday, I\u2019ll be proud to help welcome them home.\nOf course, the end of our combat mission in Afghanistan doesn\u2019t mean the end of challenges to our security."}
