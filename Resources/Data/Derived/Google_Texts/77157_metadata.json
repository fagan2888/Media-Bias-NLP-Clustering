Rick Scott called for state lawmakers to pass legislation during next year\u2019s session that would, in his words, \u201cincrease transparency for Florida hospitals and empower patients to fight against hospital price gouging.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s proposal centers around requiring hospitals to post certain information on their websites, including their prices and average payments for products and services provided, and data related to performance on certain quality metrics that would be agreed upon by the State Consumer Health Information and Policy Advisory Council.\n\nIn addition, Scott proposed requiring tax-exempt hospitals to post their annual financial reports to the IRS online, which include information on executive compensation and lobbying spending.\n\nFurther, in a news release the governor said that patients should \u201chave the ability to ask for a third-party review of their charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe high cost of health care continues to hurt some of our most vulnerable families in Florida, and the best way to guard against unfairly high hospital costs being passed on to patients is to require hospitals to be fully transparent with their own costs and patient charges,\u2019\u2019 Scott said.\n\n\u201cMost Florida hospitals receive state taxpayer dollars,\u201d he added. \u201cWe must not use state money to subsidize hospitals [that] are charging our citizens unfairly high prices for services they receive, often during a time of personal crisis.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Scott has taken an \u201cantagonistic approach\u201d to dealing with hospitals over the last few months, with the tension between the governor and the hospital industry related to the two sides\u2019 divergent opinions on expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act (ACA, aka Obamacare).\n\nHospitals favor the expansion, while Scott and House Republican leaders are opposed.\n\nIn August, Scott directed the state Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) to audit at least some contracts between hospitals and health insurers to determine if they comply with a state Medicaid law, contending that contracts could exceed a legal limit on Medicaid payment rates.\n\nAccording to Bruce Reuben, the president of the Florida Hospital Association (FHA), Scott did not discuss his recent \u201ctransparency\u201d proposals with the FHA.\n\nRueben said that there\u2019s a big difference between high prices and so-called price gouging, and that the governor\u2019s allegations of price gouging \u201care completely unfounded.\u201d\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "florida hospital association,governor rick scott,homepage,hospital price gouging,slider,transparency for florida hospitals", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hospital-costs1.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "This week, Florida Gov.
