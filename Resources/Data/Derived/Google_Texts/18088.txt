Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield said it will not renew any small group or individual health plans that were set to expire after this year, despite receiving permission to do so by New Jersey’s insurance regulator.

In a statement, Horizon said it was impossible to issue new health plans under a tight time frame before the end of the year.

"Horizon BCBSNJ has been working to implement the Affordable Care Act for the past three and a half years, and undoing our work and essentially creating new plans in three weeks has proven to be impossible," said Thomas Rubino, the insurer’s director of public affairs.

The announcement from New Jersey’s largest health insurer ends weeks of questions over how it would respond to an Obama administration policy reversal that let carriers, with the permission of their state regulator, renew plans that had been cancelled because they didn't comply with the health care law.

Horizon previously announced it could not renew its bare bones "basic and essential" health plans after the federal government refused to waive certain ACA requirements that in turn would significantly raise the premiums of these low-cost plans.

Horizon, which provides coverage to 3.7 million people, sells about 81 percent of the health plans in New Jersey’s individual market, and about 57 percent of those sold to small businesses and other groups with 50 or fewer workers.

Rubino said Horizon has been notifying its customers with approaching renewal dates about their options for converting to an ACA-compliant plan. Individual policyholders also can contact the company for an estimate of any financial aid they might be eligible for, he added.
