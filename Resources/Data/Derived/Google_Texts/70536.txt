Shares of WellCare Health Plans and Centene surged Tuesday on speculation that one of the two Medicaid insurance providers could be acquired by Ascension Health.

Ascension, the nation's largest nonprofit hospital and health system, has expanded in recent years through acquisitions of health-care systems, and a move into insurance would mark a major departure for the company.

"At an investor conference last week, the CEO of Ascension Health, a not-for-profit hospital and health system, referred to being in talks on a possible deal with an unnamed 18-state health insurer," wrote Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte in a note to clients, citing an article from the trade news site Modern Healthcare.
