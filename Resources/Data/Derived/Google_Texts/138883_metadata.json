Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) -- will move the president's work forward. She has accused Sanders of wanting to undo Obamacare and instead implement a single-payer health care plan, and has defended the president's legacy of taking on Wall Street.\n\nIn the ad, Holder specifically mentions Clinton's push to strengthen gun laws and police accountability. Clinton has accused Sanders of being too weak in standing up to gun manufacturers.\n\nSouth Carolina's Democratic primary on Feb. 27 will be the fourth in the nation. The state has a sizable population of politically active black voters -- a constituency with which Clinton still holds a lead but with which Sanders is trying to make inroads.\n\nThe TV spot is scheduled to air this week in Charleston, Columbia, Greenville-Spartanburg and Florence-Myrtle Beach.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:", "article_metadata": {"description": "He stresses that she'll keep police accountable.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-02-03 15:47:42 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "He stresses that she'll keep police accountable.", "title": "Eric Holder Appeals To South Carolina Voters In New Hillary Clinton Ad", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-holder-hillary-clinton_us_56b0f690e4b0655877f74f49", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56b0f8251a00009c01ab1d59.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He stresses that she'll keep police accountable.", "creator": "@tylerrickytynes", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/56b0f8251a00009c01ab1d59.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Eric Holder Appeals To South Carolina Voters In New Hillary Clinton Ad", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-02 15:47:42 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_56b0f690e4b0655877f74f49", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Eric Holder,Hillary Clinton,eric holder hillary clinton,hillary clinton eric holder, hillary clinton 2016,hillary clinton president,hillary clinton south carolina,Elections 2016,2016 election", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Eric Holder,Hillary Clinton,eric holder hillary clinton,hillary clinton eric holder, hillary clinton 2016,hillary clinton president,hillary clinton south carolina,Elections 2016,2016 election", "published_time": "2016-02-02 15:47:42 -0500", "modified_time": "2016-02-02 15:47:42 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "\"If you want to make sure Republicans don\u2019t take us backward, help Hillary move us forward,\" Holder says in the 30-second advertisement.\nThe first official pro-Hillary Clinton ad in South Carolina is hitting airwaves this week, and it features former Attorney General Eric Holder making the case that Clinton is the best candidate to carry on President Barack Obama's legacy.\nIn the ad, Holder specifically mentions Clinton's push to strengthen gun laws and police accountability.\nClinton has accused Sanders of being too weak in standing up to gun manufacturers.\nClinton has been working hard to convince Obama supporters that she -- not her primary opponent, Sen.
