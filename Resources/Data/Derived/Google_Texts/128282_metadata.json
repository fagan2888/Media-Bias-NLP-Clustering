And the crowds are getting big, as was the case on Thursday when Florida Sen. Marco Rubio addressed several hundred people inside a cavernous auto-repair training facility at Nashua Community College.\n\n\n\nAmong the themes of Rubio\u2019s campaign is his relative youth: the 44-year-old Republican promises to represent a new generation of Americans \u2014 and to give the likely Democratic candidate a run for her money.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this election is so critical, that\u2019s why we can\u2019t afford to elect Hillary Clinton,\u201d Rubio told the crowd. \u201cBy the way, she\u2019s increasingly attacking me. I know why \u2014 she doesn\u2019t want to run against me. But I cannot wait to run against her.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt might be good politics to exude the confidence of a frontrunner. But while Rubio has been attracting hefty crowds and a lot of buzz, he has yet to break out of a pack of five Republicans in New Hampshire who are all running well behind Trump \u2014 including Govs. Chris Christie and John Kasich, former Gov. Jeb Bush, and fellow Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\n\n\nTrump Benefits From Large Field\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are leading everywhere,\u201d Trump proclaimed to a raucous crowd of supporters in Claremont earlier this week. \u201cWhen people say, \u2018Why do you always talk about the polls?\u2019 I say, \u2018Because I\u2019m winning!\u2019 Believe me, if I\u2019m not winning, I don\u2019t talk about them.\u201d\n\n\n\n(While Trump leads in New Hampshire, polls suggest that Sen. Cruz is leading in Iowa.)\n\n\n\nIn Claremont, throngs of supporters lined up outside in frigid temperatures for a chance to see Trump on the day President Obama announced a series of executive orders aimed at curbing gun violence.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to take your guns away folks,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to do it, even though they\u2019re trying.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s support in New Hampshire has been remarkably steady over the last three months, according to Tom Jensen, director of Public Policy Polling. Jensen just completed a survey of likely primary voters in New Hampshire which found Trump with 29 percent support \u2014 about where he\u2019s been since the early fall. Then comes Rubio at 15 percent, with Christie, Kasich, Bush and Cruz clustered a few points behind him.\n\n\n\nBut the poll also says something interesting about the strength of Trump\u2019s opponents.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you poll Trump head-to-head against Rubio, Cruz and Bush, he trails Rubio by 12 points. He trails Cruz by 7 points, and he only leads Bush by 1 point at 46-45,\u201d Jensen said. \u201cSo what you\u2019re seeing is that if the field gets smaller, any candidate who dropped out, [most of] their supporters would go to a candidate other than Trump.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe poll makes clear just how much Trump is benefiting from a large field of competitors who are cannibalizing each other and pushing him to the top. That dynamic is working particularly well for him in New Hampshire, according to Gordon Humphrey, a former U.S. senator from the Granite State who is supporting Kasich.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think, honestly, that Trump has such a head of steam going here that it will probably carry him through New Hampshire at least, but he\u2019ll get slowed down farther out there,\u201d Humphrey said. \u201cSo what I\u2019m saying is, the real winner in New Hampshire is whoever comes in second and third.\u201d\n\n\n\nRunning For 2nd Place\n\n\n\nBut would second place \u2014 or even third place \u2014 be a satisfactory result in New Hampshire? If so, it\u2019s not something the candidates want to acknowledge.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to work hard and convince voters every day,\u201d Rubio told reporters in Nashua.\n\n\n\nAsked if he\u2019s running a race for second place, Rubio all but dismissed the question. \u201cI\u2019m running to do as well as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to get as many votes as we can and we\u2019ll see where that leads us.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt is well known that many New Hampshire voters make up their minds in the final days, so this race is hardly settled. But it\u2019s also a fact that the candidates who are not named Trump are having trouble escaping his shadow.\n\n\n\nJeb Bush experienced that Wednesday night at a town hall meeting in Meredith, where Tom Emanuel, a selectman from Laconia, told him he was leaning towards Trump.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd I was wondering why you think he\u2019s a jerk,\u201d Emanuel wanted to know.\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how much time we have,\u201d Bush said with a wry smile as the crowd laughed.\n\n\n\nBush said he wanted first to say some nice things about Trump, so he gave him credit for his success in business and for his ability to challenge political correctness. But then he grew serious.\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you want a president that disparages women, Muslims of all kinds, people with disabilities, Hispanics?\u201d Bush asked, with rising emotion. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re getting down to about 90 percent of all people here. I mean, at what point do we say, \u2018Enough of this!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\nBush has been somewhat reluctant to even acknowledge Trump on the campaign trail, but not this week, not with time running out to make his case in New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nAfter that exchange, Bush asked Emanuel for his vote \u2014 because that\u2019s what this process is all about.\n\n\n\nThe Laconia selectman said he\u2019s still supporting Trump. But with almost a month to go, he said that could change. \u201cIt\u2019s a long race,\u201d Emanuel said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "The Republican presidential primary race in New Hampshire is turning into a contest for second place.With businessman Donald Trump so far ahead in the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/new-hampshire-primary-now-race-2nd-place", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201601/462429276.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Republican presidential primary race in New Hampshire is turning into a contest for second place.With businessman Donald Trump so far ahead in the", "title": "New Hampshire Primary Now A Race For 2nd Place"}, "wordCount": 1182, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Anthony Brooks", "org_id": 330, "dc": {"title": "New Hampshire Primary Now A Race For 2nd Place"}, "nid": 52560, "datePublished": "2016-01-09", "story_id": 462359336, "keywords": "New Hampshire, New England, 2016, campaigns, White House", "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Republican presidential primary race in New Hampshire is turning into a contest for second place.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this election is so critical, that\u2019s why we can\u2019t afford to elect Hillary Clinton,\u201d Rubio told the crowd.\n\u201cSo what I\u2019m saying is, the real winner in New Hampshire is whoever comes in second and third.\u201dRunning For 2nd PlaceBut would second place \u2014 or even third place \u2014 be a satisfactory result in New Hampshire?\nAsked if he\u2019s running a race for second place, Rubio all but dismissed the question.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to take your guns away folks,\u201d Trump told the crowd."}
