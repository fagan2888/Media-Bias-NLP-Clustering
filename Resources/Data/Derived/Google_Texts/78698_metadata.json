The words out of the Oval Office are soothing, conciliatory, and, well, presidential. Some press aide, or maybe a cabinet member in really serious circumstances, gets sent out to deliver the cutting criticism of the administration\u2019s political opponents.\n\nRelated: Democrats Enraged Over Closely Guarded Trade Deal\n\nHowever, on the question of the controversial TPP negotiations, which would change trade rules between the U.S. and many of its Pacific Rim trading partners, it was President Obama\u2019s Trade Representative Mark Froman who played the role of diplomat on Thursday, while the president himself went on the attack.\n\nThe administration is in the unfamiliar position of pushing an initiative with broad Republican support but very little Democratic enthusiasm. The trade deal, which has been negotiated in secrecy that, according to some members of Congress, rivals serious national security discussions, is facing significant Democratic resistance.\n\nThe negotiations, while opaque to many, have been thrown open to representatives of the businesses most likely to be affected by changes to import and export restrictions. Notably absent from the negotiations have been representatives of organized labor, and groups concerned about the human rights and environmental elements of the deal.\n\nChief among the Democrats concerned about the deal has been Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has argued that the deal is bad for U.S. workers and bad for U.S. families.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Free Trade Deal Puts Hillary on the Hot Seat\n\n\u201cFor more than two years now, giant corporations have had an enormous amount of access to see the parts of the deal that might affect them and to give their views as negotiations progressed,\u201d Warren said in a statement released Wednesday. \u201cBut the doors stayed locked for the regular people whose jobs are on the line.\u201d\n\nShe warned that the deal could easily contain \u201ca provision hidden in the fine print that could help multinational corporations ship American jobs overseas or allow for watering down of environmental or labor rules.\u201d Congressional approval of Trade Promotion Authority, which would give the president the ability to put a pre-negotiated deal before Congress for an up-or-down vote, she warned, \u201cwould mean that Congress couldn\u2019t write an amendment to fix it. It\u2019s all or nothing.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Froman made an appearance at The Atlantic\u2019s \u201cSummit on the Economy\u201d in Washington, and was asked whether her concerns have \u201cmerit.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Froman. \u201cA lot of the issues for the critics of our trade agenda more broadly, whether it\u2019s Senator Warren or others, certainly have merits. We are concerned about the impact of globalization on jobs and wages in the U.S.\u201d\n\nRelated: Cruz and Ryan \u2013 Don\u2019t Trust Obama\u2026Except on Trade Talks\n\nHe added, \u201cThe concerns that are raised are absolutely legitimate. We take them very seriously, and we think that we\u2019re dealing with them constructively through these negotiations.\u201d\n\nLess than an hour later, the president made an appearance before Organizing for Action, the progressive group that grew out of his election campaigns. And he made it clear he was seriously unhappy with his critics on the trade deal. Particularly his Democratic critics.\n\nBottom line, he said: \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201c[TPP] is the most progressive trade agreement in our history,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got strong provisions for works strong provisions for the environment. And unlike some past trade agreements, all these provisions are actually enforceable.\n\nRelated: Clinton Faces Early Test on Pacific Rim Trade Deal Fight\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve been listening to this debate, I\u2019ve got some good friends who are opposed to this trade agreement, but when I ask them specifically, \u2018What is it you oppose?\u2019 they start talking about NAFTA. And I\u2019m thinking \u2018Well, I had just come out of law school when NAFTA was passed. That\u2019s not the trade agreement I\u2019m passing. So you need to tell me what\u2019s wrong with this trade agreement, not one that was passed 25 years ago.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe president continued for several minutes, sometimes sounding offended, and making a very personal defense of his record on issues related to working Americans.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear folks saying, this trade deal would destroy the auto industry\u2026.\u201d he said, \u201cListen, I spent a lot of time and a lot of political capital to save the auto industry. Why would I pass a trade deal that was bad for U.S. autoworkers? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\n\n\u201cWhen people say this trade deal is bad for working families, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. I take that personally. My entire presidency has been about helping working families. I\u2019ve been working too hard at this, and I\u2019ve got some of those folks who are saying that stuff, after all I\u2019ve done to help lift their industries up?\n\n\u201cI spent six and a half years trying to wrestle this economy out of the worst recession since the Great Depression, and rebuild it so that it benefits working Americans. I\u2019ve had to do it against relentless opposition, but every single thing we\u2019ve done, from Obamacare to Wall Street reform to student loan reform to credit card reform, to fighting for a fairer tax code, to higher minimum wages, to a smarter workplace, all of it\u2019s focused on making sure it\u2019s a good deal for middle class families and folks who are working hard to get into the middle class.\u201d\n\nLong after he might have switched to a different subject, the president continued going after his critics on TPP.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t think this was the right thing to do for working families, I would not be doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got some of these folks who are friends of mine, allies of mine, saying this trade deal would destroy American working families, despite the fact that I\u2019ve done everything in my power to make sure that working families are empowered.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo by this logic, I would have had to do all this stuff for the last six and a half years and then, suddenly,\u201d he snapped his fingers, \u201csay \u2018Well, I just want to destroy all of that.\u2019\u201d\n\nPresident Obama eventually moved on to different topics, and in the end, Congress seems likely to give him the Trade Promotion Authority he seeks, perhaps in a matter of days. Whether the fight over TPP has done damage to his relationship with key allies may take longer to determine.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In emotional, sometimes angry remarks on Thursday, President Obama went on the attack against his traditional Democratic allies, saying the \u201cdon\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about\u201d in their criticism of a pending free trade deal.", "title": "An Angry Obama Blasts Democrats on Trade Deal", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/24/Angry-Obama-Blasts-Democrats-Trade-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11062014_Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/24/Angry-Obama-Blasts-Democrats-Trade-Deal", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/11062014_Obama.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "In emotional, sometimes angry remarks on Thursday, President Obama went on the attack against his traditional Democratic allies, saying the \u201cdon\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about\u201d in their criticism of a pending free trade deal.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cec\"", "article_summary": "In the increasingly contentious debate over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Obama administration on Thursday flipped the script.\n\u201cWhen people say this trade deal is bad for working families, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\nAnd he made it clear he was seriously unhappy with his critics on the trade deal.\nWhy would I pass a trade deal that was bad for U.S. autoworkers?\nBottom line, he said: \u201cThey don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201c[TPP] is the most progressive trade agreement in our history,\u201d he said."}
