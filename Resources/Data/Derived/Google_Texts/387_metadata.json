Indiana\u2019s minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour.\n\nWhile he recognized that business may have a difficult time finding the means to pay employees such a wage, competitive wages would foster competition between employers for workers.\n\n\u201cWe have to, number one, make sure people have work, and number two, make sure those people are paid well,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also urged for investment in manufacturing jobs, such as fixing national infrastructure and investing in community colleges to assist in workers\u2019 education, as well as early childhood education.\n\nMillennium Steel is a partner with Toyota\u2019s manufacturers. It is a minority-owned business run by Henry Jackson.\n\nThe plant was recently ranked by Black Enterprise Magazine as one of the largest minority-owned businesses in the nation.\n\nThe president also launched a new competition earlier in the day Friday to invest more than $200 million to create an Integrated Photonics Manufacturing Institute. Photonics is the use of light to transmit information.\n\nThe address was scheduled on National Manufacturing Day, an event created three years ago to honor manufacturing workers, as well as showcase the manufacturing opportunities for the youth, the president said.\n\nObama has not been to Indiana since 2011.\n\nHis most notable visit to Indiana was in 2009 to visit Elkhart, Ind., to discuss the high unemployment rate. Elkhart, at that time, had an unemployment rate of approximately 15 percent, the highest in the nation.\n\nObama\u2019s speech came on the same day that the national job and unemployment rates were released.\n\nApproximately 248,000 jobs were added last month nationwide, and the unemployment rate dipped to 5.9 percent.\n\nObama has used this economic policy talk tour to shift away from the overseas events that have dominated national conversation recently.\n\nThis event comes one month before the midterm elections Nov. 4.\n\nGov. Mike Pence greeted the president at the Evansville airport Friday afternoon. Pence sent Obama a letter earlier this week requesting a meeting to discuss the Healthy Indiana Plan.\n\nObama\u2019s trips to Northwestern University and Princeton, Ind., come as part of a conversational shift prior to the midterm elections.\n\nAll 435 seats in the House of Representatives will be decided on by voters Nov. 4.\n\nObama discussed new legislation he would like to see put in front of Congress regarding minimum wage and equal pay, though he blamed the current Congressional stalemate as to why many of the pieces might not pass.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that\u2019s holding us up is politics,\u201d Obama said.\n\nLast month, the House of Representatives passed the Jobs for America Act, a Republican-written bill composed of many other economic proposals made by members of Congress, including a bill sponsored by Rep. Todd Young, R-Ind., repealing the Affordable Care Act definition of 30 hours of work being full time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama visited\u00a0Millennium Steel in Princeton, Ind., on Friday.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"url": "http://www.idsnews.com/article/2014/10/obama-visits-southern-ind-steel-plant", "image": "http://duvq7ua50whdw.cloudfront.net/20160412QJeR6mqyqZ/dist/img/IDS-fb-icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "President Obama visited\u00a0Millennium Steel in Princeton, Ind., on Friday.", "title": "Obama visits southern Ind. steel plant"}, "twitter": {"domain": "idsnews.com", "description": "President Barack Obama visited a southern Ind. steel plant Oct. 3 and delivered a speech before taking questions from the audience.", "title": "Obama speaks in Indiana", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ids/54692_obama_speaks_in_indianaf.png", "site": "@idsnews", "player": {"url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.ids/54692_obama_speaks_in_indianao.mp4", "width": 600, "identifier": "https://ids.getsnworks.com/twitter-video?id=54692", "height": 337}, "card": "player"}, "keywords": "Indiana University, IU, Bloomington, Indiana, Monroe County, Indiana Daily Student, IDS, student newspaper, newspaper, news, students, college, university, campus, Ernie Pyle", "google-site-verification": "FkL7grEXumouo-bfJ89mrCvOGorioiCTNQ4t4X3bjjI", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "President Obama addressed workers at Millennium Steel in Princeton, Ind., on Friday to discuss the state of the economy during his presidency.\nIndiana\u2019s minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour.\nObama urged for the minimum wage to be raised to $10.10 an hour, something he said would be one of the top factors in helping the economy grow.\n\u201cFor a long time, it was China,\u201d Obama said about business executives\u2019 views on where to place money.\nThe address was scheduled on National Manufacturing Day, an event created three years ago to honor manufacturing workers, as well as showcase the manufacturing opportunities for the youth, the president said."}
