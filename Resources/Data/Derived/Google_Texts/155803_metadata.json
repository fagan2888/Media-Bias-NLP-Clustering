The federal health insurance-reform law contains nearly 20 new taxes and fees on everything from tanning-bed salons to biofuels. There are also new credits for small businesses and individuals who buy coverage.\n\nThe idea behind the levies is to raise billions to cover those credits. Some of the taxes are relatively targeted or obscure. We\u2019ll stick here with the ones you\u2019re most likely to see on your individual or business return. And if you\u2019re breathing, you probably will see differences when you file in 2014 and beyond, whether it\u2019s a tax based on your Roth individual retirement account rollover or a tax credit for you or your small business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to know before the end of the year what they\u2019re looking at tax-wise so they don\u2019t have surprises,\u201d said Troy Crowther, a tax principal with local CPA firm Piercy Bowler Taylor &Kern. \u201cAnd I think there probably will be some surprises out there come April.\u201d\n\nAPRIL RETURNS BRING SWIFT CHANGES\n\nPeople who file federal income-tax returns this spring are at the front line of Obamacare-related tax tweaks.\n\nStart with higher levies on Medicare taxes and investment income. Single filers who make more than $200,000 a year, or joint filers who bring home more than $250,000, will see a 0.9 percent Medicare surtax on top of the existing 1.45 percent Medicare payroll tax. They can also expect to pay a 3.8 percent Medicare tax on unearned income such as investment dividends, rental income, interest and capital gains on property.\n\nThrow in 2013\u2019s increase in the highest tax bracket from 35 percent to 39.6 percent, and higher-end earners could be looking at an effective tax rate of 43 percent, said Chris Wilcox, a shareholder in local CPA firm Johnson Jacobson Wilcox.\n\nTogether, the Medicare surtax and investment taxes should raise $209 billion over the next decade, according to federal estimates.\n\nOK, so most people don\u2019t even come close to netting $200,000 a year. But this rule could still affect you, accountants say. That\u2019s partly because it could rope in small-business owners who pass profits and losses through to their individual tax returns.\n\n\u201cIf you take money out of people\u2019s pockets, that\u2019s less they have to invest in their business,\u201d said Bill McCarthy, a partner in local accounting firm McCarthy Kaster CPAs. \u201cIt downsizes money that could be spent in the economy, hiring employees or buying equipment.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, simple investment decisions could cost you a huge amount, even if your salary falls below $200,000 or $250,000. Say you take home $150,000 a year, and you borrow $75,000 from your 401(k) for a down payment on a home. That early withdrawal is considered income, Crowther said, and taking it will push you to $225,000. Or if you earn $100,000 a year, and you roll over a $100,000 traditional, untaxed IRA into a taxable Roth IRA, then boom \u2014 you\u2019re at $200,000.\n\nOther changes for high-earners include a jump in the capital gains tax from 15 percent to as much as 23.8 percent and cuts in personal exemptions and itemized deductions. That latter rule recently helped persuade one client to eliminate a $50,000 charitable contribution, Wilcox said.\n\nPeople at all income levels will see new limits on how much of their medical expenses they can deduct, and how much they can contribute to pretax, flexible spending accounts to cover expenses such as eyeglasses, braces, or tuition for their special-needs kids.\n\nBut Obamacare isn\u2019t all tax, all the time. There\u2019s an expanded tax credit on the way for small businesses that buy health insurance for employees. Companies with fewer than 25 employees earning an average of $50,000 per year or less could qualify as long as they pay at least half of their workers\u2019 premiums. The credit could be worth as much as 50 percent of your coverage contribution in 2014 and beyond, although only businesses with around 10 employees get the full credit.\n\nLocal accountants say the credit\u2019s early, smaller version, worth up to 35 percent of coverage costs from 2010 to 2013, hasn\u2019t gotten much play from business owners. That\u2019s because figuring it out requires a lot of record-keeping and paperwork, and that can pretty much wipe out savings.\n\n\u201cYou might save $2,000, but the cost to calculate that is $1,000,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nWilcox said one client he crunched numbers for ended up with a $900 credit.\n\n\u201cThe time and resource to make that calculation is just not even beneficial to the taxpayer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds really good on paper, but in reality, it is so limited that I\u2019m seeing very few small businesses even able to take advantage of it.\u201d\n\nWilcox and Crowther said they have no clients who\u2019ve taken the credit. McCarthy added that 160,000 of the 4 million small businesses projected to take the subsidy have actually applied for it.\n\nTwo significant new fees and one big tax credit don\u2019t take effect until Jan. 1, so they\u2019ll affect returns filed in spring 2015. That might seem a ways off, but accountants say you should start thinking now about how your incomes and expenses will look in 2014.\n\nPENALTY TAKES EFFECT IN NEW YEAR\n\nThe first major new cost is, of course, the individual mandate. Go without coverage after Jan. 1, and you\u2019re looking at an annual penalty of $95 or 1 percent of your income, whichever is bigger. So if you make $30,000 a year, you\u2019ll pay $300. The penalty increases each year through 2016, when it maxes out at $695 or 2.5 percent. That\u2019s $750 on a $30,000 salary.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have insurance on Jan. 1, you\u2019ll have to wait until October to enroll. You can\u2019t buy coverage if you get sick midyear, unless you have a qualifying event such as a new baby or loss of job-based insurance. Then, you can enroll after a waiting period of up to 45 days, and your individual fine is pro-rated. Enroll in July, for example, and you\u2019ll be on the hook for half of the penalty.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service will take the penalty out of any refund, although some people are changing their withholding status to try to avoid paying.\n\nThe penalty could eat into consumer spending, Wilcox said, because filers often use their refund to buy electronics, make home improvements or put a down payment on a car.\n\nFor consumers who buy coverage, tax credits could ease the pain. If you\u2019re single and make less than $45,960 a year, or if your household of four earns less than $94,200, you\u2019ll qualify for a subsidy, although the subsidy phases out considerably as incomes approach the threshold.\n\nThe tax credit could have an unforeseen consequence. Crowther said he expects many people who previously haven\u2019t filed taxes to begin filing, because you have to provide two years of prior returns to collect the subsidy. For businesses, the biggest overall change in 2014 will be a reinsurance fee of $63 per insured person. The fee, designed to raise $25 billion to pay insurers for selling coverage to people who are considerably sicker than average, would run through 2016. The Obama administration has proposed exempting some self-insured plans, such as union-sponsored policies, from the tax.\n\nThe tax isn\u2019t raising too many eyebrows among McCarthy\u2019s clients, at least.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hearing a lot of blowback on it,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly, if you have 100 employees and you owe $6,300, that\u2019s not a pittance. But it pales in comparison to the employer mandate.\u201d\n\nThat mandate is by far the largest tax looming in the more-distant future.\n\nEMPLOYER COVERAGE MANDATE COMING\n\nThe employer coverage mandate will cost noncompliant companies from $2,000 to $3,000 per worker after Jan. 1, 2015. The penalty is smaller if a company doesn\u2019t offer insurance at all; bigger if it provides coverage lacking Obamacare\u2019s essential health benefits.\n\nThe employer and individual mandates should raise $65 billion over 10 years, based on federal forecasts.\n\nBecause the employer mandate is more than a year away, it\u2019s hard to predict how it would affect the economy.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen media reports about companies cutting hours and shedding workers to fall below the rule\u2019s 50-worker threshold, or weighing canceling coverage altogether because the fine is cheaper than premiums.\n\nMcCarthy said he has a \u201cbad feeling\u201d that tens of millions of Americans insured through work will lose their coverage.\n\nBut Crowther said he thinks many companies will hang onto their plans. For starters, the penalty isn\u2019t tax deductible, while premiums are. And any business that provides coverage to compete for the best workers will still have to do so, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen people talk to me about dropping insurance, I ask them, \u2018Do you offer insurance now?\u2019 Most of them say they do. The question then is, \u2018Well, right now, you don\u2019t have to. Why are you doing it?\u2019 For whatever reason you\u2019re doing it, that reason doesn\u2019t change.\u201d\n\nEven considering the potential fines, the biggest cost of Obamacare isn\u2019t the employer mandate, or any other specific tax, accountants said. Rather, it\u2019s ambiguity, and the record-keeping requirements that come with thousands of pages of new regulations that aren\u2019t consistently applied.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to measure, but there\u2019s been so much uncertainty as far as how people plan for the law,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cWould the Supreme Court uphold it? Would Obama get re-elected? And then there\u2019s the fact that they keep changing it with carve-outs, exemptions and delays. How do you plan? That\u2019s the biggest cost. People don\u2019t know what or where their costs are going to be, going forward.\u201d\n\nContact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com.
