A motorcyclist is in critical condition at Bay Medical Center after a crash early Saturday morning on State Road 77 (SR-77) north of Crooked Lane in Bay County.

According to Florida Highway Patrol officials, Dylan Corbin was driving his motorcycle south on SR-77, and a second driver, Jewell Cook, was also traveling southbound on the same road, after entering SR-77 from the center median divide.

The front of Corbin's motorcycle collided with the left side of Cook's car while they were both driving south on SR-77. Corbin fell off his motorcycle near Bozeman High School.

Officials say Corbin was wearing a helmet, and at this time charges are pending.
