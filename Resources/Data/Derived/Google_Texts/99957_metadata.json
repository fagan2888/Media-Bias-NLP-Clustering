Yesterday, a video depicted Kentucky Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes' staff saying that Grimes is lying about her support of the coal industry in order to get elected. Today, an even more damaging video was released, this time of Grimes' major donors. According to them, Grimes is faking her support of the coal industry, and will \"f**k 'em [big coal] as soon as she gets elected.\"\n\nWarning, video contains adult language.\n\nThe Kentucky GOP released an emailed statement urging her to return donations from Niko Elmaleh and explain her real position on coal.\n\n\"If Alison Lundergan Grimes has even an ounce of respect for Kentucky's coal industry, she should immediately return all donations from Niko Elmaleh and then explain why in the world she continues to lie to Kentucky voters about her support for coal. The fact that her anti-coal donors truly believe and are willing to express that she's lying about being pro-coal just to get elected is extremely disturbing and should cause serious distress for all Kentuckians who depend on coal,\" said Kelsey Cooper, Kentucky GOP spokeswoman.\n\nMeanwhile, the coal miners' union United Miners has not backed down from their support of Grimes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Classy language. .05/25/2016 21:29:37PM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Classy language.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Grimes Donor Caught on Video Saying She's Going to \"F**k\" the Coal Industry", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2014/10/07/grimes-donor-caught-on-video-saying-shes-going-to-fk-the-coal-industry-n1901865", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/145/a1c441be-e5f5-4935-836c-387670b97dab.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Classy language.", "title": "Christine Rousselle - Grimes Donor Caught on Video Saying She's Going to \"F**k\" the Coal Industry", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2014/10/07/grimes-donor-caught-on-video-saying-shes-going-to-fk-the-coal-industry-n1901865", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/145/a1c441be-e5f5-4935-836c-387670b97dab.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Grimes Donor Caught on Video Saying She's Going to \"F**k\" the Coal Industry, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00ad\"", "article_summary": "Yesterday, a video depicted Kentucky Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes' staff saying that Grimes is lying about her support of the coal industry in order to get elected.\nAccording to them, Grimes is faking her support of the coal industry, and will \"f**k 'em [big coal] as soon as she gets elected.\"\nMeanwhile, the coal miners' union United Miners has not backed down from their support of Grimes.\nToday, an even more damaging video was released, this time of Grimes' major donors.\nAs I reported yesterday, Project Veritas kicked off a new video campaign seeking to expose candidates' true motives before the election."}
