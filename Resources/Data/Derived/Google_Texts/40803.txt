67 percent of jobs created under Obama already went to immigrants. Now Obama is set to cancel out whatever jobs were created, mostly low wage, in his miserable depressed economy with his illegal alien amnesty plan.

President Barack Obama’s unilateral amnesty will quickly add as many foreign workers to the nation’s legal labor force as the total number of new jobs created by his economy since 2009. The plans, expected to be announced late Nov. 20, will distribute five million work permits to illegal immigrants, and also create a new inflow of foreign college graduates for prestigious salaried jobs, according to press reports. Obama has already provided or promised almost one million extra work permits to foreigners, while his economy has only added six million jobs since 2009.

So Obama is effectively canceling out whatever job growth there was and there wasn't much of it for Americans to begin with.

Food prices have risen sharply under his regime. ObamaCare is about to begin killing jobs on an epic scale. If Obama were doing this to another country, it would be considered a war crime.
