It is staffed by 20 certified assistance counselors, who can provide help in English or Spanish.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe signed up one this morning, and have clients\u201d working with counselors now, Latoya Bishop, the center\u2019s supervisor, said on Monday afternoon.\n\n\n\nJust 3,259 New Jersey residents had selected a health plan on the federal marketplace as of Dec. 1, according to a recent report from the federal Department of Health and Human Services. About 51,000 applications from New Jersey residents had been received on the federal website, covering 95,800 people.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s just a small portion of the 900,000 uninsured people in New Jersey estimated to be eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Tens of thousands more whose health policies have been discontinued because they aren\u2019t comprehensive enough also need to choose new coverage.\n\n\n\nEnrollment must be completed by Dec. 23 for coverage to begin on Jan. 1. The uninsured have until March 31 to enroll or face a tax penalty.\n\n\n\nNew Jersey is one of 36 states to rely upon the federal government to run its insurance marketplace. The state received much less for outreach and education about the new insurance options than states with state-based health exchanges.\n\n\n\nThe staff at the enrollment centers uses the same federal website that the public uses, healthcare.gov. That site has been plagued by technical problems, most of which were remedied by Dec. 1, but it continues to produce error messages for some people. Depending on the website\u2019s performance, the enrollment process can take a half hour to an hour or more.\n\n\n\nThe Wayne and Edison sites are managed by SRA International under a contract with the federal Health and Human Services Department. It also has sites in Texas, Pennsylvania and Florida.\n\n\n\nWhile walk-ins are accepted, appointments are also welcomed.\n\n\n\nTo draw attention to the resources available for signing up in Obamacare plans, an open house is planned at the Edison center on Wednesday and the Wayne center on Thursday.\n\n\n\nLocation:\n\n\n\nWayne Enrollment Assistance Center, Suite 301, 1211 Hamburg Turnpike. .\n\n\n\nFor an appointment, call: 201-414-0465.\n\n\n\nHours: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\n\n\nEdison Enrollment Assistance Center, 1719 State Route 27, Festival Plaza, Edison\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail: washburn@northjersey.com\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "With just a week left to enroll in Obamacare health plans that start coverage on Jan. 1, a walk-in enrollment center has opened in Wayne where staff can provide face-to-face help for the uninsured and others who need insurance.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "Lindy Washburn", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/health-news/obamacare-enrollment-center-opens-in-wayne-1.692324", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com/designimages/NorthJerseyFacebook_377x196.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With just a week left to enroll in Obamacare health plans that start coverage on Jan. 1, a walk-in enrollment center has opened in Wayne where staff can provide face-to-face help for the uninsured and others who need insurance."}, "title": "Obamacare enrollment center opens in Wayne", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "Lindy Washburn", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Obamacare enrollment center opens in Wayne"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc966b\"", "article_summary": "To draw attention to the resources available for signing up in Obamacare plans, an open house is planned at the Edison center on Wednesday and the Wayne center on Thursday.\nIt\u2019s part of an enrollment push in New Jersey that includes a storefront center in Edison and a radio ad campaign.\nThe Wayne and Edison sites are managed by SRA International under a contract with the federal Health and Human Services Department.\nThe center in Wayne will be open seven days a week through March 31.\nWith just a week left to enroll in Obamacare health plans that start coverage on Jan. 1, a walk-in enrollment center has opened in Wayne where staff can provide face-to-face help for the uninsured and others who need insurance."}
