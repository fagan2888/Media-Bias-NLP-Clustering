Obamacare Forces Blue Cross to Cancel Most Individual Health Plans in Alabama

WSFA-TV in Montgomery, AL reports that self-employed and small business owners in Alabama are about to hear bad news from Blue Cross Blue Shield.

Reporter Bethany Wales reports today that "BlueCross has to cancel what they call the vast majority of its individual plans because they don't comply with the Affordable Care Act. The president and CEO of the company says its working to match customers with a plan that close to what they're already paying for. The problem? They are incredibly more expensive -- double, sometimes triple, what customers are paying now and the benefits don't think to measure up with that lower benefits and higher copays."

President Obama promised Americans that even if his signature health care law passed, if they liked their current health plan, they could keep that plan.

So much for that.

"I talked with the customer on the individual with plan today, he's been paying $523 a month for his family of four," Wales repors. "Starting in January his premium is going up to more than $1,100 a month. As an extra $600, he's not sure he can find in his budget. And the Blue Cross says the Affordable Care Act requires a rating structure that is drastically different than anything that was used before. Requiring things like rating family by the number of people, so large families have to pay more. Now this customer says his family is only four members, two of them are in college, so he shares his dilemma about keeping his family covered, tonight at 6.‚Äù

This is the second local news story this week that reveals that Obamacare amounts to a surcharge on larger American families.
