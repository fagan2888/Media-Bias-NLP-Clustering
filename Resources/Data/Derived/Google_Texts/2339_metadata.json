Think about how our kids take for granted that a black person or a woman can be President of the United States,\u201d she declared.\n\n\u201cThey take it for granted that for the first time in history, there are three brilliant women serving on our Supreme Court. They take for granted that their president will end hurtful policies like \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell,\u2019 that he\u2019ll speak out for gay marriage.\u201d\n\nThe forum marked the beginning of a long list of campaign stops the first lady is expected to make before the midterm elections. Michelle Obama has a much higher national approval rating than her husband and the Democrats are hoping she can help inspire voters.\n\n\u201cToday, when folks ask me whether I still believe everything we said about change and hope back in 2008, I tell them that I believe it more strongly now than ever before, because, look, I\u2019ve seen it with my own eyes,\u201d she said.\n\nShe then followed the same script her husband is fond of using and blamed any lack of \u201chope and change\u201d on Republicans in Congress.\n\n\u201cIf we lose these midterm elections, it\u2019s going to be a whole lot harder to finish what we\u2019ve started because things will be even worse here in Washington,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s gotten so bad, they\u2019ve even tried to block the work I do on child obesity \u2014 and that\u2019s really saying something. I mean, for most folks in this country, making sure our kids get decent nutrition isn\u2019t all that controversial \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d\n\n(H/t Breitbart News)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) First Lady Michelle Obama proudly defended her husband during a speech at the opening reception of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Women\u2019s Leadership Forum, telling the audience that people take her husband \u201cfor granted.\u201d \u201cJust think about how different our country...", "title": "Michelle Obama says Americans 'take for granted' Obama's...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/08/US-Africa-Summit_Deat-600x367.jpg", "height": 367}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/09/21/michelle-obama-says-americans-take-granted-obamas-presidency/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "take-for-granted", "published_time": "2014-09-21T11:14:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-21T11:14:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Michelle Obama has a much higher national approval rating than her husband and the Democrats are hoping she can help inspire voters.\nThink about how our kids take for granted that a black person or a woman can be President of the United States,\u201d she declared.\n\u201cThey take it for granted that for the first time in history, there are three brilliant women serving on our Supreme Court.\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama proudly defended her husband during a speech at the opening reception of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Women\u2019s Leadership Forum, telling the audience that people take her husband \u201cfor granted.\u201d\u201cJust think about how different our country looks to children growing up today.\nI mean, for most folks in this country, making sure our kids get decent nutrition isn\u2019t all that controversial \u2014 it shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d(H/t Breitbart News)"}
