It's Barack. Really! Six years in, they're finally giving me my own account. \u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) May 18, 2015\n\nThe President\u2019s first tweet led to this exchange between former President Clinton and Obama:\n\nGood question, @billclinton. The handle comes with the house. Know anyone interested in @FLOTUS? \u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) May 18, 2015\n\nWhile Jeb Bush is running around the country try to convince people that Obamacare can be replaced with an Apple Watch, Obama and Clinton were owning Twitter.\n\nRepublicans don\u2019t have a single person in their party that has as much star power as Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Democrats have the top four biggest headline getters in either party. The Obama/Clinton Twitter exchange highlights a major problem for the Republican Party. None of the GOP\u2019s presidential candidates has an ounce of charisma.\n\nThe cookie cutter Republicans are all dull, and there isn\u2019t a single one of them who won\u2019t get blown off of the debate stage when they stand next to Hillary Clinton. Jeb Bush is about as exciting as cold and unflavored oatmeal, and he is the Republican Party\u2019s great white establishment hope for 2016.\n\nScott Walker is a walking gaffe machine who is in way over his head. Rand Paul can\u2019t decide whether he is an establishment Republican or Ron Paul\u2019s crazy kid. Marco Rubio looks like a great candidate until he talks, and the rest of the field is made up of a motley crew of has-beens and never-wases that will never be elected president.\n\nPresident Obama and former President Clinton put Republicans to shame because they perfectly demonstrated what real charisma can do in 140 characters or less. The media has looked at all sorts of angles as the 2016 candidates announce, but the one point they overlook is that the Republican candidates aren\u2019t very likable.\n\nA couple of tweets from two of the biggest heavyweights in the party showed why Democrats are in a good position to keep the White House in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama and former President Bill Clinton got more attention than the Republican presidential candidates combined with a good-natured exchange on Twitter.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "President Obama and former President Bill Clinton got more attention than the Republican presidential candidates combined with a good-natured exchange on Twitter.", "title": "President Obama And Bill Clinton Put Republicans To Shame With Twitter Takeover", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/18/president-obama-bill-clinton-put-republicans-shame-twitter-takeover.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-20-at-11.02.10-AM-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-18T17:50:30+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,Bill Clinton,obama twitter account,potus,President Obama,twitter,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-05-18T17:50:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-18T17:50:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Bill Clinton, obama twitter account, potus, President Obama, twitter"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc731\"", "article_summary": "President Obama and former President Clinton put Republicans to shame because they perfectly demonstrated what real charisma can do in 140 characters or less.\nPresident Obama and former President Bill Clinton got more attention than the Republican presidential candidates combined with a good-natured exchange on Twitter.\n\u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) May 18, 2015The President\u2019s first tweet led to this exchange between former President Clinton and Obama:Good question, @billclinton.\nPresident Obama delivered his first tweet from his personal Twitter account:Hello, Twitter!\n\u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) May 18, 2015While Jeb Bush is running around the country try to convince people that Obamacare can be replaced with an Apple Watch, Obama and Clinton were owning Twitter."}
