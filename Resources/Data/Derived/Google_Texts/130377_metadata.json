Dave Camp (R-Mich.) said. \u201cWe need some leadership.\u201d [\u2026] Camp, appearing at an event with Jason Furman, one of Obama\u2019s top economic advisers, noted that the White House had only rolled out a general draft on business taxes well over two years ago. A more detailed proposal from Obama, Camp said, could give new life to the stalled tax reform effort.\n\nAccording to the report in The Hill, Camp made the remarks at an event sponsored by the Business Roundtable, a group of top corporate chief executives. The Michigan Republican, who\u2019s stepping down this year after 12 terms in Congress, added on tax reform, \u201cI could negotiate with myself. I don\u2019t think it would get anywhere\u2026. But I can\u2019t really counter what I\u2019ve done with nothing.\u201d\n\nI have a strong suspicion that I\u2019m one of only about seven people nationwide who find this interesting, and the reflexive \u201cblame Obama\u201d line grew tiresome quite a while ago.\n\nBut in this case, Camp\u2019s defense \u2013 tax reform failed because the White House didn\u2019t follow through \u2013 is so absurd, it requires some fact-checking.\n\nWith the knowledge that most of you probably stopped reading a few paragraphs ago, let\u2019s review reality for a minute.\n\nAs we last discussed in February, Camp, to his credit, invested three years of his life on a plan to overhaul the nation\u2019s federal tax code. It was an ambitious, thankless task, and though I wasn\u2019t altogether impressed with the proposal Camp put together, I gave (and still give) him credit for putting pen to paper and presenting a real plan, subject to public scrutiny.\n\nAnd for a short while, it looked like House Republicans might at least consider the possibility of working on the issue \u2013 they gave tax reform the special H.R. 1 designation, a symbolic bill number intended to convey its significance.\n\nAnd then the House GOP leadership changed its mind . Republicans made a conscious, deliberate decision: working on tax reform would mean less time to complain about \u201cObamacare,\u201d Benghazi, and anything else that fell into the far-right fever swamp. Working on public policy, GOP leaders concluded, would have been an unwelcome distraction from their more partisan priorities.\n\nBy March 2014, Republican officials thanked Camp for working so diligently on tax reform, then declared his plan dead . According to Camp\u2019s own GOP allies, his plan would receive no debate, no hearing, and no vote.\n\nAsked in the spring about the substance of Camp\u2019s tax-reform bill, Boehner said, quite literally, \u201c Blah, blah, blah, blah .\u201d\n\nAnd now Camp would have Americans believe that tax reform is dead because of Obama? For goodness\u2019 sake, the president presented Congress with a credible framework for tax reform, then waited for House Republicans to get their act together. GOP leaders decided not to bother \u2013 there were several dozen ACA-repeal votes to schedule instead.\n\nCamp is somehow under the impression that a more detailed plan from the White House would have salvaged the broader initiative. Really? Here\u2019s the follow-up question for the Ways and Means Committee chairman: if House Republicans weren\u2019t willing to support the tax-reform plan written by a House Republican, in what universe were they willing to instead support the plan from the Democratic president that disgusts them?\n\nCamp is correct that he can\u2019t negotiate with himself. But he could negotiate with his own GOP allies \u2013 his colleagues who told him to work on this bill \u2013 who instead told him they weren\u2019t interested. For the Michigan Republican to somehow want to pass the buck to the White House is ridiculous.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Republicans killed tax reform; they own this fiasco, whether Dave Camp likes it or not.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/dave-camps-short-memory", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Republicans killed tax reform; they own this fiasco, whether Dave Camp likes it or not.", "title": "Dave Camp's short memory", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/dave-camps-short-memory", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ap987350665581.jpg?itok=sI0A6ePk", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/dave-camps-short-memory", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap987350665581.jpg?itok=sIw0VdGi", "height": 553}, "title": "Dave Camp's short memory", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Republicans killed tax reform; they own this fiasco, whether Dave Camp likes it or not."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-11T17:06:59-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Dave Camp's short memory", "tags": "dave-camp,economy,house-republicans,republicans,tax-policy,tax-reform,taxes,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "09/11/2014 17:06:59 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/dave-camps-short-memory"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Republicans killed tax reform; they own this fiasco, whether Dave Camp likes it or not.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Economy, Taxes, Republicans, Dave Camp, House Republicans, Tax Policy, Tax Reform"}, "article_summary": "But in this case, Camp\u2019s defense \u2013 tax reform failed because the White House didn\u2019t follow through \u2013 is so absurd, it requires some fact-checking.\nA more detailed proposal from Obama, Camp said, could give new life to the stalled tax reform effort.\nFor goodness\u2019 sake, the president presented Congress with a credible framework for tax reform, then waited for House Republicans to get their act together.\nAnd for a short while, it looked like House Republicans might at least consider the possibility of working on the issue \u2013 they gave tax reform the special H.R.\nThe Michigan Republican, who\u2019s stepping down this year after 12 terms in Congress, added on tax reform, \u201cI could negotiate with myself."}
