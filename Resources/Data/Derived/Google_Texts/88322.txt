The Democratic Party controls almost all of the news media. Some years ago, the Democrats came up with a great idea: they established “fact checkers” within Democratic Party newspapers to spin unfortunate facts in the Democrats’ favor. Today, several such “fact checkers” are well known. Are they reliable? Of course not. To see why, read this brilliant post by Sean Davis at The Federalist.

The Federalist published a simple fact about the Clinton Foundation–a highly newsworthy entity, given Hillary Clinton’s status as the presumed 45th president:

Between 2009 and 2012, the Clinton Foundation raised over $500 million dollars according to a review of IRS documents by The Federalist (2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008). A measly 15 percent of that, or $75 million, went towards programmatic grants.

This wasn’t speculation, it was arithmetic, based on the Foundation’s tax records. And it didn’t make Bill and Hillary look good. The Democrats might have let it go, except that Rush Limbaugh quoted The Federalist on the air. So it was “game on” for the Democratic Party. PunditFact, an entity sponsored by the Tampa Bay Times and the Poynter Institute, undertook to fact check–i.e., to feverishly spin–that irrefutable fact.

The author of PunditFact’s “fact check,” Louis Jacobson, admitted to Davis that what Davis wrote was “clearly accurate” and “technically true.” In my book, “technically true” means “true.” Nevertheless, PunditFact, in service of its Democratic Party funders, labeled The Federalist’s arithmetic computation “mostly false.” Because they didn’t want to see the Clintons cast in a bad light. Seriously.

You should read the entire thing here to get the whole, almost unbelievable story. Meanwhile, the lesson is that liberal “fact checkers” can’t be trusted. At all. They are Democratic Party operatives, no more and no less, and they will be out in force in anticipation of the 2016 presidential campaign.
