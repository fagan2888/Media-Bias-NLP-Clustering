(Photo: Todd McInturf / The Detroit News)Buy Photo\n\nFord Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, facing a midnight Sept. 14 contract deadline, are considering a proposal floated by the United Auto Workers to create a health care co-op that pools together active workers from all three Detroit automakers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re discussing it and we\u2019ll see where it goes, but again, it\u2019s way too early,\u201d Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford said during a charity event Wednesday marking the 10th anniversary of the Ford Volunteer Corp.\n\nGM spokeswoman Katie McBride confirmed that the automaker also is discussing the health care co-op concept in its separate talks with the union.\n\n\u201cThe pressures of rising health care costs require collaboration to find creative solutions,\u201d McBride said in an emailed statement. \u201cGM is committed to working with our UAW partners to explore ways we can continue delivering benefits employees value while improving the long-term competitiveness of the company.\u201d\n\nFCA also confirmed it is discussing the co-op idea with the union.\n\n\u201cAs the cost of health care continues to increase at an unsustainable rate, FCA US is open to discussing with the UAW options that will reduce cost while both improving the quality of care and the health of our employees,\u201d Spokeswoman Jodi Tinson said in a statement.\n\nUAW President Dennis Williams first floated the idea publicly in June at the union\u2019s Solidarity House headquarters in Detroit. The Detroit News first reported last month that an active worker health care pool was more than an idea, and was one option being pushed by the UAW as they sent their demands to automakers.\n\nA co-op would pool all active salaried and hourly workers to help reduce automakers\u2019 rising health care costs, give them leverage against the health-insurance companies and maintain benefits for members in the future \u2014 similar to what the Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association, or VEBA, does for the current 860,000 UAW retirees and dependents.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve walked through this several ways; I just don\u2019t have any other answer,\u201d Williams told The News last month. \u201cI do believe this will work. It\u2019s worked with the VEBA.\u201d\n\nLabor expert Art Schwartz, a longtime GM negotiator who is not involved in talks this year, said confirmation from Ford and GM should not necessarily be interpreted as an indication the health-care pool concept will be part of any tentative agreement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can really read anything into what Bill Ford said,\u201d said Schwartz, who is president of Ann Arbor-based Labor and Economics Associates.\n\nFord added he \u201cfeels great\u201d about how discussions are going. Unlike past negotiations, little has been leaked about this year\u2019s talks \u2014 a tone bargainers on both sides credit to Williams and his bargaining style.\n\nIn just the past four years, outlays for health care have grown 45 percent for Ford and 77 percent for FCA. Automaker spending on health care for hourly workers and their families likely will top $2 billion this year.\n\nFord says its health care costs for hourly employees are about $800 million this year, up from $550 million in 2011. FCA says it will pay $615 million this year, compared to $347 million in 2011. GM reportedly spent $665 million on health care for hourly employees and families in 2011. The automaker will not say what its current spending is, but has said increases are \u201con par\u201d with Ford and FCA.\n\nThe co-op system pitched by the union would be a shared responsibility among the UAW and automakers, but driven by union leaders increasingly interested in helping to manage ballooning health care costs and their members\u2019 welfare. The union doesn\u2019t expect the pool would cost workers or the companies more.\n\nA pooled system also could help automakers avoid the Affordable Care Act\u2019s so-called Cadillac Tax, which starting in 2018 imposes a 40 percent excise tax on the portion of group health insurance premiums that exceed $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage.\n\nBill Ford was in Inkster on Wednesday to announce two initiatives for his Ford Volunteer Corps. The \u201cBill Ford Better World Challenge\u201d will award $500,000 yearly to community service projects identified by company employees. Ford is contributing $250,000 to the grant, and $250,000 will be matched by the automaker.\n\nUnder the \u201cThirty Under 30\u201d initiative, Ford will select 30 employees younger than 30 for a yearlong course to learn civic engagement and leadership skills.\n\nIn its 10 years, the Volunteer Corps has completed 1 million hours of community service, finishing 9,000 projects in 40 countries.\n\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019m most proud of,\u201d Ford said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we really stand for as a company.\u201d\n\nmmartinez@detroitnews.com\n\n(313) 222-2401\n\nTwitter.com/MikeMartinez_DN\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1EzjeUv", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The co-op would pool together active members from all three Detroit automakers", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "The co-op would pool together active members from all three Detroit automakers", "title": "Ford, GM: Big 3 health care pool on table", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2015/09/02/ford-uaw-healthcare-pool/71586424/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The co-op would pool together active members from all three Detroit automakers", "title": "Ford, GM: Big 3 health care pool on table", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/526b9bba5cafb8a3170d77fea680453bb097bc81/c=261-0-2891-2630&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/04/DetroitNews/B99302084Z.1_20150904103149_000_GR2J2FLU.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Bill Ford, UAW, Dennis Williams"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde001\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe pressures of rising health care costs require collaboration to find creative solutions,\u201d McBride said in an emailed statement.\nAutomaker spending on health care for hourly workers and their families likely will top $2 billion this year.\nGM reportedly spent $665 million on health care for hourly employees and families in 2011.\nFord says its health care costs for hourly employees are about $800 million this year, up from $550 million in 2011.\nIn just the past four years, outlays for health care have grown 45 percent for Ford and 77 percent for FCA."}
