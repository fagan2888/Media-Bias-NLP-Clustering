What kind of answer is that?\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s troubles began in February, when Amber Smith delivered daughter Kinsley five weeks prematurely. Kinsley spent 10 days in Summerlin Hospital\u2019s neonatal intensive care unit, and Amber\u2019s 40-day hospital stay included two surgeries.\n\nThe Smiths bought insurance from Anthem Blue Cross through Nevada Health Link in October and made two premium payments in January. Yet the claims are being denied because Amber\u2019s birth year is listed incorrectly on the family\u2019s insurance identification cards, Smith said. It\u2019s one year off \u2014 written as 1978, when it should be 1979.\n\nNor has Smith been able to get baby Kinsley added to the family\u2019s insurance, despite \u201cdozens of calls\u201d to Nevada Health Link and Anthem. So despite never missing a $1,300 premium payment, the Smiths are on the hook for all of Kinsley\u2019s follow-up care. What\u2019s more, some of Amber\u2019s specialists have unexpectedly abandoned provider networks, leaving the family with unexpected out-of-pocket expenses, he said.\n\nThe family\u2019s grand total? Roughly $1.2 million.\n\nThe Smiths are the latest in a line of consumers reporting technical problems with Nevada Health Link, the Xerox-built marketplace through which Nevadans can buy subsidized health insurance to comply with the Affordable Care Act. Las Vegan Larry Basich ran up more than $400,000 in uncovered bills in February after Xerox\u2019s system couldn\u2019t figure out which insurer he signed up with. Basich got coverage in March, after a flurry of media attention.\n\nThe board of the state exchange voted in May to drop Xerox and its system, and borrow sign-up functions of the federal Healthcare.gov when open enrollment begins Nov. 15.\n\nSpokesman CJ Bawden said the exchange is \u201cfully aware\u201d of the Smiths\u2019 case.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working very quickly to solve it,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are multiple issues incorporated in this case, and it\u2019s something that just takes a bit of time to work through. But we\u2019re trying to solve it as quickly as possible so they will have access to their health insurance, and will be able to go back and make sure charges accrued over this time period are taken care of by their insurance.\u201d\n\nAnthem spokeswoman Joyzelle Davis said the case \u201cillustrates the frustrations we and the health exchange have had in dealing with Xerox.\u201d\n\nXerox built its software so that changes such as birth dates have to be handled by the exchange system rather than by the carrier, Davis said.\n\nXerox also told Anthem the only way to add a baby to a family policy is to cancel the policy for the entire household and reissue a plan with the newborn on it.\n\nDavis said Anthem\u2019s records show Xerox cancelled the Smiths\u2019 old policy but hasn\u2019t yet applied payments and coverage to a new plan. Anthem has \u201crepeatedly escalated\u201d the issue to Xerox in recent weeks, Davis said, and company officials were \u201chopeful\u201d that the issue would be fixed by the end of the day Thursday. If that doesn\u2019t happen, Anthem will explore \u201calternative approaches,\u201d Davis said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Smiths remain overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cThey (providers) keep threatening to send me to collections,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018OK. Would you like me to make $25 payments on 12 doctors, plus all of our hospital bills? I can\u2019t pay all of you.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe birth-year typo isn\u2019t the only issue with the Smiths\u2019 coverage.\n\nThe family\u2019s monthly premium was initially set at $1,575. Nevada Health Link called in March to tell the Smiths they were overpaying and needed a new policy. The new, lower premium came in at $1,296, but since the switch, Smith can no longer see policy details or billing information online.\n\n\u201cAll I know is, I am sending checks and they are cashing them,\u201d Smith said.\n\nNevada Health Link transferred the Smiths to a \u201cspecial case unit\u201d in April, but Smith said the representative he works with cannot tell him when his coverage issues will be fixed, when he will have access to his account or when he will begin receiving statements and invoices.\n\nSo the Smiths have contacted the law firm of Callister, Immerman & Associates about joining a class-action lawsuit filed by plaintiffs who have paid for plans through Nevada Health Link but not received coverage.\n\nSmith is also shopping for a new plan through a local insurance broker. He won\u2019t be buying through Nevada Health Link, though, because of the issues he experienced and because his family earns too much to even qualify for the federal tax credits that come with insurance purchased on the site.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just praying for January to get here so I can get out of the exchange as quickly as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nContact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com.
