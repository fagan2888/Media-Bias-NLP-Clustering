GREELEY — A woman who cried wolf in a fictitious November case of rape in Windsor was sentenced Friday in Weld District Court to 35 days in the county jail.

Katherine Bennett, 21, of Illinois, was ordered to serve 180 days of electronic home monitoring and five years’ probation.

A jury found Bennett guilty in August of attempting to influence a public servant, tampering with physical evidence and solicitation to tamper with physical evidence, all felonies.

The charges and subsequent sentencing stem from an incident in which Bennett alleged she was kidnapped at knifepoint by Windsor resident Dustin Toth in a Safeway parking lot.
