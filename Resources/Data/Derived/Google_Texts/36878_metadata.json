They started by talking about any behind-the-scenes lobbying to get Medicaid back on the table.\n\nABORAYA: What are you personally doing behind the scenes to change that?\n\nBURWELL: We\u2019re gonna continue to work to make progress. What we know in Kentucky there\u2019s been an analysis by the University of Louisville and one of the big accounting firms saying 40,000 jobs will be created in Kentucky by 2021, a much smaller state than Florida. And $30 billion will flow into Kentucky from the federal government. So whether it\u2019s what this does for the individual in terms of health and financial security, or what this does for the state in terms of contributing to economic health of the entire state, we believe this is something that people are going to make a decision to do over time.\n\nABORAYA: Gov. Rick Scott mentioned jobs 32 times during the state of the state address. Is that something you\u2019re using as a negotiating or selling tactic behind the scenes to maybe get a little more talk on this?\n\nBURWELL: The jobs are extremely important, we\u2019ve seen that job growth. In addition, just about 10 days ago, another study came out where in states that have expanded Medicaid, we know the uncompensated care or that care when people just come in and use emergency rooms, that care has gone down. It\u2019s helping the economies and economics of those hospitals in those states. And that\u2019s in both rural and urban areas.\n\nABORAYA: Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a former hospital executive, he\u2019s pushing for greater hospital transparency at hospitals. Is greater price transparency a priority for HHS?\n\nBURWELL: It is, and it\u2019s a very important part of the Affordable Care Act where we\u2019ve made good progress. Whether that\u2019s price transparency on issues like drug payments or price transparency on issues like who\u2019s being paid how much by Medicare, the consumer has that ability. We want to move to a place where an engaged, empowered and educated consumer is at the center of care.\n\nSee below for an extended interview with Burwell.\n\nWMFE is a partner with Health News Florida, which receives support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\n\n\nHealth reporting on WMFE is supported in part by Florida Hospital and the Winter Park Health Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HHS Head Sylvia Burwell On Florida Medicaid, Jobs And Hospital Price Transparency", "generator": "MasterSlider 2.7.1 - Responsive Touch Image Slider | www.avt.li/msf", "title": "HHS Head Sylvia Burwell On Florida Medicaid, Jobs And Hospital Price Transparency - 90.7 WMFE", "og": {"site_name": "90.7 WMFE", "description": "Florida\u2019s 2016 Legislative Session kicked off this week, and this year, analysts do not think Medicaid expansion will be a hot-button issue.", "title": "HHS Head Sylvia Burwell On Florida Medicaid, Jobs And Hospital Price Transparency", "url": "http://www.wmfe.org/hhs-head-sylvia-burwell-on-florida-medicaid-jobs-and-hospital-price-transparency/55888", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.wmfe.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sylvia-Burwell.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.wmfe.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sylvia-Burwell.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wmfeorlando", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Abe Aboraya", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 518629354, "app_id": 1548836692013354}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-13T10:45:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-13T20:28:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "Y7hH39hBuXyNDcSaUYeVS5reQoCbVDVCIdb0XQlgfzI"}, "article_summary": "Whether that\u2019s price transparency on issues like drug payments or price transparency on issues like who\u2019s being paid how much by Medicare, the consumer has that ability.\nRick Scott, a former hospital executive, he\u2019s pushing for greater hospital transparency at hospitals.\nHealth reporting on WMFE is supported in part by Florida Hospital and the Winter Park Health Foundation.\nIs greater price transparency a priority for HHS?\nWMFE is a partner with Health News Florida, which receives support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting."}
