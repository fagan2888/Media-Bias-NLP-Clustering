Advalent healthcare IT solutions are based on a flexible and scalable cloud-based Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Configuration options and data mapping provided by Advalent make it easy to meet implementation schedules at a lower cost.\n\nThe Advalent ACO Solution focuses on ACO administration, including managing ACO financial risk and improving patient health with ACO care management, unlike other IT solutions for ACOs that are intended for use directly by providers.\n\n\u201cAdvalent ACO Solution helps ACOs manage the health of their business, in addition to patient health,\u201d said Sasidhar Parvatham, Founder & CEO of Advalent. \u201cFrom the start, our platform uses standardization, high configurability, and reusability that scales to ACOs of any size and minimizes upfront and ongoing IT costs. Custom builds are unnecessary; the data interface is ready, and custom mapping is provided at no charge.\u201d\n\nMonitor the financial health of your ACO\n\nACO administration tools in Advalent ACO Solution let business administrators analyze ACO finances and profitability with predictive pricing modules. Predictive modeling and performance tracking on multiple levels lets you proactively monitor your ACO\u2019s financial condition. In addition, the Advalent ACO Solution automatically identifies areas for improvement with comparisons of year-over-year results and better versus lower performers.\n\nCare management workflows allow nurses to engage patients\n\nACOs must carefully manage care and costs, and the most effective model appears to be ACO care management, where nurses engage with high-risk patients to improve their health and avoid unnecessary hospitalizations. The Advalent ACO Solution automatically identifies gaps in care and classifies and assigns patients to disease/case registries. These registries help care coordinators manage their patient populations. In addition, Advalent ACO solution drives member health improvements with built-in workflows: the system creates daily work items and lists that help care coordinators close gaps in care and focus their time on the patients who are most likely to affect the bottom line.\n\nQuality compliance and audit\n\nThe Advalent ACO Solution helps ACOs improve quality scores and ensures compliance with built-in quality measures, audit and compliance rules, and reporting. The Advalent solution keeps up with changes in ACO compliance and reporting requirements from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Advalent ACO Solution meets CAQH CORE standards for interoperability.\n\nLearn more at http://www.advalent.com.\n\nAbout Advalent\n\nAdvalent is reinventing the way healthcare technology is acquired, delivered, used and paid for with innovations such as standardization, unification and the universal availability of tools at an affordable cost.
