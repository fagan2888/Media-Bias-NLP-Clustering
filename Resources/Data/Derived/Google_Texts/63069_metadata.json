In some instances though, Attorney General Roy Cooper has declined to represent the state in cases which his office has determined are indefensible. For example, after the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond ruled that a Virginia gay marriage ban violated the U.S. Constitution, Cooper stated that his office would no longer defend the similar North Carolina ban in court. It was time to stop fighting court battles the state could not win, he said at the time.\n\nIn other instances, Republican lawmakers have retained private counsel even while Cooper was likewise defending the state, voicing concerns that he wouldn\u2019t adequately represent their interests.\n\nThe primary beneficiary of the General Assembly\u2019s largess has been the Raleigh office of Ogletree Deakins Nash Smoak & Stewart, with attorneys from that firm representing state officials in several lawsuits, including the voting rights and redistricting cases. That\u2019s the same firm that also advised Republican leaders during the drafting of the 2011 redistricting plan.\n\nOutside bills since summer 2014 alone exceeded $3 million, according to the AP \u2014 $2.9 million of that incurred by Ogletree Deakins to defend the voting rights cases.\n\nThose cases are far from over, as dispositive rulings from the federal district courts remain pending and appeals to the Fourth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court are likely to follow. The same is true for the redistricting cases in state and federal courts, and new lawsuits challenging other controversial laws are on the horizon.\n\nAs the AP points out, a challenge to the state\u2019s \u201cmagistrate recusal\u201d law, which allows magistrates to opt out of performing marriages based upon a \u201csincerely held religious objection\u201d to gay marriage, could be filed in the coming months.\n\nAccording to Roy Cooper\u2019s office, the Attorney General has defended state laws in at least 15 cases and didn\u2019t need the help of costly outside counsel.\n\n\u201cOur office hasn\u2019t requested that the General Assembly hire any of the private lawyers they\u2019ve been paying, and we think it\u2019s a waste of taxpayer dollars to pay outside lawyers to do the work we\u2019re already doing,\u201d Cooper\u2019s spokesperson Noelle Talley said in a statement.\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Funds for litigation costs go to private counsel retained to represent state officials in court, typically the job of the Attorney General.\nThe same is true for the redistricting cases in state and federal courts, and new lawsuits challenging other controversial laws are on the horizon.\nIn some instances though, Attorney General Roy Cooper has declined to represent the state in cases which his office has determined are indefensible.\nIt was time to stop fighting court battles the state could not win, he said at the time.\nIn other instances, Republican lawmakers have retained private counsel even while Cooper was likewise defending the state, voicing concerns that he wouldn\u2019t adequately represent their interests."}
