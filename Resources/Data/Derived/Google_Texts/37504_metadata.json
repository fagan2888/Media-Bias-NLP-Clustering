Accounting and finance, 3.4 percent increase, and creative and marketing talent, 3.3 percent increase, follow the tech field, as the largest gainers.While Robert Half didn\u2019t break down how it expects the average salaries to increase by state, Jim Kwapick, the firm\u2019s district president in Minnesota, told Twin Cities Business that Minnesota as a whole is expected to be slightly above the national averages in every category.\u201cMinnesota tends to be ahead of the curve in the job market; we\u2019re usually about two points better than the national average for unemployment, which is a big factor in salary averages,\u201d Kwapick said.Changes to government regulations played a big role in the projected increases, especially in the health care sector due to the Affordable Care Act, according to Kwapick.\u201cWe are seeing a lot of demand in the accounting and finance space. With all of the new regulations, companies are looking to hire more senior analysts, payroll specialists, and cost accounting positions,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the Twin Cities has an especially large financial sector, with companies like U.S. Bank and Ameriprise looking for skilled employees in a competitive market.\u201dAccording to Robert Half, the job candidate pool for certain industries is smaller than many hiring managers believe and is driving starting salaries higher. The market for experienced accounting and finance professionals has tightened dramatically in many areas.\u201cMany hiring managers are encountering difficulty finding professionals with the specialized skills they need to achieve their growth goals,\u201d Paul McDonald, Robert Half senior executive director, said in a statement.According to the report, though general unemployment levels remain high, unemployment rates for a number of accounting and finance occupations are below the national average. Financial professionals who hold degrees and have specific skills seem to be frequently receiving multiple offers and counteroffers\u2014thereby driving salaries higher.Robert Half\u2019s report did not look at blue collar or industrial type jobs. \u201cThe four-year degree unemployment rate is about half of what the overall rate has been; the accounting and tech spaces haven\u2019t been hurt as badly overall,\u201d Kwapick said.Twin Cities Business examined how essential postsecondary education will be for job placement in the future for Minnesota in its October issue.
