I work in public health. This can\u2019t happen to me.\u201d\n\nD, who requested anonymity, says he contracted the virus when a condom broke during sex. Two weeks later, he was tested for two sexually transmitted infections \u2013 chlamydia and gonorrhea \u2013 but not for HIV. Shortly afterward, he went back for an HIV test and found out that he had the virus.\n\nSoon after his diagnosis, D moved to Atlanta, which also happens to be the epicenter of a re-emerging national HIV crisis.\n\nAccording to the latest CDC HIV surveillance report released this spring, metro Atlanta has the fifth-highest rate of new HIV diagnoses. And that statistic may understate the problem. Patrick Sullivan, an Emory researcher and former CDC director of HIV surveillance, says, \u201cAtlanta has one of the most intense epidemics in the country.\u201d\n\nThree of the five core metro Atlanta counties \u2013 DeKalb, Fulton and Clayton \u2013 are among the top counties nationally in rates of new HIV diagnoses.\n\nWhat sets Atlanta\u2019s epidemic apart, says another Emory researcher, Travis Sanchez, is how severely the new diagnoses are concentrated within a specific population: young black men who have sex with men.\n\nThe combined problems of poverty and lack of access to health care in Atlanta are the driving forces behind the HIV epidemic, and they disproportionately affect the black community in Atlanta, experts say.\n\n\u201cWe think that HIV is no longer a death sentence, and in the era of antiretroviral drugs, we think that no one is dying,\u201d says Emily Brown of the LGBT advocacy group Georgia Equality. \u201cBut the reality is that in the black community, HIV is advancing to AIDS for many, and people are dying. No one is talking about it.\u201d\n\nAtlanta is home to a large black gay population, a community in which transmission of HIV is high. Also, a recent study by the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank, found Atlanta to have the highest income gaps between rich and poor, and many whose income is below the poverty line do not have access to health insurance. Georgia has among the highest rates of uninsured residents in the United States, and has rejected Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn 2013, Fulton and DeKalb counties had the highest number of people living with HIV diagnoses in Georgia \u2013 14,695 and 6,116, respectively. These two counties also had the highest numbers of new HIV diagnoses in Georgia, with Fulton at 667 and DeKalb at 414, according to the latest figures from the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nPublic Health says that while there is cause for concern about the increase in HIV cases, the change may come partly because we\u2019re getting better at tracking the number of infections. A more comprehensive reporting system has resulted in more accurate reporting of HIV cases to the CDC, state officials say.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Local News, Maithri Vangala", "og": {"url": "http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2015-06-16/metro-atlanta-center-burgeoning-hiv-crisis", "site_name": "Online Athens", "type": "article", "description": "ATLANTA | \"The night I found out, I slept one and a half hours,\" recalls D, a 29-year-old black gay man. \nHe's talking about being diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.", "title": "Metro Atlanta at the center of a burgeoning HIV crisis"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeef2\"", "article_summary": "According to the latest CDC HIV surveillance report released this spring, metro Atlanta has the fifth-highest rate of new HIV diagnoses.\nSoon after his diagnosis, D moved to Atlanta, which also happens to be the epicenter of a re-emerging national HIV crisis.\nPatrick Sullivan, an Emory researcher and former CDC director of HIV surveillance, says, \u201cAtlanta has one of the most intense epidemics in the country.\u201dThree of the five core metro Atlanta counties \u2013 DeKalb, Fulton and Clayton \u2013 are among the top counties nationally in rates of new HIV diagnoses.\nIn 2013, Fulton and DeKalb counties had the highest number of people living with HIV diagnoses in Georgia \u2013 14,695 and 6,116, respectively.\nI work in public health."}
