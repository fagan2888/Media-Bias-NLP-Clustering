Chris Christie, left, speaks at the Mar-A-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., on March 1. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nEvery four years, thousands of Americans threaten to leave the United States if the \u201cwrong\u201d candidate becomes president. For many voters this year, that candidate is Donald Trump.\n\nA number of celebrities, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Cher, have threatened to flee the country if Trump wins the election in November. Jon Stewart says he plans to escape planet Earth altogether. Rob Calabrese, a Canadian radio host, has urged Americans to join him on Cape Breton Island, in northeastern Nova Scotia. \u201cHow much would it cost for a three bedroom lakeside home in your state? About a jillion dollars?\u201d Calabrese asks on his website. \u201cYou would need to BE Donald Trump to afford a place like that. But in Cape Breton, we have the most affordable housing market in North America!\u201d You can expect more of the same if Trump actually does lock up the Republican nomination, and even more if polls start to show that he could win the general election: Google searches for \u201cmove to Canada\u201d spiked on Tuesday night as Trump romped through Super Tuesday.\n\nIn truth, though, few of Trump\u2019s detractors are likely to leave the country because of November\u2019s results. And had Mitt Romney won in 2012, as I wrote then for the Atlantic, few diehard supporters of President Obama\u2019s would have done so, either. This pattern has a history: Twelve years ago, as George W. Bush took a commanding lead over John F. Kerry in the polls, Canadian immigration applications tripled. Visits to the immigration department\u2019s website skyrocketed from an average of 20,000 per day to 115,000 the day after Bush won the election. A small crop of diehard liberals followed through, but U.S-Canadian immigration was ultimately unchanged in the year following the election. Two years later, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh promised to move to Costa Rica if the Affordable Care Act passed. It did, but Limbaugh still lives in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nWhy do so many disgruntled voters threaten to leave the country, only to see so few actually follow through? Because people overestimate how much pain they\u2019ll feel when they experience a dreaded outcome.\n\nThis isn\u2019t news to psychologists. In 1978, Philip Brickman and his colleagues interviewed accident victims, lottery winners and a control sample of people who hadn\u2019t experienced an unexpected major life event, good or bad. Many of the accident victims could no longer use their arms and legs, while the lottery winners had won an average of $2 million in today\u2019s money. As much as progressive voters hope for a Democratic president, the gap between that outcome and a Trump administration must pale in comparison to the difference in well-being between lottery winners and accident victims. But when a researcher asked the lottery winners, accident victims and control subjects how happy they generally felt, the differences between the groups was strikingly modest. On a six-point scale that ranged from \u201cnot at all happy\u201d to \u201cvery happy,\u201d all three groups used the more positive half of the scale, and the lottery winners were only a single point happier than the accident victims.\n\nBrickman\u2019s results weren\u2019t a fluke. In 1994, George W. Bush beat Texas Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat. Shortly before the election, Dan Gilbert and his colleagues asked a sample of voters to predict how they\u2019d feel if their preferred candidate either won or lost. In the event of a Bush victory, Democrats expected to be much less happy than they were before the election, while Republican voters expected to ride a wave of long-term elation. But a month later, when the researchers contacted them again, most of the voters reported that they were, on average, just as happy or sad as they had been before the election. The election\u2019s effects on their lives were modest and short-lived. Similarly, in 2008, John McCain\u2019s supporters anticipated being far more unhappy after he lost to Obama than they actually were.\n\nThere are at least two reasons people overestimate the effect of election outcomes \u2014 and other life events \u2014 on their enduring well-being. The first is the tendency to forget that life goes on even after traumatic events. Most of our lives consist of a series of mundane events: rising in the morning to eat breakfast, going to work, commuting home, etc. These prosaic events have a greater effect on our daily well-being than, say, election results do, and they tend to be similar for winners and losers, or accident victims and lottery winners. If Trump wins the presidency, the pain of his victory will eventually subside for Democrats, and their lives will be dominated by the same pedestrian events that dominated them before the election.\n\nThe second reason that defeat stings less than we fear before our candidate loses is that humans have a tendency to overestimate how long severe psychological pain will last. Just as we might treat a deep gash with antibiotic ointment and bandages, we\u2019re equipped with a sophisticated psychological immune system that targets serious emotional injuries. Self-soothing is distracting and mentally exhausting, so we tend to employ it only for major injuries. As Gilbert and his colleagues explained, \u201cA wife may do the costly cognitive work necessary to rationalize her husband\u2019s infidelity (\u2018I guess men need to try this sort of thing once to get it out of their systems\u2019), but not his annoying habits (\u2018I guess men need to experiment with leaving their dirty dishes in the sink\u2019), and thus the wife\u2019s anger about her husband\u2019s disorderliness may outlive her anger about his philandering.\u201d Ardent Democrats may find a Trump presidency more painful at first, but their psychological immune systems should therefore kick in more keenly.\n\nThe good news, then, is that a Trump victory in November will distress his critics less severely and more briefly than they imagine. And most of them will go on, like thousands of disappointed voters do every four years, living the same lives in the same country they inhabited before Nov. 8, 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Losing never hurts for as long as we fear it will.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Losing never hurts for as long as we fear it will.", "title": "Here\u2019s why you won\u2019t really move to Canada if Trump wins in November", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/03/02/you-may-think-youll-move-if-trump-wins-but-heres-why-you-wont-really-do-it/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/02/National-Politics/Images/Botsford_TRUMP_FL_16_03_01_12921456890491.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "adamleealter"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/03/02/you-may-think-youll-move-if-trump-wins-but-heres-why-you-wont-really-do-it/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "donald trump, election, canada, george w. bush, rush limbaugh, republicans, democrats, barack obama, mitt romney", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "donald trump, election, canada, george w. bush, rush limbaugh, republicans, democrats, barack obama, mitt romney"}, "article_summary": "Al Sharpton, Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Cher, have threatened to flee the country if Trump wins the election in November.\nIn 1978, Philip Brickman and his colleagues interviewed accident victims, lottery winners and a control sample of people who hadn\u2019t experienced an unexpected major life event, good or bad.\nBut when a researcher asked the lottery winners, accident victims and control subjects how happy they generally felt, the differences between the groups was strikingly modest.\nMany of the accident victims could no longer use their arms and legs, while the lottery winners had won an average of $2 million in today\u2019s money.\nThe good news, then, is that a Trump victory in November will distress his critics less severely and more briefly than they imagine."}
