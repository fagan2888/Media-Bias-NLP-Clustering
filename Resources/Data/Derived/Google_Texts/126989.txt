According to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, 27-year-old Kyle Caldwell was at the center of two separate investigations.

A Hinton man arrested on child pornography charges last year was arrested again this week while out on bond.

According to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, 27-year-old Kyle Caldwell was at the center of two separate investigations.

Caldwell was arrested Wednesday after an undercover OSBI child porn investigation.

He is currently awaiting trial for aggravated possession of child pornography and distribution of child pornography from a case in September of 2013.

“This close together, this soon, it's something that I haven't seen very often,” OSBI Special Agent Adam Whitney, who leads the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) team, said.

In the 2013 case, agents said Caldwell had at least 100 sexually graphic images of children involving girls as young as five years old.

“It's very hard on the soul,” Whitney said.

In court early last month, Caldwell pleaded not guilty to the 2013 arrest.

Around the same time as the court appearance, OSBI's ICAC team opened another, separate child porn sharing investigation.

They said the evidence once again lead back to Caldwell.

“When we saw the address, we knew that it was more than likely going to be Mr. Caldwell again,” Whitney told News 9.

In the new investigation, agents said Caldwell had more than 700 child porn pictures available for others to download online.

“It's very disappointing," said Whitney. "It's tough to have to go out on someone again.”

Caldwell was arrested for destruction of evidence, but agents have not explained the details that lead to that charge.

Special Agent Whitney said investigators are working with the Caddo County District Attorney on additional charges against Caldwell for child porn distribution.

Caldwell's trial for his 2013 child porn arrest is set for December.
