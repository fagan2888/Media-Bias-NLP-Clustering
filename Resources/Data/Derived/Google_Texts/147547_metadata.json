Mike Lee, R-Utah, has been tapped to head the Senate Steering Committee, a conference of Republican lawmakers working to advance a conservative agenda.\n\nLee will take the helm from Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, chairman for the past two years.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Lee said:\n\nThe Senate Steering Committee will continue to develop and promote conservative solutions and facilitate vigorous discussion and debate on the issues that matter most to the country. I look forward to leading this effort and very much appreciate the support of my colleagues.\n\nThe Utah Republican will take over in January with the start of the 114th Congress \u2014 when Republicans may control the Senate for the first time since 2006.\n\n\u201cMike Lee is a knowledgeable and principled movement conservative, and he has done a terrific job as vice chairman of the Steering Committee this Congress,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to hand the gavel to him.\u201d\n\nTo win back a majority in the Senate, Republicans will need to net six seats. According to the New York Times, Republicans now have a 58 percent chance of winning the Senate. Such a victory would give the Steering Committee \u2014 and Lee \u2014 more power in shaping the legislation that moves through the upper chamber.\n\nLee and Toomey both were elected to the Senate in 2010, when a wave of tea party conservatives won seats in both the House and the Senate. Since then, Republicans have billed the two as champions of the conservative movement.\n\n\u201cConservatives all over America will cheer the selection of Mike Lee to lead the Senate Steering Committee,\u201d said Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, a former senator from South Carolina who also chaired the Steering Committee.\n\nDeMint added:\n\nMike is one of the most dedicated, sincere and passionate public servants I\u2019ve ever had the honor of working with. He\u2019s leading the fight for conservative reform within Congress and heading the steering committee will give him a platform to ensure conservative ideas are part of the national conversation.\n\nThe Senate Steering Committee, founded in 1974, serves as a forum for Senate conservatives to create, promote and advance a national agenda. In addition to DeMint, other former chairmen include Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and former Sens. Phil Gramm of Texas and Jon Kyl of Arizona.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Steering Committee turns to Mike Lee of Utah to lead efforts to advance a conservative agenda.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senate Steering Committee turns to Mike Lee of Utah to lead efforts to advance a conservative agenda.", "title": "'Conservatives Will Cheer': This Senator Is Taking Over Key Group", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/13889673169_076569a4b0_k.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-19T15:02:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1raYpGz"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senate Steering Committee turns to Mike Lee of Utah to lead efforts to advance a conservative agenda.", "title": "'Conservatives Will Cheer': This Senator Is Taking Over Key Group", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/13889673169_076569a4b0_k.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "elections,founding principles", "published_time": "2014-09-17T15:49:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-19T15:02:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Mike Lee, Pat Toomey, Jim DeMint, Senate Steering Committee, 114th Congress, Phil Gramm, Jon Kyl, Jeff Sessions"}, "article_summary": "The Senate Steering Committee, founded in 1974, serves as a forum for Senate conservatives to create, promote and advance a national agenda.\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to hand the gavel to him.\u201dTo win back a majority in the Senate, Republicans will need to net six seats.\nSuch a victory would give the Steering Committee \u2014 and Lee \u2014 more power in shaping the legislation that moves through the upper chamber.\n\u201cConservatives all over America will cheer the selection of Mike Lee to lead the Senate Steering Committee,\u201d said Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, a former senator from South Carolina who also chaired the Steering Committee.\nLee will take the helm from Sen.
