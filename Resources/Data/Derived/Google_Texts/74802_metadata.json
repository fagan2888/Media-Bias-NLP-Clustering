It was completely mismanaged and understaffed and failed to provide a safe environment for residents.\n\n'Those who did nothing or turned a blind eye should be ashamed. It is disgraceful that this home was allowed to be run in the way it did and run for nearly two years.'\n\nShe also q uestioned whether a CQC inspection which gave Orchid View a 'good' rating in 2010 - a year before it shut - was 'fit for purpose' and expressed incredulity that many staff were still working in the care industry, fearing 'there could be another Orchid View operating somewhere else'.\n\nThe SCR, commissioned by West Sussex Adult Safeguarding Board, has now made 34 recommendations in its answers to a series of questions asked by the family members of those who died at Orchid View on how care homes and their regulations can be improved.\n\nToday, relatives of seven of those residents who died, represented by medical negligence lawyers at Irwin Mitchell, said the home was 'the worst care home in the country disguised as the best'.\n\n\n\nThey renewed calls for a public inquiry to bring together all organisations and authorities involved, to ensure the 34 recommendations in the SCR are acted upon.\n\nA TIMELINE OF FAILINGS\n\nNovember 2009: Orchid View care home was opened by Southern Cross Healthcare.\n\nDecember 2009: The first safeguarding concerns were raised regarding the care of a resident, known as Mrs A, who had joined the home to live with her husband. Adult services launched an investigation. Over the next few months, further concerns were raised by Mr and Mrs A, relating to nutritional care and medication. In May 2010 a Case Conference found the couple had been neglected. January 2010: Orchid View was inspected by the CQC and rated as a two star 'good' service. There were 16 residents at the time. February 2010 to June 2011: More than 10 Adult Safeguarding Alerts were raised in relation to care at the home. June 2011: Following two letters of complaint, a planned CQC inspection was brought forward. Inspectors found the care home failing in a number of standard categories and demanded an action plan to address improvements. July 2011: A Boots pharmacist carried out the annual advice visit. She raised serious concerns about the storage and mismanagement of medication. August 2011: An anonymous alert was made to police regarding the treatment of residents. Five members of staff were arrested and questioned but the Crown Prosecution Service deemed there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges. August 2011: A team of health and social care staff were deployed to the home to mitigate the poor quality of care, leadership and management within the home. They visited the home daily noting concerns about medication errors, failure to manage residents' pain, nutritional issues, the hydration of residents, abusive behaviour and concerns about staffing competency. September 2011: The sixth manager, like predecessors not registered with the CQC, took over running the home. September 2011: Due to on-going concerns raised by the health and social care team, residents were offered alternative accomodation, starting with those deemed most at risk. September 2011: The CQC made a decision to issue seven warning notices. October 2011: Southern Cross closed Orchid View and announced all their homes would be transferred to other operators. February 2013: An overarching Adult Safeguarding Case Conference was held at which it was recorded that 'institutional abuse' had occurred. October 2013: An inquest into the deaths of 19 residents found five elderly residents 'died as a result of natural causes attributed to by neglect' and others 'died of natural causes' with 'insufficient evidence before me to show that this suboptimal care was directly causative' of their deaths. October 2013: A Serious Case Review was commissioned by the West Sussex Adults Safeguarding Board. June 2014: The findings of the SCR are published, outlining 34 recommendations to help prevent a repeat of the 'harrowing' abuse found at Orchid View. From 2009 to the closure of Orchid View in 2011, more than 15 Adult Safeguarding Alerts were raised. They concerned cases of unexplained bruising, poor medication administration, concerns residents were dehydrated and appeared neglected, a shortage of staff and an overarching a concern that Orchid View was not appointing competant staff.\n\n\n\nThe author of the report and chairman of the SCR, Nick Georgiou, called for the care home sector to face the same scrutiny as the NHS.\n\nHe said: 'It is right that the scrutiny and demands for improvement in the NHS are also expected from the independent sector.\n\n'As the role of independent sector care businesses has grown, the number, frailty and vulnerability of people dependent on their care has increased.\n\n'It is critically important that these services demonstrate that they can provide the quality of care necessary.'\n\nOne of the key recommendations made, was for care providers to prove they can recruit and sustain a trained and skilled workforce and that they can prove this to the Care Quality Commission - the care watchdog and regulator.\n\nAnother calls for relatives to always have a named point of contact within homes, and that concerns relating to safeguarding issues should be raised outside the home if they are not dealt with promptly and properly.\n\nThe report states the emergency services should also have a named contact with homes to allow for easier access, particularly at night.\n\nOther recommendations include a call for care providers to be contractually required to hold open meetings with residents and their relatives on a regular basis, to discuss any issues of concern and to make relatives aware of any significant safeguarding concerns.\n\nThe local authority should be invited to the meetings and the minutes should be shared.\n\nThe report calls for residents to be involved in any CQC inspections with opportunities for their relatives to meet and discuss the care home with inspectors.\n\nAlso, the report makes the recommendation that West Sussex Adult Safeguarding Board should develop a threshold for informing the public about significant safeguarding issues and concerns that have been raised at homes.\n\n\n\nThis would help people make informed choices about the homes they choose for their loved ones. The report states that organisations should make it very clear where and how this information can be accessed, known as a duty of candour.\n\nIan Jerome, whose uncle Bertram died as a resident at Orchid View, said: 'The key question we still have is why Orchid View could appear from the outside to be one of the best care homes in the country, when in fact it was clearly one of the worst.\n\n\n\n'There needs to be a much better system for sharing information about care home standards and about the people who are working in and running them.\n\n'It is really important to us that the recommendations revealed today become reality as soon as possible so that care homes can be improved across the country.'\n\nLinzi Collings whose mother Jean Halfpenny died in 2010 after being administered three times her regular dose of the blood thinning drug Warfarin over the course of 17 days at Orchid View, said: 'We welcome the review\u2019s findings and recommendations but still feel frustrated that there is still a lack of accountability for how severe the problems became before action was taken.\n\n\n\n'That is why we support our lawyers in their calls for a Public Inquiry so that all the organisations involved, including previous owners of Southern Cross, can be brought together in one place.'\n\nResponding to the SCR, Peter Catchpole, West Sussex County Council's cabinet member for adult social care and health, said: 'What happened at Orchid View was harrowing. We welcome this report and its recommendations.\n\n'There is nothing more important than looking after the most vulnerable people in our society and in this respect Southern Cross Healthcare has been judged to have failed.\n\n\n\n'Statutory agencies such as West Sussex County Council had no choice but to take action to investigate and ultimately move people from the home to protect them.\n\n'Nothing will help ease the pain of the families who were affected by these terrible events and who lost loved ones. I want to offer them my condolences and assure them that we will act on the recommendations made in this report and do all we can to ensure that the other agencies involved in managing and regulating the care of our elderly relatives do the same.'\n\nResidents at Orchid View care home were left in soiled bedsheets and in one night shift 28 drug errors were made, an inquest into the deaths of five patients last October, heard\n\nThe inquest looked at the deaths of 19 pensioners at Orchid View after whistleblower Lisa Martin, an administrator at the home, contacted police to raise concerns about the standard of care.\n\nThe coroner ruled that all of these residents suffered 'sub-optimal' care.\n\nBut five of the residents - Wilfred Gardner, 85, Margaret Tucker, 77, Enid Trodden, 86, John Holmes, 85, and Jean Halfpenny, 77 - died from natural causes 'which had been attributed to neglect'.\n\nThe multimillion-pound home was said to have had a 'five-star' feel when it opened in September 2009 which 'seduced' families into believing it was well run.\n\nBut one staff member at the \u00a33,000-a-month home said: 'It was like a car that looked good from the outside but it was knackered.'\n\nIt was shut down in late 2011 after an investigation by the CQC.\n\nBereaved relatives called on the Government to usher in 'dramatic changes' to improve care standards.\n\nFormer administrator Lisa Martin, turned whistleblower, informed police after becoming concerned about what was happening at the home\n\nLinzi Collings, Mrs Halfpenny's daughter, said: 'How the corporate failings of Southern Cross could create these events and how such terrible standards could go unnoticed by the authorities for so long has left us baffled.\n\n'In this day and age you expect measures to be in place to protect vulnerable members of society from being subjected to such horrendously poor care.\n\n'We believe dramatic changes are needed to the current care system, starting firstly with greater accountability for care home owners if they are found to be making unnecessary mistakes and offering substandard services.'\n\nJudith Charatan, whose dementia-suffering mother Doris Fielding died, said: 'The Government needs to wake up and take heed. More funding, resources, better training and increased standards a mongst those that work in this industry are the only ways to truly tackle the crisis.'\n\nLast week medical law experts at Irwin Mitchell, representing seven family members, said a SCR was only the first step and they called for a public inquiry into the regulation of the care industry.\n\nThe call follows further high-profile care home exposes including undercover footage of abuse at The Old Deanery Care Home in Essex in April, as well as a CQC report into standards at Francis Court, which re-opened on the same site as Orchid View following its closure, having 'serious failures' in staffing levels and resource during an inspection in October 2013.\n\nLaura Barlow, a specialist medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell representing the families, said: 'The recommendations in the Review are comprehensive and apply to many different organisations both locally and nationally, but for real change to occur they must be delivered and there are questions over who will now drive these improvements and who is ultimately accountable not only for the neglect at Orchid View but at other care homes across the country.\n\n\n\n'What is clear is that the independent sector needs to be subject to the same level of scrutiny that the NHS expects.\n\n\n\n'The fact is that we have an ageing population and the number of vulnerable older people is rising significantly and the whole care industry needs to find a way to support them while keeping resident safety at its core.\n\n'We still believe the horrific scale of neglect warrants a completely independent inquiry which would take into account this Review as well as pulling together all the organisations involved in safeguarding care to provide a true blueprint for change in reforming the whole care industry \u2013 this must be the lasting legacy of the Orchid View scandal.'\n\n\n\nSouthern Cross was closed after an announcement that all its homes would be transferred to other operators in September 2011.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Orchid,View,care,home,receive,damning,report,published,today",
