(WDRB) -- Presidential candidate Ted Cruz was back in southern Indiana on Friday for the second time this week.\n\nCruz held a rally at Kye's in Jeffersonville, speaking mainly on winning Indiana because of good Hoosier common sense and values. Before that, he made similar campaign stops in Indianapolis and Anderson, Ind.\n\nHe even received an endorsement from Gov. Mike Pence earlier in the day.\n\n\"Gov. Pence is a strong, conservative, principled leader,\" Cruz told the crowd at Kye's. \"He's someone who's earned the respect of Hoosiers.\"\n\nIndiana has become a critical state along with its 57 winner-take-all delegates in the GOP race to the White House. Cruz's campaign stops in Indiana come with a plan to shut out front-runner Donald Trump and ensure a contested republican convention.\n\n\"If we come to November, and the two candidates on the ballot are both rich, elite New York liberals, big government liberals Donald trump and Hillary Clinton, we will have failed the people profoundly,\" Cruz said.\n\nAnd what can be seen as an to effort save his campaign after Trump had a sweeping victory in eastern states, Cruz announced Carly Fiorina as his running mate earlier this week in Indianapolis.\n\n\"I'm proud to stand with Carly Fiorina and Gov. Pence,\" he said. \"At the same time who was Donald Trump standing with? Mike Tyson.\"\n\nWhile many believe Indiana is a must-win for Cruz to continue campaigning on jobs, the economy and repealing Obamacare, he says this is what he'll do if he does not have a victory in Indiana.\n\n\"We are campaigning through the end as long as we have a viable path to victory,\" Cruz said. \"We are campaigning to the end.\"\n\nAfter his stop in Kentuckiana, Cruz headed to Evansville, Ind., for another rally.\n\nVoters head to the poll on Tuesday for the Indiana primary.\n\nCopyright 2016 WDRB Media.
