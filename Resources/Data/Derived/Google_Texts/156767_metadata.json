It was unjustified, even if school authorities had every reason to expel the student from the classroom. It was unjustified, precisely because there is no conceivable circumstance in which it\u2019s okay for a cop to brutalize an unarmed, unthreatening teen girl.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t enough to criticize this one police officer for committing a terrible crime against a teen. We must also criticize the culture of misplaced fear about safety in schools\u2014a culture that requires cops to patrol high school classrooms as if they were prisons.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office has asked the FBI to investigate the incident, and Fields is on leave while the authorities examine whether he broke any policies. He is entitled to a fair and judicious review of his actions, of course. But if he is somehow cleared of wrongdoing, it would not mean that his actions were correct. It would only mean that official policy is far too deferential to the men with guns in schools.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Fields\u2019 first run-in with controversy. According to The New York Times, a student who was expelled for \u201cgang activity\u201d sued the officer in November of 2013 for \u201crecklessly and unfairly\u201d accusing black students of being in gangs. This student was expelled after getting into a fight behind a store near the school. The case has not yet gone to trial.\n\nSome students\u2014black students\u2014said Fields was tough but fair, and were surprised at what they saw in the video. Other students offered a less positive appraisal of the man\u2019s approach toward delinquency:\n\nNygel King, 16, another sophomore, said that Officer Fields \u201cacted like a typical cop\u201d in the hallways \u2014 \u201cBut never in a bad way,\u201d he said. The video, he said, stunned him. \u201cFor one, she wasn\u2019t resisting at all,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd two, I\u2019ve never seen him be super-aggressive with another student.\u201d But some of the students said that they had heard that Officer Fields had a reputation for treating students harshly when he was called to intervene in a skirmish or make an arrest. Several of them told stories, but about incidents they had only heard about, not personally seen. What it said about Officer Fields\u2019 record was not altogether clear: It is, perhaps, an immutable law of nature that an officer in a school will be treated, in some quarters, with a certain amount of suspicion.\n\nThe article refers to cops in schools as if they reflect some perfectly natural state of affairs\u2014as if cops are just as indispensable as teachers, janitors, and principals. In fact, cops did not become a ubiquitous presence in public education until recently. While the term \u201cschool resource officer\u201d first came into being in the 1950s, it wasn\u2019t until the \u201880s that schools began hiring cops en masse. Between the late \u201890s and 2007, the number of SROs nationwide increased to 19,000 (a 55 percent rise).\n\nDo police officers decrease crime in schools? In some cases, sure. But schools are already very safe places. And in a very real sense, the involvement of SROs increases crime, since the mere presence of a cop often escalates a minor infraction of school rules into a criminal matter. It does this by definition, since the police are invariably involved, even in situations that should be resolved by competent administrators, counsellors, or parents.\n\nTake the girl who wouldn\u2019t leave her desk at Spring Valley High School. Is she making trouble? Sure. Is she a criminal? No. But now she\u2019s been arrested anyway\u2014the involvement of Officer Fields rendered this a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe girl should count herself lucky, I suppose, that she wasn\u2019t killed in the process. But we should expect better for the millions of young people compelled to attend public education in this country. We should not teach them, from a very early age, that small acts of defiance will be met with vastly disproportionate state-sanctioned force. We should not funnel these kids\u2014many of them racially and socioeconomically disadvantaged\u2014into the criminal justice system for making the kinds of mistakes that perfectly regular, well-adjusted kids have been making for centuries. And we should not pretend that public safety requires these trade-offs.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Cops in schools is a recipe for disaster", "title": "The Spring Valley High School Assault Is Exhibit A for Why We Need Fewer Cops in Schools", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/10/27/the-spring-valley-high-school-assault-is", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14459823147252.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cops in schools is a recipe for disaster", "title": "The Spring Valley High School Assault Is Exhibit A for Why We Need Fewer Cops in Schools", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14459823147252.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-10-27T21:55:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "But now she\u2019s been arrested anyway\u2014the involvement of Officer Fields rendered this a foregone conclusion.\nWhile the term \u201cschool resource officer\u201d first came into being in the 1950s, it wasn\u2019t until the \u201880s that schools began hiring cops en masse.\nWe must also criticize the culture of misplaced fear about safety in schools\u2014a culture that requires cops to patrol high school classrooms as if they were prisons.\nThe article refers to cops in schools as if they reflect some perfectly natural state of affairs\u2014as if cops are just as indispensable as teachers, janitors, and principals.\nIt was unjustified, even if school authorities had every reason to expel the student from the classroom."}
