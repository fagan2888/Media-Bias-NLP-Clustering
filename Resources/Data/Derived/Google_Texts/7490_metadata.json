Facebook\n\nFestival season isn\u2019t all fun and games. A few people became very ill at the Kendal Calling music festival in the United Kingdom, including Jordan Blackburn, who posted a picture of himself in a medically induced coma on his Facebook as a warning for those who take unknown substances at festivals.\n\nHis friend, Christian Pay, was pronounced dead upon being admitted to the hospital. Blackburn and the group of friends he was with are believed to have taken three different types of tablets. When he awoke from his coma, he posted the picture online, he says, so that people could see the effects taking unknown substances can have on you and your family.\n\n\u201cYou never realize until it\u2019s too late. You never think at that moment it is ever going to happen to you, but unfortunately you learn the hard way,\u201d Blackburn told the BBC.\n\nIn total, 14 people had to be treated at the hospital after falling ill at the event. In addition, the police department reported that four people were arrested for possession of drugs and also the suspicion of the intent to sell. Blackburn desires to stop others from making the same mistake that he and Christian made. It even brought on \u201csurvivor\u2019s guilt,\u201d because of his friend dying instead of himself.\n\n\u201cHe just wants to raise awareness,\u201d Alison Turnbull, his mother, told the BBC. \u201cHe was laying in his hospital bed and he just looked and he said, \u2018I\u2019ve been given a second chance at life, haven\u2019t I?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yes, you have.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "man, posts, facebook, photo, himself, medically, induced, coma, warn, about, risks, taking, drugs", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "One young man posts a picture on his Facebook to warn others who take unknown substances at music festivals what their fate could be.", "title": "Man Posts Photo Of Himself In Coma To Warn About Drug Use At Music Festivals [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/man-posts-facebook-photo-himself-medically-induced-coma-warn-about-risks-taking-drugs-347256", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/11/facebookpic.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One young man posts a picture on his Facebook to warn others who take unknown substances at music festivals what their fate could be.", "title": "Man Posts Photo Of Himself In Coma To Warn About Drug Use At Music Festivals [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/man-posts-facebook-photo-himself-medically-induced-coma-warn-about-risks-taking-drugs-347256", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/08/11/facebookpic.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/11/facebookpic.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-11T17:19:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-11T17:19:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "One young man posts a picture on his Facebook to warn others who take unknown substances at music festivals what their fate could be."}, "article_summary": "One young man posts a picture on his Facebook to warn others who take unknown substances at music festivals what their fate could be.\nYou never think at that moment it is ever going to happen to you, but unfortunately you learn the hard way,\u201d Blackburn told the BBC.\nWhen he awoke from his coma, he posted the picture online, he says, so that people could see the effects taking unknown substances can have on you and your family.\nBlackburn and the group of friends he was with are believed to have taken three different types of tablets.\nA few people became very ill at the Kendal Calling music festival in the United Kingdom, including Jordan Blackburn, who posted a picture of himself in a medically induced coma on his Facebook as a warning for those who take unknown substances at festivals."}
