One hundred seventy-four pages. And growing.\n\nBut, at its heart, this wordy list amounts to a statement of Clinton\u2019s confidence in two things.\n\nThe status quo.\n\nAnd the federal bureaucracy.\n\nThe other two candidates left in this presidential race want to overhaul American government. Clinton mainly wants to tinker with its parts. In many cases, her plans involve adding small \u2014 but intricate \u2014 new tasks for the bureaucracy, designed to make government smarter, more generous and more just.\n\nIn a May 8 interview with CBS News\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton explains what she means when she says Republican rival Donald Trump is a \"loose cannon.\" (Reuters)\n\n[The year of the hated: Clinton and Trump, two intensely disliked candidates, begin their face-off]\n\nTo crack down on Wall Street, for instance, Clinton would expand a particular regulatory form. The form already is 42 pages long and can require up to 300 hours to fill out.\n\nIf Congress doesn\u2019t overhaul immigration, Clinton\u2019s plan is to allow undocumented residents to walk into local federal offices and ask for help. Already-busy bureaucrats \u2014 armed with guidelines that nobody has written yet \u2014 would make millions of new decisions about who can stay.\n\nThis approach says a lot about Clinton\u2019s worldview, after 23 years in and around Washington.\n\nTo her, complexity is realism.\n\nClinton says she simply can\u2019t make the simple, grand promises of her rivals \u2014 free college tuition, a big, beautiful, free wall. Instead, she skips ahead to what policy looks like the way it\u2019s actually been done: complicated, ugly and in small steps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all incremental. It\u2019s a lot of small ball,\u201d said Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cBut it\u2019s incrementally increasing the size and cost of government. It\u2019s all in one direction.\u201d\n\nIf Clinton wins the Democratic nomination, this may turn out to be the perfect election to be a wonk \u2014 because of who she\u2019d be running against.\n\nIf Clinton treats policymaking like watchmaking \u2014 a lot of whirring, tiny, hidden gears \u2014 the Republican Party\u2019s presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, is a man making parade floats. His ideas are attention-grabbing. Expensive. And often discarded.\n\nLast week, Trump came out against his own plan to give huge tax cuts to the rich. He discarded his past opposition to raising the minimum wage. And he offhandedly suggested that the United States might pay back only a percentage of its debts, an idea that would rock the world economy and America\u2019s place in it.\n\n[Trump, who once opposed minimum-wage hike, says he would \u2018like to see an increase\u2019]\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like either of them. But at least one of them is in the real world. And one has no bearing on reality,\u201d Tanner said. \u201cI simply believe Donald Trump is unqualified to be president. Hillary\u2019s qualified. [And] I mean, I disagree with her on almost everything.\u201d\n\nTo draw a full portrait of Clinton\u2019s ideas, The Post reviewed her campaign platform and her speeches, TV interviews and performances in the Democratic debates. In that platform, there are sweeping goals inherited from President Obama: immigration reform. Gun control. And there are a few abrupt shifts to the left, made during the race against Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nPreviously, for instance, Clinton argued that the United States should continue deporting children who cross the U.S. border illegally, in order to \u201csend a message\u201d that would discourage future migrations. But in March, after pressure by Sanders, Clinton gave. \u201cI will not deport children,\u201d she said in a debate.\n\nClinton has never adopted Sanders\u2019s basic vision of liberalism \u2014 that the simplest way to help the needy is to help everyone at once.\n\n\u201cI also believe in affordable college, but I don\u2019t believe in free college,\u201d Clinton said at a debate in February, attacking Sanders\u2019s simple, huge plan to make tuition free at public colleges. \u201cWhat I want to do is make sure middle-class kids \u2014 not Donald Trump\u2019s kids \u2014 get to be able to afford college.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s solution for college is cheaper: $350 billion over 10 years, versus $750 billion for Sanders.\n\nBut it\u2019s not simple.\n\nClinton\u2019s plan is to determine what families can afford to pay, without borrowing, and provide the rest of the money as a grant. But that requires fine-grained bureaucratic determinations to find the right number for every family.\n\nShe also wants to help students by extending a tax credit that has a history going back to the tenure of her famously wonky husband. It can be worth up to $2,500. But only if students find their Form 1098-T, then fill out the relevant portions of Form 8863, then enter the amount from lines 8 and 19 of Form 8863 in lines 68 and 50 of their Form 1040. Just like that.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some inevitable trade-off here between cost and simplicity,\u201d said Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \u201cPut me down for, \u2018Let\u2019s spend our scarce resources more carefully, even if it means more complexity.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut that complexity sometimes backfires.\n\nIn this case, watchdogs say more than a quarter of those who deserve education credits don\u2019t bother applying. And the IRS paid more than $5.6 billion to people who applied for educational credits but \u2014 upon later review \u2014 may not have deserved them.\n\nThe pattern repeats.\n\nIn health care, Sanders wants to rip up the system, start over and make the government everyone\u2019s insurer. Clinton wants to help in part by adding a tax credit to give families up to $5,000 to cover out-of-pocket payments.\n\nIn Appalachia, Sanders promises to undo the trade deals that he blames for killing factory jobs. Clinton\u2019s plans include extending a tax credit.\n\nThe credit, which already exists, would be tapered to spur new investment in areas that declined with coal. But it comes with just a little red tape.\n\nThe rules, for example, require a certified Community Development Entity to make a Qualified Low Income Community Investment in a Qualified Active Low Income Community Business. To get the money, a business must perform at least 50 percent of its business and have at least 40 percent of its tangible property within a designed Low Income Community. Also, by rule, the business can\u2019t be a racetrack, massage parlor, tanning salon or what the government calls a \u201chot tub facility.\u201d\n\nBefore the credit expired the last time, a Senate study found it was so loopholed that \u2014 in one instance \u2014 it had been used to pay for a dolphin exhibit at the Atlanta aquarium.\n\n\u201cI do not believe, in totality, that\u2019s enough,\u201d said West Virginia State Rep. Clif Moore, a Democrat who represents the heart of coal country. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s offering anything that\u2019s in and of itself brand new. She doesn\u2019t have the lightning rod.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s approach is an extension of the one that both her husband and President Obama used to make change in the face of a balky Congress and hostile states. Instead of handing out money, they handed out tax benefits. Democrats could celebrate the benefit, Republicans the cut.\n\nInstead of simple, universal benefit programs, they engineered complex solutions \u2014 like the Affordable Care Act \u2014 that were supposed to be customized to fit consumers\u2019 needs.\n\nThe result, now, is a government that groans under the weight of its complexity.\n\nThe tax code has changed more than 4,000 times since 2004. The overwhelmed IRS expects to answer just 47 percent of the calls made to its help-line staff this year, and it has 923,000 unanswered letters. The broader growth of federal regulation has also caused a boom in the number of professional \u201ccompliance officers,\u201d whose entire job is to follow rules: There are 136,000 in the private sector, at last count.\n\nClinton\u2019s solutions would add complexity to complexity.\n\nThat, in a way, requires its own kind of faith: that bureaucrats can make the kind of fine-grained decisions necessary to keep such a detailed enterprise running. Her campaign\u2019s argument is that, in today\u2019s Washington, that\u2019s the only way to do it.\n\nSaid Jake Sullivan, a Clinton policy adviser: Clinton \u201cwon\u2019t make promises that she can\u2019t keep or hide the details from the people whose vote she\u2019s trying to earn.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The other two candidates want to overhaul government.
