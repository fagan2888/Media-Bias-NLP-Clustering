The profile of the suspect was tall, black, and bald. And so is Belk. They were both wearing green shirts. That\u2019s all the information they had. And that\u2019s all the information they deemed necessary to hold Belk for six hours late Friday night, according to the accounts of Belk and his lawyer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that you hear about, but never think it would happen to you,\u201d Belk said in a Facebook post, highlighted by Crooks and Liars. Belk continues in the post:\n\nWithin seconds, I was detained and told to sit on the curb of the very busy street, during rush hour traffic. Within minutes, I was surrounded by 6 police cars, handcuffed very tightly, fully searched for weapons, and placed back on the curb. Within an hour, I was transported to the Beverly Hills Police Headquarters, photographed, finger printed and put under a $100,000 bail and accused of armed bank robbery and accessory to robbery of a Citibank. Within an evening, I was wrongly arrested, locked up, denied a phone call, denied explanation of charges against me, denied ever being read my rights, denied being able to speak to my lawyer for a lengthy time, and denied being told that my car had been impounded\u2026..All because I was mis-indentified as the wrong \u201ctall, bald head, black male,\u201d \u2026 \u201cfitting the description.\u201d\n\nBelk is a well-connected film and television producer who was en route to an Emmy pre-party later that night. He notes that he \u201cgets\u201d the cops who cuffed him that night didn\u2019t know he was an \u201caward nominated and awarding winning business professional,\u201d that he had been at \u201cone of the finest hotels in their city,\u201d just an hour earlier, and that he was a \u201cwell educated American citizen.\u201d \u201cWhat I don\u2019t get\u2026\u2026\u2026WHAT I DON\u201dT GET,\u201d he writes. \u201cis, why, during the 45 minutes that they had me on the curb, handcuffed in the sun, before they locked me up and took away my civil rights, that they could not simply review the ATM and bank\u2019s HD video footage to clearly see that the \u201ctall, bald headed, black male\u201d\u2026 did not fit MY description.\u201d\n\nOnce Belk was eventually permitted to make a phone call, he used his connections to find criminal defense lawyer Jaaye Person-Lynn, who left a wedding to come retrieve him late Friday night. When Person-Lynn got there, Belk was being held on $100,000 bail. Person-Lynn said he was there for an hour before he was able to see Belk. For 40 minutes, officers disputed that Belk had actually requested a lawyer and rejected requests to see him.\n\nPerson-Lynn said he had assumed before he arrived that for police to hold Belk that long, they must have had some sort of additional evidence that he committed the crime than his matching description. \u201cI gave the cops the benefit of the doubt at that moment,\u201d he said. \u201cBut unfortunately it didn\u2019t end up that way.\u201d It\u2019s common knowledge among law enforcement that all banks have surveillance video cameras. And they never even consulted the recording until after Person-Lynn showed up to represent Belk. Once they watched the tape, it became immediately clear that the actual suspect didn\u2019t look much like Belk and they released him.\n\nIt was midnight when Belk was finally released. But Person-Lynn said many other individuals who found themselves in Belk\u2019s situation without his resources would likely have been detained at least until Monday, when a district attorney would have been able to ask him some questions and more defense lawyers were back at work.\n\nBelk also imagined that his arrest could have been worse: he almost ran to his car to check his parking meter, but slowed to a walk when he received a text.\n\n\u201c[I]f it wasn\u2019t for a text message that I was responding to, I would have actually been running up LaCienega Blvd when the first Beverly Hills Police Officer approached me. Running!\u201d he wrote.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, another prominent black man, recounted a story of being stopped by police in another tony neighborhood, Georgetown in Washington, D.C., when he was running to get to a movie in time and police flashed their vehicle lights as they yelled \u201cWhere are you going? Hold it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the Attorney General of the United States. But I am also a black man,\u201d Holder said last week in a visit to Ferguson, Missouri, where he recalled the stop again. Speaking of several other incidents in which he was pulled over the highway and had his car searched, he said, \u201cI remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me.\u201d\n\nIn Belk\u2019s case, Person-Lynn didn\u2019t fault the officers for stopping Belk initially, given that he fit the description of what they were looking for. It\u2019s the \u201coverreaction\u201d that followed \u2014 and it\u2019s overreaction that he says is epidemic against black men.\n\n\u201cThey need to do their due diligence in determining that I either am or am not the person they are looking for,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s worth a few minutes. Stand on the curb while they review the surveillance tape. I don\u2019t think it should have lasted ten minutes. But six hours is ridiculous to take a man\u2019s liberty away when it\u2019s something so clear that he was not involved.\u201d He added, \u201cWhoever really did it got a six-hour lead.\u201d\n\nA representative for the Beverly Hills Police Department did not issue a planned statement before press time.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The profile of a suspected bank robber was tall, black, bald, and wearing a green shirt.
