Scott Fitzgerald never met any of today\u2019s Republicans, but he summed them up perfectly in the bittersweet last line of \"The Great Gatsby:\" \"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.\"\n\nWhile the GOP certainly has a Donald Trump problem these days, it also has a much deeper problem: How to get onto the right side of facts, empathy and history itself.\n\n[READ: GOP Talks the Talk but Fails the Walk on ISIS]\n\nSo far the party has held on to Congress and maybe it will even win the White House next year. Yet it is on unsustainable political and policy paths. Republican candidates up and down the ticket espouse positions that are often outdated, impractical, cruel or contrary to evidence. They complain about deals they consider terrible and insist they could have done better. They denounce laws and policies meant to solve problems, and offer little in the way of alternatives.\n\nThere are exceptions, obviously, but not enough of them. Lest Democrats get too gleeful, however, they should remember that many broadly held GOP positions carry real consequences for the country and the world. The list is long:\n\nClimate change. As President Barack Obama and others have noted, the U.S. Republican Party may be the only major conservative party in the world that does not accept the need for action to stop the warming of the Earth. That\u2019s even as rising seas threaten coastlines and island nations, even as droughts and other extreme weather are already contributing to global instability.\n\nThe Paris climate agreement involving nearly 200 nations is a huge achievement that rests largely on Obama\u2019s ability to use rules, regulations and deals with the auto industry to help the United States meet its commitment to curb emissions. Republicans have tried to stymie him at every turn. They are still at it, vowing to undercut the climate deal in the GOP Congress or under a new GOP president. That\u2019s far easier said than done, and it\u2019s sad that they\u2019re even trying.\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal. Republicans were apoplectic about the agreement Obama signed with the aim of making sure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon. They say they would have negotiated a better deal \u2013 one that didn\u2019t give Iran any money impounded under economic sanctions, one that would have secured the return of several Americans held in Iran. They insist Iran will cheat. They don\u2019t, however, seem to have an alternative other than war.\n\n[SEE: Republican Party Cartoons]\n\nThe Islamic State group. The GOP field is brutal in its assessment of how Obama is battling the barbaric terrorist group. But as a number of analysts have noted, most of their prescriptions are similar to what Obama is already doing.\n\nThe economy. The GOP\u2019s hand-picked head of the Congressional Budget Office says the evidence shows that \u201ctax cuts do not pay for themselves.\u201d Regardless, tax plans from the party\u2019s presidential candidates rely on 1980s-style Reaganesque supply-side tax cuts that pamper the wealthy and balloon the federal debt. The conservative American Enterprise Institute concluded that Republicans don\u2019t care as much as they used to about deficits and ventured that they\u2019d probably do better next year \u201cif their plans weren\u2019t quite so favorable to the rich.\u201d\n\nCuba. Obama decided that it was time to engage with the communist island nation rather than continue trying to isolate and punish it. Many conservatives complained that he was wrongheaded, that he didn\u2019t negotiate the best deal, that he was betraying Cuban dissidents. Their alternative was to continue a 50-year-old policy that had not produced results.\n\nImmigration. While Obama is attacked for being soft on border control, he has deported some 2.4 million undocumented immigrants \u2013 already far more than George W. Bush\u2019s grand total of 1.6 million. Bush\u2019s compassionate approach to the dilemma of the undocumented, meanwhile, has ebbed. Trump wants to deport all 11 million currently in the country \u2013 an expensive proposition that would require a whole new police force \u2013 and make Mexico pay for a border wall. Most GOP contenders are trying to sound as tough as Trump, making it increasingly unlikely they\u2019ll improve their showings with Latinos and Asians.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act. Conservatives in some states are blocking expansion of Medicaid to cover people just above the poverty line, leaving several million without access to insurance. In Washington, there is still conservative resolve to repeal the whole law, although it has driven down the share of uninsured Americans and has not crashed the economy as the GOP predicted. But the few Republican alternatives by and large are even more flawed than the imperfect law.\n\n[PHOTOS: The Big Picture \u2013 December 2015]\n\nOther predictions and policies that turned out to be wrong or backward-looking include the Iraq War that turned into a nightmare of unintended consequences, the auto bailout that succeeded beyond all expectations, the tired \u201cwar on coal\u201d rhetoric that allowed Hillary Clinton to showcase a plan to help coal communities transition to different economic models. A plan for the future, not the past.\n\nObama\u2019s aspirational candidacy in 2008 often drew mockery, no more so than when he said he hoped that \u201cgenerations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless; this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal; this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last, best hope on Earth.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "politics", "title": "The Party of Yesterday", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The GOP will have to look forward to stay relevant.", "title": "The Party of Yesterday", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2015-12-24/the-party-of-yesterday", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/c4/7d/859bad104fe2966aa6ef17b3d94c/151224reportlawrence-editorial.lawrence.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The GOP will have to look forward to stay relevant.", "card": "summary", "title": "The Party of Yesterday"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 24, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jill Lawrence,Pulse,Republican Party,The Report [News],politics", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The GOP will have to look forward to stay relevant."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd385c\"", "article_summary": "As President Barack Obama and others have noted, the U.S. Republican Party may be the only major conservative party in the world that does not accept the need for action to stop the warming of the Earth.\n[SEE: Republican Party Cartoons]The Islamic State group.\n[READ: GOP Talks the Talk but Fails the Walk on ISIS]So far the party has held on to Congress and maybe it will even win the White House next year.\nThey are still at it, vowing to undercut the climate deal in the GOP Congress or under a new GOP president.\nRepublican candidates up and down the ticket espouse positions that are often outdated, impractical, cruel or contrary to evidence."}
