As a result, UMC is ending its outpatient oncology, outpatient pharmacy and Lied clinic services, impacting about 1,000 outpatients, officials said.\n\nThe layoffs represent about 8 percent of UMC\u2019s workforce and include 61 open positions that will remain unfilled.\n\nClark County Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak said the layoffs are unfortunate, but \u201cthe realization is that maybe it should have been done before. The sooner the better on this sort of thing...This was a bold step that was necessary and probably overdue.\u201d\n\nBarnard said patients most impacted by the cuts will be those who came to the hospital largely via social services. He said UMC tried to make cuts in areas or services provided by other hospitals.\n\nBarnard said some patients might be covered under the Affordable Care Act and others via Medicaid managed care plans.\n\n\u201cWe are working with Nevada Health Centers (a federally funded community health center) to accommodate those who don\u2019t make enough to have managed Medicaid but are not in a position to where ACA insurance is something they want to purchase,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for laid-off employees, UMC is reaching out to other hospitals, \u201cmaking sure they\u2019re aware of this, doing job-interview training, resume training, anything to (aid) the transition,\u201d Barnard said.\n\nAs the only public hospital in Southern Nevada, UMC provides millions of dollars of uncompensated care each year to patients without insurance, exacerbating its financial woes.\n\nThe hospital eliminated 105 positions and closed four of its satellite clinics in April in an attempt to reduce costs.\n\nThe hospital needed a $70 million subsidy from Clark County this year to balance its budget. It also took out an additional $45 million in emergency loans earlier this year to avoid a cash shortage that could have left the hospital unable to pay its bills.\u200b", "article_metadata": {"description": "Layoffs at University Medical Center are expected to save $21 million in the next nine months and help make the public hospital more sustainable, officials said today. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something we want to do, but there\u2019s an understanding of why we\u2019re doing it,\u201d CEO Lawrence Barnard said, reflecting on some of the reactions he\u2019s gotten from hospital staff. \u201cWe need to structure ourselves in a way that\u2019s sustainable.\u201d The layoffs eliminated ...", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "Layoffs at University Medical Center are expected to save $21 million in the next nine months and help make the public hospital more sustainable, officials said today. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something we want to do, but there\u2019s an understanding of why we\u2019re doing it,\u201d CEO Lawrence Barnard said, reflecting on some ...", "title": "Layoffs at University Medical Center called necessary, overdue", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2014/aug/21/layoffs-university-medical-center-called-necessary/", "image": "http://photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2010/01/25/umc_t378.jpg?42670983c634e7c20626cc4856c543752c0d8b2f", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "//photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2010/01/25/umc_r100x100.jpg?b3c07ccb2170322b6086abdb714037205a461b06", "account_id": 12055942, "card": "summary", "site": "@LasVegasSun"}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-21T11:09", "author": "//lasvegassun.com/staff/joe-schoenmann/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade"}, "article_summary": "Layoffs at University Medical Center called necessary, overdueLayoffs at University Medical Center are expected to save $21 million in the next nine months and help make the public hospital more sustainable, officials said today.\nThe layoffs represent about 8 percent of UMC\u2019s workforce and include 61 open positions that will remain unfilled.\n\u201cWe need to structure ourselves in a way that\u2019s sustainable.\u201dThe layoffs, announced on Wednesday, eliminated 285 positions for nurses, office assistants and other support staff.\nThe hospital eliminated 105 positions and closed four of its satellite clinics in April in an attempt to reduce costs.\nAs a result, UMC is ending its outpatient oncology, outpatient pharmacy and Lied clinic services, impacting about 1,000 outpatients, officials said."}
