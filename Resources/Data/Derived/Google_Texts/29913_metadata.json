However, about 7 percent of women said they were sexually active but didn\u2019t use contraception.\n\nThe birth control pill, which was introduced to the public in the early 1960s, remained the most common method to prevent pregnancy \u2014 some 16 percent of the 5,601 women surveyed by the NCHS said they were currently using the pill.\n\nOral contraceptives were most popular with teens and women in their 20s and early 30s. The 25-to-34 age group was most likely to opt for a long-acting reversible contraceptive.\n\nAbout 9 percent of women reported current use of the male condom as birth control, while 4 percent said they were using Depo-Provera shots or a contraceptive ring or patch.\n\nDespite ongoing lawsuits, a measure in the Affordable Care Act that requires private insurance companies to provide approved contraceptives for free is largely in effect.\n\nThere is also a push by some health care organizations to make birth control pills available without a prescription.\n\n\u201cBirth control is an essential component of women\u2019s health care\u201d and \u201cACOG supports making oral contraceptives\u201d available over-the-counter, Dr. John C. Jennings, president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in September.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve oral contraceptives for over-the-counter status, although it has given the green light to the Plan B One-Step emergency contraception product.\n\nHowever, when women are asked why they stopped taking birth control products, they rarely cite cost, access or insurance.\n\nThe main reason women discontinued taking the pill was because they \u201chad side effects,\u201d said two separate studies issued by NCHS in 2010 and 2013. Many women also feared the possible side effects of the pill or disliked how it changed their menstrual cycles, said the studies.\n\nAbout half the users of contraceptive \u201cpatches\u201d stop using it, often because of unwanted side effects or difficulty to use. Other women stopped Depo-Provera shots because of ill effects on their bodies.\n\nRelatively few women stop using male condoms, but when they do, their top two reasons were very personal: either their partners didn\u2019t like using condoms or condoms \u201cdecreased your sexual pleasure.\u201d\n\nThree percent or fewer of women said they stopped taking their birth control products because of cost, access or insurance, the 2010 and 2013 NCHS reports said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Contraception use in the United States is stable, with almost two-thirds of the nation's 62 million reproductive-age women using a product or procedure to avoid pregnancy, new federal data say.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Contraception use in the United States is stable, with almost two-thirds of the nation\u2019s 62 million reproductive-age women using a product or procedure to avoid pregnancy, new federal data say.", "title": "Contraceptive use remains level for U.S. women", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/11/contraceptive-use-remains-level-for-us-women/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/11/pill-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/11/pill-2.jpg", "description": "Contraception use in the United States is stable, with almost two-thirds of the nation's 62 million reproductive-age women using a product or procedure to avoid pregnancy, new federal data say.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Contraceptive use remains level for U.S. women"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, National Center For Health Statistics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0b3\"", "article_summary": "However, when women are asked why they stopped taking birth control products, they rarely cite cost, access or insurance.\nContraception use in the United States is stable, with almost two-thirds of the nation\u2019s 62 million reproductive-age women using a product or procedure to avoid pregnancy, new federal data say.\nThere is also a push by some health care organizations to make birth control pills available without a prescription.\nSome 38 percent of women of reproductive age said they were not using contraceptives.\nAbout 9 percent of women reported current use of the male condom as birth control, while 4 percent said they were using Depo-Provera shots or a contraceptive ring or patch."}
