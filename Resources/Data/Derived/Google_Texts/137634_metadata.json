First, 22-year-old Daniel from Orlando, Florida tells us about how he already had health insurance but went onto the website to see if he could find a cheaper plan.\n\n\u201cOnce I was on the site, it was pretty easy for me to compare plans\u201d Daniel says. \u201cI was able to pick a much higher-quality plan, and because of my income as a student, I only pay about 70 bucks a month for it.\u201d\n\nIn the second ad, we meet 54-year-old Deborah from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, another American who already had health insurance but was \u201cspending a fortune\u201d each month. \u201cThe site was very easy to use,\u201d Deborah says, \u201cand the customer service representatives were patient and helpful.\u201d\n\nThe ads are clearly meant to counter the prevailing narrative that the Obamacare website is full of \u201cglitches\u201d and impossible to use. They go several steps further than President Obama, who acknowledged the issues in his speech Monday morning, while still emphasizing the positive aspects of the Affordable Care Act. The president\u2019s speech appropriately addressed the growing concern over the website, but anyone who missed the coverage and only sees these ads will likely think everything\u2019s running perfectly.\n\nWatch President Obama\u2019s remarks below, via CNN:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[h/t NYMag]\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the same day that President Obama addressed the problems with the Affordable Care Act exchanges website at length from the White House Rose Garden, two new", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-21-at-12.28.14-PM.png", "title": "New Obamacare Ads Show How \u2018Easy\u2019 It Is to Use HealthCare.gov"}, "twitter": {"description": "On the same day that President Obama addressed the problems with the Affordable Care Act exchanges website at length from the White House Rose Garden, two new ads have been released on YouTube outlining just how \"easy\" HealthCare.gov is to navigate.", "title": "New Obamacare Ads Show How 'Easy' It Is to Use HealthCare.gov", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-21-at-12.28.14-PM.png", "creator": "@themattwilstein", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2013-10-21T16:21:09+00:00", "keywords": "online,tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0881\"", "article_summary": "On the same day that President Obama addressed the problems with the Affordable Care Act exchanges website at length from the White House Rose Garden, two new ads have been released on YouTube outlining just how \u201ceasy\u201d HealthCare.gov is to navigate.\n\u201cOnce I was on the site, it was pretty easy for me to compare plans\u201d Daniel says.\n\u201cThe site was very easy to use,\u201d Deborah says, \u201cand the customer service representatives were patient and helpful.\u201dThe ads are clearly meant to counter the prevailing narrative that the Obamacare website is full of \u201cglitches\u201d and impossible to use.\nFirst, 22-year-old Daniel from Orlando, Florida tells us about how he already had health insurance but went onto the website to see if he could find a cheaper plan.\nThey go several steps further than President Obama, who acknowledged the issues in his speech Monday morning, while still emphasizing the positive aspects of the Affordable Care Act."}
