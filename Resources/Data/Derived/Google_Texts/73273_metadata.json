The dismissing of it by pundits is shameful. What is his revolutionary vision? Getting people engaged in democracy and voting. It\u2019s not the ballot or the bullet. It\u2019s just the ballot.\n\nGandhi famously outlined the stages of reactionary response to revolutionaries, explaining, \u201cFirst they ignore you, then they ridicule you, then they fight you, and then you win.\u201d Bernie Sanders has experienced something similar.\n\nThey tried ignoring him. Then when polls moved and that was no longer possible, they ridiculed him as unelectable, even resorted to red-baiting, declaring him out of touch with mainstream voters and insisting, \u201cAmerica isn\u2019t evolved enough to elect an avowed socialist.\u201d\n\nWhen it turned out Americans are willing to look beyond provocative labels and scrutinize policies, \u201cthey\u201d now call him unrealistic.\n\nThe Washington Post derided him for \u201cselling his own brand of fiction,\u201d while Paul Krugman deemed it \u201cpolitically unrealistic to imagine that we can get the kind of radical overhaul he\u2019s proposing.\u201d\n\nChaz Pazienza encapsulates this latest attack strategy: \u201cSanders wants to fundamentally change American hearts and minds. Clinton wants to formulate a plan of action that gets things done. Sanders sells idealism.\u201d\n\nThis is the story now. Hillary will get things done as the pragmatist, whereas Sanders is the out-of-touch idealist who has to invoke \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d to advance, Pazienza says, \u201cpie-in-the-sky thinking that simply doesn\u2019t occur in representative democracies like ours, where change always comes incrementally and our system is designed so it can\u2019t be remade in one fell swoop.\u201d\n\nI guess King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream Speech\u201d wouldn\u2019t play so well these days.\n\nHow quickly we forget about dreams and their importance, their necessity, for significant social change.\n\nBut now \u201cdream\u201d is a dirty word, a communist plot.\n\nIndeed, the vocabulary of \u201cincrementalism\u201d Pazienza employs calls up the politics of gradualism invoked when African Americans sought basic and long-overdue rights in this nation. \u201cJust wait. Be Patient. These things take time.\u201d Are we seriously going to invoke the language of consensus and gradualism when it comes to gross and unsustainable inequality that undermines democracy and people\u2019s basic dignity in this country?\n\nWas it right to ask African Americans or women to wait for basic political rights and social equality because a good number of the nation\u2019s citizens were racist and misogynist?\n\nWe are driving forward-thinking imagination out of our politics, going from \u201cYes, We Can!\u201d to \u201cMaybe later. We need to wait for reactionaries to change their minds.\u201d\n\nMore to the point, though, is the utter speciousness and bad faith involved in figuring Clinton as the realist who will get things done and Sanders as the idealist who has no idea how to play the game in Washington. Remember, Sanders served sixteen years in the House of Representatives and has been senator since in 2006. He has legislated, and governed. He was elected to be mayor of Burlington, Vermont four times. Clearly, he can get some things done. He also helped craft the Affordable Care Act legislation, let\u2019s not forget.\n\nAnd let\u2019s here address a grossly slanderous misrepresentation promulgated by the anti-Sanders campaign. This is the notion, forwarded by Clinton herself, that Sanders wants to tear down the Affordable Care Act and start from scratch rather than build upon it.\n\nSanders does want to move to a single-payer system, but his opponents make it sound as if suddenly people will be without health insurance, as when Clinton has said repeatedly that it\u2019s easier to move from 90% insured to 100% insured than to start again at zero. These statements are either disingenuous or just outright ignorant, making it sound as if Sanders will dismantle or repeal the ACA before beginning and completing the process of putting something better in its place. He has never said or implied anything of the sort. The beauty of his vision is that we have the ACA in place so that now we can work for better. Until we arrive at a more optimal alternative, we\u2019ll still have the ACA in place. Let\u2019s face it\u2014the U.S. spends more than twice as much per capita on healthcare as the average developed nation does and ranks worst among eleven wealthy nations in terms of \u201cefficiency, equity, and outcomes,\u201d Time magazine reported in 2014. Can\u2019t we do better? Of course, we can.\n\nAnd what about Clinton? I have heard little in terms of how she\u2019ll get things done. According to the Washington Post, Sanders\u2019 agenda doesn\u2019t have consensus and ignores the reality of the checks and balances of our system. But what will Clinton do? Obama stepped into office met by a Republican constituency whose chief goal was obstruction. Clinton may be even more reviled by the Republicans and will face the same gridlock. Yet those who attack Sanders, arguing he will be ineffective in implementing his policies, have yet to offer any clear sense of what Clinton\u2019s pragmatic strategy will be.\n\nFinally foregoing bi-partisanship, Obama proceeded with what has been an historic presidency, using the power inherent in presidency, issuing executive orders when he could to realize his vision, most notably on issues such as immigration, gay marriage, wages, and gun control. He had a large vision, and he implemented it as he could\u2014often not through political negotiation but through executive action. He did not have consensus; he dealt with checks and balances, just Lyndon Johnson did when pushing through civil rights legislation ahead of the national consensus.\n\nChange may come incrementally, but don\u2019t we want someone with the larger vision, the guiding dream, even if we only take baby steps toward that pie in the sky? How can we realize the ideal if we don\u2019t articulate what it is and fight for it? Sanders has given no indication that it\u2019s all or nothing for him\u2013that it\u2019s a socialist society tomorrow or he\u2019s out of ideas. His years as senator suggest his ability to hold onto his ideals while he works the daily grind of the political process.\n\nMoreover, Sanders has presented plans to pay for his programs, but it is easier for critics to ignore what they don\u2019t want to hear.\n\nMaybe he can\u2019t get all this done, get the tax reform he wants through congress, but wouldn\u2019t you rather have someone who tried, who had a larger vision of where we needed to go and took what steps he could to get us there, rather than someone with a modest and compromised vision from the start?\n\nHis plan of political revolution is absolutely pragmatic. The dismissing of it by pundits is shameful. What is his revolutionary vision? Getting people engaged in democracy and voting. It\u2019s not the ballot or the bullet. It\u2019s just the ballot. If people vote, pressure will be put on representatives. That, Mr. Pazienza, is how representative democracy works.\n\nIs thinking the American voter can have a role in democracy really pie-in-the-sky? Shame on anyone who dismisses this possibility.\n\nIs this so much of a dream?\n\nGeez, let\u2019s at least dream the small dream of an engaged and empowered electorate to create a modicum of the democracy we are supposed to have.\n\nOr are we too pragmatic for that?", "article_metadata": {"description": "It has been claimed Sanders is unelectable and unrealistic, but his years as senator suggest his ability to hold onto his ideals while he works the daily grind of the political process", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Tim Libretti", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "It has been claimed Sanders is unelectable and unrealistic, but his years as senator suggest his ability to hold onto his ideals while he works the daily grind of the political process", "title": "Far From Unrealistic, Sanders Has the Experience to Work Toward his Vision", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/02/06/far-from-unrealistic-sanders-has-the-experience-to-work-toward-his-vision.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/bernie-sanders-future-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-06T18:59:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "2016 Elections,Featured News,Bernie Sanders,Democratic Party,Hillary Clinton,Obamacare,single payer,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2016-02-06T18:59:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-06T18:59:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "2016 Elections, Bernie Sanders, Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton, Obamacare, single payer"}, "article_summary": "Clinton wants to formulate a plan of action that gets things done.\nThis is the notion, forwarded by Clinton herself, that Sanders wants to tear down the Affordable Care Act and start from scratch rather than build upon it.\nSanders\u2019 plan of political revolution is absolutely pragmatic.\nAccording to the Washington Post, Sanders\u2019 agenda doesn\u2019t have consensus and ignores the reality of the checks and balances of our system.\nRemember, Sanders served sixteen years in the House of Representatives and has been senator since in 2006."}
