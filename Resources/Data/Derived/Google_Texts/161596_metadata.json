Meanwhile, China is increasing tensions with Japan over disputed, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.\n\nRelated: China\u2019s Bold Power Play Pushes Asia to the Brink\n\nThe contrasts don\u2019t stop there. The spending plans signal President Xi Jinping\u2019s priorities since this is his first military budget. China\u2019s double-digit spending boost would be the biggest in three years and follows a 10.7 percent rise in 2013, suggesting Xi plans on expanding China\u2019s reach in the Asia-Pacific region. Obama, on the other hand, is focusing on domestic issues as he approaches the midpoint of his second term.\n\nSource: The Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation\n\nIn keeping with its title as the world\u2019s second-largest economy, China\u2019s military budget is second only to that of the U.S. Still, this year\u2019s increase would bring the country\u2019s military spending to $132 billion, whereas the U.S. defense budget for this year is $526.8 billion. The Pentagon\u2019s full budget proposal for fiscal 2015 won\u2019t be known until next month when the Defense Department releases its war funding request.\n\nChina says the increased funding is needed to modernize the country\u2019s military, meaning more investments in missile development, submarines and its aircraft carrier. While defense experts are in agreement that the Chinese military would be no match against the U.S. in a direct conflict, some note that the spending increase could give pause to countries aligned with the U.S.\n\n\u201cChina is increasing defense spending precisely because it wants to be a strategic counterweight to the U.S. and its allies in the region,\u201d said William Martel, associate professor of international security studies at Tufts University. He said this move is intended to put pressure on countries like Japan and South Korea to make them question U.S. commitment to the area.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "China announced it will increase its military budget by 12 percent this year, far outpacing that of the U.S. at a time when American allies in the region face increased tensions with China.", "title": "China\u2019s Military Budget Rises as Pentagon\u2019s Retreats", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/05/China-s-Military-Budget-Rises-Pentagon-s-Retreats", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03262012_USA_vs_China_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/05/China-s-Military-Budget-Rises-Pentagon-s-Retreats", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03262012_USA_vs_China_article.jpg", "creator": "@timothyrhoman", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "China announced it will increase its military budget by 12 percent this year, far outpacing that of the U.S. at a time when American allies in the region face increased tensions with China.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Source: The Center for Arms Control and Non-ProliferationIn keeping with its title as the world\u2019s second-largest economy, China\u2019s military budget is second only to that of the U.S.\nA day after President Obama submitted a budget to Congress that reflects cutbacks in defense spending, China announced plans to increase military funding by 12.2 percent.\nThe spending plans signal President Xi Jinping\u2019s priorities since this is his first military budget.\nStill, this year\u2019s increase would bring the country\u2019s military spending to $132 billion, whereas the U.S. defense budget for this year is $526.8 billion.\nChina\u2019s double-digit spending boost would be the biggest in three years and follows a 10.7 percent rise in 2013, suggesting Xi plans on expanding China\u2019s reach in the Asia-Pacific region."}
