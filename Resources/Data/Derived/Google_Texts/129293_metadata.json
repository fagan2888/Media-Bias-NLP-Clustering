The short answer: LOL, NOPE! Here\u2019s the long answer:\n\nThanks for signing a petition about Edward Snowden. This is an issue that many Americans feel strongly about. Because his actions have had serious consequences for our national security, we took this matter to Lisa Monaco, the President's Advisor on Homeland Security and Counterterrorism. Here's what she had to say:\n\n\"Since taking office, President Obama has worked with Congress to secure appropriate reforms that balance the protection of civil liberties with the ability of national security professionals to secure information vital to keep Americans safe.\n\nAs the President said in announcing recent intelligence reforms, \"We have to make some important decisions about how to protect ourselves and sustain our leadership in the world, while upholding the civil liberties and privacy protections that our ideals and our Constitution require.\"\n\nInstead of constructively addressing these issues, Mr. Snowden's dangerous decision to steal and disclose classified information had severe consequences for the security of our country and the people who work day in and day out to protect it.\n\nIf he felt his actions were consistent with civil disobedience, then he should do what those who have taken issue with their own government do: Challenge it, speak out, engage in a constructive act of protest, and -- importantly -- accept the consequences of his actions. He should come home to the United States, and be judged by a jury of his peers -- not hide behind the cover of an authoritarian regime. Right now, he's running away from the consequences of his actions.\n\nWe live in a dangerous world. We continue to face grave security threats like terrorism, cyber-attacks, and nuclear proliferation that our intelligence community must have all the lawful tools it needs to address. The balance between our security and the civil liberties that our ideals and our Constitution require deserves robust debate and those who are willing to engage in it here at home.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Response to \u2018We the people\u2019 petition calls for him to \u2018accept the consequences.\u2019", "title": "White House Unsurprisingly Will Not Pardon Edward Snowden", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/07/28/white-house-unsurprisingly-will-not-pard", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14381168402402.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Response to \u2018We the people\u2019 petition calls for him to \u2018accept the consequences.\u2019", "title": "White House Unsurprisingly Will Not Pardon Edward Snowden", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14381168402402.jpg", "creator": "@sshackford", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "NSA", "published_time": "2015-07-28T21:05:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/scott-shackford"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Here\u2019s the long answer:Thanks for signing a petition about Edward Snowden.\nThe balance between our security and the civil liberties that our ideals and our Constitution require deserves robust debate and those who are willing to engage in it here at home.\"\nBecause his actions have had serious consequences for our national security, we took this matter to Lisa Monaco, the President's Advisor on Homeland Security and Counterterrorism.\nRight now, he's running away from the consequences of his actions.\nWe continue to face grave security threats like terrorism, cyber-attacks, and nuclear proliferation that our intelligence community must have all the lawful tools it needs to address."}
