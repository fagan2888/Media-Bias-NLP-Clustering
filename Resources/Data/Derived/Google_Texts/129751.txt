Rapid City, SD

A real estate planner in South Dakota who for years told people how to manage their money has been charged with multiple counts of wire fraud and money laundering.



57-year-old Randall "Randy" McKee has pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of wire fraud and nine counts of money laundering. Federal authorities say McKee set up a real estate development scheme that bilked investors out of about $625,000 between 2008 and 2009.



Authorities also accuse McKee of using his position as a trustee for a disabled man to take more than $80,000 from the client's trust account for his own use.



The Sioux Falls man is out on bond. He previously lived in Rapid City. A trial was scheduled for Jan. 13.
