The Academy of Pediatrics is urging parents to get their children vaccinated against influenza as soon as possible this fall. The recommendation was published Sept. 2 in the journal Pediatrics.

This year, a new quadrivalent influenza vaccine, which provides broader protection, will be available, but the more readily available three-strain vaccine is adequate, and consumers should not wait for the newer product, physicians advise.

The CDC recommends yearly influenza vaccination for all individuals aged 6 months and older. Children up to the age of 8 who have not received 2 doses of influenza vaccine since July 2010 should receive one dose as soon as the vaccines are available and follow with a second dose four weeks later.

Children less than 5-years-old are at greater risk of medical complications from the influenza virus, as are those with asthma and other chronic pulmonary disorders. Annual flu shots are critical for this population. Anyone with a history of egg allergies should consult a physician before getting a flu shot.

Consumers may locate pharmacies and clinics offering the vaccine by accessing the HealthMap Vaccine Finder. Under the Affordable Care Act, annual influenza vaccination is one of the preventive health care services that must be covered by insurers with no co-payment or deductable.
