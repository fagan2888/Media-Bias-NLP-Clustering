Among providers that have committed to innovation as a goal, such as the Cleveland Clinic and the Mayo Clinic, the difference is notable, according to the article. Mayo, for example, had nearly 40 innovation projects in the works last year.\n\nBut overall, resource constraints within healthcare discourage the kind of risk involved in meaningful innovation. This means the path to healthcare innovation will involve increased collaboration and cost-sharing among hospitals and health systems, according to Dan Wolf, chairman of the board of Munson Healthcare in Traverse City, Michigan.\n\nMeanwhile, many New Jersey providers look to cross-sector partnerships with businesses and schools for more innovative approaches to population health management, according to NJSpotlight. The future of innovation, Garden State experts say, involves large-scale partnerships among community institutions. For example, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Program Officer Jasmine Hall Ratliff cited RWJF initiatives that promote a culture of health in New Jersey with goals to improve the diet and exercise of children.\n\nBut panelists at the U.S. News & World Report Hospital of Tomorrow conference argued that the hospital itself remains the best setting for such innovation, as long as hospitals take steps such as working with \"internal innovators.\" The emphasis in innovation should be on creating \"an innovation culture within our health system,\" said panelist Katherine Steinberg, director of the Institute for Innovation in Health at UCLA Health.\n\nIn the meantime, healthcare leaders can take numerous steps to foster innovation by looking to some unexpected sources, such as Chipotle or the Apple store, FierceHealthcare previously reported, as well as accepting--and planning for--the risk of failure, as demonstrated by the Hub, an innovation initiative launched by Sibley Memorial Hospital.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the H&HN article\n\n- read the NJSpotlight article\n\n- check out the U.S. & World Report News article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n4 ways to inspire healthcare innovation\n\nCollaboration, risk-taking drive healthcare innovation [Special Report]\n\n'Shark Tank'-style contests, community initiatives spark healthcare innovation\n\n4 lessons Disney can teach healthcare leaders\n\n3 ways to create a culture of innovation\n\nGive physicians some slack to drive healthcare innovation\n\n4 principles guiding healthcare's age of enlightenment\n\n3 steps to create hospital culture of innovation", "article_metadata": {"description": "To foster innovation within healthcare, the industry needs the mechanisms in place that promoted major advances in other industries.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "To foster innovation within healthcare, the industry needs the mechanisms in place that promoted major advances in other industries.", "title": "How the healthcare industry can foster innovation", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/how-healthcare-industry-can-foster-innovation/2015-10-20", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,collaboration,Community Partnerships,Healthcare Innovation,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management,Partnerships,research and development", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "The emphasis in innovation should be on creating \"an innovation culture within our health system,\" said panelist Katherine Steinberg, director of the Institute for Innovation in Health at UCLA Health.\nTo encourage innovation within healthcare, the industry needs the mechanisms in place that promoted major advances in other industries.\nThis means the path to healthcare innovation will involve increased collaboration and cost-sharing among hospitals and health systems, according to Dan Wolf, chairman of the board of Munson Healthcare in Traverse City, Michigan.\nTo learn more:- here's the H&HN article- read the NJSpotlight article- check out the U.S. & World Report News articleRelated Articles:4 ways to inspire healthcare innovationCollaboration, risk-taking drive healthcare innovation [Special Report]'Shark Tank'-style contests, community initiatives spark healthcare innovation4 lessons Disney can teach healthcare leaders3 ways to create a culture of innovationGive physicians some slack to drive healthcare innovation4 principles guiding healthcare's age of enlightenment3 steps to create hospital culture of innovation\nBut overall, resource constraints within healthcare discourage the kind of risk involved in meaningful innovation."}
