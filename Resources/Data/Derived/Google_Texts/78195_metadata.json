Ron Johnson added his voice Tuesday to the mounting number of Republican proposals to revamp health care in the wake of a Supreme Court decision this June that could gut Obamacare.\n\nMr. Johnson, of Wisconsin, said the GOP needs to be ready when the justices decide whether the administration is unlawfully paying subsidies to customers in at least 34 states that use the federal HealthCare.gov exchange.\n\nWithout the subsidies, the law will be much less attractive in those states, opening the door to Republican-led reforms.\n\nBut it would also expose the party to political attacks, as millions of Americans lose health coverage in the wake of a lawsuit that many in the GOP cheered.\n\nIn an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Johnson said Republicans need to be ready to parry those attacks by rescuing Americans affected by the ruling.\n\n\u201cWithout an effective response from Republicans, there is little doubt that the crisis would allow President Obama to permanently cement ObamaCare in place,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHis plan would allow Americans to keep health care plans they like, and Obamacare\u2019s subsidies would continue to flow until August 2017. While new people could enroll through the law, only existing customers would continue to receive subsidies under the senator\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cIn exchange for this concession, which temporarily fixes the mess created by the sloppily written and unlawfully enforced Obamacare, the American people should be allowed to reclaim some of the freedom Obamacare denies them,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.\n\nThat means eliminating the law\u2019s insurance mandates on individuals and employers, he said.\n\nThe proposal\u2019s timeframe syncs up with GOP attempts to retake the White House and, if they can preserve their congressional majorities, repeal and replace Obamacare.\n\nOther Republicans have offered proposals to replace Obamacare \u2014 or at least provide an off-ramp from the Supreme Court case, known as King v. Burwell \u2014 but the party has not coalesced behind a single plan.\n\nMr. Johnson said they better get moving, because Mr. Obama and the \u201cmainstream media\u201d will blame the fallout from \u201cKing\u201d on Republicans and urge Congress to pass a simple fix that extends the subsidies to all states.\n\n\u201cThe first goal of a Republican strategic response must be to prevent President Obama\u2019s cynical use of the coming crisis from working,\u201d Mr. Johnson wrote. \u201cIf Republicans wait, we will have no chance of countering Mr. Obama\u2019s response.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
