Dabelow called on the State officials and Schmit to work on ways to retool the rate formula to make it more equitable.\n\n\n\nState officials said the lower population in the SE Minnesota pricing region, lack of competing health care plans, and the presence of only one major health care provider, Mayo, that is a world class provider, are all factors in the higher rates.\n\n\n\nMayo's Witt said they are frustrated as anyone over the divergence of rates between the metro and the southeast in recent years, saying they have kept cost increases at 3% or less over the last few years.\n\n\n\nDabelow noted Governor Dayton said the entire State would benefit from the new Vikings stadium and thus pushed for financing plans in which the entire State carried the cost burden of the $1 billion structure, not just the Metro. Dabelow said similarly the entire State benefits from the great services that the Mayo makes available and that thus the entire State should help cover those costs.\n\n\n\nCannon Falls business owner Julie Disch (Hi-Quality Bakery) said she didn't want to speak, but was so upset about the higher prices she and her husband pay she couldn't keep silent. Disch said her premium of $500 a month would be about $200 lower in the Metro or about $100 lower in Northfield. Disch said she supports Mayo and all the great work they do, but said that she uses hospitals in the Cities and doesn't feel she should have to pay premiums based on Mayo Clinic rates.\n\n\n\nMultiple audience members asked for boundaries to be redrawn to include a higher population for risks to be spread out over a larger region. New Affordable Care Act laws are attempting to make rates \"Community-based,\" to encourage health care providers to improve the overall health of entire communities, and hopefully lower costs in the long run.\n\n\n\nThe MNDHS's Jesson said new laws have also made more competitive bidding for Government health coverage, which it thinks has created some savings.\n\n\n\nThe State officials trumpeted that group rates for 2016 are flat to slightly higher, but conceded group rates have been sharply higher in past years. Individual plan hikes for 2016 are certainly concerning the State officials said.\n\n\n\nState officials also trumpeted the high rankings of the Minnesota health care system on a national and even world-wide basis, and noted that under the new laws the number of insured residents is now near 97%. In the long run, it is hoped fewer uninsured people will mean lower rates for all.\n\n\n\nAudience members asked the panelists to look for ways to blend some of the markets, commercial and private, to maybe help lower rates. Audience members also asked for legislation more friendly for self-insured small groups of as little as ten members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"title": "SE MN seeks help on highest health care premiums in State - Cannon Falls Beacon"}, "verify-v1": "rz5P5oRLJOmL+zlrhhQ8xD1eseSZAQ3bn6ZpHmFrG/4=", "GENERATOR": "1up!
