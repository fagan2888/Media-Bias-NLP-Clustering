The economy grew nicely in 2014, unemployment fell, home prices rose and stocks racked up another fine year. Even bonds did well, surprisingly.\n\nBut can it continue?\n\nThough there are indeed some concerns, such as the strong dollar\u2019s effect on exports, Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel and Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, say the odds favor additional good news in 2015, though economic and market performance may not match last year\u2019s.\n\nRelated: With a Rising Dollar, Should You Still Bet on U.S. Blue Chips?\n\nGross domestic product could grow by about 3 percent this year \u2014 not as hot as the 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014, but still respectable, Siegel says. (Year-end results are not yet in.) Low interest rates and low oil prices will boost the economy, he notes. \u201cPeople will have more money to spend.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should be a good year, particularly for the economy and for jobs,\u201d Zandi adds. \u201cWe created three million jobs last year. We\u2019ll create about the same amount this year. We should be at full employment by early 2016.\u201d\n\nInterest rates may rise slightly but should remain low by historical standards, says Siegel, who predicts lower than average rates \u201cfor many years to come.\u201d He notes that the Federal Reserve may raise the Fed funds rate to a still-low 1.5 percent to 2 percent from the current target of 0 to 0.25 percent. Bond yields, which fell in 2014, largely because of high demand from investors seeking safe havens amidst international turmoil, will remain low, keeping mortgage rates down as well, Siegel adds.\n\n\u201cWe should be at full employment by early 2016.\u201d \u2013Mark Zandi\n\nThat will help the housing market continue to recover. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of housing in GDP,\u201d Siegel says, noting home construction\u2019s effect on sales of appliances, furnishings and other products. \u201cHousing is definitely important.\u201d Various studies have suggested home prices could rise by 4 percent to 6 percent this year. Those figures would beat the long-term average of around 3 percent, but be comfortably short of a bubble. Price gains have been slowing after the big rebound following the financial crisis, and many experts think today\u2019s closer-to-normal gains are healthier.\n\nFull Employment on the Horizon?\n\nThe number of home sales has been disappointing for years, Zandi says, but he, too, expects factors that have dragged on the market to \u201cbegin to fade.\u201d\n\nAmong those factors: unemployment and poor wage growth. Unemployment, which peaked at 10 percent in October of 2009, fell to 5.6 percent in December and should continue to decline, Zandi notes. \u201cIf we\u2019re close to full employment by this time next year, then wage growth will accelerate.\u201d Siegel adds that the falling unemployment rate has not yet brought back into the labor force many of the people who gave up looking for work in recent years. If those workers stay on the sidelines, he cautions, lower unemployment could cause wages to rise fast enough to trigger concerns about inflation. That said, neither Siegel nor Zandi expect inflation to become a problem in 2015.\n\nRelated: The Great Decoupling: Why U.S. Is Divorcing Global Markets\n\nBoth note that falling oil prices are likely to hurt oil producers, but they say the country overall will benefit from low energy prices. \u201cClearly, the collapse in oil price is good for the economy,\u201d Siegel notes. \u201cAll this could be very good on the cost side, and that could boost corporate profits for the next year.\u201d\n\nThe strong dollar will continue to keep down the cost of imported goods, but will cut into profits of U.S. companies doing business abroad, Siegel and Zandi say. \u201cThe biggest weight on growth will be trade,\u201d Zandi explains, \u201cin part because of the surge in the dollar and in part because of the weaker global economy.\u201d\n\nU.S. stocks had a good run in 2014, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 returning about 13.7 percent with dividends reinvested, following a stupendous 32.4 percent the year before. Surprisingly, the 10-year U.S. Treasury note returned about 11 percent as falling yields pushed up prices. Most experts had expected yields to rise in 2014, not fall.\n\nTaking Stock of Stocks\n\nWhat\u2019s in store for securities this year?\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re closer to fair market value on stocks than we\u2019ve been anytime in the last five years,\u201d Siegel says. Being closer to fair value, a measure of share prices relative to corporate profits, makes big gains harder to come by, he observes. But he adds that low interest rates improve the picture because investors are more willing to take on the risks of stocks when they don\u2019t earn much in bank savings or bonds.\n\nThe average S&P 500 stock is currently priced at about 19 times the company\u2019s earnings for the past 12 months. While that\u2019s a high price compared to the long-term average of around 15 times earnings, it is far below the 30-to-1 level of the last great stock bubble 15 years ago. Siegel says a price-to-earnings ratio, or PE, in the high teens can be considered fair value when interest rates are as low as they are today. \u201cGiven the interest rates, the stock market is still undervalued,\u201d he says, forecasting an S&P 500 return of 10 percent to 12 percent for 2015. Zandi is a bit more conservative, forecasting stock gains in the mid-single digits.\n\n\u201cBut it could be rocky,\u201d Zandi adds, observing that the strong dollar will likely undercut earnings.\n\nU.S. investors, Zandi says, might be wise to look at European stocks, as PEs are lower there than in the U.S., and because the strong dollar makes foreign stocks cheaper for investors using dollars.\n\nRelated: More Americans Say Thumbs Up on the Economy\n\nFor 2014, the 10-year Treasury note returned just over 11 percent as falling yields pushed prices up. But neither Siegel nor Zandi expect bonds to do as well this year, because yields have already fallen so low \u2014 a scant 1.8 percent for the 10-year Treasury. Zandi expects interest earnings to be wiped out by falling bond prices as yields inch up. \u201cThis year,\u201d Siegel adds, \u201cbonds are much riskier because interest rates are almost at an all-time low.\u201d\n\nFor long-term investors, Siegel says, stocks remain the most promising bet, likely to produce better returns than bonds or cash for investors who can wait out the downturns.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019re closer to fair market value on stocks than we\u2019ve been anytime in the last five years.\u201d \u2013 Jeremy Siegel\n\nWhat could darken this generally rosy picture? The unexpected is, of course, is unpredictable, but Zandi and Siegel both cite worries about terrorist acts or a shock like last year\u2019s Ebola outbreak.\n\nZandi adds that it is very difficult to know how the financial markets will react if the Fed does start to raise interest rates, even if only modestly. Uncertainty as rates rise often causes volatility to increase in the stock, bond and currency markets, he warns. Economic problems in Europe and Asia could send shudders through the U.S. economy and financial markets. And there are many crises that could blow up in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of geopolitical hotspots that could boil over and have implications for [the U.S.] economy,\u201d Zandi notes. \u201cThe black swans are more likely to come from overseas than from within our own borders.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Knowledge at Wharton.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Economic conditions in the U.S.", "title": "Two Economists Predict the Markets, Employment and Growth for 2015", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/Two-Economists-Predict-Markets-Employment-and-Growth-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08052011_Market_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/Two-Economists-Predict-Markets-Employment-and-Growth-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08052011_Market_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Economic conditions in the U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe059a\"", "article_summary": "Low interest rates and low oil prices will boost the economy, he notes.\n\u201cGiven the interest rates, the stock market is still undervalued,\u201d he says, forecasting an S&P 500 return of 10 percent to 12 percent for 2015.\nZandi adds that it is very difficult to know how the financial markets will react if the Fed does start to raise interest rates, even if only modestly.\nUncertainty as rates rise often causes volatility to increase in the stock, bond and currency markets, he warns.\n\u201cWe should be at full employment by early 2016.\u201d \u2013Mark ZandiThat will help the housing market continue to recover."}
