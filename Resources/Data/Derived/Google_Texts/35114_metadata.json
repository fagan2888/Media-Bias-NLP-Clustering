Polls show the Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan fa\u00advor\u00adite in Michigan run\u00adning evenly with Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Rep. Gary Peters, and rais\u00ading more money than him as well. Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are even watch\u00ading the Ore\u00adgon Sen\u00adate race closely, where a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan phys\u00adi\u00adcian run\u00adning against Obama\u00adcare raised a half-mil\u00adlion dol\u00adlars against Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Sen. Jeff Merkley.\n\nDemo\u00adcrats are feel\u00ading the pres\u00adsure and look\u00ading long\u00adingly at 2016, when the polit\u00adic\u00adal land\u00adscape should be nearly as fa\u00advor\u00adable to them as the 2014 en\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment is per\u00adil\u00adous to their ma\u00adjor\u00adity. This year, the party is de\u00adfend\u00ading sev\u00aden states that re\u00adjec\u00adted Obama in 2012; the GOP will be de\u00adfend\u00ading six seats in state that he car\u00adried that year in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe al\u00adways knew this cycle would have a num\u00adber of dif\u00adfi\u00adcult seats to de\u00adfend,\u201d said Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic strategist Jef Pol\u00adlock. \u201cEverything stacks up bet\u00adter for us in 2016.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s changed in the past month is that a hand\u00adful of states once thought to be safely Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic \u2014 such as Michigan, Ore\u00adgon, and Vir\u00adgin\u00adia \u2014 could be\u00adcome highly com\u00adpet\u00adit\u00adive in a best-case GOP scen\u00adario. If Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama\u2019s ap\u00adprov\u00adal rat\u00adings don\u2019t im\u00adprove and Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans catch a few breaks, the GOP could ride a wave to a ma\u00adjor\u00adity that could with\u00adstand a small 2016 set\u00adback.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve put can\u00addid\u00adates on the bal\u00adlot,\u201d ac\u00adknow\u00adledged J.B. Po\u00ader\u00adsch, who ad\u00advises Sen\u00adate Ma\u00adjor\u00adity PAC, a Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic su\u00adper PAC fo\u00adcused on the Sen\u00adate. But he ad\u00added, \u201cSix months from now, or even four months from now, how many of these are ac\u00adtu\u00adally go\u00ading to be races? It\u2019s great to be able to laun\u00addry list can\u00addid\u00adates and an\u00adoth\u00ader to see how vi\u00adable they\u2019re go\u00ading to be.\u201d\n\nAmong the signs that the field is ex\u00adpand\u00ading in the GOP\u2019s fa\u00advor.\n\n1. Ed Gillespie, a former Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Na\u00adtion\u00adal Com\u00admit\u00adtee chair\u00adman with an en\u00advi\u00adable fun\u00addrais\u00ading net\u00adwork, an\u00adnounced he would chal\u00adlenge Demo\u00adcrat Mark Warner, who is pop\u00adu\u00adlar and has $7 mil\u00adlion in the bank. But Vir\u00adgin\u00adia is shap\u00ading up to be a true swing state, and Gillespie doesn\u2019t have to worry about a com\u00adpet\u00adit\u00adive primary. On Monday, one pos\u00adsible rival dropped out and an\u00adoth\u00ader de\u00adclined to jump in.\n\n2. Michigan Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Terri Lynn Land proved she could keep up with Peters\u2019s fun\u00addrais\u00ading and put in $1.6 mil\u00adlion of her own money to boot. Polls show a tight race. Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Gov. Rick Snyder will also be on the bal\u00adlot. \u201cEvery\u00adone is bullish about Michigan right now,\u201d said Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan strategist Rick Wiley.\n\n3. Demo\u00adcrats are so wor\u00adried about the pos\u00adsib\u00adil\u00adity of former Sen. Scott Brown chal\u00adlen\u00adging New Hamp\u00adshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen that they ran a pree\u00admpt\u00adive at\u00adtack ad against him on tele\u00advi\u00adsion. The former Mas\u00adsachu\u00adsetts sen\u00adat\u00ador moved in\u00adto his va\u00adca\u00adtion home in the Gran\u00adite State last year.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a barn-burn\u00ader if he gets in,\u201d said Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic poll\u00adster John An\u00adza\u00adlone. \u201cBo\u00adston is the dom\u00adin\u00adant TV mar\u00adket in New Hamp\u00adshire, so he is uni\u00adver\u00adsally known. He has a na\u00adtion\u00adal fun\u00addrais\u00ading base at well.\u201d\n\n4. In North Car\u00ado\u00adlina, one of the bell\u00adweth\u00ader Sen\u00adate races, two auto\u00admated polls this month show Sen. Kay Hagan trail\u00ading one Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan op\u00adpon\u00adent, state House Speak\u00ader Thom Tillis. One of those sur\u00adveys is from North Car\u00ado\u00adlina-based Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic poll\u00adster, Pub\u00adlic Policy Polling. The state backed Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama in 2008 and Mitt Rom\u00adney in 2012. Hagan has been a pro\u00adlif\u00adic fun\u00addraiser, but she is a first-term sen\u00adat\u00ador who isn\u2019t par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly well-known throughout the state.\n\n5. Amer\u00adic\u00adans for Prosper\u00adity, the con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive jug\u00adger\u00adnaut bank\u00adrolled by the Koch fam\u00adily, broadened its tele\u00advised at\u00adtacks on Obama\u00adcare to two states car\u00adried by Obama \u2014 Michigan and Iowa. The group has spent $22 mil\u00adlion already this cycle. A tongue-in-cheek post by the Cen\u00adter for Pub\u00adlic In\u00adteg\u00adrity no\u00adticed that the sub\u00adject lines of the fun\u00addrais\u00ading e-mails from the Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Sen\u00adat\u00adori\u00adal Cam\u00adpaign Com\u00admit\u00adtee have got\u00adten in\u00adcreas\u00adingly hys\u00adter\u00adic\u00adal, from \u201cdeep trouble\u201d to \u201cdoomed\u201d to \u201ccata\u00adstroph\u00adic.\u201d\n\n6. Ore\u00adgon Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Mon\u00adica We\u00adhby an\u00adnounced she raised $500,000 last year. It\u2019s a solidly Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic state, but she\u2019s a pe\u00addi\u00adat\u00adric neurosur\u00adgeon who sup\u00adports abor\u00adtion rights and im\u00admig\u00adra\u00adtion re\u00adform. If she wins the GOP primary, she will face Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Sen. Jeff Merkley.\n\nDemo\u00adcrats have more reas\u00adons to worry. While nobody thought Arkan\u00adsas Sen. Mark Pry\u00ador\u2019s reelec\u00adtion would be easy in a state Pres\u00adid\u00adent Obama lost by 24 points, get\u00adting out\u00adraised by Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan rival Rep. Tom Cot\u00adton at the end of 2013 makes the in\u00adcum\u00adbent look like the un\u00adder\u00addog. Arkan\u00adsas was among 10 states that gave the pres\u00adid\u00adent his low\u00adest ap\u00adprov\u00adal rat\u00adings in 2013, pegged by Gal\u00adlup at 35 per\u00adcent.\n\nEven worse is the view from West Vir\u00adgin\u00adia, where only 25 per\u00adcent ap\u00adproved of the pres\u00adid\u00adent\u2019s job per\u00adform\u00adance last year. The likely Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan nom\u00adin\u00adee, Rep. Shel\u00adley Moore Capito, who got a year\u00adlong head start, has raised sev\u00aden times as much money.\n\nSen\u00adate Minor\u00adity Lead\u00ader Mitch Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell, who faces his own tough reelec\u00adtion in Ken\u00adtucky, couldn\u2019t help but gloat re\u00adcently on Fox News Sunday about ex\u00adpand\u00ading the map.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very con\u00adfid\u00adent in every single place where we have an op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity for a pickup, we\u2019re go\u00ading to have a very elect\u00adable can\u00addid\u00adate, not just in the primary but in the gen\u00ader\u00adal as well,\u201d he said. \u201cThe at\u00admo\u00adsphere for us is so good that we\u2019re also stretch\u00ading the play\u00ading field\u201d\u00a6. So, I think it could be a very good year.\u201d\n\nThat view could change if the pres\u00adid\u00adent has a more pro\u00adduct\u00adive 2014 or if Obama\u00adcare pro\u00adduces more suc\u00adcess stor\u00adies. But for now, Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are max\u00adim\u00adiz\u00ading their ad\u00advant\u00adages.\n\n{{ BIZOBJ (video: 4695) }}", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "Democratic Party operatives are longingly waiting for 2016, when the political map is much more favorable.", "title": "6 Signs a Republican Senate Takeover Is Within Reach", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/2014/01/29/6-signs-republican-senate-takeover-is-within-reach", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2014/01/29/465685945.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2014/01/29/465685945.jpg"}, "description": "Democratic Party operatives are longingly waiting for 2016, when the political map is much more favorable.", "site": "@nationaljournal", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "6 Signs a Republican Senate Takeover Is Within Reach"}, "description": "Democratic Party operatives are longingly waiting for 2016, when the political map is much more favorable.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf7a\"", "article_summary": "Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are even watch\u00ading the Ore\u00adgon Sen\u00adate race closely, where a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan phys\u00adi\u00adcian run\u00adning against Obama\u00adcare raised a half-mil\u00adlion dol\u00adlars against Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic Sen.
