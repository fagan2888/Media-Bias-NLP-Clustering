Is South Florida’s entrepreneurial community an ecosystem or a springboard?It’s an important question, says Carla Mays, an expert in civic innovation, which is focused on models for nurturing and supporting diverse and inclusive ecosystems. She visited Miami last week from Silicon Valley and participated in a community event on the topic.A springboard is a place that may be starting to grow an ecosystem, but entrepreneurs have to go to Silicon Valley or another ecosystem to get all the resources they need to grow, she explains. “If you aren’t careful to build an ecosystem where there are connections to capital and resources ... you are not creating something here, you are creating something that helps the Valley. That’s the brain drain.”
