The gist of each is that a company violates the law when its customer service department records calls with its customers without first providing notice that the calls may be recorded. In a recent published decision, the California Court of Appeal may have sounded the death knell for these class actions. The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of a class certification motion, holding that individualized issues predominated.\n\nIn the case \u2013 Hataishi v. First American Home Buyers Protection Corp., No. B244769, __ Cal. App. 4th __, 2014 WL 667381 (Cal. App. 2d Dist., Div. 3, Feb. 21, 2014) \u2013 the defendant recorded all calls with its sales department, inbound and outbound. For inbound calls, an electronic notice played notifying customers that their calls may be recorded. But for outbound calls, no electronic notice played and the defendant\u2019s sales representatives were not trained to notify customers that their calls may be recorded. Nor was there a company policy directing sales representatives to provide such a notice on outbound calls.\n\nThe plaintiff sued, alleging a single cause of action for violation of Penal Code section 632. Section 632 prohibits a party from recording or monitoring a \u201cconfidential communication\u201d without the consent of all parties to the conversation. The plaintiff claimed that two outbound calls placed by sales representatives to her were recorded without her consent.\n\nThe Court of Appeal reaffirmed that a plaintiff may pursue a claim under Section 632 only if she had \u201can objectively reasonable expectation that the conversation [was] not being overheard.\u201d This standard proved the undoing of the class claims. The Court held that each plaintiff\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations would turn on individualized inquiries, including the length of the class member\u2019s experience with the defendant, whether the class member had ever been notified that her calls with defendant may be recorded, and each class member\u2019s experience with other businesses that record or monitor calls.\n\nThe plaintiff\u2019s own experiences were a perfect example. She placed 12 inbound phone calls to the defendant\u2019s sales department, and each time she received an electronic notice that her call may be recorded. In not one of those 12 calls did the plaintiff \u201c[tell] the [defendant\u2019s] representative that she refused to be recorded and she never terminated the call to avoid being recorded.\u201d In addition, the plaintiff \u201calso confirmed that she had participated in \u2018dozens and dozens and dozens\u2019 of telephone calls with companies [other than the defendant] where she understood her call could be recorded or monitored for quality assurance.\u201d\n\nThese facts, the Court held, affected the plaintiff\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations. A different class member with different experiences may have different objectively reasonable expectations. \u201cA jury could rationally reach a different conclusion concerning another plaintiff who has not had the same experience. In any event, due process requires that [the defendant] be permitted to cross-examine [each class member] regarding those experiences that may impact the reasonableness of his or her alleged confidentiality expectation.\u201d Individualized issues thus predominated, precluding certification of a class.\n\nIn hopes of saving the class claims, the plaintiff suggested that she could add a claim under Penal Code section 632.7. Section 632.7 is different from Section 632 in two key respects: (1) Section 632.7 applies only to telephone conversations where at least one party is on a cellphone or a cordless phone; and (2) Section 632.7 prohibits the recording or monitoring of the call without consent even if the call is not a \u201cconfidential communication.\u201d The plaintiff thus sought to avoid the individualized inquiries surrounding the \u201cconfidential communication\u201d standard under Section 632.\n\nBut the Court held that a Section 632.7 claim could not revive the class action. \u201c[A]dding a section 632.7 claim would not have dispensed with the need to engage in an individualized factual inquiry.\u201d The trier of fact would have to \u201cdetermine what type of telephone was used to receive the subject call.\u201d Because the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cproposed methodology for identifying outbound calls provided no means to determine whether a landline, cellular or cordless telephone had been used to receive the subject call and that a call-by-call inquiry would be required to make this determination,\u201d individualized issues still predominated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the past four years, droves of call recording class actions have been filed in state and federal courts across California.
