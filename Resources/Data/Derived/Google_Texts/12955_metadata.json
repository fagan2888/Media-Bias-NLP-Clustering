The ceiling on state payments to accommodate children is far higher than that for adults, attracting private investment into a lucrative area with profits three times higher than the average for stock market-listed companies.\n\nAleris, a large company owned by the powerful Wallenberg family, declined to comment on press reports that it charges as much as SKr84,000 (\u00a36,600) a month to place a refugee child with a foster family.\n\nThe company Vardaga, which has come under fierce criticism for standards of elderly care, said accommodation for child refugees involved high personnel costs, long lead-times and a high degree of uncertainty. \u201cAll of this adds up to \u20ac200 (\u00a3150) a day for kids,\u201d said the firm\u2019s CEO, Fredrik Gren. \u201cAfter three years in the sector we are still not breaking even.\u201d\n\nJokarjo, the largest private provider of refugee accommodation for adults, has grown explosively. Its owner, Bert Karlsson, says he aims to create an \u201cIkea for asylum reception\u201d \u2013 the company trebled its turnover between 2013 and 2014. Challenged last week by reporter Carolina Neurath over charging the state SKr350 a refugee, Karlsson lost his temper and accused her of being \u201cfucking stupid\u201d to suggest a third of the money was profit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A postman passes the Sundbyberg refugee shelter.

Although the minority administration is struggling in the polls, its warm welcome to refugees has struck a chord among Swedes, with polls suggesting a sharp rise in opinion in favour of accepting greater numbers.\n\nRelated: Sweden's liberal reputation tarnished as race attacks rise\n\nAbout 44% of respondents in an Ipsos poll in September said Sweden should take more refugees \u2013 an increase of 18 percentage points since February \u2013 while 30% were opposed. Almost a third of Swedes said they were willing to house a refugee in their home.\n\nSome private sector providers of refugee accommodation are serious, but others are \u201ccowboys who are only there because they want to make heaps of money\u201d, according to Marie Salln\u00e4s, professor of social work at Stockholm University. \u201cWe are not desperate, we are a rich country. But the situation is exceptional, and we are trying anything to accommodate people.\u201d\n\nThe privatisation of the reception of asylum seekers is part of the heritage of former liberal-conservative governments that pursued privatisation of the public sector, according to Jonas Sj\u00f6stedt, leader of the Left party, which campaigns to limit profits in the public sector. \u201cCurrently it\u2019s a blackmail situation. All the arguments point in the direction that we need to plan this service, and we need it to be public,\u201d said Sj\u00f6stedt.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "description": "Prime minister asks companies whether it \u2018feels good when you look in the mirror\u2019 at a time when country is facing unprecedented refugee crisis", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "David Crouch", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Prime minister asks companies whether it \u2018feels good when you look in the mirror\u2019 at a time when country is facing unprecedented refugee crisis", "title": "Swedish private housing sector accused of profiting from refugees", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/18/swedish-private-housing-sector-refugees", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8b9874bd81087563b454ac08b8f58ac891c1b9/0_331_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=b60c5b369feb00ec31743370f7dd561c", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2015/oct/18/swedish-private-housing-sector-refugees?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/18/swedish-private-housing-sector-refugees", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2015/oct/18/swedish-private-housing-sector-refugees?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/0f8b9874bd81087563b454ac08b8f58ac891c1b9/0_331_4693_2818/master/4693.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2015/oct/18/swedish-private-housing-sector-refugees?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Sweden,Migration,Refugees,Europe,World news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-10-18T10:22:35.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-crouch", "section": "World news", "modified_time": "2015-10-19T11:06:32.000Z", "tag": "Sweden,Migration,Refugees,Europe,World news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8b9874bd81087563b454ac08b8f58ac891c1b9/0_331_4693_2818/4693.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=9ad26603f4f6006ff623efbf67a5e884", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "Sweden,Migration,Refugees,Europe,World news"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are living hand to mouth,\u201d said Tolle Fureg\u00e5rd, head of refugee accommodation at Sweden\u2019s migration board, who said the service relies a heavily on the private sector in this situation.\n\u201cAfter three years in the sector we are still not breaking even.\u201dJokarjo, the largest private provider of refugee accommodation for adults, has grown explosively.\nSweden is in the grip of a row over housing for refugees, with private accommodation providers accused of making fat profits while the country struggles to find beds for tens of thousands of asylum seekers before winter.\nSome private sector providers of refugee accommodation are serious, but others are \u201ccowboys who are only there because they want to make heaps of money\u201d, according to Marie Salln\u00e4s, professor of social work at Stockholm University.\nMigration minister, Morgan Johansson, has decried companies for \u201clining their pockets\u201d while the rest of Sweden is scraping together money for refugees."}
