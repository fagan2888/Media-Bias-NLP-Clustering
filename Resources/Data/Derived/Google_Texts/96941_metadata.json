Let\u2019s hope the Boss, unlike Charles Dickens, was not paid by the word.\n\nThe mind-boggling narrative of \u201cOutlaw Pete\u201d exalts sordidness, vice and puerility at every turn. It is unfit for any civilized creature.\n\nOutlaw Pete, the anti-hero, is born a diminutive baby on the Appalachian trail. His putative parents are apparently airbrushed from the story to protect them from charges of child neglect or malparenting.\n\nAt three months \u2014 when most babies are still crawling and free from vice \u2014 Outlaw Pete robs a bank brandishing a gun. He exits the premises with a bag of dollars and coins shouting \u201cI\u2019M OUTLAW PETE! I\u2019M OUTLAW PETE! CAN YOU HEAR ME?\u201d\n\nIt strains credulity, however, to believe a three-month old baby would know, like Willie Sutton, that banks were where the money was. Child prodigies are one thing, but Outlaw Pete is in a league by himself.\n\nAt the time of his bank robbery, Outlaw Pete had not read a single book nor attended a single lecture. He was no autodidact at three months. How could he have then known the address and function of banks and currency?\n\nWhile most babies do not begin to speak until nine months, Outlaw Pete incredibly is chorusing arpeggios of prose six months earlier. Further, if Outlaw Pete\u2019s jaw-dropping precocity is to be believed, why does he stupidly confess his outlaw status to all the world, thus inviting arrest and detention? Indeed, he is jailed immediately after his bank robbery confession.\n\nIn sum, \u201cOutlaw Pete\u201d flunks the test of verisimilitude.\n\nOur anti-hero is uncontrite about his felony to gratify an infantile craving for riches for the sake of riches. He was no Jean Valjean stealing bread for his sister\u2019s starving family in Victor Hugo\u2019s \u201cLes Miserables.\u201d Dante\u2019s \u201cInferno\u201d consigns the avaricious like Outlaw Pete to the fourth circle of hell. Yet Mr. Springsteen portrays him as morally unobjectionable.\n\nAfter Outlaw Pete\u2019s pre-kindergarten crime, we then encounter the larcenist at age 25 stealing a Mustang pony. No motivation for the crime is suggested. Like a sociopath, Outlaw Pete steals for the sake of stealing with neither remorse nor concern for the victims.\n\nIn an isolated moment of reflection, he confesses to Father Jesus, \u201cI\u2019m an outlaw, killer and a thief\u201d who revels in homicide and weeping women wherever he goes. But Outlaw Pete hears no words of rebuke or moral disapprobation from above or below, or within. He is a savage devoid of any moral conscience. He experiences no terror like Macbeth upon seeing the murdered Banquo\u2019s ghost.\n\nIn a shotgun marriage, Outlaw Pete weds a Navajo girl. We are left clueless about what brought them together: no courtship, no sonnets, no red roses, no sacred wedding vows. The circumstantial evidence shows Outlaw Pete\u2019s matrimony as more the child of ulterior motives than of unsparing, selfless love \u2014 but it escapes any hint of reproach from Mr. Springsteen.\n\nDespite his parental unfitness, Outlaw Pete irresponsibly fathers a nameless daughter, neurotically shouting for the umpteenth time that he is an outlaw. He murders a bounty hunter and then rides a horse for 40 days and nights cruelly depriving the animal of food, water and rest. His hegira-like journey concludes upon an icy mountaintop where Outlaw Pete commits suicide and murders his faithful equine \u2014 either by leaping over the edge or mindlessly freezing to death. He did not die like Sidney Carton in \u201cA Tale of Two Cities\u201d to protect another.\n\nHis abandoned wife suffers no pangs for the murdered horse, but with the callousness of Lady Macbeth braids a piece of the murderer\u2019s chaps into her hair.\n\nThe book ends anticlimactically with Outlaw Pete\u2019s witless, morally vacuous wife fruitlessly summoning him to return from the dead to continue his despicable homicidal, larcenous, narcissistic life.\n\n\u201cOutlaw Pete\u201d speaks volumes about Mr. Springsteen\u2019s reprehensible moral compass. An icon at age 65 with influence over hundreds of millions, his book encourages moral baseness on virtually every page. Not a single praiseworthy trait is celebrated.\n\nIf Mr. Springsteen had character, he would withdraw \u201cOutlaw Pete\u201d from circulation and apologize.\n\n\u2022 Bruce Fein is a former associate deputy attorney general and general counsel of the Federal Communications Commission under President Reagan.
