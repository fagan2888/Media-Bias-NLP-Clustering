On Thursday, Day 4.]\n\n[Click here for a gallery of photos from the series.]\n\nIt\u2019s midafternoon on a Thursday, and the waiting room is bustling at the Eastside Neighborhood Clinic in Santa Barbara.\n\nMany of its visitors are young children \u2014 some toddlers looking at cardboard books, others kindergarten-age watching Disney videotapes on the clinic\u2019s television.\n\n| Santa Barbara County's Safety Net | About This Series |\n\nThey're waiting for their appointments with Dr. Andria Ruth, a pediatrician with the Santa Barbara Neighborhood Clinics.\n\nRuth is busily seeing patients, moving in and out of examining rooms, speaking fluent Spanish with most of the families she encounters.\n\nPhysician\u2019s assistant Melissa Ellis is shadowing Ruth, and sees patients as well.\n\nRuth often asks Ellis, a PA in training, what she thinks the symptoms could mean before the pair go in together to examine a patient.\n\nThis time, that patient is 7-year-old Jeamy Lynn Cruz, who is waiting with her mom, Adriana.\n\nJeamy has some peeling and irritation on her eyelids. She had gone to an ophthalmologist for treatment, but was sent back to the clinics because insurance would not cover the visit.\n\nReviewing Jeamy\u2019s records from past visits to the clinics, Ruth notes that she\u2019s had allergy problems, which could be the reason for her current symptoms.\n\nShe recommends some allergy medicine and also gives the little girl a bottle of sunscreen after learning she has a summer camp coming up, during which she\u2019ll be playing outside often.\n\nThe clinic has digitized most of its medical records in preparation for the health-care reform law, and Ruth says they allow a consistency in patient care that didn't exist before.\n\nThe next patient Ruth and Ellis see is 7-month-old Javier Ramirez, who has come in for a \u201cwell-baby\u201d appointment, the periodic visit for infants that is covered by Medi-Cal.\n\nHe\u2019s a responsive and active infant, and Ruth and Ellis swoon and coo at him as they talk to his mom, Norma Ramirez.\n\nIs he overweight? the woman asks Ruth, explaining that she has an 8-year-old son \u201cheaded that way.\u201d\n\nRuth responds that he\u2019s a healthy weight, and answers her questions about what he should be fed. She encourages Ramirez to purchase organic vegetables if she\u2019ll be making her own baby food for Javier.\n\nThe visit gives Ramirez a chance to ask questions of Ruth, unrushed, and talk about upcoming visits for immunizations and the like.\n\nAfter Ruth closes the door, she commended Ramirez.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s asking all the right questions,\u201d she said.\n\nThe new health-care system launching next year places importance on treating children like Jeamy and Javier in a preventative way, using a primary-care doctor like Ruth.\n\nRuth, who has been with the clinic almost a decade, says that as the economy worsened over the last several years, she began to see an increase in children without health insurance.\n\nFrom her perspective at the clinic, Ruth says that concerns her because \u201ckids come in sicker and further along in their illness.\u201d\n\nRuth admits she\u2019s a little bit spoiled because most of the young patients she sees are covered by Medi-Cal, the state's public-health insurance program that covers qualifying low-income families with children, people with disabilities, pregnant women and seniors.\n\nMost of the time, Ruth can recommend care and procedures that are covered by insurance.\n\nStill, \u201cthe number of children that are uninsured in Santa Barbara County is a problem,\u201d she said.\n\nRuth says that uninsured children she sees primarily come from two types of groups: parents who are working but don\u2019t have health insurance, and children living in the United States illegally.\n\nIn the past three years, she says she\u2019s seen more people in the first category.\n\nIt\u2019s a diverse group: children of women who have recently gone through a divorce often don\u2019t have health insurance; young moms going to school trying to get their degrees; and families as well if they work for small employers or in low-wage jobs.\n\nAs the economy deteriorated, Ruth says, she saw fewer new immigrants show up in the clinic.\n\nThe most common diagnosis among Medi-Cal patients Ruth sees is actually dental disease.\n\nWeight related-obesity and diabetes come in a close second. Type-2 diabetes in children \u201cused to be so uncommon, and now I see children with it every week,\u201d she said.\n\nThe cost of having their children seen by a medical professional continues to be an obstacle for many people.\n\n\u201cSometimes people are so afraid of the cost of health care that they don\u2019t come in at all,\u201d she said.\n\nAcross town, that\u2019s exactly what Dr. Chris Flynn sees every day as he treats children in the Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital emergency room.\n\nParents may wait to bring in their children until their diagnoses are more advanced.\n\nFlynn sees a 3-year-old girl with croup, a barking cough, and after looking at her records, it\u2019s clear that the girl\u2019s mom is using the emergency room as a primary-care facility for her child, and comes in when the little girl has another health issue pop up.\n\nFlynn says that treating patients in an acute setting like the emergency room is the most expensive way to see them, and least beneficial to their long-term health.\n\nRuth notes that a visit to the neighborhood clinics is based on a sliding scale pegged to the parent\u2019s income.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not free but the cost is usually something that is approachable,\u201d she said.\n\nPartnerships are a big part of that \u2014 for example, Direct Relief, the Goleta-based nonprofit humanitarian aid organization, sends a huge number of supplies to the clinics.\n\n\n\nAs she rotates through her shift, Ruth will have seen about 20 child patients by the time her day is through.\n\nAs for the what the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will bring for some of her youngest patients, Ruth says she wants to see health care become more evenly distributed among them.\n\n\u201cI feel strongly that health care should be the same for each patient regardless of their ability to pay or their payer source,\u201d she said.\n\n| Santa Barbara County's Safety Net | Complete Series Index |\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk staff writer Lara Cooper can be reached at .(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address) .
