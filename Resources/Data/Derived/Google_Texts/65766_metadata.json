No takers?\n\nWhen the run toward the 2014 election began, several things were certain:\n\n-Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, was in deep trouble.\n\n-Republicans easily would hold Senate seats in states that President Barack Obama lost badly.\n\n-Domestic issues, and especially the president\u2019s health care law, would rise above all others.\n\nAll that, and more, has changed.\n\nKasich\u2019s re-election now seems so assured that fans talk of his making a second run for president. (It helped that his Democratic opponent was found in a dark parking lot with a woman who\u2019s not his wife.)\n\nIn the Senate, Republicans still seem on track to pick up the six seats they need to take control. They recruited good candidates and focused on several states Obama lost. Democratic retirements made West Virginia and South Dakota slam dunks.\n\nDemocrats facing re-election offered big targets in Arkansas, Louisiana, Alaska and North Carolina.\n\nBut with Senate control so tantalizingly close, Republicans find themselves investing time, staff and money into protecting a three-term senator in Kansas \u2013 one of the most conservative states.\n\n\u201cAnyone who predicted that last year is either psychic or psychotic,\u201d said Matt Bennett, a veteran of Democratic campaigns.\n\nEven if GOP Sen. Pat Roberts survives the challenge from independent Greg Orman, Republicans also must lock down South Dakota, a once-unthinkable concern.\n\nDemocrats are pouring $1 million into TV ads attacking Republican Mike Rounds, a former governor. Driving the uncertainty is third-party candidate Larry Pressler, who spent 18 years in the Senate as a Republican. Republicans answered quickly with $1 million worth of TV ad buys.\n\nIf Republicans lose either of those states, and fall one seat short of controlling the Senate, it will rank among the most crushing failures in recent political history. Especially with a 2016 map that strongly favors Democrats.\n\nOther 2014 campaign surprises:\n\n\u2013 The \u201cincredible disappearing Obamacare debate,\u201d as described by Dan Schnur, a former top Republican aide who now teaches at the University of Southern California.\n\nFor the third straight election, attacking Obama\u2019s health law is the Republicans\u2019 go-to tactic. But strategists in both parties say the relentless criticism is losing punch as millions of people acquire insurance under the law. Many GOP candidates have broadened their denunciations to Obama\u2019s overall competency and tying their Democratic opponents to him generally.\n\n\u2013 The rise of fear \u2013 of terrorism and disease, especially \u2013 as an issue.\n\nNeither was a topic of discussion during the months of state primaries. But the rise of Islamic State militants, Obama\u2019s decision to order airstrikes against them, and the outbreak of Ebola have roiled the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nSeveral Republican candidates are replacing their ads attacking the health law with sometimes frightening warnings about the risks and threat of the militants and the virus.\n\nObama, they argue, isn\u2019t doing enough, or isn\u2019t competent enough, to keep Americans safe.\n\nDemocrats call the claims grossly exaggerated and fear-mongering. Yet they worry about the impact.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are once again being seen through the old lens about the party on security issues: as weak, indecisive, and afraid to use force,\u201d Bennett said.\n\n\u2013 The power of one TV ad. Joni Ernst was struggling in Iowa\u2019s crowded Republican primary for the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. Then she appeared in a TV ad cheerily saying: \u201cI grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm. So when I get to Washington, I\u2019ll know how to cut pork.\u201d\n\nThe ad helped push her to an easy primary victory, and her rise began. She\u2019s now in a neck-and-neck race with Democrat Bruce Braley, a congressman who started the race as a clear favorite.\n\nBoth candidates have stumbled at times. But Ernst proved that a pitch-perfect ad can break through the din and transform a race almost overnight.\n\n\u2013 The role of third-party candidates. They run in every election, but rarely play much of a role. Not this year.\n\nOrman refuses to say whether he would align himself with Democrats or Republicans. But he still shook up the Kansas Senate race by driving out the Democratic nominee and possibly consolidating the anti-Roberts vote.\n\nIn South Dakota, Pressler didn\u2019t scare away the Democrats\u2019 nominee, but he has rattled Republicans with his rise.\n\nThird-party Senate candidates in Louisiana and Georgia could force runoffs that might leave control of the Senate in doubt until December, or even January. Both states require a runoff if no one exceeds 50 percent on the November ballot.\n\nIn Maine, Republican Gov. Paul LePage has angered many voters, \u201cbut he\u2019s alive because of a liberal third party gadfly hurting the Democrats,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nNewsHour Weekend reported on the unexpected political races in Kansas.
