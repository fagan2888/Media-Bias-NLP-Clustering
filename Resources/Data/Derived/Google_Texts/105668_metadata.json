But the data are not routinely used to purge duplicates.\n\n\u201cIncreasingly lax standards in our election process produce increasingly unreliable results,\u201d Engelbrecht asserted.\n\n\u201cThe few conversations that are had about how to shore up these weaknesses are immediately seized on by certain politicians and special-interest groups as fuel to further divide American voters based on trumped-up race and class-based narratives,\u201d she said.\n\nEngelbrecht said the \u201cvicious cycle\u201d can be fixed \u201cif citizens wake up, stand up and refuse to settle for a broken system.\u201d\n\n>>> Mississippi Voter ID Implemented With No Problems\n\nJay DeLancy, executive director of the Voter Integrity Project of North Carolina, says the solution is as simple as one-two-three:\n\nFirst, tie registrations more closely to [each state\u2019s] Department of Motor Vehicles. All voter ID cards would originate there. As is today, when we get an ID card from DMV, we get registered to vote\u2014but turning in your former state\u2019s ID card should revoke your right to vote in the state that issued it.\n\nSecond, make it a felony to possess a voter ID card\u2014or any other DMV-issued ID card\u2014from more than one state.\n\nThird, we would only be allowed to vote from the address on that ID card. If a voter shows up with the wrong address, the vote is provisional until the card is corrected.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a federal ID card to do this. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t require any more feds to be hired.\u201d\n\nStates, however, will have to tighten up. And that could be a challenge\u2014both politically and fiscally.\n\n>>> Voter ID: Protecting the Integrity of Our Elections\n\nIn Virginia, Wheeler noted that the State Board of Elections and Department of Elections \u201chave had their funding reduced greatly by the [Terry] McAuliffe administration.\u201d McAuliffe, a Democrat, took office in January.\n\n\u201cWith reduced funding, they have a grossly limited staff and thus, will be greatly limited in the ability to do the cross checks and reduce voter fraud.\u201d\n\nState Board of Elections officials, who provided the cross-check data in response to a Freedom of Information Act filing by the Virginia Voters Alliance, did not respond to Wheeler\u2019s assertion.\n\nTwo national voting-rights groups \u2014 the League of Women Voters and America Votes \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some 6.9 million Americans are registered to vote in two or more states, according to a report from an election-watch group.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Some 6.9 million Americans are registered to vote in two or more states, according to a report from an election-watch group.", "title": "Millions Registered to Vote in More Than One State", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/062614_Vote_Ward.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1wBuc3H"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Some 6.9 million Americans are registered to vote in two or more states, according to a report from an election-watch group.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/062614_Vote_Ward.jpg"}, "title": "Millions Registered to Vote in More Than One State", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "elections", "published_time": "2014-06-26T11:57:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "voter fraud, voter ID, Virginia"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a8a\"", "article_summary": "Second, make it a felony to possess a voter ID card\u2014or any other DMV-issued ID card\u2014from more than one state.\nAs is today, when we get an ID card from DMV, we get registered to vote\u2014but turning in your former state\u2019s ID card should revoke your right to vote in the state that issued it.\nSome 6.9 million Americans are registered to vote in two or more states, according to a report from an election-watch group.\nThird, we would only be allowed to vote from the address on that ID card.\nHe added: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a federal ID card to do this."}
