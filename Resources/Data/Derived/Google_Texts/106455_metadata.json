The company cited higher health costs than expected due to an older customer base which is using more health services than they\u2019d prepared for, according to Kaiser Health News.\n\nPatrick Geraghty, Florida Blue\u2019s CEO, had previously warned that the company was under \u201ctremendous financial pressure\u201d and that they\u2019d be seeking significant hikes. (RELATED: Florida\u2019s Largest Obamacare Insurer: Rate Hikes Coming in 2015)\n\n\u201cIt is far from clear that large enrollment in the marketplace is a financially beneficial place to be,\u201d Geraghty told Kaiser Health News last month.\n\nFlorida Blue has attracted a third of all Florida\u2019s Obamacare exchange customers, which number almost 1 million.\n\nPremiums will even be hurting those who chose the typically cheaper health care plans with narrower networks. A full 40 percent of Florida Blue\u2019s customers chose plans with narrow networks, one of the few ways that health insurers can lower their own costs since Obamacare regulations require all plans to cover a wide base of services. (RELATED: Insurer: Obamacare Customers Must Break \u2018Choice Habit\u2019)\n\n\n\nNarrow networks are expanding, much to the chagrin of Obamacare exchange customer nationwide, because with limited co-pays and bans on charging high-risk patients higher prices, insurers are now struggling to find ways to lower their costs for older, sick patients. Lowering the number of covered health care providers in a plan\u2019s contract can allow insurers to pay lower reimbursement rates while physicians recoup their own losses with higher patient volume.\n\nEven customers with narrow network plans, however, will see a 13 percent rate increase on their exchange plan next year, on average.

Molina, a smaller company, is lowering rates 11.6 percent on average.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Florida's largest Obamacare exchange health insurer is boosting its premiums by 17.6 percent, a staggering increase for hundreds of thousands of Floridians.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Florida's largest Obamacare exchange health insurer is boosting its premiums by 17.6 percent, a staggering increase for hundreds of thousands of Floridians.
