She's reapplying this week, though, and is confident it will go through.\n\nMost Utahns signing up are getting federal subsidies for their insurance under the Affordable Care Act, the HHS news release said.\n\nEnrollment via HealthCare.gov started Nov. 15, and of those Utahns who signed up in the first month, 89 percent got federal financial assistance.\n\nJason Stevenson, communications director for Utah Health Policy Project, said the enrollment numbers reflect what's been going on at UHPP and at Take Care Utah, a partnership of organizations funded by the federal government to help people sign up for health care.\n\n\"It tracks with the busy enrollment in our office and across the Take Care Utah network,\" he said.\n\nOne big difference from last year, Stevenson noted, is the ease with which most people are signing up at HealthCare.gov.\n\n\"This year, people are signing up in an hour. There are not as many glitches,\" he said.\n\nkmoulton@sltrib.com\n\nTwitter: @KristenMoulton", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 109,000 Utahns have signed up for 2015 health insurance through the Obamacare federal marketplace \u2014 36 percent more than signed up in all of 2014.
