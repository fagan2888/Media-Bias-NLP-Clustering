Psychonaught\n\nA homeopathy conference in Handeloh, Germany this past weekend was upended by the most unlikely of things \u2014 actual drugs.\n\nAccording to the Independent, 29 conference attendees, both men and women ranging in age from 26 to 52, were believed to have taken a synthetic hallucinogenic drug known as 2C-E on Friday. The LSD-like drug, known as Aquarust in Germany, had recently been banned in the country last winter. And in the U.S. it's been listed as a schedule 1 drug since 2012, making it illegal to produce, distribute, or possess without a DEA license.\n\nThe authorities were apparently alerted by the attendees\u2019 strange behavior at the hotel where the conference was held, which included \u201cstaggering around, rolling in a meadow, talking gibberish, and suffering severe cramps,\u201d according to local media outlet NDR.\n\nIn total, over 150 medical and police staff were dispatched to the hotel to corral the hapless homeopaths to the hospital, where subsequent urine tests revealed the presence of 2C-E in their system. In addition to cramps, several attendees complained of delusions, breathing problems, and heart palpitations. None of the participants were able to coherently answer questions from the police until Monday.\n\n\u201cIt must have been a multiple overdose. That does not support the view that the people concerned took the hallucinogen knowingly,\u201d Torsten Passie, a member of the German government\u2019s expert commission for narcotics, told NDR. \u201cOne has to assume that people were not told about the substance, its effects, and risks before taking it.\u201d\n\nCurrently, however, it isn\u2019t known if the attendees mistakenly took the drug under the pretense of conducting some sort of experiment or were maliciously misled into the act, and there is still a pending investigation as to whether anyone has violated Germany\u2019s Narcotics Act.\n\nAccording to the Independent, at least one major alternative medicine organization, the Association of German Healing Practitioners (VDH), has already thoroughly denounced the conference in the wake of the incident. \u201cThe organizers of this obscure conference are unknown to us and such events will not be tolerated by our association,\u201d a spokesperson for VDH said in a statement. \u201cThe Association of German Healing Practitioners (Heilpraktikers) detests such misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nThe incident is made all the more newsworthy thanks to the widely held perception by the mainstream medical community that homeopathic treatments are incapable of producing any active pharmaceutical effects, hallucinogenic or not.\n\nIn both the United States and abroad, skeptics of homeopathy have purposefully engaged in their own \"overdose\" campaigns, ingesting massive quantities of homeopathic medicine to no ill effect.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hellucinogenic drugs, homeopaths", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Homeopaths accidentally overdose on a powerful LSD-like drug this past weekend at a conference in Germany.", "title": "Homeopaths Accidentally Take Hallucinogenic Drugs At A Conference, 29 Overdose", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/homeopaths-gone-wild-29-hospitalized-after-overdosing-hallucinogenic-drugs-german-351592", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/08/25-dimethoxy-4-ethyl.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Homeopaths accidentally overdose on a powerful LSD-like drug this past weekend at a conference in Germany.", "title": "Homeopaths Accidentally Take Hallucinogenic Drugs At A Conference, 29 Overdose", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/homeopaths-gone-wild-29-hospitalized-after-overdosing-hallucinogenic-drugs-german-351592", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/08/25-dimethoxy-4-ethyl.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/08/25-dimethoxy-4-ethyl.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-08T18:22:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-10T02:58:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Homeopaths accidentally overdose on a powerful LSD-like drug this past weekend at a conference in Germany."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2872\"", "article_summary": "A homeopathy conference in Germany was interrupted by the presence of 2C-E, a hallucinogenic drug, leading to the hospitalization of 29 attendees, local authorities report.\nPsychonaughtA homeopathy conference in Handeloh, Germany this past weekend was upended by the most unlikely of things \u2014 actual drugs.\nAccording to the Independent, 29 conference attendees, both men and women ranging in age from 26 to 52, were believed to have taken a synthetic hallucinogenic drug known as 2C-E on Friday.\nThe LSD-like drug, known as Aquarust in Germany, had recently been banned in the country last winter.\nAccording to the Independent, at least one major alternative medicine organization, the Association of German Healing Practitioners (VDH), has already thoroughly denounced the conference in the wake of the incident."}
