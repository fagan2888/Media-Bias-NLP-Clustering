The charges are staggering \u2013 drag-racing, driving under the influence, and resisting arrest. Police said Bieber was caught speeding down a residential street in a yellow Lamborghini.\n\nHe admitted to smoking marijuana, taking prescription medication and drinking alcohol. He failed a field sobriety test.\n\nBieber has gone from a wanna-be thug with saggy pants to a full-blown bona-fide Grade-A thug \u2013 with saggy pants.\n\nThe police report indicated the 19-year-old bombarded the arresting officer with a flurry of F-bombs. He repeatedly refused to take his hands out of his pockets and demanded to know why he was being arrested.\n\n\u201cWhat the f***\u201d are you doing?\u201d he demanded to know.\n\nIronically, that\u2019s the same question many people have been asking of Bieber. What are you doing?\n\nI suspect many of his fans and their parents are wondering -- what happened to the clean-cut crooner with epic hair who quoted Bible verses and professed to be a wholesome churchgoer?\n\nAnd kudos to the arresting officer for his professionalism in the middle of Bieber\u2019s profanity-laced meltdown. That boy\u2019s mouth was writing checks his body couldn\u2019t cash. Bieber is quite fortunate to still have all of his teeth.\n\nBieber\u2019s downward spiral has been well-documented by the Hollywood press, from urinating in public to cavorting with strippers. He\u2019s under a felony investigation over allegations he egged his neighbor\u2019s house.\n\nHis posse is a motley crew of assorted ruffians and scoundrels who\u2019ve had countless brushes with the law. Bieber\u2019s cohorts are proof that if you hang out with turkeys, you\u2019re going to get roasted.\n\nHollywood is littered with the tarnished reputations of child stars gone bad. Bieber is not the first, nor is he the last to succumb to Tinseltown\u2019s bright lights and temptations. The road to perdition is paved with seductive twists and turns. Hopefully, this young man\u2019s family will intervene before he discovers that the road he\u2019s traveling leads to a dead end.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the Biebs to drop the droopy drawers and put on some man pants.\n\nThe Good Book tells us that when we were children, we spoke and thought and reasoned as children. But when we grew up, we put away childish things.\n\nBy the world\u2019s standards, Bieber seems to have it all \u2013 fame and fortune. But today, the 19-year-old star sat behind bars.\n\nJustin Bieber never put away his childish things.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At approximately 4 a.m. Thursday morning, Justin Bieber learned an age-old lesson \u2013 nothing good ever happens after midnight..05/24/2016 11:06:23AM EST.", "author": "Todd Starnes", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "At approximately 4 a.m. Thursday morning, Justin Bieber learned an age-old lesson \u2013 nothing good ever happens after midnight.", "title": "- Justin Bieber Needs to Put on Some Man Pants", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2014/01/24/justin-bieber-needs-to-put-on-some-man-pants-n1784112", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/12/d370d325-8299-4c5c-a3cb-40833efc30c5.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "At approximately 4 a.m. Thursday morning, Justin Bieber learned an age-old lesson \u2013 nothing good ever happens after midnight.", "title": "- Justin Bieber Needs to Put on Some Man Pants", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2014/01/24/justin-bieber-needs-to-put-on-some-man-pants-n1784112", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/12/d370d325-8299-4c5c-a3cb-40833efc30c5.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Justin Bieber Needs to Put on Some Man Pants, Todd Starnes, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6da\"", "article_summary": "Bieber has gone from a wanna-be thug with saggy pants to a full-blown bona-fide Grade-A thug \u2013 with saggy pants.\nHopefully, this young man\u2019s family will intervene before he discovers that the road he\u2019s traveling leads to a dead end.\nAt approximately 4 a.m. Thursday morning, Justin Bieber learned an age-old lesson \u2013 nothing good ever happens after midnight.\nIt\u2019s time for the Biebs to drop the droopy drawers and put on some man pants.\nPolice said Bieber was caught speeding down a residential street in a yellow Lamborghini."}
