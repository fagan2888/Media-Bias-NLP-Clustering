He attached a 2013 Justice report that outlined the benefits of cameras but gave no estimate of the cost.\n\nThe report said police departments that use cameras found evidence that both officers and civilians \u201cacted in a more positive manner when they were aware that a camera was present,\u201d and that useful evidence of interactions often was captured on video.\n\nAt a labor convention in Missouri on Monday, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said racism is to blame for shooting deaths such as Michael Brown\u2019s on Aug. 9 at the hands of a white police officer.\n\n\u201cOther young men of color have died and will die in similar circumstances in communities all across this country,\u201d Mr. Trumka said.\n\n\u201cIt happened here, but it could have happened, and does happen, anywhere in America. Because the reality is we still have racism in America.\u201d\n\nLaw-enforcement agencies, including the Justice Department, have not issued a final determination of what led to the shooting. Police initially said the teen resisted arrest after the officer stopped him and a friend on the street.\n\nThe White House said there are \u201cunanswered questions\u201d about the use of police cameras, including privacy implications.\n\nMr. Austin added, \u201cThe issue of cost also cannot be ignored.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also know that cameras alone will not solve the problem where there is mistrust between police and communities,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a nation, we must continue to address this lack of trust. Most Americans are law abiding and most law enforcement officers work hard day in and day out to protect and serve their communities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration is supporting a movement to equip police with body cameras to record their on-duty activities, as a response to the police shooting of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration is supporting a movement to equip police with body cameras to record their on-duty activities, as a response to the police shooting of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.", "title": "Obama administration supports police body cameras in wake of Ferguson", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/16/obama-supports-police-body-cameras-wake-ferguson/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/10/police-shooting-missourijpeg-0b878.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/10/police-shooting-missourijpeg-0b878.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration is supporting a movement to equip police with body cameras to record their on-duty activities, as a response to the police shooting of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama administration supports police body cameras in wake of Ferguson"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Politics, Roy Austin Jr, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c41\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration is supporting a movement to equip police with body cameras to record their on-duty activities, as a response to the police shooting of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.\nMr. Austin said the Justice Department is researching best practices to implement cameras and other video technology for police.\nAnswering an online petition on the White House\u2019s \u201cWe the People\u201d page, a White House official said the administration backs the use of cameras worn buy law-enforcement officers.\nHe attached a 2013 Justice report that outlined the benefits of cameras but gave no estimate of the cost.\nMost Americans are law abiding and most law enforcement officers work hard day in and day out to protect and serve their communities.\u201d"}
