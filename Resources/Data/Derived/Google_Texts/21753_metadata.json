We know this will be won right here at the victory center. We can take Thom over the finish line.\u201d\n\nFirst stop: Raleigh, N.C.\n\nIn the state capital of Raleigh, \u201cground zero\u201d looks like a nondescript state party headquarters, where volunteer get-out-the-vote callers stay near their telephones while the man they\u2019re calling for delivers a campaign speech.\n\nRhett Johnson is a fluffy-haired, high-socked student intern from the college across the street. His neon orange running shoes dominate attention.\n\nThose shoes have traveled\u2013usually, by means of jogging, considering Johnson\u2019s youth\u2013to more than 10,000 homes of potential voters this summer.\n\nPriebus calls out Johnson in his speech, before mostly college students who have made the short walk from North Carolina State University.\n\nThe work Johnson does is more important to the Republican establishment than it had been in the past.\n\n\u201cThis is a total revamp of our national party,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIt can\u2019t be where we are a U-Haul trailer of cash for the presidential nominee. We know this will be won right here at the victory center.\u201d\n\nThroughout his campaigning and during debates, Tillis has focused mostly on national issues, and tried to distance himself from Hagan\u2019s positions.\n\nHagan, meanwhile, has framed her campaign as a referendum on the conservative shift taken by the state legislature under Tillis\u2019 leadership. The Hagan campaign did not respond to The Daily Signal\u2019s request to interview the candidate or campaign workers.\n\nTillis continued with his own strategy Saturday.\n\nOn the Islamic State, the terrorist group also known as ISIS: \u201cBombing targets isn\u2019t a strategy,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tactic. ISIS is the greatest threat we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nOn Ebola: \u201cI called for a travel ban three weeks ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s common sense. Hagan [on Friday] finally said she supports a travel ban. Welcome to the world of common sense.\u201d\n\nTillis contrasted himself as someone who would vote with and against the president\u2013and his own party\u2013depending on the issue.\n\n\u201cThis message is about electing a senator from North Carolina who is independent, who will stand up to the president when he\u2019s wrong and stand up to our leadership,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult and complicated. It just takes courage and commitment.\u201d\n\nBut for the college students watching, many wearing red \u201cThom Tillis\u201d stickers, voting records matter less than a candidate relating to their values.\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough demographic for Republicans to reach.\n\n\u201cOur generation is socially changing,\u201d said one rally attendee, J. Charges, a North Carolina State sophomore. \u201cLiberals appeal more to the younger generation. But conservatives want to change that.\u201d\n\nIn a direct appeal to them, Tillis told his backstory, how he left his parents\u2019 house at 17 to work in a warehouse, putting off college to do so, and how he eventually rose to become a Senate candidate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t tell you that story to brag,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cI tell you that story because it\u2019s your future.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s at Stake\n\nNorth Carolina is expected to be the most expensive Senate race in history.\n\nNearly $80 million in political ads have already flooded the state, a figure that could rise as high as $100 million by Election Day.\n\nThe latest polls show Sen. Kay Hagan, the Democrat incumbent, with a slight edge over Tillis.\n\nNorth Carolina has one Republican senator already, a Republican governor and a Republican-controlled state legislature. But Democrats are making inroads in North Carolina, as President Obama won the state in 2008 and Hagan defeated former Sen. Elizabeth Dole.\n\nThough Obama\u2019s approval rating is abysmal here, Tillis, the state House speaker, has struggled to energize the Republican base.\n\nHe ties Hagan to the president at every chance, but Tillis can\u2019t separate from her in the polls.\n\nTillis, who on Saturday dressed relaxed in blue jeans and without a tie, thinks he finally is gaining some ground. Priebus\u2019 presence in North Carolina revealed the GOP\u2019s nervousness in hoping that\u2019s true.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve caught them,\u201d Tillis said Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the momentum that tells us we\u2019re going to win.\u201d\n\nNext stop, Greensboro, N.C.\n\n\u201cGround zero\u201d is also the Guilford County Republican Party headquarters, situated in a rundown commercial center by a Cajun restaurant, in the heart of Hagan\u2019s hometown.\n\nThis, unofficially, is the largest Republican party headquarters on the East Coast of this state, and, with 25 volunteers out knocking on doors this Saturday, the place\u2019s emptiness makes it feel big.\n\nTillis and Priebus, riding together in a black SUV, travelled one hour and 15 minutes south on Interstate 85 to get here, and they were a few minutes late.\n\nTillis works to make up for it by hugging and kissing supporters\u2013faces more familiar to him than the college students in Raleigh.\n\nHere, there were only a handful of students, so Tillis spoke to his base, preaching on the economy and faith.\n\n\u201cThis race is about hope and optimism,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cRonald Reagan was a master of making America believe in themselves again. We need to get America back to that. We need to get America back to work the way we got North Carolina back to work.\n\nHe continued: \u201cPray for the president. Pray for Kay Hagan. Pray that God leads America to begin to realize that America is a great nation.\u201d\n\nFor the few young people in the crowd, it was unclear if Tillis\u2019 message resonated.\n\nThis generation is open-minded, and they were not about to pledge allegiance to a specific party\u2013or candidate.\n\n\u201cI would rather choose a candidate over a party,\u201d said Steven Carbone, a student at nearby Ragsdale High school, who came to the rally on assignment for his political science class.\n\n\u201cI want to get informed about the race,\u201d he added. \u201cNinety percent of our students don\u2019t care about politics. I want to know more than the average student.\u201d\n\nWith his mind far from made up\u2013and still a few years from voting age\u2013Carbone walked off with two of his friends and asked to take a photo with Tillis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Carolina Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus campaigned Saturday to college students.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "North Carolina Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus campaigned Saturday to college students.", "title": "\u2018Ground Zero\u2019 in North Carolina and the GOP Chase for College Kids", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_10181.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-22T12:37:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1vCamXg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "North Carolina Republican Senate candidate Thom Tillis and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus campaigned Saturday to college students.", "title": "\u2018Ground Zero\u2019 in North Carolina and the GOP Chase for College Kids", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_10181.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Evergreen Topics", "tag": "Elections 2014,society", "published_time": "2014-10-20T09:43:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-22T12:37:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "North Carolina, Senate race, Kay Hagan, Thom Tillis, Reince Priebus, Republican National Committee, President Obama, Ebola, ISIS, Raleigh,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded20\"", "article_summary": "\u201c[North Carolina] was ground zero in 2012 and I presume it will be two years from now,\u201d Priebus said.\nPriebus calls out Johnson in his speech, before mostly college students who have made the short walk from North Carolina State University.\n\u201cThis is ground zero in America,\u201d said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, who campaigned Saturday in North Carolina for Thom Tillis, the GOP Senate candidate.\nRALEIGH, N.C.\u2013For Republicans, \u201cground zero\u201d is the state where the party\u2019s fortunes in the Senate could be won or lost.\nCharges, a North Carolina State sophomore."}
