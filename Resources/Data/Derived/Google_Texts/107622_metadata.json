Over the past week Republicans have spent a fair amount of time and energy minimizing the damage of their deliberate government shutdown in spite of the harmful impact on the government and the people it exists to serve. It makes sense for Republicans to pretend their actions are not affecting millions of Americans, but it does not assuage the damage their well-planned shutdown are having on the economy or the American people. Over the past few days, to prepare Americans for their plan to default on the nation\u2019s debt obligations, Republicans have made a concerted effort to minimize the inherent economic damage failing to raise the nation\u2019s borrowing limit will have on Americans, but their arguments fly in the face of rational thought and most of the world\u2019s economic experts predicting an American default will have immeasurable detrimental effects on world financial systems.\n\nAccording to real economic experts, if the world\u2019s largest borrower fails to pay its debts, an unprecedented event in modern history, it will devastate stock markets around the world, halt a $5 trillion lending mechanism that will blow up borrowing costs for billions of people and companies, ravage the dollar, and throw world economies into a recession and probable depression. The experts, money managers, economists, bankers, traders, and former government officials consider a Republican credit default will be nothing short of financial apocalypse. However, in their economic wisdom, House Republicans have convinced themselves and a majority of their supporters that a catastrophic credit default is an Obama Administration over-hyped crisis to frighten Americans into opposing extremist Republicans and their lust to crater the economy.\n\nThe Republican idea that warnings about exceeding the debt limit is a scare tactic incited Senator Pat Toomey (R-PA) to introduce the \u201cFull Faith and Credit Act\u201d in 2011 that would \u201crequire the government to prioritize public debt obligations\u201d in case Republicans failed to raise the debt ceiling. The Republican intent was to reveal the Obama Administration\u2019s dirty tricks and fear-mongering for claiming hitting the debt limit meant defaulting on the nation\u2019s debt in case Republicans balked at paying the nation\u2019s bills. Over two years later Republicans are again claiming that if the nation hits the debt limit President Obama can move money around and tell investors he will use incoming revenue to pay for debt service and the military much like they claim the President could reopen parts of the government if he wanted to. Republicans hope Americans will forget that all appropriations have to originate in the Republican-controlled House because their intent is causing a credit default at the urging of the House teabagger caucus and Republican voters.\n\nAccording to Pat Toomey, the President is attempting to bully and frighten Republicans into raising the debt limit unnecessarily because, as Republicans see it, President Obama could finance the debt and \u201ckeep old people alive unless he is so vindictive he chooses to withhold Social Security checks\u201d or lay off staff that processes retirement checks on time to make a default as painful for the people as possible. A former Bush administration Treasury official said that \u201cIf we miss an interest payment, that would blow Lehman out of the water,\u201d referring to the devastating consequences of Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse that tanked the world\u2019s economy in 2008. The former official, Tim Bitsberger, said that \u201cLehman was an isolated company, and now we are talking about the U.S. government,\u201d but since House Republicans claim to know more about the economy than real financial experts, they are following teabagger economists who are anxious to default on the debt \u201cjust to see what will happen.\u201d\n\nRepublican voters think that what will happen is minimal, if any, damage to the economy and 54% of them believe America could breach the debt limit \u201cwithout major problems.\u201d One House Republican, Ted Yoho, a teabagger from Florida chillingly declared that a credit default \u201cwould bring stability to the world markets\u201d because the United States had moved to curb its debt.\u201d Yoho has no clue what the debt ceiling means and therein lies a major part of this nation\u2019s problem, but other Republicans comprehend that Republicans are flirting with disaster.\n\nAnother former Bush Treasury official said of Republican\u2019s blowing off the damage of a default, \u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling. I don\u2019t know what to say. Every member of Congress should know this. These aren\u2019t complicated concepts.\u201d However, they are complicated enough for teabaggers that it prompted two of Republicans\u2019 staunchest supporters, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, to reiterate the President\u2019s warning and urge Republicans to pass the debt ceiling increase soon to \u201cavoid substantial and enduring damage\u201d to the economy.\n\nIt is likely that the Chamber and Wall Street executives see the direction Republicans are taking the nations\u2019 economy and are mortified at the real prospect Republicans will let the nation go into default. Representative Joe Barton (R-TX) fueled fears Republicans will fail to raise the debt limit when he said, \u201cwe don\u2019t have to pay every bill the day it comes in,\u201d and it is precisely the attitude that prompted credit rating agency S&P to downgrade the nation\u2019s credit score in 2011. Republicans just cannot bring it on themselves to see the catastrophic effects of a nation like America defaulting on its debt and it is why they are minimizing the devastation by promoting their Full Faith and Credit Act to prioritize government payments.\n\nDespite the preponderance of evidence, and a world of financial experts\u2019 warnings, Republicans are certain a national default is nothing to fear and might even be good for America and world markets. They are as memory-challenged as they are economic imbeciles because during the last debt ceiling crisis the country\u2019s credit rating was lowered, a million jobs were lost, and $18.9 billion was added to the deficit Republicans claim is out of control. Republican leadership is sending mixed messages about their opposition to letting the nation default when they demand concessions from the President or they will not raise the debt ceiling. There are plenty of Republicans backing up Boehner\u2019s demand that President Obama pay a ransom in exchange for a debt limit increase and likely they are the House Republicans committed to a default whether the Affordable Care Act is scuttled or not.\n\nObviously, there are business and Wall Street leaders who are worried Republicans will cause a default or two of their biggest names would not take the unprecedented step of warning House Republicans to stop their games and raise the debt limit. However, Republicans cannot be bothered with informed advice from their staunch allies in business and Wall Street because they know more about the economy and high finance than worldwide financial experts, former Bush Treasury officials, President Obama, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and one or two sane Republicans. One cannot help but think though, that although teabaggers in the House are too ignorant to comprehend the debt ceiling that is not that complicated, it is worth remembering that on Inauguration Night in 2009, Republicans met in private to plot against America\u2019s economic recovery and really; what better way to finish what they started over four-and-a-half years ago than cause economic apocalypse and a worldwide depression with a default?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The arguments of the Republican default truthers fly in the face of rational thought and  economic experts who are predicting that a default will have detrimental effects on world financial systems.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The arguments of the Republican default truthers fly in the face of rational thought and  economic experts who are predicting that a default will have detrimental effects on world financial systems.", "title": "Irrational Republican Default Truthers Are Determined to Crash The Economy", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/10/10/irrational-republican-default-truthers-determined-crash-economy.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/us-money-burning-economic-disaster.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-10T10:49:55+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,credit,default,finance,Financial economics,Fiscal policy,Goldman Sachs,Lehman Brothers,Lloyd Blankfein,Pat Toomey,U.S. Chamber of Commerce,United States debt-ceiling crisis,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-10-10T10:49:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-10T10:49:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "credit, default, finance, Financial economics, Fiscal policy, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Lloyd Blankfein, Pat Toomey, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, United States debt-ceiling crisis"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0dde\"", "article_summary": "The experts, money managers, economists, bankers, traders, and former government officials consider a Republican credit default will be nothing short of financial apocalypse.\nThe Republican intent was to reveal the Obama Administration\u2019s dirty tricks and fear-mongering for claiming hitting the debt limit meant defaulting on the nation\u2019s debt in case Republicans balked at paying the nation\u2019s bills.\nRepublicans hope Americans will forget that all appropriations have to originate in the Republican-controlled House because their intent is causing a credit default at the urging of the House teabagger caucus and Republican voters.\nAnother former Bush Treasury official said of Republican\u2019s blowing off the damage of a default, \u201cIt\u2019s mind-boggling.\nHowever, in their economic wisdom, House Republicans have convinced themselves and a majority of their supporters that a catastrophic credit default is an Obama Administration over-hyped crisis to frighten Americans into opposing extremist Republicans and their lust to crater the economy."}
