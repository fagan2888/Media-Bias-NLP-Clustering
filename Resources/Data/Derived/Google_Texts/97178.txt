When Paul Oyer, an economist at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, plunged into the online dating world a few years ago, he was struck — by the economics involved in his search.

“After spending 20 years learning about and studying markets,” Mr. Oyer writes in a new book, “I had suddenly been thrust back into one of the most fascinating markets that exists — the market for life partners.”

Mr. Oyer, the author of “Everything I Ever Needed to Know About Economics I Learned From Online Dating,” published this month by Harvard Business Review Press, is taking readers’ questions on Economix about the economics of the online dating marketplace.

If you have a question about how economic principles can improve your chances, leave it in the comments section (by clicking on the icon above the headline) and Mr. Oyer will provide answers to selected questions in a future post.

Mr. Oyer writes that the best advice he could provide on the subject “is that you have to be in the market to succeed in the market.” In his search, he says his strategy was to use multiple dating sites, be open-minded about the types of women he would agree to meet for a first date and try to be honest. He also looked for bigger dating sites.

Being, and persevering, in the online marketplace paid off for Mr. Oyer. After many dates, and brief relationships, he found his current partner through the Jewish dating site JDate. Cupid played a bit of a joke on the economist in this case, however; his love match turned out to work a hundred yards from his office.
