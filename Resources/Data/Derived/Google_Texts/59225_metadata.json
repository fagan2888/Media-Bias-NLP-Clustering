One was about a so-called single-payer health care system, in which the government pays for care for all citizens.\n\n\"The interesting this is, I'm not the guy who's saying we should have completely socialized medicine,\" Ribble said Sept. 8, 2015 on WTMJ-AM (620).\n\n\"I want to repeal Obamacare and replace it with (a) free-market system. He wants to replace it with a single-payer system. That's hardly a conservative posture.\"\n\nSometimes Trump's positions can seem to be a moving target; and whether they are conservative can be open to interpretation.\n\nBut does Trump want to install a single-payer health care system?\n\nTwice in the past two months our colleagues have reviewed claims similar to Ribble's. So let's start there.\n\nFirst True\n\nIn July 2015, conservative columnist Erick Erickson wrote that Trump \"has supported a Canadian-style universal health care system.\"\n\nOur partners at PunditFact.com issued a rating of True.\n\nIn 1999, during his short-lived 2000 Reform Party presidential bid, Trump told CNN's Larry King: \"If you can\u2019t take care of your sick in the country, forget it, it\u2019s all over. ... I believe in universal healthcare.\"\n\nAnd in his 2000 book \"The America We Deserve,\" Trump made a strong pitch for universal health care. As to how the country might achieve universal coverage, Trump focused on a Canadian-style, single-payer plan.\n\nSo, Trump has supported single payer in the past.\n\nThen Half True\n\nOn Aug. 2, 2015, GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, said Trump is \"for single-payer\" -- essentially a present-tense version of the columnist\u2019s claim.\n\nOur colleagues found that earlier in 2015, Trump voiced admiration for Scotland\u2019s health care system, which is single payer. But in another interview -- while stopping short of rejecting single payer -- he talked about offering private plans made through \"deals with hospitals\" that allow the government to help people \"at the lower levels.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Trump insisted at the time that Trump has \"never supported socialized medicine,\" but is for \"a universal \u2018market-based\u2019 plan that would offer a range of choices.\"\n\nSo as the 2016 campaign unfolded, Trump has said he admires single payer, but also suggested he prefers free-market models, as well.\n\nPolitiFact National\u2019s rating of Perry\u2019s claim was Half True.\n\nThe two fact checks were what Ribble\u2019s office cited to us to back Ribble\u2019s claim. (Trump\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t reply to us.)\n\nBut Trump has since had more to say on the subject.\n\nThen what?\n\nTwo days after the more recent fact check, Trump was asked on MSNBC\u2019s \"Morning Joe\" talk show: \"Are you for single-payer health care?\"\n\nTrump replied:\n\n\"No, but it\u2019s certainly something that in certain countries works. It actually works incredibly well in Scotland. Some people think it really works in Canada. But not here, I don\u2019t think it would work as well here. What has to happen -- I like the concept of private enterprise coming in \u2026.You have to create competition. And you have to go back to a system of private.\"\n\nThe no part of Trump\u2019s answer, even as he repeated praise for single payer, seemed to indicate Trump does not favor it for the United States.\n\nBut he has since been less clear.\n\nTwo days later, at the first Republican presidential debate on April 6, 2015, Fox News host Bret Baier asked Trump:\n\n\"Now, 15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system. Why were you for that then and why aren\u2019t you for it now?\"\n\nTrump answered first by speaking about foreign policy, then said:\n\n\"As far as single payer, it works in Canada. It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you\u2019re talking about here.\n\n\"What I\u2019d like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state \u2026..Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have yourself great plans. And then we have to take care of the people that can\u2019t take care of themselves. And I will do that through a different system.\"\n\nAgain, a mixed bag: praising single payer, but advocating, if vaguely, for a private system.\n\nMore recently, Trump essentially gave no answer when conservative talk show host Sean Hannity asked him about single payer on Hannity\u2019s Sept. 1, 2015 radio program. After covering other topics, Trump replied by saying:\n\n\"As far as single-payer and all \u2014 there\u2019s so many different things you could have. Honestly, Sean, to do, to have great health insurance. The one thing I do tell people, we\u2019re going to have something great. We\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total disaster.\"\n\nOur rating\n\nRibble said Trump \"wants to replace\" Obamacare \"with a single-payer system.\"\n\nTrump continues to praise single payer -- a health care system in which the government pays for care for all citizens -- at least as it used in other countries. But he has spoken a number of times, if vaguely, about a private system and at one point said he does not support single payer in the United States. Since then, his responses have been less clear.\n\nWe rate Ribble\u2019s statement Half True.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the Summer of Trump wore on, a quiet congressman from Wisconsin decided he&#39;d had enough of his party&#39;s ostentatious presidential frontrunner.
