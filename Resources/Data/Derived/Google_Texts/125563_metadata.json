It has a mysterious way of transforming our personalities into caricatures of their former, sober selves, or turning us into the complete opposite of the person we usually are during the day. Everyone seems to have a drunk personality \u2014 I always considered mine a hyper, dance-enthused alter ego who can channel the vocal stylings of current pop divas flawlessly. But for the first time, science has decided to step in and define the main types of drunk personalities out there, and just how many people fall into them. Turns out there are four, and after a few shots of Tequila, you may just become one of them.\n\nResearchers at the University of Missouri-Columbia, publishing their findings in the journal Addiction, Research & Theory, decided to take to the bars for their study on drunk personality, and examine the most precarious binge drinkers around: college students. Looking to 374 \u201cdrinking buddies\u201d from a Midwestern university, researchers asked students to give self-reports on their behavior both before and after drinking.\n\n\u201cSome people are known to get angry and violent, careless and irresponsible, or weepy and inconsolable when drinking, and it is often what earns them the label of being a \u2018problem drinker,\u2019\u201d the study says. \u201cHowever, until now, there has been no empirical investigation into the unique types of personality-like changes that people undergo when drinking.\u201d\n\nA noble pursuit, indeed. Researchers decided that there was more to drunk personalities than being a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d drunk, and developed four distinct personality types based on how students acted in ways of agreeableness, conscientiousness, intellect, and extraversion after imbibing all night. With a little help from pop-culture, researchers came up with some pretty creative personas that seem to fit most drinkers.\n\nThe 4 Types of Drinkers\n\nFirst, we have the heavyweights, known as \u201cThe Ernest Hemingways.\u201d Named after the famous author who was quite the lush himself, Hemingway often bragged he could \u201cdrink hells any amount of whiskey without getting drunk.\u201d Researchers say those who are considered Hemingways can drink in large quantities with little changes to their personality, maintaining most of their organizational and intellectual skills. The study found that this group represented the widest population, as 42 percent of students appeared to be just as thirsty as good, old Ernest.\n\nThe second largest category, representing 23 percent of students, was called the \u201cMr. Hyde\u201d group. This group appeared to develop an evil-twin alter-ego when they started to indulge, becoming \u201cparticularly less responsible, less intellectual, and more hostile when under the influence of alcohol.\u201d The self-proclaimed angry drunks of the group, you do not want to screw with the Mr. Hydes.\n\nIn complete contrast to Mr. Hyde, was the \u201cMary Poppins\u201d drinkers, who were formerly outgoing, sweet individuals sober, but became even more kind and happy-go-lucky after a few drinks. They constituted about 15 percent of the studied group, and were the ones most likely to complement your outfit in the bathroom.\n\nFinally, we had \u201cthe Nutty Professor\u201d category, a group amounting to about one-fifth of the study population that gave true definition to the term \u201cliquid courage.\u201d Named after the chemically-altered scholar played by Eddie Murphy, the study found that Nutty Professors were shy and introverted when sober, but would quickly shed their inhibitions after a few went down the hatch. This group represented the ones most likely to make the transformation into a social butterfly, and dance on top of the bar with reckless abandon.\n\nSo other than helping you identify which personality all of your friends will become this Friday night, what was the purpose of this study? Lead researcher Rachel Winograd, a PhD student in clinical psychology at the University of Missouri-Columbia, offers a very good answer.\n\n\u201cI think what is a more immediate clinical utility of this research is putting in a language how we are when drunk,\u201d she said. When we are able to do this, Winograd explains, we develop terms to help guide interventions for those abusing alcohol, and possibly struggling with alcohol-related addiction.\n\nSource: Winograd R, Steinley D, Sher K, et al.
