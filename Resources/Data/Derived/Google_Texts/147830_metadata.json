The Huskies were dominant throughout this year's tournament, beating opponents by an average of more than 37 points.\n\nSo with UConn winning over Notre Dame by only 10 points, it was a more even match -- and an exciting one to watch.\n\nThousands of students gathered at Gampel Pavillion in Storrs to watch the game, and freshman Mike Esposito was happy to see it was closer than usual. It is the third straight national championship for the team.\n\n\"Everyone was so into it. I feel like more people would have left if it was a thirty-point game like it usually is,\" he said.\n\nSophomore Gabriela Morales said that UConn's victory made her proud as a woman. She joined her friends to celebrate the win after the game outside the UConn Student Union.\n\n\"Once you know you're going to win, you're just heart starts accelerating, and you just want to jump and scream. It's just a good moment. This is only experienced in college, nothing else,\" she said.\n\nBut on WNPR's Where We Live, Colin McEnroe realized that Connecticut has a problem when it comes to basketball vocabulary. \"A ten-point win is not a close game. It's just not a close game,\" he said. \"Dayton did not put a scare into Connecticut. Connecticut won that game by 20 points or more.\"\n\nListen to Colin McEnroe try to explain this:\n\nA \"victory lap\" has been scheduled for 5:00 pm on Wednesday to welcome the UConn women's team back to Storrs.\n\nTucker Ives contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Sports", "description": "The UConn women's basketball team won its tenth national championship on Tuesday night.
