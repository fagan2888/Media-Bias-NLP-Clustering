Even with a modest selection of writings, the volume runs more than 600 pages and is a daunting, sprawling read. Mailer managed to have a few words for almost every topic and was unafraid\u2014and thickheaded enough\u2014to comment on whatever he saw fit. This led to some rather peculiar essays but also some profound meditations on what it means to be a citizen, an American, and a human.\n\nMailer\u2019s name is always bandied about when people talk about the great American intellectuals of the 20th century. Growing up, I never read The Executioner\u2019s Song, or any of his other works, but I knew who Norman Mailer was. He epitomized the idea of a \u201cpublic intellectual,\u201d a person who struggled with the great issues of our time, someone who could interact with the academy as well as with people on the street. While he was clearly kind of a bastard (he once stabbed his wife with a penknife), and some of his opinions were quite offensive (he had a low opinion of feminism, to put it kindly, and coined \u201cwhite negro\u201d), even for his time, he existed in the public sphere in a way no one really does anymore.\n\nWho occupies that space now? The late Christopher Hitchens? He may have been the last of his kind, and I\u2019m unsure if even he had the same ubiquity as Mailer. Yet I couldn\u2019t think of another recent example. More importantly, everyone I did think of missed the mark for one reason or another. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert seem like possibilities; they converse on a myriad subjects and interview politicians, writers, musicians, scientists. But I think they\u2019d shrink from the term itself. Stewart especially has argued against people trying to peg him as more than a comedian, and Colbert\u2019s ironic shtick purposefully obfuscates the entire idea of public figures. One or both of them could probably take up the mantle if they wanted, but they refuse.\n\nEconomist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman also struck me as a possibility. He\u2019s well versed in a lot of subjects, is an academic (though writes in simple prose that most people can understand), and is interested in engaging with the world. But his politics have labeled him a pundit. I\u2019ve never read Krugman on movies or science, but I expect he\u2019d have interesting things to say. Yet he\u2019s well aware his columns on the Republican Party or the president get more views, and that must impact his choice of topics. Krugman is a political essayist, and is saddled with the baggage that comes with such a distinction.\n\n\n\nOne of the primary reasons public intellectuals no longer exist (and the reason Krugman isn\u2019t one) is this specialization. Writers, especially those on the Internet, have their little fiefdoms, and that\u2019s about it. Typically when writers stray outside of their supposed comfort zone, it doesn\u2019t go well (independent of whether they actually write an effective argument on the topic). Gawker ran into this problem earlier this year, when Adrian Chen wrote that George Saunders needed to \u201cwrite a goddamned novel already.\u201d Chen was rightfully savaged for having a ridiculous argument, but his gumption is admirable. Gawker is, first and foremost, a gossip site, where snark is key, yet it posts the occasional well-reported piece. It\u2019s not a place for literary criticism, and I don\u2019t think Chen managed to convince anyone it should be. But I\u2019m glad he tried. So why does Gawker have to be specialized in this way? The only real reason is because its audience expects a certain kind of writing there, and would react badly to such a change-up.\n\nBacklash happens all the time, especially when authors and artists can so easily express their opinions through social media. When Jonathan Meiburg, the lead singer for Shearwater, recently wrote a Facebook status in support of the Affordable Care Act, he was told to \u201cstick to music.\u201d Does Meiburg\u2019s profession make him somehow ineligible to publicly comment? It\u2019s become so easy to qualify different voices on the Internet that when they stray from their assigned role, they become suspect. And yet, everyone is now free to comment on whatever they want\u2014one of the many strange ironies our new social world has created.\n\nThis ability to comment on everything is the other major reason we\u2019re in an era where public intellectuals can\u2019t exist. This is an age where opinion has been democratized completely. Anyone can have a blog. In a sense, anyone on the Internet has an opportunity to become a public intellectual.\n\nIt may be tempting to turn this into some kind of elitist statement: There\u2019s too much noise on the Internet for the thoughtful voices to come through; the great minds will never find an audience. Aside from being insulting, that\u2019s simply not true. Someone will surely take me to task for this essay, and will do so cogently, making points I completely missed. That doesn\u2019t undercut me as a writer; it expands the conversation, bringing a plurality of viewpoints instead of just one.\n\nSo that\u2019s the trade-off, and it\u2019s not a bad one, really. We might not get any more Mailers, but now everyone can talk about anything. True, many people will never actually learn about the topics they debate, and instead regurgitate talking points or launching personal attacks. But if Mind Of An Outlaw is any indication, Mailer didn\u2019t always do his homework, and there\u2019s still a prestigious writing prize named after him. Not all insight needs to come from an expert, something to remember the next time someone on Gawker writes about books, or a favorite artist says something political. It\u2019s also something I\u2019ll try to keep in mind the next time I\u2019m getting pummeled in the comments section.", "article_metadata": {"description": "", "og": {"url": "http://www.avclub.com/article/do-public-intellectuals-exist-anymore-200644", "image": "http://i.onionstatic.com/avclub/5006/66/16x9/1200.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Earlier this year, six years after Norman Mailer\u2019s death, Random House released a collection of the writer\u2019s essays, Mind Of An Outlaw, which represents more than 60 years\u2019 work.
