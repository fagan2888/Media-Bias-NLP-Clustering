Osiris Therapeutics Inc. /quotes/zigman/102500/delayed /quotes/nls/osir OSIR jumped 10% after beating earnings estimates and revenue for the fourth quarter.

The specialist in finding treatments via stem cells sold the rights to its marquee stem-cell drug, Prochymal, during the quarter in a deal worth up to $100 million. Osiris realized a gain of $47.2 million from the sale during the period.

Without it, though, Osiris still would have reported a net profit for the period. The company said net income for the quarter was $49.9 million, or $1.44 a share, swinging from a loss of $2.65 million, or 8 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet expected no income for the quarter. Income from continuing operations was 11 cents a share.

Revenue during the quarter was $8.08 million against last year’s $2.94 million. That also came in ahead of FactSet’s forecast of $7.5 million.

Shares were up $1.56 to $17.04 in recent action.
