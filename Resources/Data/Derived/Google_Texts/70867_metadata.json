The CDC report found heroin overdose deaths were on the rise in the Midwest, including here in Indiana.\n\nThe national report also found in 2013 that most deaths from the highly addictive drug occurred among white men, ages 18 to 44.\n\nThe Indiana State Department of Health says its statewide numbers match the national trend, with an increase of nearly three times the number of heroin related deaths since 2010.\n\nCounties are trying to fight that growth. Marion County had 154 heroin overdose deaths last year and Tippecanoe County had seven heroin overdoses in the past two weeks, five of which were fatal.\n\n\u201cThese are street drugs that people are getting from who knows. So you don\u2019t know what\u2019s in there, what it\u2019s cut with (and) what the concentration is,\u201d said Rochelle.\n\nTippecanoe County Coroner Donna Avolt says it is a trend we can not afford to ignore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a segment of society that we would prefer not to think about, but it\u2019s crossing all borders. It truly is,\u201d Avolt said.\n\nA drug called Narcan combats the effect of heroin. In 2014, Indianapolis EMS administered it twice as often as in 2013.\n\nRochelle calls it a miracle drug, but only if the signs of overdose are recognized before it is too late.\n\n\u201cAny time you have anyone that\u2019s unconscious (and) you\u2019re unable to arouse them? Definitely call 911,\u201d he said.\n\nIndianapolis EMS has treated 135 heroin overdoses this year.\n\nThey hope that public awareness of the dangers of heroin will help reduce the trend.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indianapolis EMS has treated 135 heroin overdoses this year.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wish", "og": {"site_name": "WISH-TV", "description": "Indianapolis EMS has treated 135 heroin overdoses this year.", "title": "Heroin use and overdoses on the rise in Indiana", "url": "http://wishtv.com/2015/03/09/heroin-use-and-overdoses-on-the-rise-in-indiana/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwish.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/heroin4-e1425728446527.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Indianapolis EMS has treated 135 heroin overdoses this year.", "title": "Heroin use and overdoses on the rise in Indiana", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwish.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/heroin4-e1425728446527.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WISH_TV", "site": "wish_tv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488524387", "fb": {"pages": 51020120862}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WISH-TV", "google-site-verification": "-0bIsWnsWP_Tti2P_v5CM_6E-Jif4gWmQWQHbxcE9q4", "keywords": "Marion County, Local News, News, Top Video, Abby Llorico", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wishtv", "published_time": "2015-03-09T23:11:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-09T23:11:54+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wishtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/3eda613633012e4513b3dffff2e4b0bc?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda26\"", "article_summary": "The CDC report found heroin overdose deaths were on the rise in the Midwest, including here in Indiana.\nMarion County had 154 heroin overdose deaths last year and Tippecanoe County had seven heroin overdoses in the past two weeks, five of which were fatal.\nIndianapolis EMS has treated 135 heroin overdoses this year.\nHeroin (WISH Photo, file)INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) \u2013 A new federal health report reveals that across the country the rates for heroin-related deaths have tripled since 2010.\nThe Indiana State Department of Health says its statewide numbers match the national trend, with an increase of nearly three times the number of heroin related deaths since 2010."}
