It\u2019s not unlike what\u2019s happening to employer-based insurance, which is how about half of all Americans get health care coverage.\n\n\n\nThis week on Florida Matters (Tuesday, Nov. 17 at 6:30 p.m. and Sunday, Nov. 22 at 6:30 p.m.), we talk about narrowing provider networks, increasing out-of-pocket costs and the challenges of finding the uninsured in a state that has led in sign-ups under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWe are joined by Florida Covering Kids & Families Program Director Jodi Ray, Tampa health insurance agent Eric Brown and WUSF News Director and Health News Florida Editor Mary Shedden.\n\nMiss the broadcast? Listen to the show here.\n\nJODI RAY: Now (in year three), we really have to focus on those folks that don\u2019t necessarily get their information in the most traditional ways, and folks that need their information in other languages. Maybe they\u2019re not sitting on the Internet all the time, or those young adults that have a tendency to be resistant to seeing the value in having health insurance, so we really have to push the messaging out that those are folks that need it more than ever.\n\nThey have special needs that as growing adults could be met by having health care coverage, those preventive services are going to be really important to those young adults that are starting out on their own that don\u2019t necessarily have those stable incomes, where an unexpected health care issue could really dismantle their stability financially.\n\nCARSON COOPER: Now, Eric Brown, President Barack Obama told WUSF News that it\u2019s becoming more difficult to find people who are uninsured, and admittedly, there are a lot more people with insurance these days. But do you sense that might be the reason? You can\u2019t sign up more people because most people have already signed up for something.\n\nERIC BROWN: I see the biggest issues is education. What happens is, I was talking to one of the major health carriers here in Florida, and their premiums went up over 10 percent, and I asked them why. And they said because now, people now with major medical insurance are still using the emergency room, and that drives up cost when that occurs.\n\nSo I said, 'Well, what are you going to do about it?' He said, 'Well, we\u2019re just going to raise the premiums, and we\u2019re going to not offer as many plans as we did last year.' I said, 'Well, to me, that\u2019s an opportunity to educate people about what they have, and how to use it, versus raising the premiums again.'\n\nSo, I see education, not just on the individual side, also on group health insurance. Same thing. Employers \u2013 one of their major difficulties is when they offer plans to their employees, the employees don\u2019t understand what they have, and lots of times, when it\u2019s time for them to use the plan, they\u2019ll end up having financial problems because they don\u2019t what they purchased at the time.\n\nCOOPER: Mary Shedden?\n\nMARY SHEDDEN: The key question, I think, for consumers -- the people getting the plans -- is sometimes we\u2019re not getting options. Maybe our company is giving us what we have. I think the thing you need to be asking is questions, not just at enrollment time. Many folks right now in employer-based plans, they\u2019ve already signed up for the coming year, but I think it\u2019s really important to be engaged throughout the year, especially when you\u2019re dealing with out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThose deductibles \u2013 I think more and more people are just assuming, oh, I\u2019m going to get this procedure here. I think consumers need to be really aware that the insurance providers, they\u2019re trying to make the math work. And because of that, there are changes and you need to make sure your practitioner is covered (and that) the treatment is the best cost option for you.\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford a $2,000 MRI, you need to make a few phone calls before you get that procedure done. ...I think the best thing that\u2019s happened since the Affordable Care Act came out. I think consumers across the board are smarter, but they need to get even more educated.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/florida-matters-health-insurance-changes-2016", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201511/456393079.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Florida Matters: Health Insurance Changes For 2016"}, "story_id": 456306364, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "author": "Lottie Watts, Mary Shedden, Carson Cooper", "org_id": 671, "dc": {"title": "Florida Matters: Health Insurance Changes For 2016"}, "nid": 12697, "datePublished": "2015-11-17", "keywords": "Understanding Obamacare, HealthCare.gov", "wordCount": 858, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "We are joined by Florida Covering Kids & Families Program Director Jodi Ray, Tampa health insurance agent Eric Brown and WUSF News Director and Health News Florida Editor Mary Shedden.\nIt\u2019s not unlike what\u2019s happening to employer-based insurance, which is how about half of all Americans get health care coverage.\nSo, I see education, not just on the individual side, also on group health insurance.\nI think consumers need to be really aware that the insurance providers, they\u2019re trying to make the math work.\nEnrollment is under way for plans on HealthCare.gov for the third year, and consumers are seeing many changes in the plans companies are offering."}
