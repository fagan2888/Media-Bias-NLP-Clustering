(AP) - Ryan Fitzpatrick has sensed a change in how his New York Jets teammates are treating him lately.\n\nHe\u2019s the starting quarterback now, so wide receivers such as Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker know it\u2019s time to buddy up a bit to the guy who\u2019ll be throwing them the ball the rest of training camp.\n\n\u201cThose guys are a little more friendly to me now,\u201d Fitzpatrick joked Saturday while managing a straight face. \u201cIf I have something in my beard, they\u2019ll hand me a napkin, rather than laughing. They\u2019ll get me water if I need it. That kind of stuff.\n\n\u201cLife\u2019s a little bit easier in that regard.\u201d\n\nAll kidding aside, Fitzpatrick was thrust into the starting spot when Geno Smith\u2019s jaw was broken by a punch from then-teammate Ikemefuna Enemkpali. The Jets are trying to move forward with Smith out 6-10 weeks, and hoping Fitzpatrick slides right into the role as the leader of the offense.\n\nFitzpatrick played just one series in the preseason-opening 23-3 loss at Detroit on Thursday night, going 2 of 3 for 16 yards and guiding New York to its only points. The goal now is for Fitzpatrick to try to get better acquainted with the playmakers on the offense. He hadn\u2019t gotten much work all offseason with the starters, so the next few weeks before the regular season will be crucial.\n\n\u201cSometimes we use that word \u2018chemistry,\u2019 but it\u2019s just going out there and practicing and doing your best,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cSo the good thing is Ryan is a smart guy and he really sees the field well. I think the adjustment will be easy for all of us, but it\u2019s going to definitely take some time.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick looked awfully comfortable running things near the end of practice, when the Jets were working in situational drills. The offense needed eight points to tie and the clock was down to 6 seconds from inside the 10-yard line.\n\nWith a blitz coming from the starting defense, Fitzpatrick stepped up in the pocket and zipped a pass to Decker running a slant for a score. Moments later, Fitzpatrick found Marshall all alone in the corner of the end zone for the tying 2-point conversion.\n\n\u201cPlenty of good, plenty of bad that we can work on from this practice,\u201d Fitzpatrick said, \u201cbut it\u2019s fun being out there and being able to have the discussions and getting the reps.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick has been in this situation before - for most of his NFL career, in fact. He has regularly stepped in as the starter in several of his stops, and the fact he\u2019s well-versed in offensive coordinator Chan Gailey\u2019s system is a huge bonus.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s familiar with the offense,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cSo, there\u2019s no learning curve for him, if that makes any sense.\u201d\n\nIt certainly does. And it was one of the major reasons the Jets acquired Fitzpatrick from Houston in the offseason.\n\nFitzpatrick ran Gailey\u2019s offense for three seasons in Buffalo, and had arguably the best stretch of his career during that time. He threw for at least 3,000 yards and 23 touchdowns in all three seasons.\n\n\u201cHe was the quarterback up there and he ran the show up there,\u201d cornerback Darrelle Revis said. \u201cHe\u2019s very experienced, a very smart quarterback. If his options aren\u2019t there, he usually checks the ball down. That\u2019s Ryan for you.\u201d\n\nSmith was having a solid camp, and appeared to have a good grasp on the starting job. Even on the morning of the incident, Gailey raved about the progress Smith had made since minicamp in June. But the fact general manager Mike Maccagnan went out and got an experienced veteran such as Fitzpatrick made the loss of Smith sting just a little less.\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, we still have to put the work in,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cIt makes it easier in the sense that I know what we need to do and how we need to get there. I know what path we need to take, but there\u2019s still a lot of hard work ahead of us to get there.\u201d\n\nThat means learning the tendencies of guys such as Marshall, and keeping the lines of communication open. Fitzpatrick said there\u2019s already a \u201cdecent comfort level,\u201d and expects it to only get better with four weeks to go before the regular-season opener at home against Cleveland.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a question that I have about why he\u2019s running a route a certain way, if there\u2019s a definitive way I want him to run his route, then we\u2019re going to talk about it,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell him where I stand and he\u2019s got enough experience where I\u2019m going to listen to him a lot of the time, too, but that\u2019s part of it. It\u2019s not just the reps out there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sitting back and talking about reps we had or watching other guys go and say how would you run that and what would your depth be? That\u2019s going to be a lot of the chemistry as well.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ryan Fitzpatrick has sensed a change in how his New York Jets teammates are treating him lately.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ryan Fitzpatrick has sensed a change in how his New York Jets teammates are treating him lately.", "title": "Fitzpatrick\u2019s familiarity with offense has Jets confident", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/15/fitzpatricks-familiarity-with-offense-has-jets-con/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/15/a2e6cd085f6f0a247f0f6a706700c98d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/15/a2e6cd085f6f0a247f0f6a706700c98d.jpg", "description": "Ryan Fitzpatrick has sensed a change in how his New York Jets teammates are treating him lately.", "card": "summary", "title": "Fitzpatrick\u2019s familiarity with offense has Jets confident"}, "Author": "DENNIS WASZAK Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s familiar with the offense,\u201d Marshall said.\nThe Jets are trying to move forward with Smith out 6-10 weeks, and hoping Fitzpatrick slides right into the role as the leader of the offense.\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J.
