Not unless he is a dead Republican.\n\nDead Republicans are held up as examples of moderation who wouldn\u2019t fit in today\u2019s extremist party. Goldwater, Nixon and Reagan, once damned as deranged extremists lusting to blow up the planet, are temporarily rehabilitated and compared unfavorably to today\u2019s Republicans and favorably to today\u2019s Democrats.\n\nFrom such exercises in posthumous political rehabilitation, we learn that Reagan was more like Obama and that whichever Republican has drawn the ire of the media this month is the rebirth of segregationist Democrats like Albert Gore Sr and Robert Byrd.\n\nThe good Republican who has the bad taste to stay alive will only enjoy a temporary vacation in the good graces of the media. It does not matter how often he pays fealty to global warming, gun control, gay marriage and amnesty for illegal aliens, or his willingness to appear on morning shows to bemoan the extremism of the Tea Party; the time will come when he will be dragged out of the Saturday Night Live studio and the CNN green room, hung from a tree and beaten with a stick for the enlightenment of the people.\n\nThere is no help for it.\n\nThe good Republican is the living exception that proves the rule that all other Republicans exist only to take food stamps out of the mouths of welfare recipients when they aren\u2019t randomly pointing at maps and bombing countries. His job is to agree with the mainstream media on every important issue, but is allowed to maintain his \u2018pragmatic\u2019 credentials with occasional decorative budget cuts that are vociferously protested by activist groups more for the publicity than because of their negligible impact.\n\nAnd then one day, suddenly, the good Republican who has held all the right opinions, is pounced on, beaten, bloodied and dragged through the mud. At innumerable sweaty press conferences held to apologize for some sin that wouldn\u2019t even make the last minute of the evening news if it were carried out by a member of the progressive club in good standing, the former media darling wonders why this is happening to him. It is happening to him because the left doesn\u2019t believe in exceptions to its rules.\n\nThe good Republican thought that he had made peace with the left. All he ever had was a temporary truce of mutual convenience that ended once he moved from convenient to competitor.\n\nIn the last two elections, the bloodthirsty neo-confederate party of hate served up a liberal Republican, currently championing Obama\u2019s illegal alien amnesty, and a liberal Republican, currently being blamed by Obama supporters for inspiring ObamaCare. Its fantasy candidate for the upcoming election had spent the last election hugging Obama, and then signed off on tuition for illegal aliens and banned gay conversion therapy, and was, until a few weeks ago, being praised as the ultimate good Republican; only to be subjected to the same ritual media humiliations as McCain and Romney.\n\nThe same media that insisted that the murder of four Americans in Benghazi was not a scandal and that the murder of Brian Terry in Operation Fast and Furious was not a scandal is bleating that a little traffic is a scandal. Not a little traffic in assault rifles, as in Fast and Furious, but in the distance between cars.\n\nDuring the government shutdown, Obama escalated his political war with Congress by barricading war memorials, shutting down private parks and shuttering private restaurants.\n\nSenior citizens were left homeless when they were evicted from cabins on Federal land and inns were forcibly shut down by park rangers who were deployed to keep watch to see that no one went inside. Joggers on Federal land were given tickets and veterans were barred from entering their own memorials. When a group of elderly tourists tried to take a photo of Yellowstone erupting, armed rangers showed up to bellow at them that they were illegally \u201crecreating\u201d.\n\nA park ranger admitted to the Washington Times, \u201cWe've been told to make life as difficult for people as we can.\u201d If Christie was indeed responsible for Bridgegate, he was only following in Obama\u2019s footsteps.\n\nBut no one in the national media thought Shutdowngate was worth commenting on. It wasn\u2019t as if it involved something as grave and serious as New Jersey traffic.\n\nA senior Hillary adviser had orchestrated a Gore primary win by sending the environmental activist\u2019s motorcade to tie up traffic to prevent Bradley voters from reaching the polls. But that was New Hampshire traffic which is in a whole different moral universe than New Jersey traffic.\n\nThere are two wholly different sets of rules for the left and right sides of the political interstate.\n\nIn the last election, Mitt Romney had been dubbed a gaffe-prone idiot for expressing concerns about security at the London Olympics, which was then in a shambles, while Obama\u2019s belief that Austrian was a language and that the country he was aspiring to lead had 57 states were put down to tiredness.\n\nAccording to the media, a gaffe is something that a Republican says. A scandal is something that a Republican does.\n\nThere are two lanes of political traffic in the media. One is reserved for the left and the other for everyone to the right of the left.\n\nThe good Republican imagines that if he is decently centrist enough, he will be allowed to drive on the luxurious wide lane to the left where all traffic violations are forgiven and there is no speed limit, but unfortunately for him, he is still stuck in the same right lane as Michele Bachmann, Allen West and all the other enemies of the state where driving at any speed is considered an unsafe traffic violation.\n\nIn a country where the center is defined by the institutions of the left, the center ceases to exist. That center which the good Republican strives for is a mirage made of moonbeams and shifting goal posts.\n\nGood Republicans don\u2019t win elections. No \u201cmoderate\u201d Republican has made it through two terms in office since Eisenhower in the fifties. Ike\u2019s vice president was impeached and his vice president\u2019s vice president lost to Jimmy Carter. George H.W. Bush, a centrist figure, lost to Bill Clinton, while his son, who was mocked by the progressive intelligentsia as a warmongering chimp, got his full two terms.\n\nIn a radical country, the good Republican has no future. The Mensheviks did not survive the Bolsheviks and the good Republicans will not survive the Democracy Alliance, the Center for American Progress and the whole leftist network weaving its web around the Democratic Party and the rest of the country.\n\nThis is no country for good Republicans, for good government pragmatists and for centrists and liberals. To the left, a good Republican isn\u2019t someone who shares their views on gay marriage, abortion, global warming and gun control. The only good Republican to the left is a dead or disgraced Republican.\n\nFreedom Center pamphlets now available on Kindle: Click here.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Chris Christie learns the hard way: To the Left, there is no such thing as a good Republican.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Chris Christie learns the hard way: To the Left, there is no such thing as a good Republican.", "title": "No Country for Liberal Republicans", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/215210/no-country-liberal-republicans-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:39:58-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/215210/no-country-liberal-republicans-daniel-greenfield", "description": "Chris Christie learns the hard way: To the Left, there is no such thing as a good Republican.", "card": "summary", "title": "No Country for Liberal Republicans"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-12T19:38:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:39:58-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6bd\"", "article_summary": "This is no country for good Republicans, for good government pragmatists and for centrists and liberals.\nIn a radical country, the good Republican has no future.\nGood Republicans don\u2019t win elections.\nTo the left, a good Republican isn\u2019t someone who shares their views on gay marriage, abortion, global warming and gun control.\nIn a country where the center is defined by the institutions of the left, the center ceases to exist."}
