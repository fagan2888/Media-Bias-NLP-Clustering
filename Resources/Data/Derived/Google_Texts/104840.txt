My grandma will probably read this article via her Salon app, on her iPhone, and then she might send me an approving Snapchat.

Most grandmas are probably not quite as tech savvy as my dear Bubbe, however, there are quite a few grandparents on social media, including Facebook.

Or should I say there are quite a few grandpas and Grandmaster Flashes on Facebook.

Grandmas, it seems have accidentally been tagging themselves as the legendary DJ, and hip hop pioneer, Grandmaster Flash. There have been so many instances that there is even a Tumblr dedicated to the mixup: Love, Grampa and Grandmaster Flash.
