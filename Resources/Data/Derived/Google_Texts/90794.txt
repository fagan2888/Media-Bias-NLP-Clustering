If you have some extra holiday trash lying around the house this year, the American Waste Control and Mr. Murph are back to help with their annual "Unboxing Christmas Campaign."

Last year this campaign recycled over 4,000,000 pounds of material and they are looking to beat that number this year.

The AWC will recycle 98 percent of what is donated, but there is an added twist to this year's campaign. What cannot be recycled will be taken to Oklahoma's Waste to Energy Landfill and turned into energy.

"We're delivering a huge one-two punch in our effort to reuse and recycle Christmas waste," said Kenny Burkett, founder and owner of American Waste Control.

"Any items that we just can't process through Mr. Murph is being sent to our new waste to energy processing plant at our landfill and turned in to power. It may sound funny, but some of your Styrofoam and Christmas ribbons may just help turn on someone's lights."

Recyclables can be dropped off at over 100 Mr. Murph sites and on location at 1150 North Peoria. You can find one of the many Mr. Murph locations at feedmrmurph.com.
