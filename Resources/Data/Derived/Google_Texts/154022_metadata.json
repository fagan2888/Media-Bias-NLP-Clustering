It is expected more employees will include their same-sex partners in their health insurance policies, while at the same time more employers are likely to drop their domestic partnership benefits requiring gay employees to marry for benefits\u2014which still presents legal pitfalls to some.\n\nCBS News reported that as employers reassess their human-resources plans following the ruling, there may be a reduction in domestic partner benefits, according to Aon Hewitt, which estimates 77 percent of employers currently offer same-sex domestic partner health care coverage. Prior to the ruling, a number of employers extended these benefits because gay couples often were denied the right to marry legally. Now that marriage is legal for them nationwide, HR experts say some of those companies may drop domestic partner benefits.\n\nSome companies began tweaking their healthcare policies even before the ruling, with 37 states and the District of Columbia all legalizing gay marriage. Verizon and Delta Air Lines, according to CBS News, gave ultimatums to their employees: get married in order to retain your partner\u2019s healthcare coverage.\n\nDomestic same-sex partner benefits were created \u201cto equalize benefits for spouses and same-sex couples who couldn\u2019t get married\u201d said J.D. Piro, senior vice president and national practice leader in the Aon Hewitt Health Law Group. \u201cThe question is if it\u2019s still needed. The answer for every employer will be different.\u201d\n\nApproximately 22 percent of companies polled by The Erisa Industry Committee earlier this year reported they would drop benefits offered to domestic partners if the Supreme Court ruled in favor of gay marriage, while more than two-thirds of companies said they would keep them if the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage.\n\nScott Belsky, government relations manager at GoHealth told CBS News that under the Affordable Care Act, individuals who get dropped from a partner\u2019s health insurance plan can enroll through what\u2019s called a \u201cqualifying life event.\u201d These events allow individuals to buy health insurance through the state or federally run exchanges outside of the annual enrollment period.\n\nBut Belsky said that even before the Supreme Court ruling, some people had moved off their domestic partner\u2019s insurance plan in favor of buying an individual plan through Obamacare. \u201cThey are often getting tax credits or were finding plans that were cheaper than through\u201d their partner\u2019s workplace, he said. \u201cThat will be accelerated by the Supreme Court ruling.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just made it simpler to administer,\u201d Excellus spokesman Jim Redmond told Modern Healthcare. \u201cIt simplified and clarified the parameters of who\u2019s eligible for coverage through the company benefit.\u201d\n\nAttorney Jeff DeVree, who specializes in employee benefits with Varnum LLP, told FOX 17 News he anticipates a head-on conflict between equal protection and religious freedom. \u201cThe real question will be for religious organizations and businesses owned by people with strong religious convictions, will the Religious Freedom Restoration Act survive this ruling by the Supreme Court. State law now has to permit same-sex couples to be married; that doesn\u2019t make same-sex marriage a protected classification under employment discrimination laws.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>The SCOTUS ruling puts healthcare benefits in the spotlight.&nbsp;<em>By Christine Kern, contributing writer</em></p>", "title": "What The Same-Sex Marriage Ruling Means For Healthcare", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/c7377305/c7377305-fb37-49d8-923b-138301302948/judge_with_gavel.jpg"}, "creator": "Christine Kern", "site": "HITOutcomes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The SCOTUS ruling puts healthcare benefits in the spotlight.&nbsp;By Christine Kern, contributing writer", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "Title": "What The Same-Sex Marriage Ruling Means For Healthcare"}, "article_summary": "What The Same-Sex Marriage Ruling Means For HealthcareBy Christine Kern, contributing writerThe SCOTUS ruling puts healthcare benefits in the spotlight.\nState law now has to permit same-sex couples to be married; that doesn\u2019t make same-sex marriage a protected classification under employment discrimination laws.\u201d\nDomestic same-sex partner benefits were created \u201cto equalize benefits for spouses and same-sex couples who couldn\u2019t get married\u201d said J.D.\nSome companies began tweaking their healthcare policies even before the ruling, with 37 states and the District of Columbia all legalizing gay marriage.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states is expected to impact the use and availability of health insurance benefits."}
