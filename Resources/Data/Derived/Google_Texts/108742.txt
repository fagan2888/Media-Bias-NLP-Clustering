The Hathaway Bridge was lit up in neon Saturday night for the third annual Bras Across Bay 5K.

More than 300 runners showed off their finest neon and pink clothes to help raise breast cancer awareness and get some exercise at the same time.

The "glow run" theme was meant to have the runners stand out and remind drivers as they crossed the Hathaway to get a mammogram.

Event organizers say this has been the most successful "Bras Across Bay" yet.

"That's one of the reasons why I love living in Bay County. Everyone in this community comes out and supports, " Mandy Williamson from Magic Broadcasting said. "They support everything. Everything that we do, they're here to support it."

"Whatever we can do to bring (breast cancer) to the forefront and maybe save a life it's worth every bit of the time and effort that these guys put into it," explained Chris Green from Magic Broadcasting.

Green says more than $5,000 will be donated to National Breast Cancer Foundation.
