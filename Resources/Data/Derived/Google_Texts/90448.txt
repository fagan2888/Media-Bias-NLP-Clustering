Sioux Falls, SD

A South Dakota prison inmate at a minimum-security unit in Sioux Falls has been placed on "escape" status.



The South Dakota Department of Corrections says inmate Clint Eldeen was last seen leaving the minimum-security unit at the State Penitentiary at 6:45 p.m. Friday.



The 46-year-old Eldeen is serving two sentences for no account check, the first 30 years with 15 years suspended and the second, a consecutive 30 year sentence with 25 years suspended.



Both sentences were imposed on June 2000 in Lincoln County.



Eldeen is described as a white male with brown hair and blue eyes. He is 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs approximately 170 pounds.

If anyone sees Eldeen or knows of his whereabouts, you are urged to call the police immediately.
