Can you trust your ears?\n\nThere are many different audio illusion techniques, but the three demonstrated in the video below are the McGurk effect, Tritone paradox, and the Shepard tone. Is seeing believing? With the McGurk effect, a sound is paired with the visual component of another sound, ultimately tricking us into thinking we are hearing something else.\n\nIn the video, Greg\u2019s lips are motioning the word \u201cfar,\u201d but if you don\u2019t look at him, you\u2019ll notice he is repeatedly saying \u201cbar.\u201d If you are used to watching dubbed movies, the McGurk effect may not trick you because you have learned to ignore the motions of the speaker's mouths.\n\nThe Tritone paradox is an auditory illusion, which contains notes with high and low frequency, but our brains have a preference of which to listen to. Diana Deutsch, the creator of the Tritone paradox, says geography and location from infancy play a role in deciding which frequency you prefer.

However, our brain doesn\u2019t recognize this and it just seems like the sound is rising forever.\n\nTo test your ears even more, check out How Old Are Your Ears?
