Over 50 percent of every group surveyed had a less-than-favorable opinion of Trump, including white males and those without a college degree.\n\nTrump unfavorables:\n\n\n\nNon-college whites 52%\n\nWhite men 51%\n\nWhite women 68%\n\nConservatives 53%\n\nModerates 75% pic.twitter.com/uHKxJSNZu5 \u2014 Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) April 1, 2016\n\nThese numbers are simply amazing. Trump is viewed unfavorably by at least 80 percent of some of the groups that Republican strategists had hoped the GOP might improve among: young voters and Latinos. He\u2019s viewed unfavorably by three out of four moderates. That GOP autopsy into what went wrong in 2012 has been torn to shreds and scattered to the winds from the top of Trump Tower.\n\nIt's especially surprising to see how Trump's numbers among non-college graduates have tanked. After all, it wasn't too long ago that he was proclaiming his love for the poorly educated.\n\nDespite his overwhelming lead in delegates, Trump has still not received a majority of votes in any state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not good. .05/27/2016 8:42:34AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Not good.", "title": "Trump's Unfavorability Ratings Are Out of Control", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/04/01/trumps-unfavorability-ratings-are-out-of-control-n2141965", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/91/2016-03-31T030511Z_1_LYNXNPEC2U065_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Not good.", "title": "Trump's Unfavorability Ratings Are Out of Control", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/04/01/trumps-unfavorability-ratings-are-out-of-control-n2141965", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/91/2016-03-31T030511Z_1_LYNXNPEC2U065_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Trump's Unfavorability Ratings Are Out of Control, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s viewed unfavorably by three out of four moderates.\nOver 50 percent of every group surveyed had a less-than-favorable opinion of Trump, including white males and those without a college degree.\nA new poll shows that an impressive number of Americans from a wide variety of demographics have an unfavorable opinion of Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.\nTrump unfavorables:Non-college whites 52%White men 51%White women 68%Conservatives 53%Moderates 75% pic.twitter.com/uHKxJSNZu5 \u2014 Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) April 1, 2016These numbers are simply amazing.\nIt's especially surprising to see how Trump's numbers among non-college graduates have tanked."}
