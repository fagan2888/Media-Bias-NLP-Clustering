FARMER CITY – The Blue Ridge school district has lost $1.1 million in general state aid funding from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2014, and more losses are expected.

“In the best of years budget projections are a wild guess,” Superintendent Susan Wilson said. “This year it is fairly close to fiction.”

Wilson said there is a lot of information lacking from the state, including unknowns in respect to the general state aid formula, the proration percentage of categorical funding, affordable care act requirements and more. Another unknown is pension payment responsibility, as legislation to curb pension costs was recently shot down in the courts.

Wilson said the state finance department is suggesting an 89 percent proration of fund projections, but she has heard rumors from various sources that said they could go as low as 70 percent.

“That would be catastrophic,” she said. “But really no one knows.”

The current budget projection has the number at 89 percent, which would mean a loss of $189,000 in fiscal year 2016.

In regard to the $1.1 million five-year shortfall, Wilson said that it’s the students that are affected.

“That’s a lot of money. That’s a lot of teaching, that’s a lot of programs for our kids,” she said.

In 2008, the district received $1,914,197 in general state aid, and that number decreased to $739,677 in 2014. The enrollment did drop by about 60 in that time but is trending upward in the past year.

Local EAV land value growth is anticipated at 2 percent in the current projection, Wilson said.

Fund balances in all of the district’s funds are expected to decrease drastically by 2018, and Wilson said if the trend continues, the district could move from “recognition” financial status to “review” for FY15 and forward.

A working class balance sits at about $673,000, and is expected to grow to about $881,400 by 2018. The money is untouched right now and can be transferred into education, operations and maintenance, and transportation funds if necessary down the road.

Wilson said they will ideally not be spent until the district is in dire straits, as they protect the district from other state funding unknowns.

“Even though that seems like a big number, when you take a $10 million budget you’re not even talking 10 percent,” Board President Justin Otto said.

Wilson said in many months expenditures reach $800,000.

“What we’re really looking at is a savings account balance of a little over a month of expenditures,” she said.

Peculiarly, transportation fund revenues are expected to spike on the year, and Wilson said she would investigate that increase further. She noted average daily attendance and other factors could mean the increase.
