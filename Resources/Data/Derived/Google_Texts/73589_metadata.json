Political allies including Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and libertarian political scientist Charles Murray are slated to speak, according to conservatives familiar with the Koch network.\n\nThe energy initiative is being created under the umbrella of the largest Koch network nonprofit in apparent response to a number of developments: the commitment by liberal billionaire Tom Steyer to steer $100 million into ads in several states to make climate change a priority issue in the elections; numerous setbacks at the state level where Koch network backed advocacy groups have been fighting against renewable energy standards; and the new EPA regulations to curb carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.\n\nThe meeting will cap a frenetic fundraising season for the conservative donor network. This year the Koch network not only hosted a similar January conference, but several smaller gatherings in Palm Springs, Newport Beach, St. Louis, and other locales to attract new donors, according to an email from Koch fundraising honcho Kevin Gentry obtained by The Daily Beast In his email, Gentry called the Palm Springs event\u2014 which drew some 50 wealthy conservatives in March \u2014a \u201chighly successful recruitment reception\u201d and encouraged other veteran donors to get involved by holding local gatherings in their areas.\n\nKoch network operatives also have held periodic conference calls\u2014sometimes with members of Congress on the line\u2014to update loyal check writers on various issues and keep them in the fold, say conservative sources.\n\nNow, hitting the $290 million goal seems within reach: almost $170 million of that total was pledged at the last big Koch donor seminar in January this year, say two conservative sources. The hefty haul will help fund a mix of politically active nonprofits like the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity, and a newer outfit called the Libre Initiative that\u2019s aimed at appealing to Hispanics with a small government, free-market message. AFP alone is expected to spend upwards of $125 million this year on a variety of political and advocacy projects including air and ground operations, according to Politico.\n\nBy comparison, in the 2012 presidential cycle, the Koch donor network raised more than $400 million to help underwrite 17 politically active nonprofit groups\u2014including AFP and Libre Initiative\u2014 according to The Washington Post.\n\nA few Koch network-backed nonprofit groups including AFP have long fought against climate change regulations, a carbon tax, and subsidies for renewable energy. But lately, the Koch universe seem to be facing bigger energy threats stemming from Washington, state governments and big liberal checkbooks.\n\nThe new energy initiative is the handiwork of Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the Koch network\u2019s central fundraising hub, which was established in late 2011 as a trade group, according to an email to the group\u2019s members from Gentry. In 2012, the fledgling group \u2014which claims some 200 members who each kick in at least $100,000 yearly\u2014 funneled over $230 million dollars to numerous other non-profits in the Koch ecosystem according to the group\u2019s 2012 tax returns.\n\nIn an April 1 missive, Gentry invited Freedom Partners members to join an upcoming conference call about a \u201csignificant new Freedom Partners initiative\u201d which he touted as one that would \u201cdrive the national narrative around energy and the tremendous benefits of reliable affordable energy for all Americans, especially for the less fortunate.\u201d The email indicated that discussions about the energy project began last summer at another Koch donor event in New Mexico, which drew outgoing House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Rep. Paul Ryan among others.\n\nGentry\u2019s email stressed that liberal donors, led by hedge fund billionaire Tom Steyer, have plans to spend as much as $100 million on climate change issues and ads to make it a top-tier issue in the election. He noted that environmental groups had recently run a $5 million \u201cclean energy\u201d ad blitz in Iowa, Michigan, and North Carolina, all of which are considered \u201cfocus\u201d states for Freedom Partners and among the states where Americans for Prosperity has spent over $35 million on attack ads against Democratic Senate candidates on Obamacare.\n\nIn a chagrined-sounding PS, Gentry opined that the \u201cnew multi million dollar campaign by environmentalists is arguably an effort to distract from the failures of Obamacare. But you and I know energy is a critically important issue for the United States.\u201d\n\nThe details and scope of the new energy initiative, which has not been announced, aren\u2019t clear yet, but it\u2019s expected to cost in the seven figures and be a topic at the Koch donor conference this weekend\u2014 especially in light of the Obama administration\u2019s newly unveiled EPA regulations to curb carbon emissions from mostly coal fired power plants. Two sources familiar with Koch donor world told The Daily Beast that a new nonprofit group is being formed to help run the new energy initiative. Neither spokesmen for Freedom Partners or Koch Industries responded to requests for comment about the new initiative or fundraising efforts this year.\n\nThe Koch brothers combined net worth exceeds $80 billion, according to Forbes magazine, and is derived from their control of Koch Industries, the eponymous energy and manufacturing conglomerate\n\nBased on Gentry\u2019s email and recent energy drives by other Koch network groups, the initiative is likely to mix a minimalist regulatory and free-market message with a pro-consumer spin.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

In these fights the conservative nonprofits have often portrayed renewable mandates as very expensive for consumers, a point that\u2019s frequently been rebutted by independent groups.\n\nEven in Kansas, the home of Koch Industries, the Koch-backed advocacy network failed to repeal the state\u2019s renewable standards, which were enacted in 2009 Under Kansas\u2019 Renewable Portfolio Standard, 20 percent of the state\u2019s electricity is supposed to come from renewables by the year 2020.\n\nThe Kansas fight suggests part of the strategy that Koch-linked groups are expected to pursue to broaden their message and try to appeal to consumers. Alan Cobb, a former lobbyist for the company who also did stints with AFP and Freedom Partners, was hired this spring by the newly created Kansas Senior Consumer Alliance, which sent thousands of postcards to elderly citizens criticizing the renewable standards. The postcards, with pictures of worried-looking seniors opening their mail, said that there had been 15 rate hikes since 2009 when the renewable standards were enacted and urged seniors to contact their representatives to protest them.\n\nA state commission has found less than 2 percent of recent rate increases can be attributed to the renewable standards.\n\nGroups backed by the Koch network in several other states have also been rebuffed in their drives against renewables. But in late May, in a rare victory, Ohio Governor John Kasich signed off on a two-year freeze on the Buckeye State\u2019s renewable energy and energy efficiency requirements.\n\nOn the 2014 electoral front, other Koch donor supported non-profit groups like the American Energy Alliance (AEA) have poured funds into ads targeting Democrats in close Senate and House races, knocking their opposition to building the Keystone XL pipeline. In May, the AEA spent over $400,000 on ads in Colorado attacking Sen. Mark Udall for his stance opposing the Keystone pipeline. AEA, which is run by former Koch Industries lobbyist Tom Pyle, has also been fighting to end wind energy subsidies. Last year, Congress ended a two-decade old tax credit for wind energy companies after vigorous lobbying by Koch-backed groups including AEA and AFP. This year, the groups have continued to fight against attempts to revive the credit.\n\nThe fight over climate change took a personal twist this spring when Tom Steyer challenged the Koch brothers to a debate about the issue and whether more regulations are needed to curb man-made pollution. The Koch brothers turned down the invitation. In an email to a local Kansas paper, Koch spokesperson Melissa Cohlmia explained \u201cwe are not experts on climate change.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Koch Brothers, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201406131905, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Koch Brothers, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Koch Brothers Make Climate Activists New Target", "tags": "entity:person/koch-brothers,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The Koch brothers\u2019 financial network is planning on spending almost $300 million in the 2014 election, including a new anti-environment effort.", "title": "Koch Brothers Unveil New Strategy at Big Donor Retreat", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/13/koch-brothers-make-climate-activists-new-target.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/06/13/koch-brothers-make-climate-activists-new-target/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1402698998332.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "The Koch brothers\u2019 financial network is planning on spending almost $300 million in the 2014 election, including a new anti-environment effort.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Peter Stone", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-06-13T19:05:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/peter-stonehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/06/13/koch-brothers-make-climate-activists-new-target", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Koch Brothers Make Climate Activists New Target\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/06/13/koch-brothers-make-climate-activists-new-target.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/06/13/koch-brothers-make-climate-activists-new-target/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46756633.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/06/13/koch-brothers-make-climate-activists-new-target\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-13T19:05:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Peter Stone\",\"tags\":[\"koch-brothers\",\"politics\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/p/peter-stone", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddda0\"", "article_summary": "A few Koch network-backed nonprofit groups including AFP have long fought against climate change regulations, a carbon tax, and subsidies for renewable energy.\nPolitical allies including Sen.
