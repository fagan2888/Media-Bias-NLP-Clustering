In this case, an Obama-appointed judge followed the law without bias.\u201d\n\nSavage said the case cost him $1 million in legal fees \u201cand many lost days and nights.\u201d\n\nWND requested a comment from TRN, but did not get a response immediately.\n\nHorowitz said in 2013 that Savage\u2019s victory establishes the ability of radio talent to break away from an employer like any other employee.\n\nRadio hosts, he explained, have been bound by restrictive clauses in their contracts that treat them like businesses instead of regular employees. The law, therefore, has allowed the networks to enforce non-compete agreements with radio hosts that would be illegal if applied to individual employees.\n\nSavage filed the suit in December 2010 regarding his contract, alleging the network used \u201cillegal and unenforceable contract provisions\u201d and \u201cother strong-armed tactics\u201d to intimidate him and force him into accepting a \u201csub-standard agreement.\u201d\n\nIn September, as WND reported, the arbitration panel awarded Savage $863,454.92, plus all other money from withheld earnings and permanent ownership of all his archived radio shows.\n\nThe decision enabled Savage to sign with Cumulus Media Networks in October, which now airs \u201cThe Savage Nation\u201d from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Eastern, Monday through Friday. Cumulus Media calls itself the largest pure-play radio broadcaster in the United States, with approximately 525 stations in 110 markets.\n\nAccording to the court order, the dispute arose when TRN attempted to exercise a \u201cright to match\u201d provision in an independent contractor agreement with Savage.\n\nSavage asserted TRN failed to exercise its right to match properly, and the dispute was settled by arbitration.\n\nSavage is the author of 30 books, including six New York Times bestsellers. He was awarded the coveted Freedom of Speech Award by Talkers Magazine and earned his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley.\n\nHis bestsellers include \u201cTrickle Down Tyranny: Crushing Obama\u2019s Dream of the Socialist States of America,\u201d \u201cTrickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama\u2019s Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security,\u201d \u201cThe Savage Nation,\u201d \u201cThe Enemy Within,\u201d \u201cLiberalism is a Mental Disorder,\u201d \u201cPolitical Zoo,\u201d \u201cPsychological Nudity: Savage Radio Stories\u201d and \u201cBanned in Britain.\u201d\n\nSee the entire Savage collection in the WND Superstore.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday upheld a federal judge\u2019s decision to release talk-radio host Michael Savage from a contract with his former syndicator, Talk Radio Network.
