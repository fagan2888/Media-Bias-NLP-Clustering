Trade Tech is one of our premiere institutions where so many of our young people get trained,\" Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) told KPCC. Bass, whose district includes the college, stood outside with ticket holders ahead of the event.\n\nMiguel Rodriguez, a 45-year-old house painter in Los Angeles, was among those who braved the heat Thursday to hear the president speak.\n\n\"He\u2019s very elegant when he speaks,\" said Rodriguez, who said he heard the president speak at Trade Tech back in 2008, when Obama was still just a candidate.\n\nAsked about the Obama administration\u2019s immigration policies, Rodriguez said, \"I\u2019m happy with [Obama] but not the Congress, because they are delaying immigration reform.\"\n\nBusiness student Biju Jayaraaj, 44, who has been living in Los Angeles for about a year, told KPCC, \"I\u2019m from India. I don\u2019t ever get a chance to see my Prime Minister. Now I get to see a president!\"\n\nAsked about his opinion of the president\u2019s role in the battle over the Affordable Care Act, Jayaraaj said, \"I think he\u2019s got some guts and stands up for what he believes in.\"\n\nThough there had been some reports that protestors planned to show up at the event to demonstrate against U.S. policy in the Middle East and increased deportations, there was no sign of any organized disruption.\n\nObama did receive some heckling as he began to speak, but he handled it with a joke: \"I've met that guy before.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Obama made a stop at local favorite Canter's Deli to meet with four people who had taken the time to write him letters, according to a White House Press Pool report.\n\nThe president surprised diners and staff at the iconic deli in the Fairfax neighborhood, writes pool reporter Seema Mehta of the Los Angeles Times:\n\nThe line cooks snapped cell phone pics and fist-bumped with the president, who was wearing a blue shirt and tie with no jacket. \"Hi guys, how are you?\" he asked diners. One man asked him about his basketball game, and Obama replied, \"My shot\u2019s broke.\" He held his arm up in the air and said, \"It\u2019s my elbow. It\u2019s my age. I get the chicken wing.\" The diner asked how many shots he could sink out of 10, and Obama replied eight. \"But that\u2019s not during a game.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "Hundreds of people lined up for blocks in the blazing heat for an opportunity to hear the president speak on Thursday at Los Angeles Trade Technical College.", "title": "Obama criticizes US companies for lack of 'economic patriotism'", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/07/24/45557/live-obama-speaks-on-economy-at-la-trade-tech-coll/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/2b996543674832496953bed13871da90/89008-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 768}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
