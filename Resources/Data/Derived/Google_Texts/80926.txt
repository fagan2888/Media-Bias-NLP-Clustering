It’s back to school time again! Whether you’re in college, high school or elementary school—or if you need to fork out the dough for the student in your life—maybe they all would like to show a bit of Native style at school.

So, among the highlighters and pencils, books and snacks, and cell phone and computer accessories, here are 10 Native-themed back to school items to show your Native style:

A Beaded Cell Phone Case

Yes, we know some schools make you turn in your phone or keep them in your lockers, but in those moments you DO have your phone, the folks at such places like Wanelo.com and FineArtAmerica.com have all sorts of cell phone covers.

A Pendleton Pencil Case

Imagine you are reaching for a pencil, and out comes a cool Pendleton pencil case—oh yeah!

There are some beautifully handmade pencil cases on the Timberline Treasures Etsy site run by Ginny Vyvyan. They’ll run you $12 each

Some Native-Themed Glasses

If you’ve been starting to squint or are having some trouble reading the teacher’s notes, you may need glasses. Generally speaking, glasses aren’t cheap, but if you’re going to invest, how about Aya eyewear? Aya is a First Nations brand with cool designs and colors.

Some of these specs were designed by First Nations artist Corrine Hunt, who was commissioned for the first series of AYA Accessories.
