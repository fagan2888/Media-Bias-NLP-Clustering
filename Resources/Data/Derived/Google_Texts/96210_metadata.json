The GOP seems to be in lockstep against it \u2026 mostly. But that doesn\u2019t mean that a vote to shoot the deal down is a sure thing. Even if it were, the President gets to weigh in with his veto pen and then you need Democrats if you want to get past the Oval Office. And we\u2019re not just talking about a few Democrats either.\n\nIn terms of the minority party opposition, it does exist. Joe Lieberman (now safely out of the fray and into retirement) seems to be the voice of those still in office who are a bit more shy about speaking up. He\u2019s been doing the media tour lately and putting the pressure on Chuck Schumer (D \u2013 NY) to take a stand for Israel.\n\nLieberman, the Senate\u2019s first Orthodox Jew, blasted the agreement with Iran on \u201cThe Cats Roundtable\u201d with host John Catsimatidis on New York\u2019s AM 970. He said the deal could be effectively blocked with the help of Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cI think it opens the way for a lot of other Democrats to oppose it as well,\u201d Lieberman said of his longtime colleague, who is also Jewish. \u201cChuck is the key.\u201d Schumer, who is likely to become the Senate\u2019s next top Democrat, faces a major dilemma over the nuclear deal. He is both a key ally to both Israel and the White House, facing pressure from both sides on the deal.\n\nSchumer is in a ticklish position here, not only by virtue of being being Jewish himself, but having been a long time friend and supporter of both Israel in general and Bibi Netanyahu in particular. He\u2019s been a bit of a thorn in Barack Obama\u2019s side on the Middle East since the beginning of his term. As early as 2010, Chuck was speaking to the press out of school and calling for the President\u2019s counter-productive Israel policy to stop. As recently as this spring, when rumors were making the rounds about Obama strong arming Israel and hinting about less support for them in the U.N. the Weekly Standard cornered Schumer and couldn\u2019t get more than a \u201cNo Comment\u201d from him.\n\nThe point is that Schumer hasn\u2019t been afraid to buck the Democrat system to stand up for Israel and Bibi\u2019s feelings about this deal are clear to say the least. But now Schumer is on the brink of something big. Every rumor mill source in DC has it that Schumer is in line to replace Harry Reid as Minority Leader (and Majority if they manage to take the Senate back) and that means playing ball. It\u2019s been obvious for years that Chuck has had his eye on the big chair and he loves nothing more than showing up on every cable news show that will have him.\n\nSo what will Chuck do? If he stands up forcefully against the Iran deal he will provide cover for a lot of other nervous Democrats to follow him over the cliff. But he\u2019ll also be setting his bridges on fire with both the White House and the rest of the party leadership. He\u2019s unbeatable in New York, so there\u2019s no danger of losing his seat entirely, but he\u2019s probably wondering whether opposing the deal will sink his chances at the Leader position. It looks like a choice between principle and personal gain, and only Schumer knows which he will pick.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Pick a side, Chuck", "title": "Joe Lieberman may have Chuck Schumer over a barrel on Iran", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/07/26/joe-lieberman-may-have-chuck-schumer-over-a-barrel-on-iran/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-26T19:31:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-26T16:06:22+00:00"}, "keywords": "Chuck Schumer, Iran, Iran Nuclear Program, Joe Lieberman, Senate Democrats,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10e3\"", "article_summary": "He said the deal could be effectively blocked with the help of Sen.
