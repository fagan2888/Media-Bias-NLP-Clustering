But concerns tied to the enforcement of the proposed policies are also being raised.\n\n\n\nThe Republican gubernatorial candidate has recommended requiring state agencies that collect personal information to acquire individual consent before selling or releasing any data, and he has proposed granting individuals property rights over their DNA information.\n\nDeborah Peel, founder and chairwoman of Patient Privacy Rights, said Abbott\u2019s proposals would give residents unprecedented control over DNA and private information in the state. The disclosure of medical information has harmed individuals because it can lead to discrimination from third parties, including health insurance providers and employers, Peel said.\n\n\u201cMy whole career has been watching how people\u2019s lives are ruined because their medical information is disclosed. I\u2019m happy to see he\u2019s seen [this information] is not safe,\u201d Peel said, adding that the policies would need to be accompanied by \u201cadequate enforcement\" to be effective.\n\nAbbott has described his privacy proposals as a pushback against federal and state efforts to turn government \u201cinto Big Brother.\u201d In his proposal announcement, Abbott singled out the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles for collecting $2.1 million in 2012 by selling information on Texas drivers from its database to more than 2,500 clients, including collection agencies, towing companies, banks and private investigators.\n\nAdam Shaivitz, a DMV public information officer, pointed out that the department\u2019s disclosure procedures were in line with both the state\u2019s Motor Vehicle Records Disclosure Act and the federal Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act.\n\nBartlett Cleland of the Lewisville-based Institute for Policy Innovation, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, said the proposals would help reduce the government\u2019s power over personal information.\n\nUnder Abbott\u2019s proposals, state agencies looking to release or sell personal information would be required to provide individuals with a means to opt out. Cleland disagreed with the method, though, saying an opt-in system would be the better option because it provides individuals with a \u201cplain\u201d way of knowing what \u201cthey\u2019re signing up for.\u201d\n\nAbbott\u2019s proposal, part of his larger \u201cWe the People\u201d policy initiative, also included recommendations prohibiting the resale of personal information to third parties and the use of cross-reference techniques, or methods to re-identify an individual in a \"de-identified\" data set, to identify individuals whose data is used in larger online databases.\n\nCleland acknowledged that the policies would require additional state oversight and would create the need for \u201cadditional definitions and parameters\u201d to explain how each policy would work to avoid confusion or unintended consequences.\n\nLynn Blais, a property law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, questioned Abbott\u2019s DNA rights proposal, saying it lacked a detailed explanation, and she said it was unclear what problem the attorney general intends to solve.\n\n\u201cI think it would be a better approach to current concerns about DNA use if we approached it from a privacy lens,\u201d Blais said, adding that a property right over DNA did not solve issues related to access, including law enforcement officers' ability to swab an individual's cheek if he or she is arrested. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t solve problems people are currently seeing.\u201d\n\nAbbott has been criticized in the past over the issue of privacy rights.\n\nLast year, his office accidentally released millions of Social Security numbers of Texas voters when a voter database provided to lawyers challenging the state\u2019s voter ID law disclosed the personal information.\n\nA spokesman for state Sen. and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis questioned Abbott\u2019s credentials when it comes to privacy, citing the Social Security number blunder in the campaign's response to Abbott\u2019s proposals.\n\n\"Greg Abbott's record demonstrates that Texans can't trust Greg Abbott to protect their privacy,\" said Bo Delp, a spokesman for Davis. \"Greg Abbott exposed millions of Texans to identity theft and breached his responsibility to protect them pursuing a political agenda. Now he is playing politics again to cover up his record and hope Texans will forget his failure.\"\n\nAbbott spokesman Matt Hirsch said Davis' support of the federal Affordable Care Act and its accompanying federal navigators, who are helping Texans sign up for health insurance through the federal marketplace, is a larger privacy threat to Texans.\n\nThe attorney general has previously requested additional state oversight of navigators on the basis of privacy concerns.\n\n\"Big government, in which Sen. Wendy Davis places her trust, is the most enduring threat to privacy and individual liberty,\" Hirsch said.\n\nAbbott has also questioned legislation, House Bill 2103, signed by Gov. Rick Perry during the 83rd legislative session, that increased the sharing of data among education resource centers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m showing, if you would, a new kind of Republican candidate,\u201d Abbott told the NE Tarrant Tea Party during his announcement. \u201cOne that is very substantive. One that has a lot of policy details.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Attorney General and gubernatorial candidate&nbsp;Greg Abbott&nbsp;has&nbsp;pushed for more stringent privacy laws, and privacy rights activists say his proposals would benefit Texans.
