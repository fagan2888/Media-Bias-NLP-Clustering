The President\u2019s main goal was to make health insurance and health care available to more people, and he\u2019s done that.\n\nJack Lessenberry talks about Michigan's shortage in primary care doctors.\n\nThere\u2019s still a problem, however. Even if you have coverage, it\u2019s hard to get health care without a doctor \u2013 especially what\u2019s known as a primary care physician. Specialists are thick on the ground, especially in affluent areas, like Birmingham or Ann Arbor.\n\nBut you are going to need a lot of luck if you have to try finding a general practitioner, pediatrician or psychiatrist in rural northern Michigan, or the city of Detroit itself. If you have small children, you\u2019re probably better off medically if you live in Oakland or Washtenaw counties.\n\nThey have ten times as many pediatricians as the medical profession considers ideal for the size of the population. But if you have kids and are thinking about taking a job in the far-off Keweenaw Peninsula \u2026 good luck.\n\nThose statistics come from a report published this summer by the Citizens Research Council of Michigan, which has been doing important, non-partisan research and policy analysis for nearly a century.\n\nThey conducted a comprehensive study of medical care, and found that Michigan has an overall shortage of primary care providers, one that\u2019s likely to get worse.\n\nThis is something I had been hearing about anecdotally for years from doctors, or people who\u2019ve been looking for a primary care provider. The CRC report provides solid evidence that that\u2019s the case.\n\nAnd while there is a shortage, the problem is even more one of distribution. Pleasant, relatively rich areas are well-served, poor areas not.\n\nThis not only sounds unfair; it has social consequences; areas with more primary care doctors have lower mortality rates. There are a number of reasons for this; doctors, like everyone else, prefer living in nicer places. But specialists also tend to be paid more, and the average medical school graduate emerges with something like $150,00o dollars in debt.\n\nEric Lupher, the president of Citizens Research Council, wrote a column last weekend in which he outlined a number of policy initiatives our leaders could take, including loan forgiveness for primary care physicians and changing Medicaid reimbursement rates and other provider payment systems in a way more favorable to primary care physicians.\n\nTrouble is, Michigan has a legislature that cannot even manage simple road repair, and whose members regard any kind of government spending as anathema. Battle Creek\u2019s Joe Schwarz, who\u2019s both a politician and a practicing physician, has a simpler plan that I think makes a lot of sense. He\u2019d have the state spend about $12 million a year for scholarships for 40 to 50 students willing to go into primary care.\n\nThey would get a free medical education in return for making a commitment to practice for at least eight years in an area in Michigan where the need exists. Schwarz thinks we\u2019d be getting a bargain. When you think of what we spend on prisons, the cost would be insignificant. Nothing is more important than the future health of our citizens. Now all we need is the political will to get it done.\n\nJack Lessenberry is Michigan Radio's political analyst.
