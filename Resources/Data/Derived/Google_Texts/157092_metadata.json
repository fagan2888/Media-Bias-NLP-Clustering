While many people are focused on plans\u2019 out-of-pocket expenses, experts warn that shouldn\u2019t be the only factor in the decision-making process.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cYou really have to think about your personality,\u201d when choosing the type of health insurance to go with, says Jeff Alter, CEO Unitedhealthcare Employer & Individual. \u201cAre you someone who is willing to be flexible around what provider you see or how you access the health-care system or are you someone who wants to find their own path?\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to health insurance, there are three main types of plans: HMOs, PPOs and EPOs.\n\nWhile HMOs, which stands for health maintenance organization, were the de-facto standard in years past, PPOs and EPOs are becoming more popular, particularly among those with chronic illnesses. Last year, HMOs accounted for 8.6% of all individual and family plans at online insurance marketplace eHealthInsurance, and this year it\u2019s up to 36%.\n\n\u201cHMOs are making a comeback,\u201d says Carrie Mclean, director of customer care at eHealthInsurance. \u201cThe insurance companies, in order to keep cost down created a lot more HMO plans.\u201d\n\nKevin Luss, owner of financial services firm The Luss Group, explains that patients with a HMO have to use doctors within their plan\u2019s network to have the care covered. In addition to seeing only in-network doctors, HMO plans require a referral to see a specialist.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey are cheaper, but HMOs are a little bit more restrictive,\u201d says Luss. \u201cYou have to pick your gatekeeper, which is your primary care doctor.\u201d He explains that requiring a referral reduces overall health-care costs because it will prevent people from seeing a specialist on a whim.\n\n\u201cHMOs are appropriate for people who aren\u2019t seeing many specialists and don\u2019t venture far from where they live.\u201d\n\nPPOs, or preferred provider organization plans, are another popular type of insurance plan that allows subscribers to go outside the network to see a doctor. However, that move might mean paying half the bill, according to Mclean. People with PPOs don\u2019t need a referral to see a specialist. \u201cPPOs are good for people who have a lot of pre-existing conditions that require them to see a lot of specialists and they don\u2019t want to get a referral each time,\u201d says Mclean. \u201cPPOs can be more money than HMOs.\u201d\n\nEPOs, or exclusive provider organization plans, have been offered in some states for several years, while other states just starting offering them. \u201cEPOs and PPOs are more open in general,\u201d says Alter. \u201cThey offer a larger, broader network.\u201d\n\nThat network, however, doesn\u2019t come cheap. According to Alter, the larger the network of doctors, the bigger the price tag of a plan. People with an EPO have to stay in-network, but the network is typically large and national, which means those that summer in New York and head to Florida for the winter still have a large choice of doctors.\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, in a normal marketplace without significant upheaval you\u2019ll pay 15% to 20% more for EPO,\u201d says Luss. \u201cIt makes sense for people who travel\u201d since the network is national.\n\nFor those choosing a plan based on what doctors are covered, Luss recommends they do their homework before making a purchase.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t trust anything you see such as Internet lists. The only way to be sure is to call the doctor\u2019s office and speak with them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 02:13:07 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "From HMOs to PPOs, the world of health insurance can be confusing, especially in this era of high deductible plans and co-insurance.
