WHITWELL, Tenn. (AP) — A Tennessee woman is facing child neglect charges after deputies found her driving ahead of her daughters while making them walk to school.

Marion County Sheriff Ronnie “Bo” Burnett says the mother told deputies her daughters were being punished for missing the bus, the Chattanooga Times Free Press reports (bit.ly/1UHXZH6).

Lisa Marie Palmer is scheduled for an initial court appearance April 18 on charges of child neglect and driving without a license.

No phone number was listed on a deputy’s report to reach Palmer for comment, and court officials said she doesn’t have an attorney yet.

A deputy says he saw Palmer and the children about 50 yards apart with Palmer in the car ahead of them.
