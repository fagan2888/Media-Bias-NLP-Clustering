According to the police department, the officer who fired his gun was acting in self-defense. Robinson was taken to a hospital, where he died from his gunshot wounds.\n\nRobinson was not carrying a firearm. \u201cThe initial finding at the scene did not reflect a gun or anything of that nature that would have been used by the subject,\u201d Madison Police Chief Mike Koval told reporters.\n\nThe news of the fatal shooting prompted about 100 Madison residents to take to the streets early Saturday morning, chanting \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d and singing and praying for Robinson\u2019s family.\n\n\n\nCrowd chants \"Black lives matter!\" on Willy St @BadgerHerald pic.twitter.com/pYHezgKu6i \u2014 Rachael Lallensack (@rlallensack) March 7, 2015\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not protecting us, you\u2019re killing us!\u201d Robinson\u2019s grandmother, Sharon Irwin, shouted at police.\n\nIrwin told the Daily Cardinal that she believes Robinson\u2019s death is part of a bigger pattern of police killings of unarmed black men who are perceived as threats. \u201cThis can\u2019t go on anymore,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going on across the United States and it\u2019s ridiculous. You don\u2019t have a license to kill. You have a license to protect, and that\u2019s not what I\u2019m seeing.\u201d\n\nWisconsin has long struggled with issues of race, violence, and policing. The state has the highest rate of incarceration of black men in the country. A recent investigation from USA Today confirmed that, just like Ferguson, there\u2019s a big gap between the racial diversity of Wisconsin\u2019s police departments compared to the communities they\u2019re serving.\n\nThe state has also attempted to make some reforms in this area. Wisconsin recently became the first state in the country to pass a law requiring the independent investigation of police-custody deaths. That policy resulted from years of grassroots mobilizing after an unarmed man was shot point-blank in the head by a police officer and the police department\u2019s investigation quickly ruled the shooting was justified, to the skepticism of the community. The victim\u2019s family advocated on behalf of the legislation for 10 years.\n\nMadison Mayor Paul Soglin confirmed that, in accordance with that new law, there will be an out-of-area investigation into the shooting death of Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy beyond description,\u201d Soglin said. \u201cI expect there will be a lot of anger and frustrations.\u201d\n\nThe latest incidence of police violence against a young man of color comes amid heightened tensions stemming from 18-year-old Mike Brown\u2019s shooting in Ferguson, which has sparked widespread outrage about racialized police brutality over the past six months.\n\nLast week, the Department of Justice released the results from an investigation into the Ferguson Police Department that uncovered systematic racial bias among cops in the St. Louis suburb, including instances of officers exchanging blatantly racist emails. Attorney General Eric Holder on Friday said that he\u2019s prepared to take any steps necessary to address the issues among the Ferguson police, including dismantling the entire department if necessary.\n\nAlthough Holder said he\u2019s \u201cshocked\u201d by the number of black residents who have been mistreated by the Ferguson Police Department, the Justice Department stopped short of bringing charges against Officer Darren Wilson, the cop who fatally shot Mike Brown. Officials said they didn\u2019t have enough evidence to corroborate claims that Brown had surrendered with his hands in the air before Wilson discharged his weapon.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The latest shooting death comes as the nation prepares to mark the anniversary of \"Bloody Sunday,\" the famous protest that highlighted police brutality against African Americans.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The latest shooting death comes as the nation prepares to mark the anniversary of \"Bloody Sunday,\" the famous protest that highlighted police brutality against African Americans.", "title": "Protests Erupt In Wisconsin\u2019s Capital After Cop Fatally Shoots A Black Teen", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/03/07/3631104/protests-wisconsin-shoot-teen/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP861001469004.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The latest shooting death comes as the nation prepares to mark the anniversary of \"Bloody Sunday,\" the famous protest that highlighted police brutality against African Americans.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP861001469004-321x214.jpg", "title": "Protests Erupt In Wisconsin\u2019s Capital After Cop Fatally Shoots A Black Teen", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP861001469004.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AP861001469004.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-07T10:48:02+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "According to the police department, the officer who fired his gun was acting in self-defense.\nJustice Protests Erupt In Wisconsin\u2019s Capital After Cop Fatally Shoots A Black Teen CREDIT: AP Photo/Morry Gash Protesters declare \"black lives matter\" on Dec. 23, 2014, in MilwaukeeOn the same weekend as the nation marks the 50th anniversary of the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d protest in Selma that represented a major turning point in the civil rights movement, protests have erupted in Wisconsin\u2019s capital after a cop shot and killed a 19-year-old black man.\nWisconsin recently became the first state in the country to pass a law requiring the independent investigation of police-custody deaths.\nThe state has the highest rate of incarceration of black men in the country.\nMadison Mayor Paul Soglin confirmed that, in accordance with that new law, there will be an out-of-area investigation into the shooting death of Robinson."}
