But on September 3rd, five federal judges predicted that the complaint\u2014which involves the law\u2019s requirements for employers to provide contraception to their employees\u2014would find a receptive audience at the Supreme Court.\n\nChurches and other religious organisations are exempt from the duty. Last year certain types of \u201cclosely held\u201d corporations run by people with religious objections to birth control earned a similar bye. But charitable organisations affiliated with religious groups, from food banks to hospitals\u2014most of which are Catholic but equal-opportunity employers\u2014were not released from the requirement. So in response to their complaints the Obama administration revised the rules to permit religious non-profits to opt out of providing contraceptive coverage by filling out a form or writing a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services. A third party would then provide birth-control coverage directly to the employees without the involvement\u2014financial or otherwise\u2014of the objecting organisation.\n\nThis was not enough for dozens of Christian charities and universities, which are resisting the federal government\u2019s attempt to accommodate their religious scruples. A barrage of lawsuits against Sylvia Burwell, the secretary of the health and human services department, contend that the so-called accommodation is anything but. By filling out the form and certifying that \u201cthe organisation...has a religious objection to providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive services that would otherwise be required to be covered\u201d, the groups claim they are still complicit in the sinful practice of destroying life.\n\nOne of the highest-profile challenges comes from the Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of nuns providing care to the impoverished elderly in Colorado. To sign the form, the Little Sisters\u2019 petition to the Supreme Court reads, is to be \u201cmorally complicit in grave sin\u201d. At stake is nothing less that the Little Sisters\u2019 right \u201cto practice their religion as they understand it.\u201d\n\nThe court that rejected that argument in July, the tenth circuit court of appeals, was the sixth appeals court to have done so. It explained that although the Little Sisters\u2019 objection is \u201csincere\u201d, the accommodation imposes no \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on their religious freedom, since it did not require them to provide, pay, or be otherwise involved in the provision of contraception. \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 only involvement in the scheme,\u201d the panel wrote, \u201cis the act of opting out.\u201d\n\nFollowing the Little Sisters\u2019 loss, the tenth circuit considered whether to take up the case again before the entire 12-judge bench. By a vote of 7-5, they demurred. But the five dissenters who voted to hear the nuns\u2019 complaint en banc were strident in their dismissal of the original ruling. The plaintiffs \"sincerely believe\" that they will violate God's law if they fill in the necessary documents, said Judge Harris Hartz. \"And the penalty for refusal to execute the documents may be in the millions of dollars. How can it be any clearer that the law substantially burdens the plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise of religion?\"\n\nJudge Hartz notes that \u201cit is not the job of the judiciary to tell people what their religious beliefs are\u201d or whether some are \u201ccore\u201d while others are \u201cderivative\u201d. On the reasoning of the three-judge panel, he charged, \u201ca Christian could be required to work on December 25\u201d if a court found that Jesus was born in March. A Jewish prisoner \u201ccould be provided only non-kosher food\u201d if a court decided that \u201cthe real purpose of biblical dietary laws is health.\u201d\n\nIf the courts\u2019 failure to uphold the religious non-profits\u2019 claims really led to these results, it would indeed be problematic. But Judge Hartz\u2019s argument is faulty. The courts that have ruled against the organisations are not deigning to redefine Christian tenets or to \u201ccorrect\u201d widely held beliefs about holidays or the justification for religious commandments. They are not arguing the medically sensible claim that birth-control techniques like the IUD or Plan B (the \u201cmorning-after pill\u201d) are not in fact abortifacients. Instead, they have scrutinised the groups\u2019 claims that their beliefs are substantially burdened by the accommodation scheme\u2014and found them wanting.\n\nThat seems reasonable. If the government had to bend over backwards for every religious believer asserting that an accommodation permitting them to opt out of a generally applicable law still substantially burdened their beliefs, there would be no end to the exemptions. In its July ruling, the court implied that if the Little Sisters were to prevail, the accommodation available to people with a conscientious objection to military service would suddenly become legally suspect on the grounds that \u201csomeone else will take his place\u201d on the front lines. A conscientious objector could therefore argue that he remains \"complicit\" in sinful military activity even if he himself is exempted from combat.\n\nReligious liberty permits people to practice their faith without molestation by the government. It puts a duty on the government to grant accommodations to believers when warranted, and when doing so does not negatively impact third parties or stymie the very functioning of the state. Attempts to frame such accommodations as an attack on religion are surely mistaken.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/2015/09/blogs/democracy-america/20150912_usp504.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Religious scruples and birth control", "description": "Roman Catholic non-profits refuse to take yes for an answer", "pubdate": 20150911, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "Roman Catholic non-profits refuse to take yes for an answer", "title": "Is Obamacare at war with religion?", "url": "http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2015/09/religious-scruples-and-birth-control", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/cf_images/images-magazine/2015/09/12/US/20150912_USP504_facebook.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "Roman Catholic non-profits refuse to take yes for an answer", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-11 16:42:00", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/09/blogs/democracy-america/20150912_usp504.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@EconUS"}, "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "Blogs", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/2015/09/blogs/democracy-america/20150912_usp504.jpg", "articleid": 21664043, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/2015/09/blogs/democracy-america/20150912_usp504.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Religious scruples and birth control", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/2015/09/blogs/democracy-america/20150912_usp504.jpg", "news_keywords": "Religious scruples and birth control"}, "article_summary": "Last year certain types of \u201cclosely held\u201d corporations run by people with religious objections to birth control earned a similar bye.\nJudge Hartz notes that \u201cit is not the job of the judiciary to tell people what their religious beliefs are\u201d or whether some are \u201ccore\u201d while others are \u201cderivative\u201d.\nTo sign the form, the Little Sisters\u2019 petition to the Supreme Court reads, is to be \u201cmorally complicit in grave sin\u201d.\nOne of the highest-profile challenges comes from the Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of nuns providing care to the impoverished elderly in Colorado.\nThis was not enough for dozens of Christian charities and universities, which are resisting the federal government\u2019s attempt to accommodate their religious scruples."}
