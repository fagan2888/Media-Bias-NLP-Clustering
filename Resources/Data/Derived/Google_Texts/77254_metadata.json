Under mandamus, a court can order government officials to properly fulfill their official duties or correct abuses.\n\nThe firm\u2019s filing also requested an order from Clark County District Court shortening the time in which to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 motion.\n\n\u201cSome of our clients are so ill that if their needs are not addressed now, it is a matter of life and death,\u201d Callister said.\n\nPlaintiffs in the lawsuit include a husband and wife who applied for coverage in October, and weren\u2019t covered until May. While they went without a plan, the wife developed an untreatable brain tumor, Callister said.\n\nAnother plaintiff was placed in both Medicaid and Health Plan of Nevada by Nevada Health Link, Callister said. Because of the mixup, neither insurer is taking responsibility for the plaintiff, who is Medicaid-eligible and has blood cancer, he said.\n\nCallister\u2019s solution would be a statewide panel of 10 to 20 insurance brokers to manually enroll people who have had trouble signing up for policies through Nevada Health Link\u2019s website and call center.\n\nA spokesman with the state exchange said the exchange does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nFrom its Oct. 1 launch, software glitches on Nevada Health Link\u2019s website prevented some from finishing applications or paying premiums. The website has also botched effective coverage dates and federal tax credits.\n\nThe exchange\u2019s board decided in May to dump website contractor Xerox. The state will borrow the federal system\u2019s eligibility and enrollment functions beginning in November.\n\nIn the meantime, the exchange needs a broker task force, Callister said. The task force would be funded with premiums paid to the exchange. Callister estimated the exchange is taking in $750,000 a month in premiums from roughly 36,000 paying members.\n\nThursday\u2019s petition follows Callister\u2019s April 1 filing of a class-action lawsuit against the exchange, Xerox and the state of Nevada on behalf of Nevadans who have paid premiums and not gotten coverage. The lawsuit has 150 plaintiffs, but Callister said there could be 6,500 more affected Nevadans.\n\nA hearing is scheduled for July 3 to give Callister\u2019s firm steering-committee status to lead the class-action case.\n\nContact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com.
