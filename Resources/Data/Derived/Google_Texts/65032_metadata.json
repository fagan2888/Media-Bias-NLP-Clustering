CSUMB has joined a pilot program, Re-imagining the First Year of College in hopes of improving the student success rate for freshmen.\n\nThe three-year project is coordinated by the Association of American State Colleges and Universities. It is funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and USA Funds.\n\nAccording to a news release, the first year of college is the point at which schools experience the greatest loss of students. The goal of the project is to help the participating colleges enhance the first-year experience, increase retention and improve graduation rates, particularly among historically underserved populations \u2013 low-income, first-generation and students of color.\n\nThe goal for each campus is to have a better strategy for student success by the end of the project, with measurable results on retention and credits earned, plus a broader support network.\n\n\u201cThe Re-imagining the First Year of College project will allow CSUMB to continue to work on student success on campus and it will align nicely with Monterey County's cradle-to-career partnership, Bright Futures.\n\nEl Sausal enters national science contest\n\nOnce again, El Sausal Middle School in Salinas is in the running to represent California at the National Science Bowl this spring.
