During that time, the studio released 45 Top 10 albums and 20 No. 1 hits.\n\nFor many, Caribou Ranch was an icon in the history of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. And, on Saturday, people jumped at the chance to claim a piece of it.\n\nHundreds gathered for the Caribou Ranch auction, held at the Denver Design Center, where Leslie Hindman Auctioneers sold nearly 500 items from the ranch and recording studio.\n\nHighlights included an antique mahogany Steinway & Sons grand piano used by Elton John and a 1985 Corvette with custom Caribou license plates.\n\n\u201cWhat was important for this sale was to paint the picture of Caribou Ranch,\u201d said Annie McLagan, managing director for LHA\u2019s Denver office. \u201cWe were expecting 300 to 350 people for this,\u201d she added with a laugh, estimating that roughly 2,000 people participated in the live and online bidding combined.\n\nLong before the auction began, the small conference room designated for bidding was overflowing with Caribou Ranch enthusiasts and music lovers.\n\nTo accommodate the crowds, speakers broadcast the action throughout the 8,000-square-foot exhibition area. When they ran out of plastic auction paddles, event organizers began handing out pieces of paper with numbers written in black marker.\n\nConcetta Palmieri and her husband were among those listening to the bidding in the exhibition area, waiting for their lot number to draw closer before braving the auction room.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to have a piece of Colorado history and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll history all rolled into one,\u201d said Palmieri, 39, hoping to snag a piece of furniture.\n\nAs the first few items sold \u2014 including several Caribou Ranch signs that went for about $2,000 apiece \u2014 Palmieri and her husband changed their minds. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not getting anything,\u201d she said, laughing.\n\nNot long after, a Caribou Ranch ashtray and a book of matches sold for $800. A 1925 Wm. Knabe & Co. baby-grand piano brought in $52,500.\n\nRussick Smith, 27, said he drove from Breckenridge to participate in the auction. An audio engineer, he was particularly interested in the equipment from the recording studio.\n\n\u201cCaribou Ranch is one of the strongest connections Colorado has to the recording industry,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI wish there was this much interest in the existing industry. It\u2019s a shame there\u2019s no similar facility in Colorado today.\u201d\n\nFive percent of the proceeds from the auction will be donated to the Colorado Music Hall of Fame, which is inducting Caribou Ranch this year.\n\n\u201cWe felt it was time to share with the fans some of the memories and stories that remain from that magical time,\u201d said James Guercio, Caribou\u2019s original owner.\n\nGuercio purchased the land \u2014 a 4,000-acre ranch near Nederland \u2014 in 1971, converting an old barn into the recording studio and furnishing cabins and a lodge for visiting musicians.\n\nSome of the most distinctive albums of the \u201970s and \u201980s were recorded there, including three by Elton John and five by Chicago. The studio was a major destination until 1985, when a fire destroyed the control room.\n\nAfter the fire, Guercio and his family began selling portions of the land to the city and county of Boulder. In 2014, the remaining 1,600 acres sold for $32.5 million to Indian Peaks Holdings LLC.\n\nAnna Gauldin: 303-954-1666, agauldin@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Caribou Ranch auction draws thousands of music lovers, collectors", "title": "Caribou Ranch auction draws thousands of music lovers, collectors", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/24/caribou-ranch-auction-draws-thousands-of-music-lovers-collectors/", "image": {"width": 458, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150124__20150125_B1_CD25CARIBOURANCHp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150124__20150125_B1_CD25CARIBOURANCHp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-24T18:40:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T04:44:56+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6962\"", "article_summary": "Hundreds gathered for the Caribou Ranch auction, held at the Denver Design Center, where Leslie Hindman Auctioneers sold nearly 500 items from the ranch and recording studio.\n\u201cWhat was important for this sale was to paint the picture of Caribou Ranch,\u201d said Annie McLagan, managing director for LHA\u2019s Denver office.\nLong before the auction began, the small conference room designated for bidding was overflowing with Caribou Ranch enthusiasts and music lovers.\nFor many, Caribou Ranch was an icon in the history of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\nIn its heyday, some of the top names in music passed through Caribou Ranch, a recording studio nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains."}
