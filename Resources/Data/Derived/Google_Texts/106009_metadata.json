In an op-ed in Thursday\u2019s Wall Street Journal, House Speaker John Boehner and soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said they would make job creation their top priority, and to that end, they would move quickly to approve drilling and pipeline applications:\n\nLooking ahead to the next Congress, we will honor the voters\u2019 trust by focusing, first, on jobs and the economy\u2026 These bills include measures authorizing the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which will mean lower energy costs for families and more jobs for American workers\u2026 We\u2019ll also consider legislation to help protect and expand America\u2019s emerging energy boom.\n\nYou\u2019d think that if Boehner and McConnell actually cared about permanent jobs, the fact that Keystone would only create 35 of them would push it way down their priority list. But then, if they cared about jobs, they would do a lot of things differently, from supporting more domestic spending to closing the infrastructure deficit.\n\nJobs are a just a fig leaf for Keystone\u2019s real purpose, which is enriching fossil fuel interests. It\u2019s not even true that Keystone would reduce American energy costs. By enabling oil from the North Dakota Bakken Shale to be brought to Gulf Coast refineries and exported, it would actually eliminate the current glut of oil in the Midwest and raise prices for Mid-western consumers.\n\nBut this is all well established. The big new question is whether Republicans are even correct in claiming a popular mandate for these policies.\n\nThe short answer: No. Only 34 percent of eligible voters came out to the polls on Tuesday, down from 58 percent in the 2012 presidential election and 41 percent in the 2010 mid-term. To claim any kind of mandate from an election that drew just a third of the eligible public would be a stretch.\n\nThe long answer doesn\u2019t look much different, for three main reasons: First, most voters didn\u2019t vote. Second, those who did were unrepresentative of the general electorate. And third, the exit polls don\u2019t suggest that voters\u2019 choices for candidates even reflected their preferences on issues or parties.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the low turnout. Midterms always have disproportionately lower turnout among younger, poorer, and nonwhite voters. Sure enough, on Tuesday the share of the electorate under 30 years old dropped to 13 percent from 19 percent in 2012, and the senior citizens\u2019 share rose from 16 to 22 percent. This typical mid-term dynamic, which favors Republicans, was exacerbated by the fact that Republican state governments have recently passed restrictive voting laws, such as ID requirements, making it more difficult for many young, urban, or low-income people to vote.\n\nGerrymandering may have also depressed turnout. Thanks to partisan redrawing of House district boundaries, and the more efficient distribution of Republican voters across suburban and rural districts, Democrats are disproportionately packed into urban congressional seats. That has given Republicans an enormous advantage relative to their actual popularity. In 2012, Republicans retained their House majority despite winning 1.4 million fewer votes for House seats than Democrats. (Total House vote data is not yet available for this year\u2019s election.)\n\nIn states without a Senate race, the only federal election this year was for Congress. But if you live in a non-competitive congressional district, as a large and growing share of Americans do, it seems less worthwhile to climb the barriers to voting that Republicans have erected.\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that the voters in this year\u2019s election were disproportionately old, white, rich, and Republican. Political scientist Patrick Egan, writing in the Washington Post, called it, \u201cthe most unrepresentative Senate election since World War II.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s set aside for a minute the questions of who voted and who didn\u2019t, and just look at the question of whether voters were casting their ballots based on energy issues.\n\nWhen it comes to the environment and energy, if you look at public opinion polls, majorities of Americans claim to simultaneously hold opposing views. Two-thirds accept climate science and want the government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, but majorities also want to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would exacerbate climate change. So yes, as API loves to point out, Keystone polls well, but that\u2019s because the average person asked about it knows nothing about the issue, couldn\u2019t find the pipeline\u2019s route on a map, and isn\u2019t being asked to reconcile his concern about climate change with his vague sense that North American energy production is good for the economy.\n\nLest you doubt that there is any disconnect between what people believe and how they voted on Tuesday, consider that some of the very same states that elected Republican senators or governors simultaneously passed liberal ballot measures, like raising the minimum wage or legalizing medicinal marijuana.\n\nTake a look at Iowa, where a majority of the same voters who chose right-wing Republican Joni Ernst also told exit pollsters that they favor legal abortion, legal gay marriage, and raising the minimum wage \u2014 all of which Ernst opposes. In Colorado, even as a 49 percent plurality of voters elected rabidly anti-abortion rights Rep. Cory Gardner to the Senate, more than 60 percent said abortion and gay marriage should be legal and illegal immigrants should get a path to citizenship. They also voted down a fetal personhood amendment, while Gardner is a cosponsor of a federal fetal personhood bill.\n\nPerhaps their incoherence reflects ignorance of what the parties and candidates stand for. Although polling on that is hard to come by, there is ample evidence that most Americans do not know enough about politics to make informed decisions. In September, only 36 percent of Americans could name the parties each in control of the House and the Senate. Of course, anyone who does not know which party controls the House or Senate is incapable of intelligently judging the record of the incumbent candidate or party.\n\nExit polls did not ask about climate change, but there is no reason to think that it\u2019s the lone case of voters\u2019 behavior actually matching their positions. Four of the eight fracking bans on local ballots passed while the other four failed. Some climate hawks, like Senator-elect Gary Peters of Michigan, won. Others, like South Dakota\u2019s Rick Weiland and Colorado\u2019s Mark Udall, lost.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for signals of an ideological shift, you can find evidence to support almost any argument, or none at all. Instead, it\u2019s best to understand that the mid-terms in a president\u2019s second term are traditionally dominated by a throw-the-bums-out, anti-incumbent sentiment, directed at the president\u2019s party.\n\nOn top of that, the President is black, and a number of states with Senate seats up this year are the ones that have been slowly turning red ever since the Democrats passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The anti-Obama passion of many Republican voters in the South and Appalachia has little to do with his record, or that of the Democratic senators they just ousted.\n\nMore Louisiana Republicans blame Barack Obama for the federal government\u2019s bungled response to Hurricane Katrina than George W. Bush, who was actually president at the time. When Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., observed last week that Obama\u2019s unpopularity in her state is partly because the South \u201chas not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans,\u201d Republicans and conservatives cried crocodile tears. How dare Landrieu suggest race has anything to do with their seething hatred for Obama!\n\nBut it does. As a 2005 study in the American Journal of Political Science demonstrated, white Southerners with racist attitudes are more likely to vote Republican even when adjusting for their political ideology. Landrieu\u2019s main Republican opponent, Rep. Bill Cassidy, claimed Louisianans don\u2019t like Obama because he won\u2019t approve Keystone and they don\u2019t like Obamacare. Really, how much more would Louisianans like Obama if he had approved Keystone?\n\nIn Kentucky, Democratic Senate nominee Alison Lundergan Grimes refused to say whether she voted for Obama, but said she is a \u201cHillary Clinton Democrat.\u201d Since Clinton and Obama are cut from the same ideological cloth, this is obviously just a code for \u201cwhite Democrat.\u201d Grimes lost her race against Mitch McConnell, just as Landrieu is likely to lose her runoff against Cassidy.\n\nObama is similarly unpopular for the same obvious reasons in West Virginia and Arkansas, which replaced Democratic senators with Republicans on Tuesday. The Republican takeover in all these states has been a long time coming, for reasons that have nothing to do with what voters think about pipelines and oil rigs.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://grist.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/befuddled-voter.jpg?w=50", "sailthru.author": "Ben Adler", "pocket-site-verification": "600c3e036c3d0b8412be38a78681c7", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Grist", "description": "Big Oil and its Republican lackeys claim that the recent elections give them a mandate to drill.
