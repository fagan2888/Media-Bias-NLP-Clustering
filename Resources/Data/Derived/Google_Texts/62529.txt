Hillary Clinton will mark a first in the digital campaign era on Tuesday, when she’ll become the first presidential candidate to answer questions on Quora.



Clinton will discuss ways to reduce costs for prescription drugs, and will defend Obamacare in a Q&A on the site, according to a Clinton campaign official.



According to an excerpt provided to Mashable from a Clinton campaign official, Clinton will outline her cost reducing prescription drug plan, which includes capping out-of-pocket costs and introducing more generic drugs to the market.

Reducing drug costs has become a hot-button issue in 2016, after Turing Pharmaceuticals CEO Martin Shkreli came under fire for raising the price of a 62-year-old blood-poisoning drug to $750 from $13.50 a pill.



“We need to put a limit on what Americans are paying out-of-pocket for their medications,” Clinton will write in one answer, according to the official. “I’ve introduced a plan that would require health insurance companies to cap out-of-pocket spending at $250 for covered prescriptions, which would save people with serious or chronic illnesses hundreds or even thousand of dollars every year.”



On Obamacare, President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, Clinton will blast Republicans who have held dozens of repeal votes.



“We should build on its success, not start from scratch,” Clinton will say. “And we can’t let Republicans in Congress repeal or weaken it (which they’ve voted to do more than 50 times) and risk returning to the days when insurance companies wrote their own rules.”



Founded by two former employees at Facebook, Quora allows users to ask questions about certain topics, which are then answered by the website’s community of users. Famous names who have answered questions on the site include Obama, Ashton Kutcher and the Swedish DJ Avicii.
