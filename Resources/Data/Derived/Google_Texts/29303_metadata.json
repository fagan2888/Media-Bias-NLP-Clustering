But Liff kept working for the government and was awarded jobs under similar circumstances at OPM, the auditors said.\n\nThe report named Kay Ely, who, at the time, was the associate director for OPM\u2019s Human Resource Solution\u2019s office, as a key player in the scheme to get Liff jobs. The scheme involved hiring Liff as a subcontractor\u2014but to avoid forcing him to compete among other bidders, they used a small business set-aside to let him immediately have the contract without competition.\n\nRelated: EPA Contractors Use Private Gym Paid for by Taxpayers\n\nThe small business set-aside was a contractor called Information Experts, which would receive a small portion of the contract, while Liff did the work and received the rest.\n\n\u201cI could bring him on through an 8(a) vendor we already have so the costs would be a little more then [sic] what he costs,\u201d an OPM official whose name was redacted wrote.\n\nLiff crafted the bills and submitted them through Information Experts\u2014charging basically whatever he wanted.\n\n\u201cIf we need to make the price more palatable, we could add another say 200 hours or so to the estimate, and then reduce the hourly rate by 10 percent to get the same final number,\u201d Liff was quoted in the report.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just Liff, though. The auditors said the culture of contract misconduct is widespread.\n\nA separate report released last week by the General Service Administration\u2019s Inspector General revealed that the contractor selected to run the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center was selected through favoritism by the General Services Administration, adding that the contractor mismanaged the building and did not deserve the contract.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that a culture may have developed within these departments where the type of improper behavior uncovered in this investigation was deemed to be acceptable,\" the report said. \u201cNo one appeared to have considered whether the government was receiving the best value for its money.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s not breaking news that the government has a", "title": "Agencies\u2019 \u201cCulture of Favoritism\u201d Subverts Competition", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/26/Agencies-Culture-Favoritism-Subverts-Competition", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/26/Agencies-Culture-Favoritism-Subverts-Competition", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "It\u2019s not breaking news that the government has a", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3a9\"", "article_summary": "A new report from the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s Inspector General reveals that the problem might be more engrained in the government\u2019s culture than previously thought.\nThe auditors said the culture of contract misconduct is widespread.\nBut Liff kept working for the government and was awarded jobs under similar circumstances at OPM, the auditors said.\nIt\u2019s not breaking news that the government has a serious issue with the way it manages its contractors.\n\u201cNo one appeared to have considered whether the government was receiving the best value for its money.\u201dTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:"}
