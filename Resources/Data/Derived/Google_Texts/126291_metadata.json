But the National Border Patrol Council, which represents line agents, said the bill doesn\u2019t add any new agents, nor does it update their training or firepower, which means it won\u2019t improve the situation.\n\n\u201cThis legislation speaks about metrics but frankly does not provide either the strategy or the resources necessary to achieve them,\u201d said Shawn Moran, spokesman for the union. \u201cWe need real solutions on the border, where the trends are moving in the wrong direction, with increased apprehensions, more aggressive action from smugglers and drug cartels and continued threats from terrorists.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: GOP accused of omitting Univision from 2016 debates to \u2018avoid uncomfortable immigration questions\u2019\n\nThe agents\u2019 opposition is a severe blow to GOP leaders, because it will add fuel to conservatives\u2019 belief that the border bill doesn\u2019t go far enough to solve the situation. Republican leaders need near-unanimity within their own ranks because they won\u2019t be able to count on Democratic support to pass their bill.\n\nGOP leaders are still planning for a Wednesday vote but may have to rethink that schedule or make changes to the legislation to assuage conservatives.\n\nWritten by House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Michael T. McCaul, Texas Republican, the bill would direct the Department of Homeland Security to build about 50 miles of additional fencing, fly more drones and add more technology sector by sector along the border and come up with a strategy for catching every single illegal immigrant or smuggler trying to cross high-risk zones within two years and for the entire southwest border within five years.\n\nThe Border Patrol union says the bill needs to be more specific in calling for an additional 5,000 agents on the southwest border \u2014 there are about 20,000 now \u2014 updating their training to a 20-week course and acquiring more M4 rifles and other gear so they can operate out in the field.\n\nThe border debate comes at a time when the numbers signal an increase in illegal immigration. After dropping dramatically from 2006 through 2011, as the U.S. economy soured, illegal crossings on the southern border rose nearly 50 percent from 2011 to 2014, judging by apprehension statistics.\n\nMost strikingly, the Obama administration was caught off-guard last summer by a surge of illegal immigrants from Central America, who overwhelmed the immigration services and exposed serious loopholes in U.S. policy.\n\nMr. Obama, however, contends the border is secure and getting safer. His Homeland Security Secretary, Jeh Johnson, issued a statement last week blasting the McCaul bill, saying it went too far in requiring certain actions. Mr. Johnson said instead of setting new goals and requiring more fencing, Congress should give his department more money so it can pursue its own strategy.\n\n\u201cThe bill does nothing to provide what the Department of Homeland Security really needs from Congress \u2014 appropriated funding to pay for vital homeland security initiatives,\u201d he said.\n\nPart of Congress\u2019 frustration with Mr. Johnson is that his department has been operating for five years without a measure of border security. The department scrapped the old yardstick of number of miles under \u201coperational control\u201d in 2010 and promised a replacement years ago, but still has yet to offer one.\n\nMr. McCaul\u2019s bill would force the department to meet a 100-percent standard, and it would punish top political appointees at the department by denying them the ability to attend conferences or fly on government aircraft for all but the most essential trips if they don\u2019t meet the schedule imposed in the legislation.\n\nThe bill also would give Border Patrol agents unfettered access to federal lands \u2014 solving a problem the agents have raised for years, arguing they often have to fight with the parks or forest services over building towers or responding to illegal immigrant incursions.\n\nMr. McCaul says his bill is a first step, and GOP leaders have promised to tackle bigger immigration policy questions later this year, saying they want to take immigration overhaul step by step.\n\n\u201cThe bill matches resources to needs, putting fencing where fencing is needed and technology where technology is needed. My constituents in my home district and my home state of Texas spoke loud and clear: They want the border secured,\u201d Mr. McCaul said.\n\nHis bill cleared his committee on a party-line vote last Wednesday.\n\nBut the border agents\u2019 opposition will hurt \u2014 and it\u2019s just the latest dent to the bill.\n\nEarlier last week the labor union for immigration officers at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, one of the other immigration agencies, said the bill needs to make it tougher to claim asylum and needs to end the \u201ccatch-and-release\u201d type of policies that allowed most of the illegal immigrants in last summer\u2019s Central American wave to be released into the U.S., where many have since disappeared into the shadows.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Border Patrol agents' labor union announced their opposition Friday to the House GOP's new border security bill, calling it \"window dressing\" that doesn't add any new agents or updated their firepower to get the job done in sealing off the U.S.-Mexico border.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Border Patrol agents\u2019 labor union announced their opposition Friday to the House GOP\u2019s new border security bill, calling it \u201cwindow dressing\u201d that doesn\u2019t add any new agents or updated their firepower to get the job done in sealing off the U.S.-Mexico border.", "title": "Border Patrol agents say GOP\u2019s border security bill is weak \u2018window dressing\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/24/border-patrol-agents-say-gops-border-security-bill/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/24/border-patrol-ap-image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/24/border-patrol-ap-image.jpg", "description": "Border Patrol agents' labor union announced their opposition Friday to the House GOP's new border security bill, calling it \"window dressing\" that doesn't add any new agents or updated their firepower", "card": "summary", "title": "Border Patrol agents say GOP\u2019s border security bill is weak R"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "But the border agents\u2019 opposition will hurt \u2014 and it\u2019s just the latest dent to the bill.\nThe labor union for the nation\u2019s Border Patrol agents announced their opposition Friday to the House GOP\u2019s new border security bill, calling it \u201cwindow dressing\u201d and adding further obstacles to Republican leaders who had hoped to pass the bill in a vote this Wednesday.\n\u201cThe bill does nothing to provide what the Department of Homeland Security really needs from Congress \u2014 appropriated funding to pay for vital homeland security initiatives,\u201d he said.\nPart of Congress\u2019 frustration with Mr. Johnson is that his department has been operating for five years without a measure of border security.\nHis Homeland Security Secretary, Jeh Johnson, issued a statement last week blasting the McCaul bill, saying it went too far in requiring certain actions."}
