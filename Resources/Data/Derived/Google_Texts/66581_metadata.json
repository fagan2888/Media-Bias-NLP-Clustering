For others, a premeditated skit unfolds on the field.\n\nAnd for the select few, finable gyrations take over.\n\nThe sack will forever live in the NFL\u2019s official records, and the sack dance forever emblazoned in the minds of millions watching. The second act is as much a part of the game as the tackle itself, despite the league\u2019s continued efforts to curtail \u201cunsportsmanlike\u201d celebrations.\n\nBroncos linebacker Von Miller knows this. As does his teammate DeMarcus Ware. As do countless other NFL defenders who have turned the sack into an art and the sack dance into the signature scrolled across the bottom of the painting.\n\nWATCH: Top five Broncos, NFL sack dances\n\nWare keeps his autograph uniform. Every sack is followed by the \u201cHulk Smash,\u201d a danced he adopted from former Cowboys safety Keith Davis, who would slam his fists to the turf with fervor each time he sprinted out of the tunnel before the start of a game.\n\n\u201cOne day he was like, \u2018D-Ware, I\u2019m about to retire, man. You don\u2019t have any sack moves. You need a sack dance. You\u2019ll make it popular,\u2019 \u201d Ware recalled. \u201cAfter I started doing it, I got so used to it and it became mine.\n\n\u201cNever going to change it. Sometimes simple is good, right?\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s celebrations eschew simplicity.\n\nHis eccentricity extends from his wardrobe (remember that fox hat?) to his dances. His latest, a sexually explicit re-enactment of a Key & Peele skit, went viral and earned the praises of his teammates and many fans.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, yeah, yeah,\u201d Broncos defensive end Derek Wolfe said. \u201cThat was a good one.\u201d\n\nIt also cost Miller $11,567, made payable to the NFL.\n\n\u201cYes, we have talked about that,\u201d Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said with a grin. \u201cWe need to find a new one.\u201d\n\nThe penalty for \u201cunsportsmanlike conduct\u201d didn\u2019t keep Miller from mocking the league and its fine system with his \u201cthree pumps\u201d as he sprinted out of the tunnel before the start of the Broncos\u2019 victory over the Vikings a week ago. And it didn\u2019t keep him from continuing to press the league\u2019s buttons when he and Ware sacked Teddy Bridgewater in the second quarter.\n\nMORE: Denver Broncos Sack Tracker\n\nHis legs in position and his hands behind his head, Miller glanced side to side as if to check for the NFL\u2019s watchful eye before dropping his hands and carrying on.\n\nJust keeping you on your toes, NFL.\n\nThe punishment for a play that has been so crucial to the Broncos\u2019 season \u2014 they lead the league with 18 sacks \u2014 is seemingly a punishment to the act of defending itself.\n\nOr so the players say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to come by, so if you get a sack you should be able to pretty much do whatever,\u201d Broncos linebacker Shaquil Barrett said. \u201cYou probably have a little censorship in your dances. So (Von) probably should have done two pumps and not three.\u201d\n\nThe league\u2019s censorship, however, stretches back more than 30 years. It wasn\u2019t until 1982, the year Ware was born, that the league first began to credit defenders for quarterback sacks. Two years later, players were banned from celebrating them.\n\nBefore Miller, before Ware, before Michael Strahan and before Bruce Smith there was Mark Gastineau, a member of the Jets\u2019 \u201cNew York Sack Exchange\u201d defensive line who danced with as much vigor as he poured into each sack. His signature shimmy was gaudy. It was excessive. It was in-your-face. It led to fights.\n\nAnd his dance, in part, led the league to outlaw them.\n\nInformally it instituted The Gastineau Rule. Formally it was Rule 12, Section 2, Article 14, which NFL owners passed in March 1984: No \u201cprolonged, excessive, or premeditated celebration by individual players or groups of players.\u201d\n\nOver the years, the banned celebrations after sacks have been detailed to a laughable degree, with the NFL\u2019s reins on growing tighter with each rule change. No props. No dancing on the ground. No \u201cthroat slash; machine-gun salute; sexually suggestive gestures; prolonged gyrations; or stomping on a team logo.\u201d And no \u201csack dances; home run swing; incredible hulk; spiking the ball; spinning the ball; throwing or shoving the ball; pointing; pointing the ball; verbal taunting; military salute; standing over an opponent (prolonged and with provocation); or dancing.\u201d\n\nSTATISTICS: 2015 NFL sack leaders\n\nThe rules, enforced subjectively and inconsistently to touchdown and sack celebrations, have seemed to only encourage more creative moves. The fist-pumps and screams have given way to choreographed dances, such as Jared Odrick\u2019s \u201d Pee-wee Herman Dance\u201d and J.J. Watt\u2019s tailored mockeries of quarterbacks.\n\nThe threat of a double fine, handed out to repeat offenders, kept Miller from performing another explicit dance last Sunday. But, perhaps, only temporarily. The league, try as it might, cannot thwart that split-second when the sack master turns to sack artist.\n\nAnd it cannot stop Miller from dancing. Few can.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to save that ($23,000) for big time,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThem pumps are expensive. I\u2019m saving that for a big-time sack.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "To NFL\u2019s chagrin, sack dances as memorable as tackles themselves", "title": "To NFL\u2019s chagrin, sack dances as memorable as tackles themselves", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/10/to-nfls-chagrin-sack-dances-as-memorable-as-tackles-themselves/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151010__20151011_C1_SP09DANCE1p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151010__20151011_C1_SP09DANCE1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-10T18:36:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T05:08:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The sack will forever live in the NFL\u2019s official records, and the sack dance forever emblazoned in the minds of millions watching.\nWATCH: Top five Broncos, NFL sack dancesWare keeps his autograph uniform.\nAs do countless other NFL defenders who have turned the sack into an art and the sack dance into the signature scrolled across the bottom of the painting.\nYou need a sack dance.\nThe league, try as it might, cannot thwart that split-second when the sack master turns to sack artist."}
