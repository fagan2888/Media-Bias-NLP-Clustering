Fool me twice, shame on me.\n\nObama\u2019s slip of the tongue exposes something even more troubling than the number of conservatives willing to trust a proven liar in the Oval Office.\n\nThis latest revelation confirms the darkest suspicions surrounding the international agreement Obama wants Congress to rubber stamp.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions read the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership and was shocked to learn that it is \u201ca living agreement\u201d that can be rewritten and updated at any time in the future.\n\nIf you think the U.S. Congress will be involved in updating the agreement, think again. Obamatrade creates a new global authority, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission, and vests it with powers to enforce the deal and admit new members, even China, on its own.\n\nTellingly, the midwives pushing Obamatrade through the Senate killed an amendment that would have required congressional approval for China to join. Though not yet born, this new regent already has squires jealously guarding its powers against intruders, including our elected representatives.\n\nThe White House has not shown us the creature it hopes Congress will christen before it adjourns to celebrate our nation\u2019s birthday on July 4. But we can discern a shape in the cradle beneath the blanket of secrecy, and one notices a resemblance between this infant and the sovereignty-eating beast of Brussels, the European Union.\n\nLike the EU, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has the ability to admit other countries, simply on the basis of consensus agreement of existing members. That is unlike any previous trade deal the U.S. Congress has approved.\n\nThe treaty that launched the European Union established a European Commission to enforce the provisions of the pact. Similarly, the TPP\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership Commission will ensure enforcement of the agreement and must consider the opinions of other international organizations.\n\nThe European Union was founded on \u201cfour freedoms\u201d: the free flow of people, goods, money and services among members. We learned at a recent White House press conference the Trans-Pacific Partnership will ensure \u201cpeople, goods and money will flow freely within the Asia Pacific region.\u201d\n\nThe European Common Market was always about more than eliminating tariffs between Belgium and France. Asked why TPP\u2019s sibling the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership isn\u2019t referred to as a \u201cfree trade agreement,\u201d or FTA, Obama\u2019s top trade negotiators said its \u201cbecause it is so much broader than trade.\u201d These agreements, they said, \u201care about figuring out better ways of integrating our \u2026 economies\u201d \u2013 \u201cbroader than the traditional FTA.\u201d\n\nMaybe the similarities between Obamatrade and the European Union are just a coincidence. Maybe.\n\nBut this is certain: there is only one way to be sure we won\u2019t wake up one day to find our food, energy and businesses are being regulated not by bureaucrats in Washington, but in a far-away capital.\n\nSen. Sessions says the White House must come clean on the nature of this \u201cliving agreement\u201d with nations known and unknown, and the powers of the new international authority it will spawn.\n\nIt must do so before Congress can put Obamatrade on the fast track.\n\nThese GOP senators are keeping mum on whether they\u2019ve read Obamatrade.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "In 2010, President Obama sold Obamacare with the line \u201cIf you like your insurance, you can keep it.\u201d Millions of canceled policies later we discovered the line was a lie.
