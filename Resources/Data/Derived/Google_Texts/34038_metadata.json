College football players are reported to sustain as many as 1,350 subconcussive head impacts a season, the researchers said in background notes.\n\nPeople who suffer full-fledged concussions often complain of symptoms related to near point of convergence, said Dr. Andrew Lee, chair of ophthalmology at Houston Methodist Hospital in Texas.\n\n\"If you can't converge properly, you'll get a double image and things will be blurry,\" said Lee, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.\n\nThe new report follows a previous study in which Kawata and his colleagues asked soccer players to perform 10 \"headers,\" in which they used their heads to stop a soccer ball shot out of a pitching machine.\n\nThe researchers found the players' near point of convergence \"was pretty noticeably worse, and this phenomenon was not recovered after one day of resting, which means it's a very slow recovery even after a mild head impact,\" Kawata said.\n\nTo take their study further, the research team recruited 29 Temple University football players. They fitted them with a \"smart\" mouthguard that tracked the number of head impacts received during play and the magnitude of head acceleration during those impacts.\n\nThe researchers then followed the players through five preseason practices, sorting them into two groups -- one that received higher-impact blows to the head during play, and those who received lower-impact blows. None of the blows was strong enough to cause a concussion.\n\nThese subconcussive head impacts didn't cause any symptoms noticeable to players, regardless of how often and how hard they were hit, researchers found.\n\nHowever, vision tests found the higher-impact group suffered from compromised near point of convergence. Those vision problems remained three weeks later when tested at the end of training camp.\n\nBut after three weeks' rest postseason, their eyes returned to normal, according to follow-up vision exams.\n\nThe findings were reported May 12 in the journal JAMA Ophthalmology.\n\nAlthough more research involving a larger group is needed, Lee said this pilot study shows a vision test could be useful in judging the severity of a brain injury, either on the sidelines or following a traumatic accident.\n\n\"It could be used possibly as a screening device and a diagnostic device,\" Lee said. \"The convergence problem might be the tip of the iceberg, in terms of more significant neurocognitive deficits.\"\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on convergence, visit the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 HealthDay.
