As comics have taken over TV and the movies, that status quo hasn\u2019t changed much. Preposterously, we\u2019re still waiting for a Wonder Woman movie. Marvel women are making some gains on the small screen, with upcoming TV shows lined up for \u201cJessica Jones\u201d (a private eye/former superhero created by Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos) and \u201cAgent Carter\u201d (Captain America\u2019s \u201940s love interest). But overall, the boys are still dominating.\n\nYet change is finally coming from an unexpected source: comic books themselves. This year, there has been a striking attempt by publishers (particularly Image and Marvel) to launch new series with female leads. To celebrate this welcome development, here are nine of the best new female-centric series.\n\n1) \u201cShe-Hulk\u201d\n\nJennifer Walters aka She-Hulk is a superhero and a lawyer, and this new series by Charles Soule (also a lawyer) and Javier Pulido (not a lawyer, but a pop-art-influenced phenom) takes this giant green lady through the trials of establishing her own practice, punching the bad guys in the head, and seeking asylum for the bratty child of Dr. Doom. In the same spirit as \u201cHawkeye\u201d and \u201cThe Superior Foes of Spider-Man,\u201d \u201cShe-Hulk\u201dis part of a Marvel movement toward independent-flavored versions of corporate creations that don\u2019t shy away from comedy.\n\n2) \u201cRat Queens\u201d\n\nThe Rat Queens are an all-female gang who have foul mouths, sharp swords and hilarious adventures. The four leads \u2014 Hannah, Violet, Dee, and Betty \u2014 feel like real-life friends who bicker, joke, do drugs, have sex, eat candy, drink too much and get into trouble. Only these friends settle their problems with badass swordplay and magic. Roc Upchurch\u2019s cartoony yet detailed art is like a fairy tale directed by Tarantino. Kurtis J. Wiebe\u2019s dialogue is quick and funny: This series has enough humor to work as a quality sitcom, which it might end up being, since it\u2019s going to be an animated pilot. This Image comic is a strong challenger to \u201cSaga\u201d as the best comic out there.\n\n3) \u201cLumberjanes\u201d\n\nPublished by BOOM! Studios, here\u2019s another series about a group of female friends, this time of a younger variety: the Lumberjanes are girls at a scout camp where the challenges go far beyond arts and crafts or making s\u2019mores: At this camp, there are three-eyed wolves, cryptic messages, and mysterious bearwomen. This supernatural mystery story is written with a ton of lively humor by Noelle Stevenson and Grace Ellis, and Brooke Allen\u2019s art is like a children\u2019s book for adults.\n\n4) \u201cBlack Widow\u201d\n\nThanks to Scarlett Johansson\u2019s appearances in \u201cIron Man 2,\u201d \u201cThe Avengers\u201d and the frankly spectacular \u201cCaptain America: The Winter Soldier,\u201d Natasha Romanoff has never been more prominent in pop culture. In this series, Phil Noto\u2019s beautiful, painted art has a classical elegance that\u2019s matched by Nathan Edmondson\u2019s stories and dialogue, which bring out the inherent conflict in Romanoff, who\u2019s always been a morally flexible, female ex-KGB agent in a mostly male, self-righteous superhero world. Hopefully this series\u2019 success and the Widow\u2019s strong presence in \u201cWinter Soldier\u201d are foreshadowing a Black Widow solo film.\n\n5) \u201cVelvet\u201d\n\nSpeaking of spies, Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting \u2014 who created the comic book version of \u201cThe Winter Soldier\u201d \u2014 have launched another gem for Image. \u201cVelvet,\u201d starring Velvet Templeton, puts a new spin on spy stories by taking an overlooked, underdeveloped character type and making her the star. Velvet is introduced as a secretary at a super-duper-secret spy agency, \u00e0 la Ms. Moneypenny. Unbeknownst to all, Ms. Templeton is more interesting and deadly than anyone else at the agency. It\u2019s a fresh story by a confident creative team that excels at the spy genre. For another great series with a female protagonist, check out Brubaker\u2019s \u201cFatale\u201d: an insanely addictive horror noir.\n\n6) \u201cElektra\u201d\n\nForget the Jennifer Garner \u201cElektra\u201d movie \u2014 and the Ben Affleck \u201cDaredevil\u201d movie while you\u2019re at it. Elektra has been one of Daredevil\u2019s best supporting characters since she was created by Frank Miller (\u201cThe Dark Knight Returns,\u201d \u201cSin City,\u201d \u201c300\u201d) as an ex-girlfriend and freelance ninja assassin (and you thought your ex was a handful). Though Elektra has occasionally gotten her own series \u2014 notably, the immortal \u201cElektra Assassin\u201d by Miller and Bill Sienkiewicz \u2014 she\u2019s mostly remained a supporting character, so it\u2019s welcome to see her take the spotlight, especially in a series that is so visually striking. Writer Haden Blackman comes fresh from a stint on DC\u2019s \u201cBatwoman\u201d with J.H. Williams, and in some ways Elektra is following that series\u2019 artsy path, as Mike Del Mundo\u2019s painted panels kaleidoscope into each other, creating a dreamlike feast for the eyes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From \"Rat Queens\" to \"Black Widow,\" comics have never starred more complicated, compelling female superheroes", "title": "9 series that prove 2014 is the year of the female-centric comic book", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From \"Rat Queens\" to \"Black Widow,\" comics have never starred more complicated, compelling female superheroes", "title": "9 series that prove 2014 is the year of the female-centric comic book", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/06/9_series_that_prove_2014_is_the_year_of_the_female_centric_comic_book/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/ms_marvel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From \"Rat Queens\" to \"Black Widow,\" comics have never starred more complicated, compelling female superheroes", "title": "9 series that prove 2014 is the year of the female-centric comic book", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/ms_marvel.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mark Peters", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Comics, Editor's Picks, image, Marvel, rat queens, she-hulk", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38a9\"", "article_summary": "This Image comic is a strong challenger to \u201cSaga\u201d as the best comic out there.\nTopics: Comics, Editor's Picks, image, Marvel, rat queens, she-hulk, Entertainment NewsComic books have traditionally been the most testosterone-marinated of genres.\nThis year, there has been a striking attempt by publishers (particularly Image and Marvel) to launch new series with female leads.\n5) \u201cVelvet\u201dSpeaking of spies, Ed Brubaker and Steve Epting \u2014 who created the comic book version of \u201cThe Winter Soldier\u201d \u2014 have launched another gem for Image.\nTo celebrate this welcome development, here are nine of the best new female-centric series."}
