Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly fired back at "Daily Show" host Jon Stewart Wednesday, saying Stewart lives in "left-wing fantasyland."Stewart on Tuesday accused O'Reilly of "dipping whole-scale into the full Fox scandal grab bag" during his interview with President Barack Obama before Sunday's Super Bowl.O'Reilly asked Obama about the Benghazi attack, the IRS scandal and the Obamacare website rollout debacle. Stewart said "many of those issues" had been investigated "on multiple occasions."Stewart said he would have preferred that O'Reilly ask about "loose nukes, Middle East peace, trade regulations, and the environment."In his opening segment, titled "Making Jon Stewart Understand America," O'Reilly said, "These issues aren’t important to Jon Stewart or even to the president. They don't see them as vital because they don’t pertain to social justice or global warming. So, if I ask about those issues, I'm a dufus, a scandalmonger. That's the spin."O'Reilly called the claim that the issues had been investigated a "farce," noting that there has been no final report issued on the IRS' targeting of conservative groups, no one has been arrested in the deadly Benghazi attack, and the Obamacare fallout has not subsided."Are you hearing me out there in left-wing fantasyland?" O'Reilly asked.Kirsten Powers, a liberal commentator who appears regularly on O'Reilly's show, wasn't impressed with Stewart either."I was interested to learn about the multiple investigations that have been done, particularly the IRS," she told O'Reilly. No conclusions have been reached, and nobody has been held accountable, she said.O'Reilly said he had invited Stewart to appear on the "Factor," but he had yet to accept."We'll send a car for him that is not subsidized by the government," O'Reilly said.
