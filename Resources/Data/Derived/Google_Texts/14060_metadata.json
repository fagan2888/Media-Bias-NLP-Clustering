Women need to weigh the risks of pregnancy with the risks of hormonal contraception, experts advise. But the key thing to remember is that the risks remain rare.\n\nDr. Michael Policar is an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at U.C. San Francisco. \u201cIf you take a rare event, make it a little more common, it is still a rare event,\u201d he told NPR \u2014 but still believes that studies are needed that compare NuvaRing head-to-head with other forms of contraception.\n\nNPR does a great service explaining absolute vs. relative risk. From their analysis:\n\nThe nonprofit sex education website Besider.org lays out absolute risks of blood clots: For young women who are not pregnant and not using a birth control method with estrogen, the risk of forming a blood clot is about 1 in 5,000 per year; when using birth control methods with estrogen, that risk may be as high as 1 in 1,000 per year. Women need to compare that to the risk of pregnancy, too, says Bill Albert, chief program officer for the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, which runs Bedsider. The risk of forming a blood clot while pregnant shoots up to about 1 in 340, Albert says. Given the various complications of an unplanned pregnancy, Albert says, \u201cskipping birth control altogether for fear of blood clots isn\u2019t the way to protect oneself.\u201d\n\nSome advocates have been pushing for more disclosure of NuvaRing\u2019s risks \u2014 but believe the product does not have to be pulled from the market. \u201cEven when there\u2019s scientific uncertainty \u2026 that information can be presented in a way that women can deal with,\u201d Amy Allina, with the National Women\u2019s Health Network, told NPR.
