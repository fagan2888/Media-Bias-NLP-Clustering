The case takes its inspiration from a recent ruling in California in which a judge ruled the state\u2019s tenure laws violated students\u2019 right to a \u201csound, basic education.\u201d\n\nBut despite her group\u2019s pledge to \u201cbring transparency\u201d to the education debate, Brown\u2019s campaign against the teachers unions has been dogged by questions about its financial backers. In the weeks since launching the Partnership, Brown has repeatedly deflected questions from reporters about her donors, saying simply that they hail from \u201cboth sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\nIn her appearance on \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d Brown did little to quell suspicion. \u201cI\u2019m not going to reveal who the donors are because the people are out,\u201d she told host Stephen Colbert, pointing to a window where a dozen or so protesters had gathered with signs reading \u201cCampbell Brown doesn\u2019t speak for me\u201d and \u201cWho funds you?\u201d Brown said that if she disclosed her backers, critics \u201care going to go after people who are funding us.\u201d\n\nWell, yes, that\u2019s usually how public debates work. Those interested in the outcome of a policy question or seeking to make a change don\u2019t just get what they want automatically; they have to make their case. This often involves pushback from those who disagree with you \u2014 your motives are questioned, your connections. People say unflattering things about you. Sometimes, meanies in the opposite camp even take to the streets to express their views. Democracy isn\u2019t always nice; it requires, in the words of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, \u201ccivic courage.\u201d If the pearl-clutching millionaires behind Campbell Brown\u2019s lawsuit are too emotionally fragile to withstand any sort of public scrutiny, they have no business wading into a debate whose outcome will affect millions of students.\n\nBrown\u2019s secrecy about her funders is especially unconscionable given her background as a journalist. Her organization claims it wants to encourage debate about public education. But if anything, the Partnership\u2019s lack of transparency only makes open dialogue more difficult. Without knowing who is behind the effort to get rid of teacher tenure, it\u2019s difficult to tell if they are acting in the best interests of students or whether they are among the for-profit education entrepreneurs looking to cash in on the privatization of public education, which has become a multibillion-dollar industry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anchor turned teacher tenure foe says revealing her group's donors could lead to pushback.
