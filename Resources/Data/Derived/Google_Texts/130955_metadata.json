State, go to postand courier.com/SCState.\n\nPieces of white printer paper taped to near-empty vending machines warn that prices have gone up.\n\nThe 119-year-old barbershop in the Kirkland W. Green Student Center shut its blinds in March.\n\nLast week, the college\u2019s interim president announced nine buildings on campus were closing, including the I.P. Stanback Museum and Planetarium, to save money on heating and maintenance.\n\nFor the first time in years, S.C. State has a balanced budget \u2014 made possible through millions of dollars worth of cuts that some worry will do more harm than good.\n\nOn June 30, the board approved a $67.8 million budget for fiscal year 2016 based on a projected enrollment of 2,650 students. It includes more than $4 million in cuts to student scholarships and mandatory 12-day furloughs for all employees.\n\nUnder the new budget, more than a dozen staff members have lost their jobs. Twenty-three faculty members have been let go. The instructors who are left will have to add an extra class to their course load.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re another Greece. That is, you cannot improve Greece or the university in this matter by demanding that you live within your means if means are defined as the amount of money generated by enrollment,\u201d said Willie Legette, a political science professor at S.C. State. \u201cThere are consequences to cuts.\u201d\n\nLike employee morale and student recruitment. Legette worries budget reductions will hurt S.C. State\u2019s ability to compete against other institutions for talented students at a time when the university depends on student tuition more than ever.\n\n\u201cWhen you come to an institution that\u2019s been cut to the bare bones, it makes it harder for the institution to compete,\u201d said the Rev. Joe Darby, a S.C. State alumnus and vice president of the Charleston NAACP. \u201cTime will tell. To me, they look a little bit draconian.\u201d\n\nIn the past several years, S.C. State has suffered massive deficits, top-level turnover, waning enrollment and a public corruption scandal that landed its former board chairman, Jonathan Pinson, in prison. Four of Pinson\u2019s co-conspirators were sentenced to three years on probation and restitution earlier this week.\n\nFor these reasons, the university has been threatened with closure and losing its accreditation. The new interim board of trustees, appointed by state officials and charged with untangling its financial mess, has vowed not to take any option off the table, including major budget reductions.\n\nEarlier this year, the university launched a three-year capital campaign to raise $20 million to help pay off its debts and fund scholarships for students. Although total donations are down this year, more people are giving, according to Acting President Franklin Evans. He needs alumni \u201cto step up in a major way.\u201d\n\nOn Friday morning, in the school\u2019s engineering auditorium, Evans made his appeal to more than 200 alumni at S.C. State\u2019s annual alumni convention.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely important for alumni to reengage in the university,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI appreciate the $25, the $50, even the $1,000 (donations), but when you look at the cost of education for one student \u2014 in-state, about $22,000, out-of-state, $31,000 \u2014 the $25, even the $1,000, only takes a little bit off.\u201d\n\nAmid the turmoil, a few glimmers of hope have emerged. In June, the university\u2019s regional accrediting agency allowed S.C. State to keep its accreditation and remain on probation for another year. Then the state Budget and Control Board agreed to extend S.C. State\u2019s $6 million loan repayment to the year 2020. At Friday\u2019s convention, alumni, meanwhile, were largely optimistic about the school\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the university is still in a crisis mode,\u201d said Bill Hamilton, of the class of 1973. \u201cBut I think we will climb out of this hole and be a viable institution again.\u201d\n\nSo far, 2,513 students have enrolled in the coming school year. Evans said he expects to see an influx of 500 students enroll in the next 30 days, bringing total enrollment closer to last year\u2019s level. Evans acknowledged the additional hardship students and parents will face with limited scholarships available, but he said the cuts were necessary to maintain financial stability.\n\n\u201cWe have to kind of multitask and not only try to reach (students) through scholarships and talk about the good and value that our programs bring, but we also have to touch the heart and let them know that coming to South Carolina State is a family environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do more than just give you a degree; we help you develop as individuals and that\u2019s what we\u2019re selling at South Carolina State.\u201d\n\nReach Deanna Pan at 937-5764.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "S.C.
