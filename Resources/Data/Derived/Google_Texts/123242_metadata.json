Integrated solutions provide maximum visibility not only on scheduling, but also labor costs, skills mix and coverage requirements.\n\n\u201cSeamless integration with the time and attendance system decreases duplication and errors, increases visibility to staff approaching overtime, allows for actual hour versus scheduled hour reporting and provides the data to monitor hours for Affordable Care Act employment status definition monitoring,\u201d says Carol Ballou, senior healthcare marketing manager at Kronos.\n\nIntegrated solutions also allow supervisors to manage labor costs on the fly and avoid overtime costs, Aslanyan adds.\n\n3\n\nTracking and matching features are at the heart of the best scheduling systems. Accurately matching staff skills to resident acuity levels and census thresholds, and tracking and maintaining employee-resident assignments are a critical part of care and continuity, and staff satisfaction, adds Abercrombie.\n\nAt the end of the day, \u201cscheduling tools help you focus most on the needs of your residents,\u201d says Udi Polonsky, the CEO of LINTECH.\n\n4\n\nChances are very good many staff are part of the Millennial generation, so your scheduling system should be feature-rich in online and mobile access.\n\n\u201cIt's no longer request and wait,\u201d says Aslanyan. \u201cThe workforce is being managed in real-time today.\u201d\n\nThis will go a long way to creating transparency, decreasing absenteeism and increasing staff acceptance, experts say. Such transparency can quickly mitigate issues where a \u201cscheduler [is] playing favorites and loading up a handful of \u2018BFFs' with all of the facility's overtime,\u201d adds Woodka. \u201cMore even distribution of open shifts and necessary overtime can make a significant impact to improving staff morale and retention.\u201d\n\nMany systems allow staff to not only view their hours online or by phone, but also self-schedule when shifts open and request vacation or personal time off or shift changes, says Randell Johnson, marketing director, Prime Care Technologies, Inc. Communication also is paramount.\n\nYour automated system should allow staff to receive alerts of shift changes and openings and communicate to supervisors and one another, he adds.\n\n\u201cOnline and mobile scheduling can help improve employee engagement as they gain more control over their work preferences and schedules,\u201d Woodka notes.\n\n5\n\nThe first 30 days\n\ndeploying any new system inside an organization generally determines how successful it will be.\n\n\u201cThe rollout of the system is critical,\u201d says Kirby Cunningham, RN, vice president of strategic clinical initiatives at AOD Software.\n\nStaff meetings and training are essential to the effort, he adds. n\n\n\u2013 John Hall", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,forms.mcknights.com,mcknights.com,media.mcknights.com", "news_keywords": "Staff Scheduling", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "McKnight's", "description": "Electronic staff scheduling programs have become so sophisticated, some wonder how anyone performs the task anymore with paper and pencil.
