His guests this week are George Vradenburg, co-founder, USAgainstAlzheimer\u2019s; Trish Vradenburg, co-Founder, USAgainstAlzheimer\u2019s and Meryl Comer, CEO, Geoffrey Beene Foundation Alzheimer\u2019s Initiative.\n\nArmstrong points out recent statistics that indicate as many as one in nine Americans over the age of 65 has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And the number of those living with the progressive brain disease is expected to rise by 40 percent in the next decade. That means that Alzheimer\u2019s will touch every one of us in some way, he says, adding that the conversation will suggest ways to fight back against the march of Alzheimer\u2019s disease across the nation.\n\n\u201cHave you ever watched Alzheimer\u2019s take a loved one away from you? It\u2019s a cruel disease. It costs so much, emotionally and financially, and there is still so little that can be done about it. Progress is being made, but we need to do much more. And fast! That\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to meet my guests this week, who have turned the heartbreak Alzheimer\u2019s gave them into the power to help so many others,\u201d Armstrong notes.\n\nThe show, which debuted in January, airs live on Saturday mornings at 10:30 a.m. on News Channel 8 in the Washington, D.C., area, and repeats again at 6:30 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Right Side Forum, an hour-long conservative live news and talk show hosted by columnist Armstrong Williams, will look at the challenge of Alzheimer's disease for the nation as well as the patients and families who must deal with it.
