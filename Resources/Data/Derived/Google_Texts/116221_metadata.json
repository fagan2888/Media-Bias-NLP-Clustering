I am not alone.\n\nEvery family caregiver has a personal story to tell \u2014 which is why caregiving is one of those rare issues that cross geographic and political lines. This isn\u2019t a Democratic issue. It\u2019s not a Republican issue. It\u2019s a family issue.\u00ad\u00ad It\u2019s one shared by more than 42 million Americans who are helping their older loved ones live independently at home, where they want to be.\n\nIn some ways, caregiving is a wonderful gift.\n\nIt affords us the opportunity to:\n\nGive back to the ones who gave so much to us.\n\nSpend quality time with the people we love.\n\nStep back and put things in perspective.\n\nBut it also can be a difficult and trying time \u2014 and it can be isolating.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Advocacy Newsletter\n\nThe level and kind of help family caregivers provide vary greatly, and depend on the circumstances:\n\nSome provide care from a distance, while others are just a short drive away.\n\nSome support aging parents who have physical disabilities, while others are also managing through the challenges that come with Alzheimer\u2019s and other types of dementia.\n\nSome perform complex medical tasks that were once handled only by trained medical personnel.\n\nSome step in to help mom and dad manage their finances.\n\nAnd some caregivers do it all.\n\nToday, the average family caregiver is a 49-year-old working woman who cares for her mother. She provides 20 hours of care per week. Meanwhile, other family caregivers help their loved ones around the clock, and many can\u2019t even take a break. In total, America\u2019s family caregivers provide an estimated $450 billion in unpaid care annually.\n\nBeyond the kitchen table, into legislative chambers\n\nThat\u2019s why AARP is fighting to help this silent army of Americans who lovingly care for their parents, spouses, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles and friends. We\u2019ve seen real progress in states across the country as this personal issue becomes a political issue \u2014 as we move the conversation beyond kitchen tables and into legislative chambers.\n\nWe couldn\u2019t do this work without state legislators, governors and other elected officials\u2014especially those who are at the vanguard of the movement:\n\nWho write, support and move legislation.\n\nWho work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get things done.\n\nWho come together to pass those critical votes that turn bills into law.\n\nCapitol Caregivers\n\nTo recognize the state elected officials who were integral to the passage of key caregiving legislation in 2014, last night at the National Conference of State Legislatures Forum, I introduced our inaugural, bipartisan class of Capitol Caregivers. This class includes 46 state legislators and three governors from 19 states who helped family caregivers by:\n\nThe 2014 Capitol Caregivers are:\n\nState Sen.
