But what\u2019s interesting this election cycle is that both sides are experiencing a particularly bad case of it at the same time given the twin rise of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders. However, neither of these populist demagogues has arisen in an intellectual vacuum. Smart-set folks in their camp \u2014 some reformocons on the right and Paul Krugman on the left \u2014 have for a while now been beating the protectionist drum and blaming China for the travails of the American middleclass.\n\nBut, I note in my column at The Week, it\u2019s far from clear that the American working class is doing as poorly as these brainiacs suggest; or that trade liberalization for China or any other country has hurt rather than helped these folks; or that protectionism would be an effective cure.\n\nThere is evidence suggesting that there are plenty of unfilled jobs, but working class Americans are just not as into them as they used to be. There are many reasons why, but:\n\nChief among them is Congress' relaxation of the rules for claiming Social Security disability during the Reagan years so that a worker's own subjective self assessment \u2014 rubber stamped by his own self-selected physician \u2014 would be enough to file a successful claim.
