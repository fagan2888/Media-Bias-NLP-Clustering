It\u2019s anger about the direction of the country and the one man not up for reelection, President Obama.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTapper then brought on CNN political correspondent John King to explain the results of the poll.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with a number that will make some Democrats happy, but it\u2019s a bit misleading,\u201d King began. \u201cIn the generic ballot, we asked people, \u2018Who are you planning to for in Congress eight days from now?\u2019 It\u2019s a statistical tie, Democrats with a slight edge. But don\u2019t be misled by that, that\u2019s not a horrible number for the Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at this heading into the election,\u201d King continued. \u201cSixty-eight percent of the American people say they are \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018somewhat\u2019 angry. Some are unhappy with the economy, a lot of them are angry at the dysfunction in Washington, Congress does not get high approval ratings either here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s another interesting number; fifty-three percent saying they are \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018somewhat\u2019 scared. No question. We\u2019ve spent the last month talking about what, the ISIS terrorist threat, Americans beheaded overseas, now Ebola, so Americans are scared, angry, a bit anxious heading into Election Day, that\u2019s usually not good for the President\u2019s party, and if I were an incumbent in any party, that would make me a little nervous.\u201d\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter @NussBB", "article_metadata": {"description": "CNN Poll: Anger Driving Midterm Elections", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "CNN Poll: Anger Driving Midterm Elections", "title": "CNN Poll: Anger Driving Midterm Elections - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/10/27/AngerPollScreenshot.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/10/27/cnn-poll-anger-driving-midterm-elections/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CNN Poll: Anger Driving Midterm Elections", "title": "CNN Poll: Anger Driving Midterm Elections - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/10/27/AngerPollScreenshot.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "CNN, Jake Tapper, Twitter,Breitbart TV,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-10-27T15:02:30-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMonday afternoon on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper,\u201d host Jake Tapper reported that a new CNN poll reveals that anger is driving turnout in this year\u2019s midterm elections.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTapper then brought on CNN political correspondent John King to explain the results of the poll.\n\u201cSixty-eight percent of the American people say they are \u2018very\u2019 or \u2018somewhat\u2019 angry.\n\u201cNew CNN polls breaking right now reveal what is driving voters across the nation,\u201d Tapper said.\nIt\u2019s anger about the direction of the country and the one man not up for reelection, President Obama."}
