Balter, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer, is GitHub\u2019s official Government Evangelist. His purpose: to educate government agencies about adopting open-source software.\n\nBalter\u2019s battle is an uphill one, but it\u2019s finally beginning to pay off. GitHub, the nation\u2019s most popular Web-based hosting service for mostly open-source coding projects, has just surpassed 10,000 active users within federal, state, and local governments\u2014a number that\u2019s roughly two and a half times larger than it was at this time last year.\n\nGitHub revolves around the repository\u2014basically, a directory where users store the underlying code for computer programs. In exchange for free hosting, GitHub requires repositories to be public; that means anyone can view or suggest edits to software hosted there. That includes major open source projects like Ruby On Rails and some projects by companies like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe United States Of GitHub\n\n\n\nBen Balter\n\nGitHub began training its sights on government last fall with the launch of GitHub and Government, a portal designed to help government workers take advantage of open source software and tools so they can reuse pieces of code that are known to work\u2014and so don\u2019t have to keep reinventing the wheel.\n\nBalter\u2019s job is to be GitHub\u2019s eyes and ears in Washington by meeting with agencies and educating them about the basics of open source software. The biggest problem is the culture, he says.\n\nSee also: GitHub Goes Government, Aims To Open Source Civics\n\nFor instance, when Balter sends government agencies links to GitHub repositories, they frequently ask him to resend PDFs or PowerPoint slideshows instead. Such \u201cclosed data\u201d formats\u2014meaning there\u2019s no way to extract data and do something (anything!) with it\u2014are anathema to the freewheeling, flexible GitHub culture.\n\nAs Balter told me:\n\nYou\u2019ve got government contractors that only know legacy languages. You\u2019ve got administrators within government that don\u2019t know whether open source can be trusted. So there\u2019s a lot of education that needs to happen. Plus, there\u2019s an entire industry dedicated to selling closed solutions to the government, and open source has to compete with that.\n\nBut the government is more open to modernization than it once was. HealthCare.gov, the Obama administration\u2019s initially disastrous website for Affordable Care Act signups, was a wake-up call regarding the atrocious interfaces and outdated technology of some government Web pages and their underlying services.\n\nWhen The Feds Go Digital\n\nNow, the White House has taken a page from San Francisco. Earlier this week it established a new U.S. Digital Service that, among other things, will set out technology best practices for the federal government. Running it will be Mikey Dickerson, the former Google employee who led a team credited with fixing the problems at HealthCare.gov.\n\nSee also: The White House Now Has A Digital SWAT Team\n\nIt\u2019s one small step for a government mainly stuck in the dark ages of technology. Balter told me that while he was on the White House SWAT (Software Automation and Technology) team, he wrote a script that cut the time one White House lawyer had previously spent messing around with spreadsheets from 45 minutes\u2014to one:\n\nAs a taxpayer, we want these people working on law stuff, not busywork. And they would collect FOIA requests in spreadsheets and they would spend 45 minutes a day merging those spreadsheets. So we coded a script in 30 minutes so they can press a button and do that 45 minutes of work in one click. And if we share this script with other agencies, that\u2019s the value of open source. We can free up government employees\u2019 time to work smarter.\n\nWhen usability and modernization are still major problems with some government websites, it\u2019s a little early to be thinking about citizen participation. However, Balter is optimistic. He wants to have all 50 state governments using GitHub in some capacity by year\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cI want your average 18-year-old to have the same facts and figures as a K Street lobbyist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere he or she can walk into a congressional office and point out a discrepancy with the open data he or she found in the government\u2019s GitHub repository. And in my dream, the congressperson says, \u2018You can submit a pull request to fix it.\u2019 All of a sudden everyone\u2019s on equal footing and we have participatory democracy.\u201d\n\nLocal Government Wins, Too\n\nOne of GitHub and Government\u2019s major success stories is the city of Chicago, where government employees and citizens are working side-by-side to map the city\u2019s bike routes. Meanwhile, the city of Philadelphia\u2019s proposed data specifications for flu shot locations was so successful, Chicago and San Francisco later borrowed the code.\n\nWhen GitHub says that it has 10,000 \u201cactive\u201d government users, it really means government users who have \u201cdone something on GitHub other than signing up.\u201d So while it\u2019s unrealistic to assume 10,000 government employees are regularly using open source technology, it\u2019s still possible that 10,000 of them think open source is a very good idea.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing preventing the government from modernizing,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we hit the reset button, I think more people would envision a more open government that \u2018shows its work\u2019.\u201d\n\nLead photo courtesy of GitHub; photo of Ben Balter courtesy of Ben Balter", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ben balter, github, government, open source, u.s. digital service, usds", "og": {"site_name": "ReadWrite", "description": "Believe it or not.", "title": "GitHub May Actually Be Dragging Government Into The 21st Century - ReadWrite", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1400, "identifier": "http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTIzNjEzMTg5MTkxMjcxOTUw.png", "height": 788}, "url": "http://readwrite.com/2014/08/14/github-government-ben-balter-open-source/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Believe it or not.", "creator": "@RWW", "image": "http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/MTIzNjEzMTg5MTkxMjcxOTUw.png", "title": "GitHub May Actually Be Dragging Government Into The 21st Century - ReadWrite", "site": "@RWW", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-14T16:00:00-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 192187591145688}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://15809-presscdn-0-93.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/readwrite/assets/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "msvalidate.01": "9D616CD979011140F703394FDBD92469", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ReadWrite", "section": "Hack", "tag": "USDS", "published_time": "2014-08-14T16:00:00-07:00"}, "theme-color": "#121212", "description": "Believe it or not."}, "article_summary": "That includes major open source projects like Ruby On Rails and some projects by companies like Facebook and Twitter.\nBalter\u2019s job is to be GitHub\u2019s eyes and ears in Washington by meeting with agencies and educating them about the basics of open source software.\nPlus, there\u2019s an entire industry dedicated to selling closed solutions to the government, and open source has to compete with that.\nAnd if we share this script with other agencies, that\u2019s the value of open source.\nWhen The Feds Go DigitalNow, the White House has taken a page from San Francisco."}
