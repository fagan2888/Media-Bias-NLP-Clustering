This means that just days after Christmas, on January 1st, 1.3 million people stand to lose their unemployment benefits. Did you just shiver?\n\nSandy Levin (D-MI) and Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) introduced a bill last month to extend the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program through 2014, but so far, our Republican-led House is too busy with hearings on ObamaCare to address matters of poverty stricken children and veterans.\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee Democrats released a new report today showing the devastating effects on military veterans and children of unemployed Americans set to take place upon the expiration of the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program.\n\nThe Committee summarized the key points:\n\nMore than 20,000 veterans would immediately be cut off from federal unemployment insurance the week of Dec. 28 if Congress does not reauthorize the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program.\n\nAs many as 2 million children could be impacted by ending the federal EUC program.\n\nWithout the federal EUC program, less than a quarter of unemployed Americans would have received unemployment benefits, the lowest UI recipiency rate for Americans looking for work in more than 50 years.\n\nJP Morgan did their own research and they found that the expiration of the EUC benefits could lower labor force protection, which would in turn depress the unemployment rate, and any further decline in the unemployment rate could complicate the Fed\u2019s communication efforts. \u201cAnother potential effect is through reduced spending by benefit recipients. EUC currently pays out benefits at around a $20-25 billion annual rate; should that flow dry up, consumer spending could take a hit in 1 Q, perhaps subtracting around 0.4% -pt from annualized real GDP growth in that quarter.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not just the bleeding heart liberals with compassion for their fellow citizens who support extending unemployment benefits. But shouldn\u2019t starving children and veterans without jobs be a matter of concern to us all? Surely Republicans can take a break from one of their four hearings on ObamaCare this week to handle renewing these benefits. There is time, if they chose to use it.\n\n\u201cMillions of unemployed Americans and their children would be left out in the economic cold just days after Christmas unless Congress acts to extend this vital program,\u201d said Representative Levin. \u201cThis report just adds to the urgency that confronts this Congress over the next two weeks. Congress must act.\u201d\n\nBut unless they get a lot of pressure for failing our veterans (forget poor children, they can\u2019t vote and Republicans have shown that they don\u2019t care), they won\u2019t. Remember, they won\u2019t even sit down to budget reconciliation or let immigration reform come up for a vote. They\u2019re very busy \u201cbloviating\u201d instead of legislating.\n\nMerry Christmas.\n\nImage: PBS Frontline Poor Kids", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just in time for Christmas, on December 28 the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program will expire unless Congress takes action.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Just in time for Christmas, on December 28 the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program will expire unless Congress takes action.", "title": "Republicans Will Let Veterans and Children of Unemployed Go Needy This Christmas", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/12/03/merry-christmas-scrooge-republicans-letting-veterans-children-unemployed-needy.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Screen-Shot-2013-12-03-at-4.07.20-PM-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-03T16:15:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-12-03T16:15:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-03T16:15:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d0a\"", "article_summary": "This means that just days after Christmas, on January 1st, 1.3 million people stand to lose their unemployment benefits.\nJust in time for Christmas, on December 28 the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program will expire unless Congress takes action.\nAs many as 2 million children could be impacted by ending the federal EUC program.\nBut shouldn\u2019t starving children and veterans without jobs be a matter of concern to us all?\nThe Ways and Means Committee Democrats released a new report today showing the devastating effects on military veterans and children of unemployed Americans set to take place upon the expiration of the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program."}
