Sasse was assistant secretary of Health and Human Services in George W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\nTwo other conservative groups endorsed Sasse: the Club for Growth and Senate Conservatives Fund. Those same groups endorsed State Treasurer Don Stenberg in the U.S. Senate race last year, but he finished third in the three-way primary race.\n\nFreedomWorks PAC President Matt Kibbe said in a press statement, \u201cThe Senate does not need more smart people with generally nice sounding ideas; it needs heroes. The time for giant voices and strong principles is now.\u201d\n\n\u201cShane Osborn has proven himself to be all these things and more. Nebraska and the country will be proud of the work Shane Osborn does in the Senate,\u201d Kibbe said.\n\nOsborn\u2019s campaign manager, Bill Novotny, was dismissive of Sasse\u2019s two other endorsements, saying Nebraskans will be voting in the election, not \u201cWashington elites that he spends most of his time with\u201d and accusing Sasse of wanting to play \u201cthe inside game in Washington.\u201d He said the Osborn campaign would have preferred that the Club for Growth stayed out of the Nebraska race.\n\nWhen asked how those sentiments about the relevance, or irrelevance, of these endorsements squares with the FreedomWorks endorsement, Novotny released a statement from Osborn saying he\u2019s honored to get their endorsement \u201cbecause they understand that conservative action speaks louder than mere promises.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy record of promoting transparency, shrinking the size of government while making it more efficient and cutting a budget is more than sound bites, it\u2019s reality,\u201d he said. \u201cWashington doesn\u2019t need more folks schooled in the ways of Washington; it needs folks that can go to D.C. with new blood and new ideas and really shake the place up.\u201d\n\nThe other Republican candidates are Omaha banker Sid Dinsdale and Omaha attorney Bart McLeay. Independent cattle rancher and restaurant entrepreneur Jim Jenkins of Callaway is also running.\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
