Then they helped the state boom again starting in the 1960s with the discovery of another Cenozoic treasure trove: invisible gold.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re blessed with an endowment of mineral resources, and gold is one of the biggest,\u201d said Mike Visher, deputy administrator for the Nevada Division of Minerals.\n\nPut another way: Geology built Nevada, and Nevada was built on geology.\n\nPEAKS AND VALLEYS\n\nWanda Taylor is a professor of structure and tectonics in UNLV\u2019s Department of Geoscience.\n\nShe said the same forces that produced the Carlin Trend and other Nevada gold deposits also created the state\u2019s signature landscape feature.\n\nNevada is the most mountainous state in the nation, with so many distinct ranges that some say it is impossible to stand anywhere in the state without seeing some peak or another in the distance.\n\nWhen viewed in satellite images, Nevada sports what look like zebra stripes running north to south. Geologists know it as the Basin and Range, a series of narrow mountain blocks separated by flat valleys formed as the Earth\u2019s crust was stretched and broken by extensional faults.\n\nThe Basin and Range province extends north into Idaho and Oregon and south into Mexico, but nowhere is it more pronounced and uniform than in the 500-mile sweep from Utah\u2019s Wasatch Front to the Sierras.\n\nAs author John McPhee describes it in \u201cAnnals of the Former World,\u201d his 1999 Pulitzer Prize-winning work of creative nonfiction: \u201cWith Nevada these high, discrete, austere new ranges begin to come in waves, range after range after north-south range; basin, range; basin, range; a mile of height between basin and range.\u201d\n\nEach of those mountain and valley pairings exists because of at least one or two fault lines.\n\n\u201cThis is why we\u2019re interested in earthquakes,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThe landscape is active. It\u2019s geology in action.\u201d\n\nAs the crust extends, it thins and cracks, creating space for heat and molten rock from the Earth\u2019s interior to rise toward the surface. In the Nevada of the comparatively recent geologic past, that helped produce something besides gold: volcanoes.\n\nThe state is dotted with the remnants of calderas and cinder cones, including one former volcano near the shore of Lake Mead that has been ripped in half and carried in opposite directions along an active fault over the past 12 million years or so.\n\nSome of the largest volcanic eruptions anywhere on Earth occurred in Nevada, including one blast some 31 million years ago so powerful it buried portions of what is now the central part of the state beneath a layer of ash and crystals nearly one mile thick, Taylor said.\n\nThe continent began stretching some 50 million years ago, and it continues today.\n\nThe process eventually will rip the North American Plate apart, and an ocean will fill the hole the way the Red Sea is slowly expanding in the gap between Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n\u201cThankfully, it will take a while,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cTens of millions of years.\u201d\n\nAll of this has happened before. If you go back far enough, almost everything has.\n\nFrom roughly 500 million years ago until about 200 million years ago, Nevada was at the bottom of an ocean filled with bony fish and giant squids and patrolled by carnivorous marine reptiles the size of tractor-trailers.\n\nToday their fossilized bones are displayed at Berlin-Ichthyosaur State Park in northern Nye County, where the remains of sea monsters are weathering from rocks now almost a mile-and-a-half above sea level.\n\nAN INVISIBLE FORTUNE\n\nMuch of the state\u2019s early population was drawn by the discovery of the Comstock Lode in 1859 and by gold and silver strikes in Central Nevada and copper in Eastern Nevada during the early 1900s.\n\nSome prospectors who came west to join the booms crossed directly above one of the richest gold deposits on Earth, though they had no way of knowing it was there or how to extract it.\n\nThe gold that triggered Northern Nevada\u2019s modern boom is microscopic, diffused ion by ion into a type of rock called pyrite, which you may know by its other name: fool\u2019s gold.\n\nTo get at it, multinational mining companies carve man-made canyons and haul out the surrounding rock in 240-ton loads to be crushed, cooked and washed in chemicals.\n\n\u201cIt really took some clever geologists to figure it out,\u201d said UNLV geology professor Jean Cline.\n\nThose men were Newmont Mining geologists John Livermore and J. Alan Coope. In 1961, they followed some geological clues to a promising deposit of microscopic gold that became the Carlin Mine and triggered a flurry of exploration that continues today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s called invisible gold,\u201d Cline said.\n\nSo far, almost 80 million ounces of it have been teased from the rocks of Northeastern Nevada.\n\nVisher said Nevada produced more than 5.6 million ounces of gold in 2012. If our state were a country, it would have ranked fourth in the world for gold production last year.\n\nNevada has produced enough gold since 1859 to make 28 full-sized versions of the Statue of Liberty worth more than $270 billion at today\u2019s price.\n\nCline said some gold and silver coins were minted recently in honor of Livermore, who died early this year at his home in Reno at age 94.\n\nNEVADA\u2019S OTHER TREASURES\n\nNevada\u2019s impressive geology has also produced riches of a different sort.\n\nOne of Southern Nevada\u2019s most popular tourist destinations is Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. Almost a million hikers, climbers and other outdoor enthusiasts flock there each year.\n\nGeologists do, too.\n\nDuring a recent survey that netted a roughly 220 million-year-old fossil at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park at Red Rock, UNLV paleontologist Josh Bonde pointed to the striped sandstone cliffs that loom above the park.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at the first two periods of the age of dinosaurs. You\u2019re looking at it, and you\u2019re standing on it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get much more dramatic topography for work.\u201d\n\nAt the eastern edge of the Las Vegas Valley, near a trash-strewn roadside pullout next to Frenchman Mountain, is the Great Unconformity. It represents a gap in the geologic record spanning about 1.3 billion years.\n\nThis humbling absence is only visible in a few places in North America. Some people hike to the bottom of the Grand Canyon just to touch the formation, but one of the easiest places in the world to see it is at the edge of a wash a few yards off Lake Mead Boulevard, one mile east of Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nThere, the geologic wonder appears as a line \u2014 a few feet long and tilted at a 50-degree angle \u2014 where rock formed 1.8 billion years ago touches rock formed 500 million years ago.\n\nThe Silver State is filled with similar surprises. Taylor said there is no place she would rather be with a rock hammer in hand. \u201cNevada is an incredible place to be a geologist and to learn about geology.\u201d\n\nEven if you don\u2019t strike it rich.\n\nContact reporter Henry Brean at hbrean@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0350.
