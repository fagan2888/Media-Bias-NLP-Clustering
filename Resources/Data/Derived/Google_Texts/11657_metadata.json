Alcee Hastings (D-FL) called Texas a \u201ccrazy state.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about in your state, which I think is a crazy state to begin with \u2014 and I mean that just as I said it,\u201d Hastings said, adding that he would not live in Texas \u201cfor all the tea in China.\u201d\n\nGatlin, who is a conservative activist and a Texas native, was invited to come on Fox News on Wednesday to share a song in response to Hastings.\n\n\u201cThe eyes of Texas are upon you / Better not come near,\u201d Gatlin sang. \u201cThe eyes of Texas are upon you / I think you\u2019d best steer clear.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said things about my Texas that just were not kind / And if I get a chance, I\u2019ll open up cowboy boot shop in your behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cLarry, that\u2019s hilarious!\u201d Fox News host Steve Doocy replied, laughing uncontrollably, and adding that Hastings had once been ranked number one in nepotism because he employed family members.\n\n\u201cNepotism, you folks in Alcee\u2019s district go look that up,\u201d Gatlin replied. \u201cYou talk about low-information voters, they elected this man to be their congressman. They elected Debbie Waterfowl what\u2019s-her-name\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Doocy said. \u201cWasserman Schultz.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they elected her twice,\u201d Gatlin continued. \u201cSo of course, me saying this will automatically brand me a racist. After all, a racist is anyone who is winning an argument with a Democrat or a liberal.\u201d\n\nThe country singer argued that Democrats could not be upset about states rejecting the Affordable Care Act because the GOP had won more governor\u2019s races and legislatures in the last election.\n\n\u201cWhat part about getting your butt kicked in the November elections do y\u2019all not understand?\u201d Gatlin asked. \u201cThat\u2019s the bad part. But what part of getting your butt kicked if you come to Texas and talk bad about us, you better start understand that too, Alcee. It\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below from Fox News\u2019 Fox & Friends, broadcast Feb. 4, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/fox_ff_gatlin_hastings_150204a-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Country singer delights Fox News with song about kicking black Congressman\u2019s ass"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d5d\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201dWatch the video below from Fox News\u2019 Fox & Friends, broadcast Feb. 4, 2015.\n\u201cWhat part about getting your butt kicked in the November elections do y\u2019all not understand?\u201d Gatlin asked.\n\u201cThe eyes of Texas are upon you / Better not come near,\u201d Gatlin sang.\nBut what part of getting your butt kicked if you come to Texas and talk bad about us, you better start understand that too, Alcee.\nLarry Gatlin sings for Fox News (screen grab)Country music singer Larry Gatlin on Wednesday told the hosts of Fox & Friends that he was prepared to physically assault a Democratic lawmaker who had insulted the state of Texas."}
