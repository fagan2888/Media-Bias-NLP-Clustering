The reason this particular petition should interest you is that it has the potential to affect so many people, specifically those who derive income from any sources outside the state where they live. As explained in this Forbes article, the fundamental question being put to the court is as follows:\n\nDoes the United States Constitution prohibit a state from taxing all the income of its residents \u2014 wherever earned \u2014 by mandating a credit for taxes paid on income earned in other states?\n\nThe specifics of the original case:\n\nIn this case, a married couple, the Wynnes, reported taxable net income of approximately $2.7 million. More than half of that amount represented a share of earnings in an S corporation with operations in several states. The Wynnes claimed a credit on their Maryland tax returns for taxes paid to 39 other states but not for any county or local government taxes. The State of Maryland denied the credits and issued a notice of deficiency and the Wynnes appealed. At a hearing, the assessment was affirmed.\n\nSo the Wynnes lost the first two rounds in court, even though they were apparently taxed by the states where the income was generated and then taxed again in Maryland But they then amended their original request, asking the courts to answer the question, \u201cwhether a state had the unconditional right to tax all income based on residency.\u201d\n\nWhen they phrased it that way, the Circuit Court agreed with the Wynnes. The state appealed and the Court of Appeals sides with the Wynnes as well, since they were being subjected to double taxation. Not suprisingly, the Obama administration has weighed in with an amicus curiae brief supporting the state, though their argument mainly seems to be, Hey! This could cut out a lot of tax money!\n\nThe feds argued in their brief that \u201cthough States often choose to grant tax credits to their residents for income taxes paid in other States, nothing in the Commerce Clause compels a State to offer such credits or otherwise defer to other States in the taxation of its own residents\u2019 income.\u201d Further, \u201c[t]he decision\u2026 may lead to challenges to similar tax schemes in other jurisdictions; and is inconsistent with statements made by the highest courts in other States.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect a quick answer here, since we\u2019ll be lucky to have a decision by Christmas. But as wonky as it may sound, you should probably keep an eye on this one. It doesn\u2019t only affect wealthy investors. If you commute across state lines for work and don\u2019t receive a full credit for taxes paid in the state where you work, this could directly impact your bottom line too.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Commerce", "title": "SCOTUS to decide on double taxation across state lines", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/06/01/scotus-to-decide-on-double-taxation-across-state-lines/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "income tax, Supreme Court, taxes,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-01T13:31:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-01T12:34:00+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd60\"", "article_summary": "If you commute across state lines for work and don\u2019t receive a full credit for taxes paid in the state where you work, this could directly impact your bottom line too.\nThe state appealed and the Court of Appeals sides with the Wynnes as well, since they were being subjected to double taxation.\nThe Wynnes claimed a credit on their Maryland tax returns for taxes paid to 39 other states but not for any county or local government taxes.\nThe specifics of the original case:In this case, a married couple, the Wynnes, reported taxable net income of approximately $2.7 million.\nThe State of Maryland denied the credits and issued a notice of deficiency and the Wynnes appealed."}
