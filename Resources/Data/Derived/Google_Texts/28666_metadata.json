She was an advisor for Sen. Rand Paul's presidential campaign, and has served as speechwriter for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and on President George W. Bush's National Security Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nBirther movements in American political life are base, mean-spirited and a distraction from the real issues at stake in a critical presidential election. And I couldn\u2019t be happier that Ted Cruz is getting his moment in the birther sun.\n\nI believe in karma. As a reward for Cruz\u2019s self-serving and cynical defense of the worst of Donald Trump, the billionaire bully has launched a birther movement to attack the Canadian-born Cruz as he rises at the polls.\n\nTrump now wants a federal court to determine if Cruz, born in Calgary to an American mother, satisfies the \u201cnatural born\u201d requirement to serve as president. Though most constitutional scholars interpret this undefined clause in Cruz\u2019s favor, uncertainty is all Trump needs to plow ahead in the court of public opinion.\n\nFor any other candidate, this scrutiny would be unfair, and it was wrong for Trump to call into question President Barack Obama\u2019s U.S. citizenship. But unlike other contenders for the 2016 Republican nomination, Cruz enthusiastically cross-pollinated with Trump and rose in his defense, even claiming that Hillary Clinton, not the Donald, started the fervor over Obama\u2019s birth certificate.\n\nUntil now, being Trump\u2019s lackey has been a smart strategy for Cruz: every other candidate who has attacked Trump has, as the Donald loves to brag, precipitously fallen at the polls. (Full disclosure: until the end of 2015, I was an advisor on Senator Rand Paul\u2019s campaign and supported Paul\u2019s decision to aggressively attack Trump\u2019s bullying.) As the primary plodded on this fall and candidates who took on Trump\u2014such as Paul and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush\u2014did so to their peril, Cruz\u2019s Machiavellian allegiance to Trump was maddening.\n\nCruz\u2019s defense of Donald has been his only consistent position, and until now it was galling that it worked.\n\nConsider his policy positions and track record in the Senate.\n\nCruz has approached his duties in the U.S. Senate with the zeal of a government bureaucrat determined to play obstructionist politics even against his own party. (Bonus points, Cruz, if you really did wear a diaper for your pointless 21 hour filibuster against Obamacare \u2014 you are the jilted astronaut stalker of this cycle.)\n\nBecause of his calculating intelligence, Cruz could just as easily be a conventional establishment Republican\u2014as he was in his work on President George W. Bush\u2019s campaign and for his administration\u2014instead of the Tea Party firebrand we see today. That\u2019s why he is scary \u2014 because he who stands for nothing only stands for himself.\n\nThe malleability is apparent in his ever-changing or non-existent policy positions \u2014 notably, how he opposed the National Security Agency\u2019s warrantless spying until he voted for the Patriot Act. How over the course of a few months, he went from declaring his support for granting Obama \u201cfast-track\u201d trade authority to suddenly opposing the secrecy of an always-secret deal. Just this week in Iowa, Cruz decided that ethanol was a really good thing, disavowing his previous calls to end ethanol subsidies. Political office even changed Cruz\u2019s tone on his former \u201cdear friend\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts. In 2005 Cruz wrote publicly in support of Roberts and heralded the judge as a \u201crole model\u201d for his staff in the Texas Solicitor\u2019s General Office; in 2015 Cruz called for his resignation from the Supreme Court.\n\nIt\u2019s a long shot, granted, but there\u2019s a chance I might like Ted Cruz \u2014 if only I knew what he stood for.\n\nWho is the guy? The politician who advocates \u201ccarpet-bombing\u201d civilians \u2014 or the man who reads Green Eggs and Ham to his little girls? The candidate who, during his Senate campaign, attacked the Dallas mayor \u2014 a fellow opponent of same-sex marriage \u2014 for attending the city\u2019s gay pride parade, or the fundraising politician who assures a New York City audience that ending gay marriage wouldn\u2019t be a priority? Is he an attorney who supports federal stimulus dollars when he\u2019s billing by the hour, or the deficit hawk claiming \u201cthere\u2019s a battle over whether we remain a free market nation\u201d?\n\nMaybe, just maybe, this national political nightmare on the eve of the Iowa primary will force Ted Cruz to define what he truly believes in before Iowans head to caucus.\n\nOr maybe he\u2019ll finally reap the rewards of his cynical, shape-shifting strategy.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Until now, being Trump\u2019s lackey has been a smart strategy for Cruz", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Until now, being Trump\u2019s lackey has been a smart strategy for Cruz", "title": "Ted Cruz Deserves Donald Trump's Birther Scrutiny", "url": "http://time.com/4172788/ted-cruz-donald-trump-birther/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/ted-cruz.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/ted-cruz.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Ted Cruz Deserves Donald Trump's Birther Scrutiny", "description": "Until now, being Trump\u2019s lackey has been a smart strategy for Cruz", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "ted cruz, donald trump, ted cruz citizenship, birther theory, obama us citizenship", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz citizenship, birther theory, Obama US citizenship"}, "article_summary": "And I couldn\u2019t be happier that Ted Cruz is getting his moment in the birther sun.\n(Full disclosure: until the end of 2015, I was an advisor on Senator Rand Paul\u2019s campaign and supported Paul\u2019s decision to aggressively attack Trump\u2019s bullying.)\nIt\u2019s a long shot, granted, but there\u2019s a chance I might like Ted Cruz \u2014 if only I knew what he stood for.\nAs a reward for Cruz\u2019s self-serving and cynical defense of the worst of Donald Trump, the billionaire bully has launched a birther movement to attack the Canadian-born Cruz as he rises at the polls.\nCruz\u2019s defense of Donald has been his only consistent position, and until now it was galling that it worked."}
