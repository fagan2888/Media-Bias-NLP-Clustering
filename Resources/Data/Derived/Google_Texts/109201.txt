Bill O’Reilly has come under fire for allegedly fabricating a number of stories regarding his reporting in the Falklands War, El Salvador and Florida, surrounding the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Recently, O’Reilly has also made up a story about a trip to Northern Ireland in 1984, during which time he said he witnessed terrorists bomb Irish citizens. As the controversy was unfolding, Fox News was steadfast in its support of the news anchor, saying that the allegations were “nothing more than an orchestrated champaign.”

Now, the network has been forced to reckon with growing evidence that O’Reilly was actually making a lot up. Of the Northern Ireland story, a Fox News spokesperson acknowledged that O’Reilly had not witnessed any bombings — but instead, was shown photographs of the incident.
