The service picks up passengers from their homes.\n\nEdgar Morales, a regular MV rider, said the service lets him be more independent due to his disability.\n\n\u201cI have seizures so I\u2019m unable to drive. MV allows me to be able to get around without depending on other people,\u201d Morales said. \u201cI can do things the way that I want to and at the time that I want it.\u201d\n\nThe paratransit service was mandated in 1990 with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to provide a bus service for disabled people in cities with a fixed bus route system. MV, the private company that provides the local service, is contracted through RTS.\n\nPeople can qualify to ride MV through the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Medicaid or Transportation Disadvantage.\n\nUnder the ADA, passengers must prove to be physically disabled and unable to ride RTS. There is a $3 fee each way, and it takes people to destinations within city limits.\n\nThe state of Florida provides Transportation Disadvantage, which requires people be unable to drive and 150 percent under the poverty level. With Transportation Disadvantage, people can ride MV even if they live outside the city limits \u2014 with a $3 fee.\n\nTo qualify for MV, people must have Medicaid that covers transportation. They can use it to go to a Medicaid appointment with a $1 fee each way.\n\nMark Mayfield, a consumer transportation advocate for the Center for Independent Living of North Central Florida, reviews ADA applications. Mayfield said there are still people who need the service but aren\u2019t in the system yet.\n\nParatransit serves 50 percent to 75 percent of all who require MV, but there are still people who need the service but don\u2019t know about it or can\u2019t access it. Making the application process harder would trap citizens in their homes, he said.\n\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t get to their doctor, it\u2019s going to be a decline in health, potentially an even greater need for the healthcare their fighting against,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t get the preventative health, so they\u2019re going to wait until they\u2019re too sick and have to go to the ER for the health care. It\u2019s going to be a vicious cycle.\u201d\n\nMorales said he rides MV every day to work at the Center for Independent Living, where he trains \u201chard-of-hearing\u201d individuals to use special phones.\n\n\u201cBecause of MV I\u2019m able to say that I have been working here for 13 years. If I wasn\u2019t able to have MV, that would be more difficult,\u201d Morales said. \u201cSome people don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re asking them for a ride. People don\u2019t understand that sometimes; that because a disability, it impairs you.\u201d\n\nHe said MV provides long-term help.\n\nAccording to MV Transportation, it averages 10,000 trips a month. City, state and federal tax revenues fund the paratransit service. Gainesville recently voted to extend MV\u2019s contract for another five years\n\nMedicaid\u2019s changes will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WUFT News", "description": "The state of Florida's decision to opt out of expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act will alter the application process for MV transportation, according to the Regional Transit System.", "title": "Florida Medicaid Decision Affects RTS Gainesville Paratransit Service", "url": "http://www.wuft.org/news/2013/12/12/florida-medicaid-decision-affects-rts-gainesville-paratransit-service/", "image": "http://www.wuft.org/news/files/2013/12/MV-transportation.jpg", "type": "article"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bcc\"", "article_summary": "MV transportation is a private bus service through RTS for people with disabilities who are unable to use public transportation.\nPeople can qualify to ride MV through the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Medicaid or Transportation Disadvantage.\nPeople don\u2019t understand that sometimes; that because a disability, it impairs you.\u201dHe said MV provides long-term help.\nThe state of Florida provides Transportation Disadvantage, which requires people be unable to drive and 150 percent under the poverty level.\nAccording to MV Transportation, it averages 10,000 trips a month."}
