In addition to taking more refugees, Australia immediately dispatched its Immigration Minister to Geneva in order to learn \u201cwhat more\u201d could be done.\n\nThe aunt of Aylan Kurdi, the 3-year-old Syrian boy whose body was washed ashore in Turkey, spoke to the press outside her home in Canada today, of her family's pain. (Sept. 4) AP Video Video Video: Syrian toddler's aunt: 'Stop the war' Under tight security, five bus loads of East Indians entered CFB Stadacona in Halifax on July 13, 1987, to spend their first night in Canada in a military gymnasium. The 173 men and one woman \u2013 who arrived at dawn July 12, 1987, on Nova Scotia's South Shore \u2013 got off the buses at the Canadian Forces base one or two at a time. The arrivals, who mysteriously appeared in Woods Harbour, told startled residents they had come from India. Early reports indicated that they came ashore in lifeboats under a cover of darkness and fog. Later it was determined that the refugees had been dropped off by the Amelie, a Chilean-registered freighter.

We have different requirements. We have to go through screening processes that we\u2019re obliged under our immigration laws to implement.\u201d\n\nCanada has so far accepted 2,374 Syrian refugees and has pledged to bring in a total of 11,300 over three years. In addition, Conservative Leader Stephen Harper promised to accept an additional 10,000 Syrian and Iraqi refugees over four years if re-elected.\n\nConservative spokesman Stephen Lecce stressed to The Globe Sunday that Canada is acting to resettle refugees, but is also delivering humanitarian aid and participating in the military mission in the region.\n\nLiberal Leader Justin Trudeau said Canada needs to take inspiration from countries like Germany and accept more refugees.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, just this weekend Germany\u2019s putting us all to shame with 7,000 yesterday, close to 10,000 today. That\u2019s what you can do when you have political will,\u201d he said at a campaign event in Laval, Que.\n\nBoth the Liberals and NDP are calling for non-partisan discussions to take place with the Conservatives on steps that Canada could take immediately regardless of the election campaign.\n\nNDP candidate and foreign affairs critic Paul Dewar urged the government Saturday to name a Syrian refugee co-ordinator to organize a federal response.\n\n\u201cI\u201dm deeply disappointed,\u201d he said of the government\u2019s \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d position. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen mayors from across the country, civil society, churches, the Pope, everyone is doing what they can do to increase the numbers of Syrian refugees that we can accommodate \u2026 but the government obviously has a massive role to play,\u201d Mr. Dewar said on Sunday.\n\nNot all of Canada\u2019s allies have increased their targets.\n\nThe United States has provided $4.1-billion in humanitarian aid since the start of the crisis in Syria, but has only accepted about 1,500 Syrian refugees.\n\nThe U.S. State Department recently pointed out that any new refugees from Syria would need to be \u201cthoroughly vetted,\u201d given the strong presence of terrorist groups operating in the region.\n\nSome in Congress have been warning U.S. President Barack Obama for months against accepting more Syrian refugees.\n\nRepublican Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, wrote to the President in June, warning that accepting Syrian refugees \u201cis very dangerous\u201d given that U.S. intelligence is not able to properly vet potential candidates from the region.\n\nMr. McCaul warned there is a real risk that terrorists will attempt to exploit refugee resettlement programs to gain entry into the U.S.\n\n\u201cTerrorist networks are constantly probing our defences and would not hesitate to manipulate a program meant to save those fleeing violence for the purpose of infiltrating operatives onto American soil,\u201d Mr. McCaul wrote.\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.339", "description": "Opposition parties urge Ottawa to commit to taking more Syrian refugees as allies boost their own efforts", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "Opposition parties urge Ottawa to commit to taking more Syrian refugees as allies boost their own efforts", "title": "Immigration Minister defends Canada\u2019s response to refugee crisis", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/immigration-minister-defends-canadas-response-to-refugee-crisis/article26241619/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/055/incoming/article26223522.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/Chris+Alexander.JPG", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Opposition parties urge Ottawa to commit to taking more Syrian refugees as allies boost their own efforts", "creator": "@globeandmail", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/26241619", "iphone": "tgam://article/26241619"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "site": "@globeandmail", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512948019}, "robots": "noarchive", "last-modified": "2015-09-07 08:25:21 EDT", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "humanitarian aid;Immigration Minister Chris Alexander ;Canada;migrant crisis;Conservative Party;Alan Kurdi;Federal Election 2015;refugee crisis;refugee resettlement;Syrian refugees;", "article": {"onpage": 1, "engagement": "true", "comments": "false", "pages": 1, "type": "news", "id": 26241619}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "article_summary": "Some in Congress have been warning U.S. President Barack Obama for months against accepting more Syrian refugees.\nThe United States has provided $4.1-billion in humanitarian aid since the start of the crisis in Syria, but has only accepted about 1,500 Syrian refugees.\nImmigration Minister Chris Alexander is resisting calls for Canada to do more in response to the international migrant crisis, even as some of Canada\u2019s closest allies boost their efforts to bring in more Syrian refugees.\nYet when pressed Sunday on various news shows, Mr. Alexander continued to defend Canada\u2019s position.\nIn addition to taking more refugees, Australia immediately dispatched its Immigration Minister to Geneva in order to learn \u201cwhat more\u201d could be done."}
