Erick Erickson, the RedState.com editor, has called him \u201ca bully\u201d; Steve Deace, a conservative radio host in Iowa, calls his candidacy \u201ca non-starter for conservatives.\u201d The conservative health-policy expert Avik Roy, writing in National Review, said last year, \u201cThe chances of John Kasich marrying Kate Upton are higher than the chances of John Kasich contending for the GOP nomination.\u201d Kasich\u2019s transgressions against conservative orthodoxy are many. He supports the Common Core educational standards, which the right loathes; he says he would consider allowing undocumented immigrants to become citizens; his state budgets have cut a lot of taxes, but raised others; and spending has increased on his watch. Conservatives\u2019 primary complaint is that Kasich singlehandedly accepted the Obamacare-Medicaid expansion for his state, thus making him complicit in the most loathed policy of the loathed Democratic president.\n\nBut Kasich\u2019s heresy is bigger than these specific ideological transgressions. It is tonal\u2014he has golfed with Obama and generally declines to attack the president personally; he has justified his Medicaid decision on the basis of Christian compassion for the poor. And it is philosophical\u2014Kasich is witheringly dismissive of the anti-government absolutists in his own party. \u201cThere's a sort of fantasy out there, or a myth, that we can just cut all the government and that'll give us our lower taxes,\u201d he told me when I visited him in Ohio in February for a profile I was writing. \u201cIt doesn't work that way. You can't just get rid of all these programs and say, \u2018People, just spontaneously do it!\u2019\u201d Kasich seemed to be referring to the argument advanced by some conservatives that much government aid could be replaced by private charity. \u201cWe do need to reawaken people\u201d to help their fellow man, he said. \u201cBut that doesn't mean government just disappears.\u201d His definition of conservatism, he told me, is lifting people up by giving them the tools to help themselves. \u201cPeople in Ohio are more hopeful [now] that they\u2019re included. What's better than that?\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s conservatism. If it isn\u2019t, it ought to be called that.\u201d This sort of thing has gotten Kasich labeled a \u201cbig-government conservative.\u201d But he shouldn\u2019t be mistaken for a liberal. He believes in lowering taxes and eliminating regulations on business in order to spur economic growth. In his 2007 book Stand for Something, Kasich argues that, despite a recent string of scandals involving companies like Enron, more regulation was the wrong answer, because \u201cyou can\u2019t legislate ethical behavior,\u201d and \u201cso-called corporate reform\u201d was actually \u201cstifling the progress of American business.\u201d That was written while Kasich was on the payroll of Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street firm that imploded during the 2008 financial crisis. Kasich\u2019s current pitch to GOP voters rests on these twin pillars of trickle-down economics and Christian compassion. New Day for America, the nonprofit backing him, has been airing television ads that tout his work balancing the budget in the 1990s\u2014he was the Budget Committee chairman under then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich\u2014alongside footage of regular people and the slogan, \u201cJohn Kasich\u2019s for us.\u201d Supporters believe there is a good chance that Jeb Bush, the establishment-backed frontrunner, will stall out or falter, leaving Kasich\u2014another popular two-term governor of a big swing state, moderate in temperament, conservative in governance\u2014as the preferred candidate of the coastal-donor classes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Ohio governor is launching his campaign for the presidency on a platform of trickle-down economics and Christian compassion.
