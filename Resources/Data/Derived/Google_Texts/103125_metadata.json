Ted Cruz (R-TX) for calling out on President Obama for overlooking the Commerce Clause and giving the federal government more authority due to the Affordable Care Act. But when Sen. Cruz comes out against states\u2019 sovereignty by claiming that Obama and the Department of Justice are lawless by not enforcing federal drug laws, as they allow Colorado to enforce their own drug policies, we should hold Cruz accountable for simply ignoring the Constitution.\n\nSen. Cruz has been an eloquent defender of federalism in the past but has seemed somewhat clueless during his keynote address at the Texas Public Policy Foundation\u2019s Policy Orientation last Friday.\n\nAccording to the conservative senator, federal laws must be changed before the President can go ahead and say that Colorado has a right to enforce its own pot laws. That\u2019s right:\n\nA whole lot of folks now are talking about legalizing pot\u2026. And you can make arguments on that issue. You can make reasonable arguments on that issue. The president earlier this past year announced the Department of Justice is going to stop prosecuting certain drug crimes. Didn\u2019t change the law. You can go to Congress. You can get a conversation. You could get Democrats and Republicans who would say, \u201cWe ought to change our drug policy in some way,\u201d and you could have a real conversation. You could have hearings. You could look at the problem. You could discuss commonsense changes that maybe should happen or shouldn\u2019t happen. This president didn\u2019t do that. He just said, \u201cThe laws say one thing\u201d\u2014and mind you, these are criminal laws; these are laws that say if you do X, Y, and Z, you will go to prison. The president announced, \u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHis remarks seem odd, especially if you examine his defense of federalism in past occasions. Sen. Cruz has been a remarkable advocate of the idea of states\u2019 rights on issues such as same-sex marriage, the Affordable Care Act, and abortion, but once the conversation shifts to marijuana criminalization, he prefers to overlook the Tenth Amendment and allow the federal government to have its way, regardless of what the state of Colorado approved as its local policy.\n\nTraditionally, the federal government leaves almost all petty marijuana cases to local law enforcement agencies. The Controlled Substances Act prohibits anybody from possessing any amount of marijuana, but by stating that the Obama administration should be enforcing the Controlled Substances Act in Colorado, Sen. Cruz ignores that previous administrations also decided to manage federal law enforcement resources by allowing states to take care of small pot-related matters while allowing federal agencies to only go for major cases.\n\nWhen the administration decides to exercise prosecutorial discretion in the face of major shifts regarding state laws, it isn\u2019t doing anything unconstitutional, quite the opposite.\n\nThis is the first time this administration actually allows states to decide their local marijuana policies. In 2011, Obama walked back on the DOJ\u2019s 2009 decision of not making medical marijuana a priority for federal law enforcement by raiding several dispensaries and growers in California. As a matter of fact, President Obama outspent President Bush by $100 million by directly interfering with medical marijuana laws. According to Americans for Safe Access, Obama\u2019s DEA carried out 270 medical marijuana raids, twelve raids more than the DEA carried under President George W. Bush.\n\nWhen Sen. Cruz says he wants federal drug policies to change before allowing states to enforce their own laws, he\u2019s creating a double standard that puts the sovereignty of the states at risk, which is precisely what he has been so eloquently against in the past year.\n\nIf that\u2019s the kind of position he takes as the conservative, small government approach, he might as well lose the support he has earned after standing for states\u2019 rights in the past so many times.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Affordable Care Act,DOJ,Drug War,ObamaCare,Ted Cruz,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "description": "We should support Sen.
