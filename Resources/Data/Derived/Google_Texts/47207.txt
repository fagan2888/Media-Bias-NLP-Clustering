Christopher Spivey was found murdered in his home on March 14, 1995 and no suspects have been found.

Spivey's family gathered at a memorial for murdered children to remember him and hold onto hope that the person or people involved are captured.

"We want to keep his memory alive, his case alive, in hopes that some day his case can be solved," said Terry Pennington, Spivey's mother.

Spivey worked at the McDonalds near Douglas and Seneca; Spivey was found by a co-worker who was sent out to check on him after Spivey did not show up to work.

Spivey lived in the 200 block of north Elizabeth, just a few blocks from his workplace. He was 22-years-old at the time of the murder.

The family wants answers and the person or people guilty apprehended and held accountable for the murder.

"Anybody that has any information about it, it is time for them to come forward so that we can solve this and move on with our lives," Pennington said, "it seems like we are in a standstill until we get this solved."
