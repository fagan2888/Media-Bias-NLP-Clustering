One thing that has not changed, however, is consumer demand for affordable, convenient and effective health care. In today's health care world, telehealth delivery systems are increasingly replacing house calls, community center nursing stations and the George Baileys of the world, leveraging technology to make health care more convenient and affordable without compromising care.\n\nTelehealth can be defined in many ways, but in essence, it is the delivery of health care services to patients who are located remotely from the provider, through the use of technology. The business case for telehealth is self-evident. The Affordable Care Act has created millions of new health care consumers and, as discussed in a recent InsideCounsel article, President Obama's November 2014 Executive Action on Immigration will add to the burdens imposed on some state governments to provide health care to a new set of eligible beneficiaries. New and innovative ways to provide quality health care cost-effectively to more people is needed, and telehealth has emerged to answer the charge.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Edward D.
