The agency is helping those countries test for the virus and reduce the mosquito population. In the wake of the announcement that a Texas woman contracted the virus through sexual intercourse, public health experts also warn Zika could potentially spread through bodily fluids, according to WSLS10.\n\nMeanwhile, leaders at individual U.S. hospitals are hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. A Chicago hospital is currently testing a patient for the virus, according to ABC7, while in New Jersey, hospitals are taking steps to prepare for patients despite no sign of any infected patients yet, according to NJ.com. WVNSTV reports similar efforts in West Virginia. And Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) has declared a public health emergency in four Sunshine State counties that have confirmed cases, according to MyNews13.\n\nNow that WHO has declared Zika an international public health emergency, public health agencies must look to the international response to the Ebola outbreak in crafting their response, according to a blog post from the Harvard Business Review. This will mean implementing similar protocols that aim to identify potentially infected patients as early as possible and quarantining them.\n\nThis will be more difficult in the case of Zika, however, as its symptoms are vague--and less likely to manifest at all--compared to Ebola. To that end, the post states, public health authorities must focus on restricting exposure to the mosquitoes that transmit the virus through precautions such as mosquito repellent and insecticide-treated bed nets.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the NPR article\n\n- read the WSLS10 article\n\n- check out the ABC7 article\n\n- read the NJ.com story\n\n- here's the MyNews13 piece\n\n- read the HBR post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nTexas nurse has Ebola; Did CDC protocols fail?\n\n3 preparation tips to head off 'explosive' Zika pandemic\n\nWorld economy could buckle under the strain of major disease outbreak\n\nEbola watch: One year later, many nurses say government left them ill-prepared\n\nInfection control experts: U.S. isn't ready to handle an epidemic\n\nExperts call for reform of global infectious disease protocols\n\nPublic health lessons from the Ebola outbreak\n\nCompany insures hospitals against pandemics", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's been nearly two years since public health agencies' efforts to prevent the spread of Ebola dominated the headlines and now those agencies, as well as individual healthcare providers, have their work similarly cut out for them\u00a0to combat the Zika virus.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "It's been nearly two years since public health agencies' efforts to prevent the spread of Ebola dominated the headlines and now those agencies, as well as individual healthcare providers, have their work similarly cut out for them\u00a0to combat the Zika virus.", "title": "Public health agencies, hospitals prepare for potential Zika spread", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/public-health-agencies-hospitals-prepare-potential-zika-spread/2016-02-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),Disease Outbreak,Dr. Thomas Frieden,Ebola outbreak,infectious dieases,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,public health,World Health Organization (WHO),Zika virus", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Now that WHO has declared Zika an international public health emergency, public health agencies must look to the international response to the Ebola outbreak in crafting their response, according to a blog post from the Harvard Business Review.\nRick Scott (R) has declared a public health emergency in four Sunshine State counties that have confirmed cases, according to MyNews13.\nIt's been nearly two years since public health agencies' efforts to prevent the spread of Ebola dominated the headlines and now those agencies, as well as individual healthcare providers, have their work similarly cut out for them to combat the Zika virus.\nIn the wake of the announcement that a Texas woman contracted the virus through sexual intercourse, public health experts also warn Zika could potentially spread through bodily fluids, according to WSLS10.\nThe CDC has made Zika a top priority, not only in the U.S. but in affected Latin American nations, according to NPR."}
