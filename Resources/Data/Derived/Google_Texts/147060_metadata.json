Immediately after buying the stock, it was sold off to another Deutsche Bank entity, but the shell company was stuck with the tax liability on the stock\u2019s gains. After paying back the loan that made the deal possible in the first place, the shell company was left with insufficient funds to pay on the taxes owed. Including penalties and interest, the Internal Revenue Service determined it is now owed over $190 million.\n\nIn response to the suit, a company spokeswoman said the bank planned to defend itself against the charges, arguing that it had once already addressed the matter with the government.\n\n\u201cWe fully addressed the government\u2019s concerns about this 14-year old transaction in a 2009 agreement with the IRS. In connection with that agreement they abandoned their theory that DB was liable for these taxes, and while it is not clear to us why we are being pursued again for the same taxes, we plan to again defend vigorously against these claims,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\nThe tax evasion lawsuit comes several months after the federal government successfully obtained a guilty plea against the Swiss bank Credit Suisse, which agreed to pay roughly $2.6 billion in penalties for helping U.S. citizens dodge their taxes.\n\nThis post updated at 3:49 pm.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The U.S. government is accusing Deutsche Bank of engaging in a fraudulent scheme to avoid paying over $190 million in taxes.", "description": "The U.S. government is accusing Deutsche Bank of engaging in a fraudulent scheme to avoid paying over $190 million in taxes.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Schroeder", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The U.S. government is accusing Deutsche Bank of engaging in a fraudulent scheme to avoid paying over $190 million in taxes.", "title": "Justice Department sues Deutsche Bank for tax evasion scheme", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/226338-justice-department-sues-deutsche-bank-for-tax-evasion-scheme", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/226338-justice-department-sues-deutsche-bank-for-tax-evasion-scheme", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-08T15:43-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Schroeder", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-08T15:43:35-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/226338-justice-department-sues-deutsche-bank-for-tax-evasion-scheme", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The U.S. government is accusing Deutsche Bank of engaging in a fraudulent scheme to avoid paying over $190 million in taxes.", "card": "summary", "title": "Justice Department sues Deutsche Bank for tax evasion scheme"}, "dcterms.title": "Justice Department sues Deutsche Bank for tax evasion scheme"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENT\u201cThrough fraudulent conveyances involving shell companies, Deutsche Bank tried to make its potential tax liabilities disappear,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.\nThe U.S. government is accusing Deutsche Bank of engaging in a fraudulent scheme to avoid paying over $190 million in taxes.\nTo avoid paying taxes on those gains, the government claims Deutsche Bank worked with a firm to create three shell companies and deliberately underfunded them.\nImmediately after buying the stock, it was sold off to another Deutsche Bank entity, but the shell company was stuck with the tax liability on the stock\u2019s gains.\nSpecifically, the government says Deutsche sold the corporation and stock to the shell company at an unjustifiably low price, and the shell paid for the acquisition with a short-term loan."}
