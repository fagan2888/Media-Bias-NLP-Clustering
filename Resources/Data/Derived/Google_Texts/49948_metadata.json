It also incorrectly described his occupation.\n\nHouse Speaker William Howell, R-Stafford, right, speaks to supporters at an election party in Fredericksburg, Va., Tuesday. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nVirginia\u2019s top Republican easily withstood a \u00adtea-party primary challenge Tuesday, signaling that a deeply fractured state GOP may be finding its footing at a crucial time when national Republicans are preparing for the 2016 presidential race.\n\nWith all precincts reporting, House Speaker William J. Howell (Stafford) defeated challenger Susan Stimpson, a former Stafford County supervisor and onetime Howell protege, by a 2-to-1 ratio, according to unofficial returns.\n\nStimpson was inspired, in part, by the stunning GOP primary defeat one year ago of then-U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor by unknown economics professor Dave Brat. But Howell, who was nominated for his 15th term in the Virginia House of Delegates on Tuesday, was well prepared for the challenge, raising vastly more money and waging an aggressive campaign in his Fredericksburg-area district about 50 miles south of Washington. He did so despite opposition from the national group Americans for Tax Reform and prominent conservative donor Foster Friess.\n\n\u201cThis is a time for the party to unite and find out what we can do together,\u201d Howell said at his victory party at the Paradise Diner in Fredericksburg. \u201cWe can\u2019t win if we don\u2019t work together.\u201d\n\n[Longtime Alexandria mayor goes down in stinging defeat]\n\nHouse Speaker William Howell, right, talks to voter Debbie Mardini, of Fredericksburg, as he campaigns at his home polling place in Fredericksburg, Va., Tuesday, June 9, 2015. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nGary F. Snellings, chairman of the Stafford County Board of Supervisors, said \u201ctea party tactics\u201d didn\u2019t work in Stimpson\u2019s challenge to Howell \u2014 even though they did last year.\n\n\u201cThat was Eric Cantor\u2019s fault, not Dave Brat\u2019s,\u201d Snellings said. Of Howell\u2019s race, he added: \u201cIt just did not make sense to get rid of the speaker of the house.\u201d\n\nIn an e-mail to supporters, Stimpson thanked the 2,700 voters who cast ballots for her \u2014 who wanted, she said, \u201cRepublicans to actually lead on conservative principles.\u201d\n\nA second victory for the GOP establishment materialized in Augusta County, in western Virginia, where Republican state Sen. Emmett Hanger, under fire from conservatives for supporting Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, beat back two challengers on the right.\n\nAnd closer to Washington, in the Shenandoah Valley, conservative Del. Mark Berg fell to a more moderate Republican, Christopher E. Collins, according to preliminary results with all precincts reported. However, in a suburban Richmond Senate race, longtime Republican state Sen. Stephen H. Martin lost his three-way primary to tea-party-backed challenger Amanda F. Chase.\n\n\u201cHaving served with Senator Martin for the entirety of his tenure in the Senate, I know how disappointed he must be,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment Jr. (R-James City). But he said Chase would be a \u201cfantastic senator.\u201d\n\n[Steve Martin criticized for calling pregnant women \u2018hosts\u2019]\n\nIn Portsmouth, former City Council member Steve Heretick won a surprise victory in a Democratic primary challenge to longtime state Del. Johnny Joannou, whom Heretick called \u201cour tea party delegate\u201d \u2014 a reference to Joannou\u2019s conservative positions on some issues.\n\nGov. Terry McAuliffe (D) helped recruit Heretick, a longtime supporter, for that race. But he was more focused on the state Senate, which Republicans control by a single seat. Taking back the chamber is the governor\u2019s top political priority this year. He has said that doing so would build momentum in a crucial swing state for his close friend Hillary Rodham Clinton if she is the Democratic nominee next year.\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s preferred candidate also won in a race for an open Richmond-area Senate seat that is expected to be among the most competitive in Virginia in November. In that race, Chesterfield County Supervisor Dan Gecker defeated environmental activist Emily Francis and former delegate and businessman Alexander McMurtrie with help from McAuliffe, who did television and radio ads and robo-calls for Gecker. The seat is currently held by retiring Sen. John C. Watkins (R-Powhatan).\n\nFarther north, in a Prince William County district, state Sen. Charles J. Colgan (D) is vacating a seat Republicans hope to take. They nominated Manassas Mayor Harry J. \u201cHal\u201d Parrish II, whose father was both mayor and a longtime state delegate. On the Democratic side, with nearly all precincts reported, Jeremy McPike, who works for the city of Alexandria, defeated math teacher Atif Qarni and state Del. Michael Futrell.\n\nA tight race is also expected in the fall in neighboring territory, where Republican Sen. Richard H. Black (R-Loudoun) will square off against Democrat Jill McCabe, a pediatrician. Neither faced a primary, leaving the candidates free to focus on raising money for the fall. McCabe has outraised Black this year, but for the moment the incumbent still has far more cash on hand.\n\nIn Roanoke, southwest Virginia\u2019s only Democratic senator could be imperiled by an independent bid. Prosecutor and former Democrat Don Caldwell decided this week to run as an independent against both incumbent Sen. John S. Edwards (D) and Republican Nancy Dye.\n\n\u201cI believe that we can both agree that our community deserves better representation than what we have had for the past 20 years from John Edwards,\u201d Dye said in a statement.\n\nAnother independent bid has been launched by former delegate Joe Morrissey, who recently announced plans to marry the teenaged former intern and mother of his child \u2014 and to run for a state Senate seat in Richmond.\n\nTo face him, incumbent state Sen. Rosalyn R. Dance (D) first turned back a primary challenge Tuesday from freshman delegate Joseph E. Preston.\n\nA four-way primary in Henrico County to replace retiring Sen. Walter A. Stosch (R), another proponent of Medicaid expansion, likewise pitted the GOP establishment against conservatives.\n\nFormer delegate Bill Janis is a longtime foe of conservative activists, and many of them backed Newt Gingrich staffer Vincent Haley. But the victor was Siobhan Stolle Dunnavant, a doctor from a political family, who outraised Janis, Haley and party loyalist Edward S. Whitlock III.\n\nMark Levine prevailed in a crowded field of five Democrats competing to replace Alexandria\u2019s Del. K. Robert Krupicka Jr. (D), who decided to retire so he could focus on his doughnut shop. All five agreed on nearly every issue; Krupicka backed Julie Jakopic, 54, owner and operator of a leadership and strategy consulting firm.\n\nMany people said they couldn\u2019t tell the difference between delegate candidates. At Alexandria\u2019s Mount Vernon Recreation Center, Cathy Melanson said she voted for Levine because of his \u201cinclusive\u201d policy on gay men and lesbians. David Lipwick said he, too, liked Levine\u2019s \u201csexual orientation\u201d stances.\n\nIn the Mount Vernon area of Fairfax, Paul E. Krizek, chief counsel for Christian Relief Services Charities, easily defeated Justin Brown, a Navy veteran who works on Capitol Hill, in the Democratic primary to replace Del. Scott A. Surovell (D), who is running for Senate.\n\nLaura Vozzella contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House of Delegates Speaker William J.
