An improved economy and the financial tail winds from cheaper gas prices could influence many consumers, especially ones with lower incomes and tighter budgets, to boost their spending. That would be a healthy sign for overall growth, since the consumer spending category makes up almost 70 percent of the U.S. economy. But even if Black Friday sales aren\u2019t as strong as they\u2019ve been in years past, it might not necessarily indicate a slowing economy. In fact, it could be a sign that consumers feel things are getting better.\n\n\n\n[READ: The 14 Best Deals of Black Friday 2014]\n\nHistory suggests that in a good economy, consumers have less of a reason to rely on deep discounts, says Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation.\n\n\u201cThe difference between a $4 toaster and a $15 toaster isn\u2019t that significant for a lot of Americans,\u201d Grannis says. \u201cBut if you really are pinching pennies and you\u2019re watching your budget, you might head out for that $4 toaster [on Black Friday].\u201d\n\nData from the National Retail Federation show that Black Friday weekend shopping on a per-person basis gyrates somewhat irrespective of what\u2019s going on in the larger economy. For example, in the middle of the Great Recession in 2008, shoppers ramped up their Thanksgiving weekend spending by 7.2 percent over 2007. But in 2013, they dialed their spending back by 3.9 percent.\n\n\n\nLindsey Cook for USN&WR; Source: National Retail Federation\n\nOn the upper end of the income spectrum, shoppers generally are less reliant on Thanksgiving sales. \u201cThey might even sleep through the deals,\u201d Grannis says.\n\nAnd if consumers don\u2019t show up to take advantage of Black Friday deals, it could mean a less volatile pace of spending, says Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Sterne Agee.\n\n\u201cThat people might not be relying on Black Friday discounts doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they want to pay full price, but consumers aren\u2019t backloading yearly spending between November and December,\u201d Piegza says. \u201cMore than relying on deep discounts, retailers are being smart in pulling in consumers in the spring, summer and fall with seasonal discounts.\u201d\n\n\n\n[ALSO: Why You Never Need to Shop on Black Friday Again]\n\nRecent economic reports confirm that the American economy has made big improvements in 2014 alone. The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that growth during the second and third quarters was stronger than in any six-month period in over a decade. The Labor Department reported earlier this month that the unemployment rate is at a six-year low and monthly job gains are the strongest they\u2019ve been since 1999.\n\nAdd to that the fact that the average price of regular unleaded gasoline had been declining for 60 days and was at a four-year low as of Monday, according to AAA. Lower gas prices \u2013 like a tax break \u2013 enable people to spend more freely. And low-income Americans are more likely to spend their extra cash than those with higher incomes, providing another potential economic spending boost.\n\n\n\n\u201cAt least in the short run, the drop in gas might give households the wherewithal to spend a little more. I wouldn\u2019t expect a quantum leap \u2013 things are getting better, but they\u2019re getting better incrementally,\u201d says Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont.\n\nDiscount retailers like Wal-Mart and Sears are the top destinations for holiday shoppers and 96 percent of people say discounts are important in their buying decisions, according to a recent Accenture report. But 28 percent of people reported higher incomes this year compared with last, and 22 percent of people said they have greater job security this year, up from 15 percent in 2013.\n\nThe kinds of items people are buying also could be an important indicator of how successful this Black Friday will be. Researchers at the Georgetown Institute for Consumer Research anticipate a slight decline in Black Friday sales this year as consumers shop more for apparel and less for electronics.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of consumers are planning to spend the same or less than last year during Thanksgiving sales events. In fact, the only subset of consumers planning to spend more this year are men and high-income individuals who are planning on shopping online,\u201d the Georgetown researchers said in a report.\n\nReport authors Kurt Carlson and Ishani Banerji say the weekend is even more important for millennials, who have lower incomes than members of older generations but who plan to spend almost the same amount as non-millennials: $363 and $373, respectively. The generation has had a notoriously hard time financially following the economic crisis, and stands to benefit from deeper discounts.\n\n\u201cThis implies that millennials spend a greater portion of their discretionary income on Thanksgiving shopping than non-millennials,\u201d Carlson and Banerji wrote in an email to U.S. News. \u201cAnd this implies that success around Black Friday sales hinges on attracting the millennials.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Data Mine [News]", "title": "Black Friday Shopping May Show Improving Economy", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "But less reliance on seasonal discounts also would indicate a more confident consumer.", "title": "Black Friday Shopping May Show Improving Economy", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/11/27/black-friday-shopping-may-show-improving-economy", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/f6/c1/52a607974f6c8cd0bc3e3783b5c7/141126-blackfriday-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "But less reliance on seasonal discounts also would indicate a more confident consumer.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Black Friday Shopping May Show Improving Economy"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Nov. 27, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Katherine Peralta,Pulse,picks,economy,Thanksgiving,Black Friday,consumers,Data Mine [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "But less reliance on seasonal discounts also would indicate a more confident consumer."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde1a\"", "article_summary": "But even if Black Friday sales aren\u2019t as strong as they\u2019ve been in years past, it might not necessarily indicate a slowing economy.\n\u201cThis implies that millennials spend a greater portion of their discretionary income on Thanksgiving shopping than non-millennials,\u201d Carlson and Banerji wrote in an email to U.S. News.\n[READ: The 14 Best Deals of Black Friday 2014]History suggests that in a good economy, consumers have less of a reason to rely on deep discounts, says Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman for the National Retail Federation.\n\u201cThe vast majority of consumers are planning to spend the same or less than last year during Thanksgiving sales events.\n\u201cAnd this implies that success around Black Friday sales hinges on attracting the millennials.\u201d"}
