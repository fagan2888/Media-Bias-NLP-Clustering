Not quite satisfied with the level of advertising he was seeing out there, he recruited actors Harvey Keitel and Johnny Knoxville to make their own pitches to New Yorkers and young people, respectively.\n\nOn one side, Jones met with Anne Filipic of Enroll America who is doing what she can to get millions of Americans signed up for health insurance. On the other was conservative analyst Gina Loudon who believe \u201cObamacare is bad for America.\u201d Jones had some major trouble taking Loudon seriously, especially when she argued that the private health insurance system has \u201cworked really well for a really long time.\u201d\n\nBut things really took off when Jones got a look at the ads each side was putting out leading up to the October 1st launch. After viewing an ad from Enroll America aimed at New Yorkers, Jones said, \u201cYou don\u2019t suggest health care in New York, you tell them.\u201d This led to the pitch from Keitel, in which the actor says, \u201cBuy some fucking health insurance, New York\u2026 Sign up, you assholes!\u201d\n\nJones also offered up an alternative to Generation Opportunity\u2019s now-infamous ad, in which a creepy Uncle Sam attempts to give a young woman a pelvic exam. In an alternative attempt to appeal to young (and old) Americans, Jones tapped Knoxville, who brought his Jackass antics to the world of Obamacare.\n\nKnoxville explained that he knows what it\u2019s like to feel \u201cinvincible,\u201d but realizes now that everyone should be covered \u201cbecause you never know when something unexpected\u201d is going to happen. He ended the ad by asking, \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be single player coverage? It would be so much easier.\u201d\n\nWatch video below, via Comedy Central:\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the official launch of the Affordable Care Act exchanges Tuesday, The Daily Show's Jason Jones took a look at some of the messaging that both sides are", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DS.jpg", "title": "Harvey Keitel and Johnny Knoxville Help Sell Obamacare on Daily Show"}, "twitter": {"description": "With the official launch of the Affordable Care Act exchanges Tuesday, The Daily Show's Jason Jones took a look at some of the messaging that both sides are using to either encourage or discourage Americans from signing up.", "title": "Harvey Keitel and Johnny Knoxville Help Sell Obamacare on Daily Show", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DS.jpg", "creator": "@themattwilstein", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2013-10-02T12:21:02+00:00", "keywords": "tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In an alternative attempt to appeal to young (and old) Americans, Jones tapped Knoxville, who brought his Jackass antics to the world of Obamacare.\nNot quite satisfied with the level of advertising he was seeing out there, he recruited actors Harvey Keitel and Johnny Knoxville to make their own pitches to New Yorkers and young people, respectively.\nOn one side, Jones met with Anne Filipic of Enroll America who is doing what she can to get millions of Americans signed up for health insurance.\nIt would be so much easier.\u201dWatch video below, via Comedy Central:[photo via screengrab]\u2014 \u2014>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter\nHe ended the ad by asking, \u201cWhy can\u2019t it be single player coverage?"}
