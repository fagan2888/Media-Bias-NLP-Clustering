The Ohio governor was confused.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t have health insurance because there is a program now through the exchange,\u201d Kasich reportedly told the woman\n\nOf the six remaining presidential candidates, Kasich is the only one who says things like this. Confronted with a voter without access to affordable care, the governor is supposed to start blaming President Obama, even if that doesn\u2019t make sense, before launching into a fiery diatribe about \u201cObamacare.\u201d Instead, Kasich simply reminded the South Carolina woman how easy it is to get insured \u2013 even if that means working within the Affordable Care Act system.\n\nThe Columbus Dispatch had a good report the other day, noting that some of the governor\u2019s rivals are using this approach to undermine his candidacy.\n\nThe race for the Republican presidential nomination erupted in anger as Gov. John Kasich accused Jeb Bush of \u201ctrashing\u201d his opponents following the former Florida governor\u2019s criticism of Kasich using federal dollars to expand health coverage to low-income people. [\u2026] Bush provoked the battle Wednesday when he told a gathering in suburban Charleston that by accepting federal money to add coverage to low-income people, Kasich was making \u201cmore and more people dependent upon government.\u201d\n\nKasich responded that while he supports repealing the ACA, \u201cexpanding Medicaid at this point, bringing our dollars back is working. It\u2019s saving money and it\u2019s saving lives. And that\u2019s what really matters at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nExcept, this kind of thinking is so wildly out of step with contemporary Republican politics, it\u2019s a near-perfect summary of why Kasich is all but certain to lose.\n\nFor the Ohio governor \u2013 a conservative Republican who only appears moderate when compared to the other five GOP presidential candidates \u2013 it\u2019s best to evaluate policies like Medicaid expansion on their efficacy. He embraced this aspect of the Affordable Care Act; it\u2019s \u201cworking\u201d; it\u2019s \u201csaving money\u201d; it\u2019s \u201csaving lives\u201d; those results are \u201cwhat really matters.\u201d\n\nNot to put too fine a point on this, but Republicans have spent seven years convincing themselves of the exact opposite. Whether or not a policy works, the argument goes, isn\u2019t nearly as important as the policy\u2019s partisan implications, ideological purity, and effects on the next election cycle.\n\nThe whole \u201cpost-policy\u201d thesis exists for a reason.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "For the Ohio governor, it's best to evaluate policies like Medicaid expansion on their efficacy.
