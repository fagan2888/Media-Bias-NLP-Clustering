A free health fair was held in north Wichita, providing free medical checkups and educational material on healthy choices.

The fair was held at the New Beginnings Seventh Day Adventist Church near 21st and Broadway.

Many organizations provided free medical testing for blood disorders and other tests. There was also a bus that had mammogram imaging technology inside, where people who qualified for a mammogram had hospital grade technology processing the test.

The testing was done for free for some women who met certain guidelines such as being between the ages of 40 and 64 years old and have a certain income. Here is a link to the program and the requirements: Click here.

There are two other events this mammogram testing will be available at in Wichita; October 4th at the Asian Wellness Day and October 11th at the Caf√© con Leche event.

Pastor Carlos McConico said the fair helped anyone in his community find free resources for their health. "We have some that have not accessed these resources, they have them and that is why we are doing this to make them aware of where they are, not only people in our church but in community," McConico said.
