One of two groups in Georgia who received grants to help provide navigators was the University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer Sciences, which hired 12 navigators. But earlier this year, the Georgia Legislature passed a bill essentially barring anyone who is a state entity or employee from serving as a navigator, which would essentially eliminate the UGA program, said Dant\u00e9 McKay, the state director for Enroll America.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out who is going to step up to fill those shoes,\u201d said McKay, who said he did not know who else applied this time.\n\nUnlike many other states, Georgia requires navigators to pass a criminal background check, undergo training and be licensed by the state. That can cost on average about $300, McKay said, which had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on some would-be navigators. \u201cIt was just an unforeseen expense that most people couldn\u2019t accommodate,\u201d he said.\n\nBut if the community pools its resources together, that can be overcome, said the Rev. Melvin Ivey of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Augusta.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re pulling these people, we\u2019ve got to replace these people,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it is a necessity. Finances should not be the reason we can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nAugusta itself had about three navigators working last enrollment period and it was \u201cvery busy,\u201d said navigator Terri Gant with Medical Associates Plus at Belle Terrace. A lot of it was education at first, then trying to reach people through a lot of events with different community partners like churches and the Augusta Library, she said.\n\n\u201cWe could not have done what we did without our partners,\u201d Gant said.\n\n\u201cThat partnership was huge,\u201d said Craige Taylor Burton, an enrollment specialist at Christ Community Health Services.\n\nThe need is out there, said Melita Lowe, the family and community engagement manager for CSRA EOA Head Start. In the 11 counties it serves, there are thousands of families, many of them in rural counties that lack not only health care but access to computers and even basic transportation, she said.\n\nIn the rural areas, there\u2019s not a lot of resources,\u201d Lowe said. Even just getting information or a flyer into the group\u2019s monthly newsletter would be helpful, she said.\n\nBut social media is also a powerful tool to reach people, as recent elections have shown, said Mayor-elect Hardie Davis.\n\n\u201cThese are campaign tools,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not get out and vote. This is get out and get insured.\u201d\n\nLatinos in particular did not get the message last time and part of that is the language barrier, said Ed Acevedo of the Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural Hispanoamericana. About three-fourths didn\u2019t know there was financial assistance for getting the insurance, he said.\n\n\u201cThese are challenges, or I would say opportunities, to make it better the next time around,\u201d Acevedo said.\n\nJust looking at the poor health outcomes in Augusta should motivate people to get involved, Davis said.\n\n\u201cThat should warrant private investment on its own to say, \u2018How can we help lift this?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI will offer help to try to help lift that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Tom Corwin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "With an uncertain number of trained people available to help enroll people under the Affordable Care Act next time around, a Georgia enrollment advocacy group met Wednesday with Augusta community leaders.", "title": "Leaders meet on plans to fill void left by absence of navigators for helping with Obamacare enrollment", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/health/2014-07-23/leaders-meet-plans-fill-void-left-absence-navigators-helping-obamacare", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/13557852.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat partnership was huge,\u201d said Craige Taylor Burton, an enrollment specialist at Christ Community Health Services.\nOne of two groups in Georgia who received grants to help provide navigators was the University of Georgia College of Family and Consumer Sciences, which hired 12 navigators.\nUnlike many other states, Georgia requires navigators to pass a criminal background check, undergo training and be licensed by the state.\nThat can cost on average about $300, McKay said, which had a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on some would-be navigators.\n\u201cThat should warrant private investment on its own to say, \u2018How can we help lift this?\u2019\u201d he said."}
