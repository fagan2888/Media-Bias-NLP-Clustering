That\u2019s easy: The GOP base is fed up with its mealy-mouthed, impotent leaders.\n\nRepublican voters see their party\u2019s recently crowned congressional kingpins, as well as the career pols running for the White House, as all talk and no action, while Trump comes across as someone who\u2019d actually get things done.\n\nThe real estate magnate is tapping into frustration mainly over GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s and House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s failure to deliver on promises made during the 2014 campaign.\n\nMcConnell and Boehner have the power of the purse, yet they\u2019ve punted on promises to defund executive amnesty for illegal immigrants, the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, HUD\u2019s plan to remap the suburbs and, most recently, Planned Parenthood.\n\nRepealing ObamaCare was the cornerstone of their message to the GOP faithful in 2014. In October alone, they ran more than 35,000 TV ads promising to scrap it. They also flooded the airways with 10,000 commercials vowing to block Obama\u2019s unconstitutional order suspending enforcement of immigration laws.\n\nOn these messages, Republicans were swept back into power. The day after their victory, McConnell and Boehner wrote a national column pledging to make good on their many pledges. But once seated, they agreed with Democrats to fully fund ObamaCare. They also failed to pass a Homeland Security bill blocking Obamamnesty.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s impotence was on display again Monday when he failed to pass a bill to end taxpayer funding for organ-harvesting abortion clinics. A week earlier, he forced through an amendment reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, a bastion of crony capitalism.\n\nLast year he complained \u201cmany bills that passed the Republican-led House in recent years were never even brought to a vote by the Democratic Senate majority,\u201d adding \u201cmany passed with bipartisan support \u2014 only to gather dust in a Democratic-controlled Senate that kept them from ever reaching the president\u2019s desk.\u201d\n\nBut nothing\u2019s really changed in McConnell\u2019s Senate, where the now-Democrat minority filibusters bills to death. He could have nuked the filibuster like his predecessor Harry Reid, but he\u2019s refused to wield such power for fear of media backlash. What good is a GOP Congress when Obama has had to veto only four bills, while getting virtually all his radical nominees approved?\n\nUnlike the GOP political class, Trump is not cowed by the inside-the-Beltway crowd. He gives it right back, which is why he\u2019s leading his closest rival by 2-to-1.\n\nThat said, Trump is no conservative panacea. Many of his policy positions, past and present, are a problem, as are his generous donations to Democrats.\n\nIn fact, his $34,000 gift to Democratic campaign committees in the 2006 election cycle helped put Reid and Rep. Nancy Pelosi in power. Two years later, they rammed through the medical and financial regulations that McConnell and Boehner can\u2019t roll back.\n\nBy breaking their word, these two leaders could deliver the presidential nomination to a candidate whose Republican credentials, if not his swagger, are in doubt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Politics: As the presidential debate approaches, the Republican establishment is at a loss to figure out Donald Trump's runaway popularity.
