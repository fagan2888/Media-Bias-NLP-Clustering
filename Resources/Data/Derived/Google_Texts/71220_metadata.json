Just this summer one family friend and former patient of dad\u2019s told me that my father not only saved the life of his mother, but his also. All on one day.Although he carried board certification as an internist and a medical examiner, dad took care of families. He was a busy primary care doctor before the title was popularized. I trust that in today\u2019s medical world the skill and caring of America\u2019s doctors endures\u2014if little else.A new national survey of primary care providers (physicians, NPs, and PAs) from the Commonwealth Fund/Kaiser Family Foundation is out. More than 1,600 doctors were questioned about their \u201cexperiences with and reactions to recent changes in healthcare delivery and payment.\u201dOverall, the opinions of primary care physicians (PCPs) are mixed as to the current state of medical practice. Clearly, they understand that medicine is changing and will probably continue to. The successful physicians will adapt.Surprisingly enough, with all the EHRs problems doctors cite, they generally like how information technology is helping with bettering healthcare. And in no surprise, nearly half of surveyed doctors said the recent trend in healthcare has them contemplating an early professional exit.Here are few other PCP survey highlights:\u2022 Regarding PCP pay, only about one-third are compensated exclusively on a fee-for-service basis. The vast majority (64%) say they are paid via capitation or salary. And most physicians (55%) said their \u201cpractice receives incentives or payments based on measures of quality of care, patients\u2019 experiences, or efficiency of providing care.\u2022 When it comes to hanging up the stethoscope early due to healthcare changes, nearly half (47%) of the PCPs said they have entertained the idea. This may not be all bad, though. \u201cWhile physician dissatisfaction is associated with early retirement,\u201d the survey concludes, \u201ca look at historical trends shows that physician satisfaction levels have not changed dramatically over the past 20 years.\u201d\u2022 A clear majority of PCPs are skeptical about whether their performance assessments and financial penalties should be tied to patient outcomes. Half of all doctors \u201cfeel that the increased use of quality metrics to assess provider performance\u201d is negatively impacting patient care.\u201d\u2022 When it comes to the increased use of non-physician clinicians, PCPs have very different views from their NPs and PA colleagues about their roles in primary care. Nearly 90% of NPs and PA see charges as positive; just 29% of doctors think that way. Still, regarding teamwork and collaboration among these three healthcare pros, more than 85% of doctors call it satisfying.\u2022 Physicians were asked to \u201crate Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurers in terms of their reimbursement rates and administrative burden.\u201d Most doctors rate these groups negatively when it comes to getting paid\u2014although private insurance payers score better than public. About half of the PCPs admitted they don\u2019t even know how they get paid by the federal government.\u2022 Has primary care medical practice consolidation slowed? Perhaps. Among the surveyed doctors, just 17% \u201creported their practices were acquired by or consolidated with a group practice, hospital, or another type of organization within the past two years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new survey of primary care providers shows many doctors are thinking about early retirement or changing careers.", "og": {"site_name": "MD Magazine", "description": "A new survey of primary care providers shows many doctors are thinking about early retirement or changing careers.", "title": "47% of Primary Care Doctors Think About Quitting", "url": "http://www.hcplive.com/physicians-money-digest/columns/the-doctor-report/08-2015/47-of-primary-care-doctors-think-about-quitting", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v1_media/_upload_image/_thumbnails/Stressed_worried_doctor.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v2_media/_core/favi/ms-icon-144x144.png", "keywords": "Columns, Practice Management, Internal Medicine, Family Medicine, pediatrics,", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "He was a busy primary care doctor before the title was popularized.\nAbout half of the PCPs admitted they don\u2019t even know how they get paid by the federal government.\u2022 Has primary care medical practice consolidation slowed?\nMore than 1,600 doctors were questioned about their \u201cexperiences with and reactions to recent changes in healthcare delivery and payment.\u201dOverall, the opinions of primary care physicians (PCPs) are mixed as to the current state of medical practice.\nAll on one day.Although he carried board certification as an internist and a medical examiner, dad took care of families.\nI trust that in today\u2019s medical world the skill and caring of America\u2019s doctors endures\u2014if little else.A new national survey of primary care providers (physicians, NPs, and PAs) from the Commonwealth Fund/Kaiser Family Foundation is out."}
