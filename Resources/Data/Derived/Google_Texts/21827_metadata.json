While we may have showered, deodorized, and spritzed on our best fragrance, we still manage to get a whiff of an onerous odor we soon realize is our own. Our favorite beverage or food could actually be giving us bad body odor, suggesting we smell like what we eat.\n\nAlthough the most common body odor is produced in our armpits and groin in combination with bacteria typically found on our skin, according to the Mayo Clinic, foods like garlic and onions, which may contain volatile sulfurous substances, can be released through our sweat. They are absorbed into our blood and our lungs after digestion, giving us bad body odor and breath.\n\nTo make sure what you eat helps you smell sweet, avoid consuming these foods:\n\n1. Alcohol\n\nThe occasional glass of wine or beer may not produce bad body odors, but it could lead to experiencing bad breath in the morning after sipping down a couple the previous night. As alcohol goes through the blood and the body, some of it seeps out through the pores, and through the breath, as a person\u2019s perspiration begins to smell of alcohol. Therefore, the mouth becomes dehydrated, and urine even has a faint smell of alcohol, according to alcoholrehab.com.\n\n2. Asparagus\n\nAfter eating asparagus and using the restroom, most of us come to the realization that our urine has a different smell. This odor is thought to derive from the digestion of mercaptan \u2014 the sulfur compound \u2014 that breaks down into smelly chemical components. A 2010 study published in the journal Chemical Senses did find some study participants failed to develop asparagus pee because they lacked to gene for the digestive enzyme that breaks down the vegetable into its smelly components.\n\n3. Coffee\n\nThis morning pick-me-up beverage can not only activate our brains to remain more alert due to caffeine, but it can also activate our sweat glands. The term \u201ccoffee breath\u201d has become a problem for coffee drinkers because it is a diuretic that will make us feel very thirsty, leading to a bad taste and smell, which dries out the mouth. \"The dryness in the mouth especially contributes to the growth of bacteria,\u201d Justyna Trzesniowski, Registered Nurse, and former coffee barista told ABC.net.au.\n\n4. Curry and Cumin\n\nThe smells of spices such as curry and cumin can turn a bland meal into a savory dish, but it can also wreak havoc on your body\u2019s natural odor, remaining in your pores for days. A brief taste of cumin can actually leave a lasting aroma. Berkeley Wellness at the University of California, Berkeley, says a mom\u2019s prenatal diet, if it regularly includes strong spices like curry, cumin, or fenugreek, could possibly affect her newborn\u2019s body odor.\n\n5. Red Meat\n\nUnless you\u2019re a vegetarian, it is most probable you will eventually experience an unpleasant body odor. A 2006 study published in the journal Chemical Senses found the odor of participants who were on a non-meat diet had a significantly more attractive and pleasant smell and less intense compared to their meat eating counterparts. This is due to the duration it takes for large amounts of meat to travel through the digestive tract, as it rots throughout. As a result, the person experiences bad odors in their breath, perspiration, and bowel movements.\n\n6. Too Little Greens\n\nIt\u2019s important to eat your greens not just for your health, but for good body odor. Chlorophyllin, found in plants, has been used orally as an internal deodorant in the 1940s and 1950s on foul-smelling wounds, according to the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University. Eating chlorophyll-rich greens such as spinach, and watercress can help freshen up the body, and prevent bad body odor.\n\nRemember, you smell what you eat, so choose wisely to smell sweet and prevent nose-pinching body odors.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bad body odor, you are what you eat, bad breath, stinky breath, smelly foods, stinky foods, alcohol, asparagus, coffee, curry, cumin, red meat, too little greens", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Avoid consuming these six stinky foods \u2014 from asparagus to coffee \u2014 that can actually lead to bad body odor through sweat.", "title": "6 Smelly Foods That Are Actually Giving You Bad Body Odor", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/you-are-what-you-eat-6-smelly-foods-are-actually-giving-you-bad-body-odor-298318", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/woman-hold-nose-and-cooking-pot-because-bad-smell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Avoid consuming these six stinky foods \u2014 from asparagus to coffee \u2014 that can actually lead to bad body odor through sweat.", "title": "6 Smelly Foods That Are Actually Giving You Bad Body Odor", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/you-are-what-you-eat-6-smelly-foods-are-actually-giving-you-bad-body-odor-298318", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/woman-hold-nose-and-cooking-pot-because-bad-smell.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/15/woman-hold-nose-and-cooking-pot-because-bad-smell.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-16T10:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-16T10:01:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Avoid consuming these six stinky foods \u2014 from asparagus to coffee \u2014 that can actually lead to bad body odor through sweat."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4c52\"", "article_summary": "Our favorite beverage or food could actually be giving us bad body odor, suggesting we smell like what we eat.\nThey are absorbed into our blood and our lungs after digestion, giving us bad body odor and breath.\nEating chlorophyll-rich greens such as spinach, and watercress can help freshen up the body, and prevent bad body odor.\nAlcoholThe occasional glass of wine or beer may not produce bad body odors, but it could lead to experiencing bad breath in the morning after sipping down a couple the previous night.\nRed MeatUnless you\u2019re a vegetarian, it is most probable you will eventually experience an unpleasant body odor."}
