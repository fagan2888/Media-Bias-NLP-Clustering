The repayments come if a subsidy recipient\u2019s actual income was higher than their projected income.\n\n\u201cIf you are low-income, having to pay any increase on taxes is a hardship on people,\u201d Cynthia Cox, Kaiser Family Foundation associate director and lead author of the study told TheBlaze. \u201cEven if your income goes up over the year, some people don\u2019t realize they are receiving subsidies and would be surprised they have to pay back so much.\u201d\n\nThe study found that some taxpayers would have to pay back nearly $4,000 if their income rose out of the poverty level entirely, using projections for the first tax filing year after Obamacare subsidies were available. Nearly half, or 46 percent, of those making repayments would owe between $200 and $1,000 to the government.\n\n\u201cThis is a consequence of Obamacare using the tax system to help low-income families buy insurance,\u201d Cox said.\n\nThe Kaiser study, titled \u201cRepayments and Refunds: Estimating the Effects of 2014 Premium Tax Credit Reconciliation,\u201d comes the same week the Obama administration marked the fifth anniversary of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnder the law, households with incomes of up to four time higher than the federal poverty level are eligible for subsidies. The federal poverty level for 2013 was $11,490. But someone making up to $45,960 could also get federal subsidies from the Department of Health and Human Services to assist in purchasing plans on the Obamacare exchange. If someone\u2019s incomes is higher than projected, or increases during the year, the household would have to repay at least some of the subsidy.\n\nThough 50 percent of those getting subsidies would have to repay the government, another 45 percent of those getting subsidies are projected to get refunds, which will be on average $773. The bulk of refunds issued \u2013 42 percent \u2013 would be between $200 and $1,000, according to Kaiser.\n\nThe number receiving subsidies has not been determined, but is estimated between 4.5 million and 7.5 million, Cox said.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson did not respond immediately to inquiries from TheBlaze about the findings. An Internal Revenue Service official told TheBlaze that because this is the first tax filing year for health care subsidies, there would be no way to confirm the Kaiser findings and said the agency did not want to speculate.\n\nWhen people sign up to buy an Obacmacare plan on healthcare.gov or the state marketplace, they fill out what they anticipate their income being over the next year, which can sometimes be hard to predict, Cox said.\n\n\u201cFor those owing a few thousand, they may have made enough in their increased income to be able to swing it, but it might still comes as a surprise,\u201d Cox said.\n\nSomeone signing up for Obamacare with an income earning up to twice the federal poverty level \u2013 $22,980 for an individual \u2013 would have the lowest repayment level with an average payment of about $667, but some could get an average refund of $412.\n\nA household earning between $34,470 and $45,690 \u2013 or between three and four times higher than the poverty level \u2013 would face an average repayment of $1,380, or an average refund would pay $1,601.\n\nFor those who earn more than $45,690 by the end of the year, the repayment could be between $2,306 to $3837, depending on their projected income.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "What Obamacare gives, it can take away \u2013 at least if you got a pay increase over the last year.
