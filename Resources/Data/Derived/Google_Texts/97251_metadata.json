(USATSI)\n\nAccording to multiple reports, via SI.com, Heat forward Michael Beasley, in his first game back with Miami after signing as a free agent this summer, had an incident in his first game. Despite scoring nine points and adding two rebounds, Beasley reportedly required \"medical treatment\" after punching himself in the head out of frustration.\n\nNo, really.\n\nBeasley called for traveling and begins punching himself in the head. Meanwhile, James Jones pushes him into defensive position. \u2014 Joseph Goodman (@JoeGoodmanJr) October 11, 2013\n\nTreatment as in the application of those steel compresses cut doctors use on boxers. Beas' brow was swollen RT @jordub as in stitches? \u2014 Joseph Goodman (@JoeGoodmanJr) October 11, 2013\n\nOf course, Beasley also did something a little odd after one offensive play. Upset with himself over missing a shot, Beasley started punching himself in the head while running back on defense. He punched himself so hard that he needed treatment after the game from the Heat's trainer.

Beasley was drafted by Miami in 2008, before being traded in 2010 after the formation of the Lebron-James-Chris-Bosh-Dwyane-Wade Triad. He had no success in Minnesota, then signed a three-year, $18 million deal with Phoenix which the Suns bit the bullet on and waived him of this summer.\n\nBut it is pretty funny that he hit himself in the head so hard he needed basically an ice pack on his head.\n\nI don't know, people are always demanding that Beasley have some level of self-discipline...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Heat forward self-punishes after a turnover, requires compresses to his head in preseason debut for Miami.", "og": {"site_name": "CBSSports.com", "description": "Heat forward self-punishes after a turnover, requires compresses to his head in preseason debut for Miami.", "title": "Michael Beasley needs medical attention after hitting himself", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24064008/michael-beasley-requires-medical-attention-after-hitting-himself-in-frustration", "image": "http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/visual/whatshot/michaelbeasley.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Heat forward self-punishes after a turnover, requires compresses to his head in preseason debut for Miami.", "title": "Michael Beasley needs medical attention after hitting himself", "url": "http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24064008/michael-beasley-requires-medical-attention-after-hitting-himself-in-frustration", "image": "http://sports.cbsimg.net/images/visual/whatshot/michaelbeasley.jpg", "creator": "@EyeOnBasketball", "site": "@cbssports", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 297742330311988, "pages": 25902406772}, "vr": {"content_id": 24064008, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "NBA basketball rumors news scores stats standings teams schedules games results, National Basketball Association, NBA Tickets, professional pro basketball teams stats news, NBA schedule players, CBSSports.com", "googlebot": "NOODP"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1297\"", "article_summary": "Despite scoring nine points and adding two rebounds, Beasley reportedly required \"medical treatment\" after punching himself in the head out of frustration.\nvia Miami Heat take on Detroit Pistons in NBA exhibition at Palace of Auburn Hills - Sun Sentinel.\nUpset with himself over missing a shot, Beasley started punching himself in the head while running back on defense.\nBeasley was drafted by Miami in 2008, before being traded in 2010 after the formation of the Lebron-James-Chris-Bosh-Dwyane-Wade Triad.\nBut it is pretty funny that he hit himself in the head so hard he needed basically an ice pack on his head."}
