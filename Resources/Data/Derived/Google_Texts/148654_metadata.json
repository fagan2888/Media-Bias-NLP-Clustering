Washington Nationals starter Stephen Strasburg was hit during those two months in a way he had not been previously in his career. First, a 4.60 ERA in April. Then the abomination of May, when opponents hit .351 and Strasburg closed the month with a 10.13 ERA during five starts.\n\nAn ankle injury and back problem, both random, had contorted Strasburg\u2019s mechanics. His velocity was down. His number of pitches was up. His ineffectiveness was a contributor to the Nationals slogging through the beginning of the year, a churn that cost them at the end.\n\nThen, he flipped back to the Strasburg who, at 27 years old, is about to enter his prime years as one of the premier pitchers in the league. His post-all-star ERA was 1.90. He struck out 92 in 66 1/3 innings. He had six wins, nearly as many as the eight walks he allowed.\n\nStrasburg often mentioned a \u201cknot\u201d in his upper back that caused discomfort during the season. After the season, he had a benign fibrolipoma \u2014 a lipoma is \u201ca benign fatty tumor usually composed of mature fat cells,\u201d which in this case had excessive fibrous tissue \u2014 removed. It wasn\u2019t the knot Strasburg referenced, but was a contributor to the symptoms, like the knot, that he felt during the season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say it was the reason for pitching poorly or anything,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cIt was above the muscle, so they didn\u2019t cut into muscle or anything. It was a procedure all in itself took about 15 minutes and [doctors] said it\u2019s almost a zero percent chance of coming back. I was pretty much doing my normal stuff within a week.\u201d\n\nStrasburg can become a free agent after the 2016 season. He\u2019s decided to use the staid approach, one day at a time, one pitch at a time.\n\n\u201cI found with pitching, I pitch better, if I don\u2019t stress out as much, if I just focus on the now,\u201d Strasburg said.\n\nPart of that will be developing a relationship with new pitching coach Mike Maddux. Steve McCatty, the only pitching coach Strasburg has had in the big leagues, was fired along with several others from last year\u2019s coaching staff. Maddux arrives with a punchy sense of humor and long track record. Strasburg said he is willing to learn from anyone, and that a relationship with the pitching coach cannot be forced.\n\n\u201cI think communication is a big thing between the pitcher and the pitching coach, especially for the starter,\u201d Strasburg said. \u201cJust going over gameplans before the game, maybe mechanical tweaks. All of us here have been throwing and know our bodies the best and know how it should feel. A lot of times, it\u2019s us coaching ourselves then just picking their brains for some enlightenment.\u201d\n\nHe is not going to change anything about his offseason or spring training routine, outside of not severely spraining his ankle by stepping on something in the weight room. Strasburg said his arm felt as \u201cstrong as it ever could\u201d during last season. Once he shook off the ankle and back irritations, his numbers proved that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Strasburg had a fibrolipoma removed from his upper back in the offseason and said on Saturday he is healthy and not worrying about possibly being a free agent after next season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Strasburg had a fibrolipoma removed from his upper back in the offseason and said on Saturday he is healthy and not worrying about possibly being a free agent after next season.", "title": "Stephen Strasburg not worrying about free agency", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/12/stephen-strasburg-not-worrying-about-free-agency/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/09/0731a0bdb7799028810f6a706700b0c7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/09/0731a0bdb7799028810f6a706700b0c7.jpg", "description": "Strasburg had a fibrolipoma removed from his upper back in the offseason and said on Saturday he is healthy and not worrying about possibly being a free agent after next season.", "card": "summary", "title": "Stephen Strasburg not worrying about free agency"}, "Author": "Todd Dybas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Stephen Strasburg"}, "article_summary": "Steve McCatty, the only pitching coach Strasburg has had in the big leagues, was fired along with several others from last year\u2019s coaching staff.\n\u201cI think communication is a big thing between the pitcher and the pitching coach, especially for the starter,\u201d Strasburg said.\nWashington Nationals starter Stephen Strasburg was hit during those two months in a way he had not been previously in his career.\nIt wasn\u2019t the knot Strasburg referenced, but was a contributor to the symptoms, like the knot, that he felt during the season.\nStrasburg said he is willing to learn from anyone, and that a relationship with the pitching coach cannot be forced."}
