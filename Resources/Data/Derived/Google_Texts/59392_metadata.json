His parents whipped him, too. Now he lives in the Bronx and refuses to hit his own children. \u201cI don\u2019t think beating works,\u201d he says. \u201cIt instils in them a cruelty that they pass down, generation to generation.\u201d\n\nAmple evidence backs his view, say Richard Reeves and Emily Cuddy of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank. Nearly 30 studies from various countries show that children who are regularly spanked become more aggressive. They are also more likely to be depressed or take drugs, even after correcting for other factors.\n\nSmacking is effective in the short run: it stops children pulling their sisters\u2019 hair. But in the long run it has all sorts of bad effects. A study in 20 American cities found that young children in homes with little or no spanking showed swifter cognitive development than their peers. Other studies find that children in physically punitive schools perform worse.\n\nStill, 81% of American parents believe that spanking is sometimes necessary (see table). That is more than in many other rich countries, 20 of which have banned spanking even by parents. In America Republicans spank more than Democrats; southerners more than north-easterners; blacks more than whites; and born-again Christians more than everyone else.\n\nAmerican teachers are still allowed to whack children with a paddle (a wooden bat only a little shorter and thinner than a cricket bat) in 19 states, mostly in the South\u2014a practice that is banned in over 100 other countries. More than 216,000 pupils were beaten at school during the 2008-09 school year, according to the Department of Education.\n\nWhen Adrian Peterson, a football star, was arrested on charges of child abuse in September, after he allegedly wounded his son with a switch, several black pundits protested that beatings were an essential rite of passage. A whipping from a loving parent keeps kids on the straight and narrow, they argued. \u201cA father\u2019s belt hurts a lot less [than] a cop\u2019s bullet!\u201d tweeted D. L. Hughley, a black comedian. Others defer to the Bible: \u201cSpare the rod, spoil the child.\u201d Mr Stewart retorts that a better rod \u201ccould be the word of the Lord\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20141115_USP002_0.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Corporal punishment", "description": "Spanking makes your children stupid", "pubdate": 20141115, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "Spanking makes your children stupid", "title": "Spare the rod", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21632521-spanking-makes-your-children-stupid-spare-rod", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20141115_USP002_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "Spanking makes your children stupid", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-15 00:00:00", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20141115_USP002_0.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.printdate": "2014-11-15 00:00:00", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "United States", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20141115_USP002_0.jpg", "articleid": 21632521, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20141115_USP002_0.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Corporal punishment", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20141115_USP002_0.jpg", "news_keywords": "Corporal punishment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc89\"", "article_summary": "Others defer to the Bible: \u201cSpare the rod, spoil the child.\u201d Mr Stewart retorts that a better rod \u201ccould be the word of the Lord\u201d.\nGEORGE STEWART\u2019S teacher in Jamaica used to wait by the school door with a switch to punish tardy pupils.\nMore than 216,000 pupils were beaten at school during the 2008-09 school year, according to the Department of Education.\nNearly 30 studies from various countries show that children who are regularly spanked become more aggressive.\nThat is more than in many other rich countries, 20 of which have banned spanking even by parents."}
