Insurers have cited higher-than-expected care costs from customers they gained under ObamaCare\u2019s coverage expansion, rising cost of prescription drugs and other expenses as reasons for proposing the increases, many of which are in the double-digit percentages. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina is seeking a roughly 26% premium increase, while plans in Illinois and Florida, among other states, are asking for hikes of 20% or more. In Pennsylvania, Highmark Health Insurance Co. is asking for a 30% increase.\n\nAmount of time covered by the \u201cBig Three\u201d: zero.\n\nBad Obama Polling Results\n\nCBS News/New York Times poll results released Tuesday morning showed that Americans believe there is too much cash in politics; 84% of those polled said that money has too much influence in political campaigns. What the report didn\u2019t cover from the same poll: 37% of Americans approve of Obama\u2019s handling of foreign policy, while 49% disapprove. Also missing: 49% disapprove of Obama\u2019s handling of the economy.\n\nAmount of coverage by CBS of its own negative poll results on Obama: zero.\n\nBad Economic News\n\nThe economy contracted during the first quarter of 2015, with GDP falling .07%. Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity, was modest. Personal consumption rose by 1.8% last quarter, down from 4.4% in late 2014.\n\nCoverage by the \u201cBig Three: zero.\n\nExecutive Amnesty Ruling\n\nIn November of 2014, the \u201cBig Three\u201d hailed Obama\u2019s executive order granting amnesty to illegal immigrants. However, following the May, 27 decision by refusal the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to lift a stay on the controversial order, NBC and ABC both ignored the ruling.\n\nCoverage by CBS: 17 seconds.\n\nWhile the \u201cmainstream media\u201d has long denied that a liberal bias exists, Obama himself admitted earlier this year that it does:\n\nJudging by the amount of coverage given to the Vanity Fair cover \u2013 vs. covering the above stories impacting America \u2013 the networks themselves seem to have once again proved Obama\u2019s point.", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "description": "Spoiler: a total of 17 seconds devoted to all four stories...", "published_at": "2015-06-04T13:51:11+00:00", "author": "Mike Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "Spoiler: a total of 17 seconds devoted to all four stories...", "title": "Here Are the Stories You Might Have Missed While the Media Went Bonkers Over Caitlyn Jenner", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1480, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-04-at-11.03.52-AM.png", "height": 782}, "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/06/337429-here-are-the-stories-you-might-have-missed-while-the-media-went-bonkers-over-caitlyn-jenner/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Spoiler: a total of 17 seconds devoted to all four stories...", "creator": "@injo", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-04-at-11.03.52-AM.png", "title": "Here Are the Stories You Might Have Missed While the Media Went Bonkers Over Caitlyn Jenner", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "post_id": 337429, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-04T13:51:11-04:00", "wp-categories": "14082 27 2567 482", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "tags": "Nation", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/06/337429-here-are-the-stories-you-might-have-missed-while-the-media-went-bonkers-over-caitlyn-jenner/", "wp-category-slugs": "celebrities-entertainment, elections, lifestyle, nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Celebrities", "published_time": "2015-06-04T13:51:11-04:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-04-at-11.03.52-AM.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "is_https": 0}, "article_summary": "Amount of coverage by CBS of its own negative poll results on Obama: zero.\nAs reported by NewsBusters, the \u201cBig Three\u201d networks \u2013 CBS, NBC, ABC \u2013 devoted more than 48 minutes to the story from Monday night through Wednesday morning.\nExecutive Amnesty RulingIn November of 2014, the \u201cBig Three\u201d hailed Obama\u2019s executive order granting amnesty to illegal immigrants.\nWhat the report didn\u2019t cover from the same poll: 37% of Americans approve of Obama\u2019s handling of foreign policy, while 49% disapprove.\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As anyone who watches the news or spends any amount of time online knows, the \u201cCaitlyn Jenner\u201d Vanity Fair story has received a tremendous amount of coverage in the media since the magazine unveiled its July cover on Monday."}
