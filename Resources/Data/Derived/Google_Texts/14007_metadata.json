Over time, prescription drug trafficking continued to increase.\n\nIn my role as executive director of the Tennessee Sheriff's Association, our member sheriffs and other law-enforcement professionals are fighting an ever-growing battle against prescription drug abuse. The cases may run from the individual, who first started the habit stealing pills from a friend or relative and now steals to pay for his or her drugs, to the \"doc-shopping\" addict to the for-profit \"pain clinic.\"\n\nMost of us are familiar with these medicines, among them are Vicodin, Percocet and Hydrocodone. You may have been prescribed one of them after surgery or know a relative who takes them for chronic pain. But there are those who are getting high by crushing and snorting, chewing or shooting up these pain medications.\n\nThis is a complex problem with no easy answers, although the new abuse-deterrent medications may be a first step. This is new technology, approved by the FDA, which allows these medications to be manufactured in a way that makes the opioid useless if crushed to snort or mixed with water to inject.\n\nTaking a look at these new medications \u2013 along with the overall prescription drug abuse problem \u2013 is part of pending legislation in the Tennessee General Assembly. The \"Opioid Abuse Reduction Act\" (House Bill 403) would establish a working group, set up by the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, to look at the issue of opioid abuse in Tennessee \u2013 focusing primarily on TennCare patients. For years, we have seen a growing number of lower-income individuals who abuse opioids and who are more likely to sell these pills to pay for their habit.\n\nThis bill has been passed by the Senate and is expected to go to the full House for a vote soon. The legislation will also study the latest data about opioid abuse as well as the direct and indirect costs as well.\n\nThere is no single study effort that will solve this critical problem, but it will help raise awareness of the issue and identify techniques to fight the crisis.\n\nWhat it will take is Tennesseans coming together \u2013 law enforcement, doctors and nurses, state government, the faith community and concerned citizens \u2013 to work together to end this devastating epidemic.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1ynmMGE", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Law enforcement is fighting an ever-growing battle against prescription drug abuse.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Law enforcement is fighting an ever-growing battle against prescription drug abuse.", "title": "Seeking cure for Tennessee's prescription drug epidemic", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/04/12/seeking-cure-prescription-drug-epidemic/25670687/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Law enforcement is fighting an ever-growing battle against prescription drug abuse.", "title": "Seeking cure for Tennessee's prescription drug epidemic", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f24e6a62a58b167d1be9f8905af3c1896feb7e69/c=0-59-163-222&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/12/B9316927416Z.1_20150412110830_000_GSTAFD13U.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Chronic pain", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Chronic pain", "title": "Seeking cure for Tennessee's prescription drug epidemic", "author": "Terry Ashe", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9e46d207a6b9f4732836277da6d8bd1f1f457d36/c=0-32-163-249/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/12/B9316927416Z.1_20150412110830_000_GSTAFD13U.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/05b2a6ab06d302b24d45310993b7631a1636294e/c=0-59-163-222/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/12/B9316927416Z.1_20150412110830_000_GSTAFD13U.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c08efc30c74a6bd1e3b7045b6aae1499675752b2/c=0-80-163-202/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/12/B9316927416Z.1_20150412110830_000_GSTAFD13U.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3891d4b2928f52e5f8032bfe2f4326a4327d0ada/c=0-94-163-186&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/12/B9316927416Z.1_20150412110830_000_GSTAFD13U.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-04-12T10:29:23.757000-05:00", "shorthed": "Prescription drug epidemic needs cure", "articleid": 25670687, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8b991dd04fad2319a5de728d077daf92099abfde/c=0-94-163-186/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/12/B9316927416Z.1_20150412110830_000_GSTAFD13U.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/92993fdd21518a8e14b0753b1c0e4e66c538f6dd/c=2-0-160-281/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/04/12/B9316927416Z.1_20150412110830_000_GSTAFD13U.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "opioid, drug, prescription, vicodin, tennessee, epidemic, sheriff, law enforcement"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd022e\"", "article_summary": "Terry Ashe, executive director of Tennessee Sheriffs\u2019 Association (Photo: Submitted) Story Highlights Law enforcement is fighting an ever-growing battle against prescription drug abuse.\nThe scope of prescription drug abuse in Tennessee is staggering.\nIn my role as executive director of the Tennessee Sheriff's Association, our member sheriffs and other law-enforcement professionals are fighting an ever-growing battle against prescription drug abuse.\nOver time, prescription drug trafficking continued to increase.\nTaking a look at these new medications \u2013 along with the overall prescription drug abuse problem \u2013 is part of pending legislation in the Tennessee General Assembly."}
