This time for benefits he thinks his son deserves. It's an issue that affects others who served or are still in uniform.\n\nAfter 20 years in uniform, Jeff Gall expected service from the military. The retiree said, \"The insurance benefits are part of what I thought were the retirement benefits.\"\n\nBut his government-funded Tricare Health plan won't cover his son Carter who, in four months, turns 23.\n\nCarter Gall said, \"I make enough money now to pay the rent and go to school. If I had to pay my own health insurance, I'd have no idea.\"\n\nThough the Affordable Care Act allows children on their parents' plan until age 26, Tricare Health makes the cut at 23 if in college like Carter.\n\nJeff said, \"I want my kid to be eligible until he's 26 on my insurance just like everybody else.\"\n\nTricare does offer coverage that dependents can buy for about $150 a month with standard coverage. But the retired Master Sergeant says the most immediate affect for his son when he turns 23 will be the out-of-pocket cost for prescriptions.\n\nPharmacist Tony Beraldi says it's not easy for young adults to go it alone on coverage. He said, \u201dA young person just starting out might walk in with a prescription that costs several hundred dollars.\"\n\nJeff Gall has been on a campaign to get congress to fund dependent health insurance up to age 26.\n\nWhile still waiting for a response from Tricare, Fact Finders did get an answer from a spokesman for United States Senator Deb Fischer.\n\nTaylor Foy says funding coverage without additional costs to beneficiaries was unworkable. Foy said, \"Given the far more restrictive budget environment today it's unlikely congress will implement a change anytime soon.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "An Air Force veteran is battling again.
