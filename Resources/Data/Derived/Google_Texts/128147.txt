Janet Yellen, the newly installed chief of the Federal Reserve, made her first appearance before a congressional panel in that role as she testified before the House Financial Services Committee. Times correspondents covered the appearance in a live blog here.

Ms. Yellen’s prepared testimony was released earlier in the morning, and as Binyamin Appelbaum reports, it suggested little departure from the policies of her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke. “I expect a great deal of continuity” in monetary policy, she said.
