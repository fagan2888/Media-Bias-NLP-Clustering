Radel represented Florida\u2019s 19th Congressional District, which encompasses most of Lee County and includes Fort Myers and adjacent Cape Coral. CD 19 is a haven for retirees, wealthy and otherwise.\n\nAlmost immediately after Radel announced his resignation, Benacquisto was declared the front-runner to succeed Radel and restore dignity to the seat.\n\nThen Curt Clawson entered the race, spent $4 million of his own money for his campaign \u2014 much of it in negative advertising directed at his opponents \u2014 and Benacquisto would be left wondering what happened.\n\nClawson received 38 percent of the vote to Benacquisto\u2019s 25 percent and former state Rep. Paige Kreegel\u2018s 25 percent.\n\nBenacquisto took time away from Tallahassee to campaign. The special election overlapped with much of the 2014 Legislative Session. Almost any other lawmaker would have been criticized for missing the committee meetings and floor votes which mark the sixty days of a legislative session. But not Benacquisto, one of the chamber\u2019s most beloved members. Photographs from the day she walked through the double doors and onto the floor of the Florida Senate show her being applauded and embraced by both Joe Negron and Jack Latvala, two former rivals then locked in a bitter struggle to one day serve as president of the body.\n\nBenacquisto returned to her post as Majority Leader and easily won re-election in the fall of 2014.\n\nDespite how well things worked out for Benacquisto after her loss, she really should today be serving in Washington, D.C.\n\nLizbeth should be running for re-election to Congress.\n\nUnfortunately for Benacquisto and the people of southwest Florida, that is not the case.\n\nInstead, the situation is that Clawson is not running for re-election. He announced Thursday he wanted to be closer to his ailing father. Kudos to Clawson for being the dutiful son, but he should never have been in office in the first place.\n\nClawson was just another faux outsider with a real checkbook who bought himself a line on a resume.\n\nSo much of Clawson\u2019s political story was the kind of gimmickry that should have served as a harbinger for what has transpired during the 2016 presidential race. His former basketball coach showed up in his campaign commercials, one of which Clawson paid tens of thousands of dollars to air during the Super Bowl. He challenged President Barack Obama to \u201cman up\u201d and compete against him a basketball shooting contest.\n\nOf course, Clawson\u2019s campaign was backed by Tea Partiers like Michele Bachman and Rand Paul, but those endorsements played well in a community home to, among others, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, himself an \u201coutsider\u201d who used his checkbooks to bludgeon his opponents.\n\nThe unending television ads Clawson was able to pay for during a compressed special election drowned out any real examination of his background.\n\nThe Naples Daily News posted an expose on the jobs record of Clawson and found that it included \u201can Obamacare bailout, layoffs for workers and outsourcing, a poor workplace safety record and even the death of a worker, Shawn Boone,\u201d according to a story by then-Miami Herald reporter Marc Caputo.\n\nCaputo asked Boone\u2019s sister, Tammy Miser, what she thought of Clawson. This was her emailed response: \u201cIf Florida wants someone who will not respond to their needs, is in the habit of tearing down a community and does not act on the behalf of the public\u2019s health and welfare then Mr. Clawson is the man for them.\u201d\n\nBut if you have the kind of money Clawson has, that sort of damnation doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nOnce in office, Clawson was quickly revealed as less-than-ready for prime time.\n\nDuring a House hearing in July of 2014, Clawson mistook Nisha Desai Biswal and Arun M. Kumar, two senior U.S. officials of Indian-American descent, for representatives of the Indian government, saying, \u201cI am familiar with your country, I love your country. Anything I can do to make the relationship with India better, I\u2019m willing and enthusiastic about doing so. [\u2026] Just as your capital is welcome here to produce good-paying jobs in the U.S., I\u2019d like our capital to be welcome there. I ask cooperation and commitment and priority from your government in so doing. Can I have that?\u201d\n\nThat was one of several \u201cairballs,\u201d Clawson heaved during his brief time in Congress. Allied with Reps. Bachmann, Marsha Blackburn, and Steve King, Clawson is one of those bury-your-head-in-the-sand-and-vote-against-everything conservatives who has gridlocked the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nClawson voted against a temporary extension of a highway funding bill (which passed overwhelmingly) because he thought it relied on financing \u201cgimmicks\u201d that the government wouldn\u2019t allow businesses to use, according to an analysis by Ledyard King of the USA Today. He also opposed the Student and Family Tax Simplification Act because he said it could have made undocumented immigrants eligible for tax credit refunds.\n\nClawson defied then-Speaker John Boehner. He was one of just ten Republicans not to support Paul Ryan as Boehner\u2019s successor.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s not exactly clear what Clawson accomplished in his first term, other than speaking some common sense on the issue of climate change.\n\nNo wonder Clawson is yet another politician stepping down because he wants to, as the clich\u00e9 goes, spend more time with his family.\n\nNo matter how sick Clawson\u2019s father is, the reality is Clawson is just another one of these rich guys who thought it would be neat to win an election, but found out how hard governing is once they are in office.\n\nIt\u2019s telling that in the days that have followed Clawson\u2019s decision to step away from politics, only one of his colleagues in the Florida delegation has released a statement to the press corps acknowledging his leaving.\n\nWith Clawson not running, Lizbeth Benacquisto has been given a second chance at possibly representing Florida\u2019s 19th Congressional District. Several other candidates have already announced they will run or are considering it.\n\nAfter the back-to-back disasters of Trey Radel and Curt Clawson, hopefully, the poor voters of southwest Florida will get it right this time.\n\nMaterial from the Naples Daily News, Roll Call, and Wikipedia was used in this post.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Judging by the expression on her face, Lizbeth Benacquisto appeared genuinely surprised \u2014 and touched \u2014 by the standing ovation given to her by her colleagues in the Senate upon her return to\u00a0the Florida Legislature.
