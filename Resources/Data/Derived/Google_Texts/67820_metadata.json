And as the New York Times reports, the right-wing players involved in that effort are working on reclaiming \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d as a set of policies the GOP can actually get behind.\n\nBirth control, abortion, and sexual violence are out. Osteoporosis \u2014 a bone disease disproportionately affecting women that can lead to fractures of the hip, spine, and wrist \u2014 is in.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s health issues are osteoporosis or breast cancer or seniors living alone who don\u2019t have enough money for health care,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster who helps anti-abortion groups conduct research on women\u2019s issues, told the New York Times. Conway is advising GOP candidates to challenge Democrats who use the term \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d to refer to reproductive rights, pivoting the conversation back to brittle bones and breast exams. She also wants Republicans to avoid ever mentioning the word \u201crape.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, osteoporosis and breast cancer are serious public health issues that plague millions of women. But in a national landscape that continues to be dominated by record-breaking numbers of abortion restrictions, gaps in family planning funding, botched sexual assault investigations, and insensitive comments about rape victims, it will likely be tough for candidates to avoid addressing any of the gender-specific reproductive health issues that female voters in swing states say are among their top priorities.\n\nLawmakers are already struggling with this dynamic. Last week, Republican Scott Brown, who is running for office in New Hampshire, reportedly \u201ctook shelter in the bathroom\u201d to avoid answering a reporter\u2019s questions about Hobby Lobby. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R), a potential 2016 presidential contender, was similarly evasive. And Republicans in Congress are attempting to convince women they support birth control by introducing legislation that doesn\u2019t actually do anything to change the way that contraceptive coverage currently works.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s political arm, which plans to spend more than $18 million during the upcoming election cycle in at least 14 states where the group believes reproductive rights are vulnerable, doesn\u2019t want to let those lawmakers get away with it. As part of its \u201cWomen are Watching\u201d campaign, the reproductive health organization is running ads specifically targeting Republicans who support Hobby Lobby\u2019s right to drop contraceptive coverage for their workers.\n\nFor Planned Parenthood Action Fund, it\u2019s clear that talking about osteoporosis won\u2019t be good enough. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to fight back against lawmakers who want to ban abortion, block access to birth control, and strip us of the rights we\u2019ve worked so hard to secure,\u201d the group says on its website.\n\nIt\u2019s been about a year and a half since the GOP first initiated its rebranding strategy to win back female voters, and so far, it hasn\u2019t been going particularly well. Polling has found that the Republican Party has actually been losing women\u2019s support \u2014 and politicians haven\u2019t stopped making headlines for their controversial comments about women, even after taking several training sessions on how to avoid offensive statements.\n\nAlong those lines, GOP strategists are also calling for a serious shift in tone when it comes to talking about abortion, alluding to the fact that elected officials haven\u2019t always demonstrated compassion toward women who choose to end a pregnancy. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we have candidates who are respectful when they talk about this issue and that they talk about it in a humane way. And I think that\u2019s where the Republican Party has failed in a certain way,\u201d Elise Stefanik, who recently won a Republican congressional primary in upstate New York, told the New York Times.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Instead of talking about birth control or sexual assault, GOP strategists are looking toward osteoporosis.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Instead of talking about birth control or sexual assault, GOP strategists are looking toward osteoporosis.", "title": "Right Wing Plans To Reframe \u2018Women\u2019s Health Issues\u2019 To Focus On Preventing Brittle Bones", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/07/24/3463936/gop-reframe-womens-health/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/womens-health1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Instead of talking about birth control or sexual assault, GOP strategists are looking toward osteoporosis.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/womens-health1-321x214.jpg", "title": "Right Wing Plans To Reframe \u2018Women\u2019s Health Issues\u2019 To Focus On Preventing Brittle Bones", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/womens-health1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/womens-health1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-24T15:41:38+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe235a\"", "article_summary": "Health Right Wing Plans To Reframe \u2018Women\u2019s Health Issues\u2019 To Focus On Preventing Brittle Bones CREDIT:The GOP is working hard to rebrand its \u201cWar on Women\u201d image, particularly after the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision on Hobby Lobby has given Democratic candidates even more ammunition to wield reproductive health as an election issue.\nConway is advising GOP candidates to challenge Democrats who use the term \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d to refer to reproductive rights, pivoting the conversation back to brittle bones and breast exams.\n\u201cWomen\u2019s health issues are osteoporosis or breast cancer or seniors living alone who don\u2019t have enough money for health care,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, a Republican pollster who helps anti-abortion groups conduct research on women\u2019s issues, told the New York Times.\nShe also wants Republicans to avoid ever mentioning the word \u201crape.\u201dTo be sure, osteoporosis and breast cancer are serious public health issues that plague millions of women.\nAs part of its \u201cWomen are Watching\u201d campaign, the reproductive health organization is running ads specifically targeting Republicans who support Hobby Lobby\u2019s right to drop contraceptive coverage for their workers."}
