Religious rights are protected under a law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nThe Notre Dame case was the only appeals court decision on that issue that pre-dated the Hobby Lobby ruling.\n\nThe compromise allows the groups to certify they are opting out, which then forces insurers to pick up the tab.\n\nNotre Dame says the certification process still essentially forces the groups to authorize the coverage for its employees, even if they are not technically paying for it. Religious institutions are exempt from the contraception coverage requirement.\n\nThe case is Notre Dame v. Burwell, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-392.
