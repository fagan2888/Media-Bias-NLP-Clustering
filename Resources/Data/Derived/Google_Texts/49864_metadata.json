Good luck, Hillary.\n\n\u201cThe main thing that I\u2019ve been trying to communicate over the last several of these horrific episodes is that, contrary to popular belief, Americans are not more violent than people in other developed countries,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut they have more deadly weapons to act out their rage.\u201d Asked by interviewer Bill Simmons of HBO if gun control will be the \u201cdominant\u201d issue on his agenda next year, Mr. Obama replied, \u201cI hope so.\u201d \u201cWe have this weird habit in this culture of mourning and, you know, 48, 72 hours of wall-to-wall coverage, and then \u2026 suddenly we move on,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd I will do everything I can to make sure that there\u2019s a sustained attention paid to this thing.\u201d\n\nPassing new gun-control legislation in the middle of a presidential campaign with both chambers of Congress controlled by Republicans should be a snap. Especially with polling like this:\n\nAbout half of all Americans oppose stricter gun control laws, a larger segment of the population than those who support tighter controls on guns, according to a new CNN/ORC poll released Wednesday. Nearly three weeks after the latest mass shooting claimed the lives of nine people, 52% of Americans now oppose stricter gun control laws, 6 percentage points more than the 46% of Americans who support such laws. That\u2019s a wider gap than in June when CNN last surveyed Americans on gun control, finding that the public was equally split at 49% on the issue\u2026 Most non-white Americans \u2014 55% \u2014 support tighter gun control laws, while 43% stand opposed. There is also a gender gap when it comes to support for tighter gun control laws. While 14% more men oppose gun control restrictions, women are nearly equally split on the question with 49% in favor and 48% opposed to such legislation.\n\nThe last few lines show you why this wouldn\u2019t be as disastrous politically as it might seem at first blush. In terms of policy, it\u2019s a disaster for the left for the reason Cooke gave; you would think O might have learned by now that every rhetorical feint he makes towards gun control ends up injecting many more guns into circulation as buyers stock up before the feds clamp down. The best thing he could do to limit new sales would be to shut up about guns already. But he won\u2019t because this is a legacy play for him: He wants to be remembered as a president who fought against gun ownership even if his ongoing battle has done more to boost gun ownership over the past seven years than the NRA has.\n\nPolitically, on the other hand, this might pay off insofar as Hillary\u2019s strategy will have less to do with outreach to centrists and more to do with re-mobilizing the Democratic base that twice delivered victory to Obama. That means plenty of pandering to liberals, young voters, minority voters, and women, and gun control plays well with all of those groups. That\u2019s why she\u2019s already started talking up executive action to close the, ahem, \u201cgun-show loophole\u201d by treating even low-volume sellers as gun dealers required to conduct background checks for purposes of federal law. Obama\u2019s team had previously concluded that he didn\u2019t have the legal authority to do that as president, but whaddaya know \u2014 as soon as Hillary began pushing it, they reconsidered and started whispering that maybe they have the authority after all. Why Obama would want to quash one of Hillary\u2019s campaign promises to the left by implementing her proposal himself, though, I don\u2019t know. Again, I assume it\u2019s a legacy thing: Even if it\u2019ll backfire by panicking gun owners (and maybe by encouraging low-volume sellers to sell more, not less), it\u2019s something for his presidential resume. He may end up wrecking American health insurance and arming Iran with a nuclear weapon and doing squat to stop ISIS from building a jihadi caliphate, but damn it, the man did what little he could to block gun sales. That\u2019s quite a political epitaph.\n\nBy the way, here\u2019s what he said in the same interview with GQ about what he\u2019s learned as president:\n\nOBAMA: What I didn\u2019t fully appreciate, and nobody can appreciate until they\u2019re in the position, is how decentralized power is in this system. When you\u2019re in the seat and you\u2019re seeing the housing market collapse and you are seeing unemployment skyrocketing and you have a sense of what the right thing to do is, then you realize, \u201cOkay, not only do I have to persuade my own party, not only do I have to prevent the other party from blocking what the right thing to do is, but now I can anticipate this lawsuit, this lobbying taking place, and this federal agency that technically is independent, so I can\u2019t tell them what to do. I\u2019ve got the Federal Reserve, and I\u2019m hoping that they do the right thing\u2014and by the way, since the economy now is global, I\u2019ve got to make sure that the Europeans, the Asians, the Chinese, everybody is on board.\u201d A lot of the work is not just identifying the right policy but now constantly building these ever shifting coalitions to be able to actually implement and execute and get it done.\n\nIsn\u2019t this the same guy who rewrote ObamaCare\u2019s statutory deadlines unilaterally and then declared amnesty for millions of illegals by royal decree? And now he\u2019s grousing that he didn\u2019t have enough power? No wonder gun owners are worried about confiscation.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Plans.", "title": "Obama: I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll spend my last year in office focused on gun control", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/11/17/obama-im-thinking-ill-spend-my-last-year-in-office-focused-on-gun-control/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-18T01:01:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-18T12:32:15+00:00"}, "keywords": "assault, background checks, grab, gun, gun control, hillary, Obama, office, weapons,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "There is also a gender gap when it comes to support for tighter gun control laws.\nThat means plenty of pandering to liberals, young voters, minority voters, and women, and gun control plays well with all of those groups.\nWhile 14% more men oppose gun control restrictions, women are nearly equally split on the question with 49% in favor and 48% opposed to such legislation.\nThat\u2019s a wider gap than in June when CNN last surveyed Americans on gun control, finding that the public was equally split at 49% on the issue\u2026 Most non-white Americans \u2014 55% \u2014 support tighter gun control laws, while 43% stand opposed.\nNearly three weeks after the latest mass shooting claimed the lives of nine people, 52% of Americans now oppose stricter gun control laws, 6 percentage points more than the 46% of Americans who support such laws."}
