It seems to me that he has delivered to a substantial extent on his promise of \u201cfundamental transformation\u201d of the United States. He has also had a profound effect on the Democratic Party. Last night at the Dems\u2019 debate in Charleston, Hillary Clinton presented herself as his heir. Bernie Sanders, well, he wants to continue the fundamental transformation too.\n\nThere is nothing funny about this crew. They are as funny as cancer.\n\nYet Martin O\u2019Malley provides comic relief of the unintentional variety. Quotable quote from Governor O\u2019Malley: \u201cThe greatest business opportunity to come to America in 100 years is climate change.\u201d This must represent deep thinking orthodoxy in Obama\u2019s party. O\u2019Malley is a useful character. He gives us Democratic orthodoxy as a court jester might.\n\nI assume Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee. (Disclaimer: I assumed this in 2008 as well. Reviewing last night\u2019s proceedings, John Podhoretz suggests why I might be mistaken this time as well.) Listen to her spout Democratic orthodoxy on the criminal justice system and everything else, for that matter. Listen to her sing the praises of Obamacare. Listen to her grating tone of voice. Bless us and save us, said Mrs. O\u2019Davis.\n\nThe Democratic nominee will start the campaign with a substantial leg up in the electoral college. Ask yourself this question: Which Republican candidate can carry such critical swing states as Colorado and Ohio and Virginia and Florida against her?\n\nNBC News has posted last night\u2019s doings online, complete with an hour of pregame kibbitzing and an hour of postgame analysis, four hours\u2019 worth in all. If it doesn\u2019t kill you, it will make you stronger.\n\nThe New York Times has posted a transcript of the event here. In case you missed it and have a high threshold for pain, I\u2019m posting the video below. It is illuminating in its own way. Like the prospect of being hanged in a fortnight, it will concentrate your mind wonderfully.\n\nPaul Mirengoff gave it up big time for Power Line readers to provide an excellent assessment of the proceedings. Paul will spare you the pain if your pain management discourages you from taking this in on your own.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "I don\u2019t deprecate President Obama\u2019s accomplishments in office.
