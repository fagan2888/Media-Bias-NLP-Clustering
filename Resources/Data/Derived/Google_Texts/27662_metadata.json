The house was packed \u2013 literally, it was standing room only. Had it not been a continually cooperative group, willing to push on in, the audience would have extended past the door. And all those people weren\u2019t there for a fundraiser or a meet-and-greet with the hot politician of the hour. They were there to hear about freedom.\n\nWhat\u2019s so different about that? You may ask. Freedom of speech. Freedom of religion, whatever one means by that \u2014 it\u2019s in some dispute just now. Sounds like the sort of thing Washington talks about. On this night the topic was \u201cInterior Freedom.\u201d The speaker was a French priest wearing the traditional white habit and brown scapular. And he wasn\u2019t even speaking English. In the last days of the Christmas season, the Catholic Information Center crowd was happy to wait for the sister who would be translating.\n\nIt was a young crowd. I could have taken the headcount of the over-50s on one hand, two at most. The audience was largely familiar with Father Jacques Philippe from his many books on the spiritual life. Interior Freedom is one. Searching for and Maintaining Peace is another. Both grow out of the work of a lifetime. As Pope Francis is fond of saying: God is patient with us. So go to Him already!\n\nThis is the stuff of not a feel-good but a rigorous spirituality, real discernment. This interior-freedom business is key to getting the rest of those freedoms right. They all rely on people who care about the habits of virtue to keep things going well. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor surprised many by issuing an injunction to relieve the Little Sisters of the Poor \u2014 a Catholic congregation of women religious who care for (as their name suggests) poor elderly men and women \u2014 from the coercive abortion-drug, contraception, sterilization mandate issued by the Department of Health and Human Services as part of Obamacare. But for Sotomayor\u2019s injunction, the Little Sisters would have been hit with the mandate the next day, January 1. This Obama-administration mandate forces Americans who are morally opposed to some or all of these things to either ignore their conscience or face steep financial penalties that needn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nBut government isn\u2019t the beginning and end of public life. We have charity in America. We have neighbor looking out for neighbor. We have hope when the government fails us and our world seems to fall apart.\n\nAmong Father Philippe\u2019s most fundamental points is: Don\u2019t go through life expecting from others what only God can give. Security. Happiness. Even love. By which he means what everyone who has been to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting knows: It\u2019s that faith and hope in something greater than ourselves that sustains. The Little Sisters do what they do because they have chosen to hand their lives over to Providence. It\u2019s a Little Sister\u2019s knowing she is loved by her Creator that gives her the desire and strength to serve. She is bringing the love she knows from God to others. She is able to love because she is loved. In our everyday relationships \u2014 and in our politics, too \u2014 we too often impose on others the fulfillment of needs only God can provide. And isn\u2019t that the source of so much misunderstanding and conflict? Peace comes from examining this. And daily.\n\nNot everyone on K Street is going to buy into this. But at least one young man walked into the auditorium that evening impressed by the scene: young professionals, at rapt attention, packed into the room. \u201cI need to be a part of this,\u201d he said as he walked in. Just as representative democracy needs to be about letting the Little Sisters do what they do as they need to do it. We need that virtue; we need that service. The Founders knew this. Some 300 predominantly 20- and 30-somethings in Washington, D.C., appear to know it too.\n\n\u201cAuthentic freedom is a freedom for excellence, not a freedom of indifference,\u201d Ryan T. Anderson of the Heritage Foundation, one of the young leaders present that evening, highlighted as a takeaway from Father Philippe\u2019s talk and his writings. \u201cIt\u2019s about understanding your talents and discovering what God has asked you to do in life, and then doing your best in living that out. You accept the difficulties that will come along the way and accept your own limitations, but nevertheless put yourself at the service of your community, working to fulfill your vocation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I know about human beings,\u201d New Jersey governor Chris Christie declared during his much-watched press conference about traffic and scandal on the George Washington Bridge. \u201cI\u2019ve hired a lot of them in my time. . . . Sometimes, despite the best background checks, . . . despite the best interviews, despite your best instincts . . . ,\u201d he started to explain. \u201cSometimes they start off as a good hire; because of circumstances that happened in their life, they change. You can\u2019t prevent everything. But the test of leadership is, when you find it out, what do you do?\u201d That\u2019s life. We mess up. Someone else does. Some make news. Some cost jobs. Most hurt someone. What are we doing now to move forward?\n\nScandal in whatever form doesn\u2019t happen out of love. Discouragement isn\u2019t born of love. To use your freedom to choose to love, born of faith in an eternal Source of love, can change everything.\n\nAnother of the young leaders present that evening was Melissa Moscella, an assistant professor of philosophy at Catholic University of America and also a volunteer with Catholic Voices USA. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to learn how to practice the freedom of acceptance,\u201d she says, reflecting on Father Philippe\u2019s talk, \u201cthat inner freedom of embracing the things that we did not choose and cannot change \u2014 to learn how to discern a call to grow in faith, hope, and love precisely in and through those circumstances.\u201d\n\nLike a traffic jam on a bridge, the fog of pride can get us stuck. With freedom, we have the power to clear it up. But know it takes a lifetime. And that we\u2019re in it together. In a Washington crowd, on the GWB, on the job, we are together. Knowing and seeing, living the examined life, helps honest, true freedom flourish.\n\n\u2014 Kathryn Jean Lopez is editor-at-large of National Review Online, a director of Catholic Voices USA, and a member of the board of the Catholic Information Center.
