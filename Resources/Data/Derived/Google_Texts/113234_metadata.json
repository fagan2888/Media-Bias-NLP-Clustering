He has been everything from a star college athlete to a classically trained opera singer and professional musician to the CEO of a small drugmaker. Having a broad range of skills and the ability to switch gears successfully is a good thing in the health care industry. After all, many lawmakers still want to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which overhauled health care insurance and expanded Medicaid, among other changes. As the sixth-largest health care company in the U.S., with $103 billion in annual revenue, Cardinal Health\u0092s future will be shaped by that debate. The Dublin, Ohio\u0096based company distributes drugs and medical and laboratory supplies to hospitals, physician offices, pharmacies and ambulatory surgical centers. It also manufactures products for doctors and individuals and is a provider of home health care services.\n\nBarrett joined Cardinal Health in 2008 as vice chairman and CEO of its health care supply chain services division after a decade at generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Cardinal Health had just reached a $34 million settlement over charges that it had failed to notify the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency about suspicious shipments of drugs, which were later sold online. Cardinal lost at least $1 billion in sales that year, and almost a dozen high-level executives left or were forced out. Barrett became CEO in 2009, just in time to take responsibility for the drug embarrassment and to evaluate the dozens of acquisitions Cardinal Health had made since the 1980s.\n\nAs CEO, Barrett started refocusing Cardinal Health on its core drug distribution business, and spun off its high-growth clinical and medical technology businesses to create a company called CareFusion. He felt Cardinal Health needed to be better aligned to trends in health care, including aging populations and a relentless focus by insurers and others on the high cost of care.\n\nThe 60-year-old chief executive has plenty of experience with recovery and going in new directions. After graduating from high school in Westport, Connecticut, he attended Brown University, where he quickly became a star on the soccer team. A back injury ended his dream of playing professionally. Barrett instead focused on singing \u0097 he is a tenor with perfect pitch \u0097 and graduated Brown in 1977 with a double major in music and history. He spent several years in New York focusing on his music \u0097 which had moved from opera to the folk rock clubs \u0097 before joining NMC Laboratories, a dermatology products company started by his future father-in-law. He was 26. \u0093I actually like sleeping at night and being awake during the day,\u0094 Barrett says.\n\nHe rose to CEO of NMC, which was acquired in 1990 by what went on to become Alpharma. He stayed on until 1997, running U.S. pharmaceuticals for several years, then left to launch a start-up with Johns Hopkins Medical Center before joining Teva.\n\nBarrett has spearheaded a number of acquisitions for Cardinal Health. Last year it purchased Harvard Drug Group to expand its generics and over-the-counter medications business, as well as cardiology company Cordis, which provides less-invasive treatments for heart problems, from Johnson & Johnson. It also bought Metro Medical, the largest independent distributor of specialty drugs. Senior Writer Julie Segal recently spoke to Barrett about his management strategy and how Cardinal Health is positioning itself to do well in a health care environment that is almost unrecognizable from a decade ago.\n\nInstitutional Investor: You\u0092re leading a huge company that does everything from delivering drugs to 100,000 locations a day to manufacturing surgical products. How do you develop a strategy for such a vast organization?\n\nBarrett: When I think back to my first corporate job \u0097 a small dermatology start-up \u0097 I got to touch everything from sales and marketing to regulatory affairs to quality control and finance.\n\nI even worked on the factory floor. That did allow me to function more comfortably as a leader because I felt fluent in many areas. But I was well aware that I wasn\u0092t an expert in any one of them. I\u0092ve always been pretty good at knowing what I\u0092m not, and been able to draw on others for that expertise. I wound up running that dermatology business, and had to be able to draw on the talents of others. I was able to train myself with people who had great technical know-how. I do the same thing here. I surround myself with really competent people. We tend to think, as leaders, that we\u0092re supposed to be the teachers all the time. But actually, really good leaders are good students as well.\n\nWhen you joined Cardinal Health, it was stumbling. What influenced your thinking in leading it in a new direction?\n\nCardinal had been a really successful company through the \u009280s and \u009290s and then it ran into a bit of a bump in the early 2000s. I arrived when there was a real question inside the organization as to whether or not one part of our med-tech business and the rest of the business fit together that well. To be honest, coming in from a product company,\n\nI was quite reluctant to part with some of those lines of business. But I did come to believe that our portfolio could be a more coherent integrated health care company by making some moves. We ended up spinning off part of the business, which became CareFusion and which was acquired [by Becton Dickinson] this past year. But part of what we needed to do was to reset who we were, and make sure that the portfolio that we had was coherent and strategically aligned with the changes that we saw in front of us in the health care system.\n\nWhat was the most difficult part of the reorganization?\n\nInside the organization, the part that we spun off was seen by many as the high-growth med-tech sector, and the larger part of the organization \u0097 distribution \u0097 was seen as more mature. And in some ways, the organization had come to see the more mature part as almost the cash generator for the med-tech business.\n\nI had to get the organization to rethink that. That actually, that large business was its own growth engine. Part of the challenge and excitement was to just help us reset our trajectory around how much capability we had, what a broad ranges of services and products that we had, and what enormous reach across the health system we had \u0097 and that we could use that as a source of growth.\n\nHow did you change people\u0092s minds?\n\nIn every opportunity in front of employees, I was talking about growth. I was talking about the capabilities we had to be on the right side of health care changes to drive accelerated growth, and that we had the opportunity to be a very attractive investment for shareholders. I tried to make sure that I surrounded myself with people who felt the same way. When you\u0092re trying to reframe a business, it can\u0092t just be a simple message. It has to be very deeply integrated in your behaviors and your investment strategies and your deployment of capital and the things that you reward and don\u0092t reward.\n\nTalk about the incredible changes taking place in health care, including the ACA.\n\nThese were the changes we were thinking about back in 2009, when we started to regroup. It\u0092s well beyond the Affordable Care Act, which hadn\u0092t yet been implemented. Demographic changes are tremendous. We have a dramatically aging population. We have 11 million people today over the age of 80. That number will double by 2025. This is just in the U.S., but it\u0092s happening globally as well. As you know, older people are higher consumers of health care products and services. That creates economic pressures. How are we going to give these people access? We are spending around 18 percent of GDP on health care, crowding out spending on other issues like infrastructure and education.\n\nInnovation is also transforming health care and our ability not only to prolong life and treat disease, but in some cases to cure diseases and repair physical pathologies with medical devices. Finally, the big trend is consumers becoming more like consumers, meaning they will have a greater role in their own health and, ideally, in their own wellness.\n\nHow do these forces change what you do as a company?\n\nIt changes everything: how we deliver care, in what setting we deliver care and by whom. How do you measure the quality of the care over time and, of course, who pays for it?\n\nWhat\u0092s the most difficult part of planning for that?\n\nWell, the easier part was clearly having a point of view on what kind of changes would occur. The hardest part, in a way, is managing pace. It wasn\u0092t impossible to imagine some of the changes or how they might play out, although getting them all right is, of course, impossible. What\u0092s most difficult is over what time period. How fast does it occur? How dramatic are the changes?\n\nAs a leader, that\u0092s actually one of the biggest challenges. I could assume that change will happen as it has historically, just rather slowly, and you just stick exactly to what got you there. Then you run the risk of really being disrupted or blindsided. On the other hand, you can assume that change is going to occur overnight, very fast. You\u0092re so preoccupied with the future you\u0092re not focusing on the disciplines of competing in today\u0092s world, and you get hurt in your core activities, and you\u0092re sort of out over your skis on the future. I think this issue of managing pace is important. I remind the organization all the time that we need to compete to win in the world as we know it today, and \u0097 it\u0092s an and, not an or \u0097 have a clear point of view on some of these future trends and make some thoughtful, disciplined, measured bets on the long term.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "description": "The Cardinal Health CEO plays guitar or piano every day as an antidote to the stress of running one of the U.S.\u2019s largest health care companies.", "language": "EN", "og": {"site_name": "Institutionalinvestor.com", "description": "The Cardinal Health CEO plays guitar or piano every day as an antidote to the stress of running one of the U.S.\u2019s largest health care companies.", "title": "When It Comes to Health Care, George Barrett Stays in Tune"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW,NOARCHIVE", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=470469146", "keywords": "cardinal health, george barrett, obamacare, affordable care act, longevity, speciality pharmaceuticals, specialty drugs, medical technology, medtech, harvard drug group, 2016 presidential election", "distribution": "Global", "majestic-site-verification": "MJ12_4fc82b71-bfad-43da-a68e-770569a840a2"}, "article_summary": "He felt Cardinal Health needed to be better aligned to trends in health care, including aging populations and a relentless focus by insurers and others on the high cost of care.\nBut I did come to believe that our portfolio could be a more coherent integrated health care company by making some moves.\nGeorge Barrett, CEO of Cardinal Health, is used to change.\nHaving a broad range of skills and the ability to switch gears successfully is a good thing in the health care industry.\nIt also manufactures products for doctors and individuals and is a provider of home health care services."}
