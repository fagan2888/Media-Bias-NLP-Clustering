Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who is running as a Democrat, said his priorities would be healthcare for everyone, a $15 minimum wage, and creating new jobs through infrastructure spending. Clinton named economic issues like jobs and equal pay for women, building on Obamacare, and finding ways to unite the country and end the \"mean-spiritedness\" seen in the last several years. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley listed higher wages and letting illegal immigrants work, climate change, and a \"new agenda\" for U.S. cities.\n\nAll three candidates see national security \u2013 including fighting the Islamic State \u2013 as an afterthought. O'Malley and Sanders are isolationists, Hillary Clinton less so. But with the world melting down, one would think that an American president would believe that protecting the homeland would be a top priority.\n\nThis is why Democrats claim that combatting climate change is a matter of \"national security\" \u2013 a supercilious notion that bears no relationship with reality. It's an attempt to change the definition of \"national security\" to suit a political agenda \u2013 something liberals are wont to do when they are losing on an issue.\n\nHere's a video of their responses:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/01/missing_from_dem_candidates_top_priorities_national_security.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Missing from Dem candidates' top priorities: National security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "What can the American people expect the top priorities will be if a Democratic candidate is elected president?\nAll three candidates see national security \u2013 including fighting the Islamic State \u2013 as an afterthought.\nAn issue that apparently doesn't interest the Dems much is national security.\nThis is why Democrats claim that combatting climate change is a matter of \"national security\" \u2013 a supercilious notion that bears no relationship with reality.\nIt's an attempt to change the definition of \"national security\" to suit a political agenda \u2013 something liberals are wont to do when they are losing on an issue."}
