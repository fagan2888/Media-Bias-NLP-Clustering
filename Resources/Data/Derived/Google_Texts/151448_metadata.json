There just isn\u2019t a lot of space for pragmatic, policy-minded conservatives in today\u2019s GOP. There\u2019s good news, however, and his name is Ted Cruz.\n\nTurns out Ted Cruz is really a moderate, and he\u2019s deeply concerned about the rhetorical excesses of his fellow Republican candidates, particularly after the terrorist attacks in Paris. Indeed, a new AP report suggests that Cruz is attempting to rebrand himself in the wake of the latest attacks. His hope is to appeal to the supporters of people like Trump and Carson by emphasizing his experience and, I\u2019m not joking, his moderation.\n\n\u201cTone matters,\u201d Cruz told the AP in a recent interview. \u201cAre there some in the Republican Party whose rhetoric is unhelpful with regard to immigration? Yes.\u201d When pressed about his affiliation with Steve King (the Iowa congressman who endorsed Cruz last week), who has described immigrants as disease-ridden and even \u201ccompared them to drug mules and livestock,\u201d Cruz glibly replied: \u201cI cannot help the language that others use. I can only help the words that come out of my mouth.\u201d\n\nYou almost have to applaud Cruz\u2019s chutzpah here. This guy has made a career of extremism. His strategy in the Senate, from the very beginning, has been to obstruct and to use his platform to appeal to the wingnut base of the Republican Party \u2013 showing little to no interest in advancing a credible legislative agenda. And he\u2019s mouthed as many inflammatory idiocies as anyone currently running for president.\n\nPolitico was kind enough to compile some of Cruz\u2019s rhetorical highlights in March. A similar list was assembled at Raw Story. Here are just a few examples:\n\n\u201cLook, we saw in Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, \u2018Accept the Nazis. Yes, they\u2019ll dominate the continent of Europe, but that\u2019s not our problem. Let\u2019s appease them. Why? Because it can\u2019t be done. We can\u2019t possibly stand against them.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI think President Obama is the most radical president this nation\u2019s ever seen \u2026 And in particular, I think he is a true believer in government control of the economy and of our everyday lives. In my judgment, we are facing what I consider to be the epic battle of our generation, quite literally the battle over whether we remain a free market nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, back in the \u201970s \u2014 I remember the \u201970s, we were told there was global cooling. And everyone was told global cooling was a really big problem. \u2026 The problem with climate change is there\u2019s never been a day in the history of the world in which the climate is not changing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Obama economy is a disaster, Obamacare is a train wreck, and the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind \u2014 the whole world is on fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cNet neutrality is Obamacare for the internet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our job to be social workers in Iraq and put them all on expanded Medicaid.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative zealot Ted Cruz champions his electability after right-wing hysteria following Paris attacks", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s laughable plan to rebrand himself as a moderate", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Conservative zealot Ted Cruz champions his electability after right-wing hysteria following Paris attacks", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s laughable plan to rebrand himself as a moderate", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/24/cruz_laughably_rebrands_himself_as_a_moderate_after_paris_attacks/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/AP_833623787892-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservative zealot Ted Cruz champions his electability after right-wing hysteria following Paris attacks", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s laughable plan to rebrand himself as a moderate", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/AP_833623787892-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean Illing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, 2016 GOP primary, Ben Carson, Donald Trump, Paris Attacks, Republican Party, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s good news, however, and his name is Ted Cruz.\nTurns out Ted Cruz is really a moderate, and he\u2019s deeply concerned about the rhetorical excesses of his fellow Republican candidates, particularly after the terrorist attacks in Paris.\n\u201cAre there some in the Republican Party whose rhetoric is unhelpful with regard to immigration?\nTopics: 2016 Elections, 2016 GOP primary, Ben Carson, Donald Trump, Paris Attacks, Republican Party, Ted Cruz, Elections News, News, Politics NewsWhen you think of Republican moderates, very few \u2013 if any \u2013 come to mind.\n\u201cTone matters,\u201d Cruz told the AP in a recent interview."}
