InflowHealth\u2019s solution gives physicians unique insights into their financial, operational and strategic performance, allowing them to identify opportunities for improvement and guide practice budgeting and strategic investments. These are central capabilities for managing any successful practice, only growing in importance as physicians start to explore clinically integrated networks and alternative payment models, such as bundled payment and shared savings,\u201d Premier senior veep Wes Champion said in prepared remarks.\n\nPremier said Inflow Health and its employees will become part of Premier\u2019s performance service business.\n\nCharlotte, N.C.-based Premier said it didn\u2019t expect the acquisition to have an impact on its fiscal 2016 results.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve used our years of industry experience to design data-driven tools that effectively capture the extreme nuances of operating physician practices, at the specialty level. These solutions provide a level of depth, transparency and accountability that physicians have not had in the past,\u201d InflowHealth prez David Olson said in a press release.\n\nLast week, Premier said it won a $9.3 million contract from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to take part in the 2nd round of the Hospital Engagement Networks in the Partnership for Patients initiative.\n\nThe goal of the program is reducing preventable readmissions to hospitals by 20% and reducing hospital-acquired conditions by 40%, the company said. The program is part of a larger overall framework established by the Affordable Care Act to refine healthcare services to provide better care and lower costs.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages02.net,3dcadforums.com,3dcadworld.com,analogictips.com,connectortips.com,couplingtips.com,datasheetpro.com,designworldonline.com,devicetalks.com,digitalsignalprocessingtips.com,edaboard.com,eeworldonline.com,electro-tech-online.com,engineeringexchange.com,engineeringwhitepapers.com,fluidpowerworld.com,fpgatips.com,hoseassemblytips.com,linearmotiontips.com,makepartsfast.com,massdevice.com,mcadcentral.com,mechatronictips.com,medicaldesignandoutsourcing.com,microcontrollertips.com,mobilehydraulictips.com,motioncontroltips.com,page.wtwhmedia.com,pneumatictips.com,powerelectronictips.com,sensortips.com,solarpowerworldonline.com,testandmeasurementtips.com,windpowerengineering.com,wireandcabletips.com", "description": "Premier Inc.
