Coloradans can still get health insurance through the state marketplace for all of 2016 if they apply by Saturday at midnight.\n\nThe original deadline for enrollment was Dec. 15, but a large storm on the Front Range, as well as an onslaught of people trying to enroll at the last minute, caused Connect for Health to extend the deadline a few extra days. Now the exchange has extended it again.\n\n\u201cThat snowstorm hit Denver harder than it hit us and it caused problems there. The call volumes have been outrageous over the last week, so it\u2019s been hard for people to get help,\u201d said Brett Borup, a Telluride-based independent insurance broker who helps people navigate the Connect for Health marketplace. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re extending the deadline.\u201d\n\nBoth Borup and Stacey Wright, programs manager for the Telluride Foundation-backed nonprofit Tri-County Health Network, which also helps people in the Telluride area sign up for insurance through the state marketplace, said they\u2019ve been inundated with people looking for help in the last month.\n\nWright said she personally enrolled more than 40 people on Dec. 14 and 15 as the original deadline approached.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working basically from 6 in the morning to 11 at night for the last month. I thought things would drop off after [Dec. 15], but I\u2019ve continued to be booked with meetings,\u201d Borup said Thursday, adding that the requests had dropped off as Christmas approached, with no meetings scheduled Thursday, Friday or Saturday.\n\nTo enroll through the marketplace, Colorado residents can go through a broker like Borup (708-7895) or health navigators at TCHN (708-7096). Or, they can do it themselves at connectforhealthco.com, but both Wright and Borup cautioned insurance shoppers to know what they\u2019re buying.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that people do not let auto renewal happen without knowing what their premium is,\u201d Wright said. A report from the Colorado Health Institute last month found that health insurance rates on the private market on the Western Slope were up 26 percent for 2016.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be fooled just by seeing the price,\u201d Wright added.\n\nThe plans offered on the marketplace will be accompanied by detailed information on the costs and benefits, but Borup said it can be hard for individuals to figure out what all that means.\n\n\u201cWe do this all the time. You can sit there and read all the information thrown at you, but there are a million little rules with the Affordable Care Act that many people don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t blame them,\u201d Borup said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to deal with it all the time, so that\u2019s where brokers and health navigators can help.\u201d\n\nPenalties under the ACA for not having health insurance are variable depending on personal income, but Wright said the penalty can be $695 or more for an individual. The deadline for enrollment for coverage effective Jan. 1 is Dec. 26 at midnight, but it\u2019s possible to get coverage by the first of the year if you have problems with the enrollment process that cause delays.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Telluride Daily Planet", "description": "Connect for Health Colorado has extended its deadline to enroll in health insurance coverage effective Jan. 1.
