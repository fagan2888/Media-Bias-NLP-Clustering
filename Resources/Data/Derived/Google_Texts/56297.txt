A former Memorial Hospital surgical tech is suing Memorial Healthcare System and a long-time Hollywood surgeon who she says sexually harassed and groped her and other women at the South Broward facility for years.

As the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports, “Jane Doe No. 43” says she complained to her supervisor about the words and actions of Dr. Juan Wester, now 80, but that no action was taken. Wester, who is in private practice, referred inquiries to his attorney, who says the surgeon denies wrongdoing.

In other news, a Pasco County internist has been sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to operating an unlicensed pain clinic, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi’s office. Dr. Malcolm Colbern Foster, 63, is said to have prescribed 1.3 million opiod pills, such as Oxycontin, before his arrest in January, Bondi said.

The Florida Board of Medicine revoked Foster’s license in October 2012. (Just to clarify, this doctor is not to be confused with Dr. Malcolm T. Foster of Jacksonville).
