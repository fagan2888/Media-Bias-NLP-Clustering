For both, it would be their last.\n\nAs President Barack Obama walked down the Congressional aisle after delivering his final State of the Union Address, Santa Barbara Congressmember Lois Capps reached out, shook his hand, and said, \u201cMr. President, you and I are leaving this place together. He said, \u2018I know that.\u2019\u201d For Obama, it was his eighth State of the Union speech; for Capps, it would be her 18th and her last. \u201cThis was very emotional for me,\u201d Capps said. \u201cIt was rather poignant.\u201d\n\nIt became especially so, she said, as Obama spoke of the need to change the way politics is conducted in the United States and re-establishing \u201cbonds of trust\u201d in an atmosphere defined by hyper-partisanship. \u201cThat was the phrase Walter used \u200b\u2014 \u200b\u2018bonds of trust,\u2019\u201d Capps said, speaking of her deceased husband, Walter Capps, whose Congressional seat she assumed in 1997 after he died of a sudden heart attack. \u201cMan, that took my breath away to hear the President talk that way.\u201d\n\nCongress was bitterly divided along partisan lines, Capps said, when she first took office. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t half as partisan as it is now.\u201d In his address, Obama appealed to the \u201cvoices of unarmed truth and unconditional love,\u201d a phrase he borrowed from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., to reduce the rancor and noise of American political discourse. When Americans learn to conduct politics in a less polarized fashion, anything, he said \u200b\u2014 \u200ba cure for cancer, an end to climate change, even campaign finance reform \u200b\u2014 \u200bis possible. To do otherwise, he contended, would be to \u201cforsake a better future\u201d and allow an even greater consolidation of great wealth and power.\n\nCapps said Obama might have better served his agenda were he endowed with some of the \u201cbig, hearty, slap-you-on-the-back\u201d personality traits of former president Bill Clinton, whose impeachment was taking place when she first took office. But the president, she added, \u201chas been stymied by Congress in so many ways.\u201d Even so, Capps added, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much we actually got done. The economy is undoubtedly in much better shape \u200b\u2014 \u200bthough not for everybody \u200b\u2014 \u200band we passed the Affordable Care Act.\u201d These were among the accomplishments Obama cited.\n\nCapps had nothing but praise for Obama\u2019s speech and the to-do list the president outlined, which included free community college education, immigration reform, the end of the Cuban trade embargo, closing the American prison at Guantanamo, an increased minimum wage, and a \u201cmore fair\u201d distribution of economic wealth for those willing to work hard. \u201cHe really poured himself into that speech,\u201d she said. \u201cI got a lot of exercise there; I stood up every minute or so.\u201d\n\nCelebrated for winning the Nicest Member of Congress award more times than any other member, Capps lamented it\u2019s grown far harder to find Republicans with whom she can reach across the aisle. \u201cBut I can\u2019t stop trying,\u201d she said. To that end, Capps said she is currently collaborating with Michigan Republican Fred Upton, chair of the Energy & Commerce Committee on which she sits, to strengthen safety regulations on oil transport pipelines in the wake of the Refugio spill.\n\nUpton is stepping down from his post as chair at the end of the year, and his district, like Capps\u2019s, experienced an environmentally traumatic pipeline spill. They also have a personal connection. \u201cI know Fred,\u201d Capps said. \u201cI really like Fred. I know his wife.\u201d As for attending her last State of the Union speech, Capps said it was more a time to \u201creflect\u201d than \u201cto be nostalgic.\u201d She also stated, \u201cIt\u2019s a little weird.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This story was changed to reflect that Rep. Upton will end his chairmanship of the Energy and Commerce committee, not his term in Congress.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://media.independent.com/img/croppedphotos/2016/01/13/Capps-Obama-CSPAN-Screen-Shot.jpg", "description": "They Share A Moment And Ask For Less Partisan Politics.", "title": "Last State of the Union for Obama and Capps"}, "verify-v1": "ILofteeXjEGSBFwUf9oRyP4hdhxQ7F35jPp2MwAQrUE=", "y_key": "33d4a6dfbd23f58a", "description": "They Share A Moment And Ask For Less Partisan Politics.", "title": "Last State of the Union for Obama and Capps"}, "article_summary": "LOIS AND POTUS: Congressmember Lois Capps reaches out to President Barack Obama after the State of the Union speech.\nHe said, \u2018I know that.\u2019\u201d For Obama, it was his eighth State of the Union speech; for Capps, it would be her 18th and her last.\nAs President Barack Obama walked down the Congressional aisle after delivering his final State of the Union Address, Santa Barbara Congressmember Lois Capps reached out, shook his hand, and said, \u201cMr.\n\u201cI know Fred,\u201d Capps said.\nTo that end, Capps said she is currently collaborating with Michigan Republican Fred Upton, chair of the Energy & Commerce Committee on which she sits, to strengthen safety regulations on oil transport pipelines in the wake of the Refugio spill."}
