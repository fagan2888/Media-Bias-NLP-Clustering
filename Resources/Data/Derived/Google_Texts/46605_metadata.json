Coca-Cola even aimed to purge the internet of hate. The exception, and most-hated ad of the day, was Nationwide\u2019s morbid dead-children pitch.\n\nThe Denver Post\u2019s Super Bowl XLIX ad panel noted an abundance of heart-warming \u201cDad-vertising\u201d and puppies. Fewer car ads, more online services. And subtle feminist sentiment (\u201cRun like a girl\u201d) balancing the inevitable super models.\n\nAdvertisers spent $4.5 million per 30-second spot, calling on nostalgia and celebs \u2014 Mindy Kaling, Pierce Brosnan, Steve Buscemi, Kim Kardashian West, Jeff Bridges, Bryan Cranston, Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel among them \u2014 to make their case. Which ads were most effective?\n\nBudweiser \u201cLost Dog\u201d\n\nWhen a little white dog becomes lost, it\u2019s Clydesdales to the rescue, to the tune of The Proclaimers\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles).\u201d\n\nFrom the panel: Silverman: \u201cThey need to push the envelope with that concept. As soon as you see the first two vignettes of that puppy wandering around, you know how it\u2019s going to end up.\u201d Wagner: \u201cBuilding off last year\u2019s super successful puppy/Clydesdales combo, the \u201cbest buds\u201d are back in another charming adventure story. Beautifully shot with a nice soundtrack. Will once again be near the top of Monday morning\u2019s Admeter.\u201d Stern: \u201cA nice follow up to last year\u2019s spot but maybe a little more predictable and familiar feeling. Sequels are rarely better than the original.\u201d Robinson: \u201cThe music \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be (500 miles) covered by Sleeping at Last overwhelmingly trumps \u201cLet Her Go\u201d by Passenger because it avoids the uncomfortable romantic subtext at work in \u201cPuppy Love\u201d with the lyrics \u201conly know your lover when you let her go.\u201d Fink: \u201cThese friends are distinctively Budweiser. Hope to see a sequel next year with a less predictable ending.\u201d\n\nBMW \u201cNewfangled Idea\u201d\n\nA flashback to \u201cToday\u201d hosts Couric and Gumbel asking \u201cwhat is Internet?\u201d in 1994, then in BMW\u2019s electric car asking \u201cwhat is i3?\u201d\n\nFrom the panel: Silverman: \u201ceffective and memorable spot makes the point that electrically-powered transportation will become part of our lives, just like the Internet did. The new-news message is delivered by two well-known and credible news sources.\u201d Wagner: \u201cBest spot in the car category. The \u201994 flashback is laugh-out-loud funny.\u201d Stern: \u201cThe BMW ad baffles me. Do Bryant Gumbel and Katie Couric have any relevance at all to anyone watching the game? Will anyone remember or care about the \u2018Internet\u2019 gaffe? Why transpose that same ignorance onto your own product? Am I missing something?\u201d\n\nAvocados from Mexico \u201cFirst Draft Ever\u201d\n\nA white-robed God-figure announces which species go to which countries. Mexico gets\u2026avocados.\n\nFrom the panel: Silverman: \u201cEntertainingly strategic.\u201d Wagner: \u201cProves again that genuinely funny commercials score big in this party environment.\u201d Stern: \u201cKudos to the client for doing something fun and unexpected, if not a little bit random. Lots of themes going on: God, politics and sports \u2014 but they managed to pull it off. What was missing for me was anything having to actually do with eating avocados.\u201d Shearer: \u201cHysterical spot. I like this one over the other \u2018God\u2019 spot (for Mophie), more theatrical and humorous. You aren\u2019t sure where they are going, but you sense the punch line coming. The art direction, acting and script are just great.\u201d\n\nNo More/NFL on domestic violence\n\nIn any empty house a woman dials 911, pretends to order pizza while her attacker is present. A chilling and controversial spot in the year of Ray Rice.\n\nFrom the panel: Wagner: \u201cThis serious spot will cut through in a game full of humorous, action-packed commercials.\u201d Hagan Brown: \u201cIt\u2019s the worst year the NFL has ever had. It\u2019s too little, too late. Good advertising can\u2019t mask the truth of who an organization is. The consumer is not that naive.\u201d Stern: \u201cWe all know this is just a public relations move by the NFL, as opposed to a genuine ethical stance in a campaign to end domestic violence. If it were the latter, we\u2019d have been seeing these ads for years now. This is a cop out.\u201d Robinson: \u201cIt\u2019s a way for the NFL to throw money at a problem.\u201d Sukle: \u201cHard not to be cynical, but it grabbed and held my attention.\u201d\n\nDove Men+Care\n\nAn ode to fatherhood. \u201cCare makes a man stronger.\u201d\n\nFrom the panel: Wagner: \u201cDads rock this year. Not only Dove but McDonald\u2019s \u2018pay with lovin\u2019 \u2018 and Toyota\u2019s \u2018What it means to be a dad.\u2019 Dove\u2019s is a memorable, emotional salute to fatherhood. I think it will score with kids and moms, too.\u201d Shearer: \u201cDad-vertising has been on the uptrend for a couple of years and is finally reaching a tipping point. As millenials move into young parent zone, they are more involved and sharing parenting duties differently than their fathers\u2019 and grandfathers\u2019 generations. Dads are getting more credit for affecting household purchasing.\u201d Robinson: \u201cWorks in its contradictory message of the integration of nurturing, an historically feminine attribute, into the traditional symbol of masculinity.\u201d\n\nOur panel\n\nKathy Hagan Brown, co-president Karsh Hagan; Janet Robinson, film studies instructor, University of Colorado at Boulder; Norm Shearer, partner & CCO, Cactus; Chuck Silverman, creative director, L.A., Chicago, Denver and agency owner, TSA; Aaron Stern, Stern + Company; Mike Sukle, associate creative director/owner, Sukle Advertising; Daphne Fink Taber, Denver president, gyro; Greg Wagner, University of Denver and former creative director, Leo Burnett USA", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Post panel names its Top 5 Super Bowl commercials", "title": "Denver Post panel names its Top 5 Super Bowl commercials", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/01/denver-post-panel-names-its-top-5-super-bowl-commercials/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150201__20150202_A6_AE02SUPERAD1p1.jpg", "height": 414}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150201__20150202_A6_AE02SUPERAD1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-01T19:32:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T21:34:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd084\"", "article_summary": "The Denver Post\u2019s Super Bowl XLIX ad panel noted an abundance of heart-warming \u201cDad-vertising\u201d and puppies.\n\u201cCare makes a man stronger.\u201dFrom the panel: Wagner: \u201cDads rock this year.\nFrom the panel: Wagner: \u201cThis serious spot will cut through in a game full of humorous, action-packed commercials.\u201d Hagan Brown: \u201cIt\u2019s the worst year the NFL has ever had.\nThe new-news message is delivered by two well-known and credible news sources.\u201d Wagner: \u201cBest spot in the car category.\nAnd subtle feminist sentiment (\u201cRun like a girl\u201d) balancing the inevitable super models."}
