I am sitting at my computer, listening to my playlist of patriotic music. Marilyn Horne has just finished bringing tears to my eyes with her operatic rendition of “God Bless America” as I gaze out my window at my flag of the United States of America flying proudly in front of my house.

But I am distracted by the news stories and pictures of the protesters at the Trump rally outside of San Francisco. I see a large number of Latinos who have been given sanctuary in that pus pocket of liberalism, once a proud and beautiful city. I see violence with riot police. I see an American flag, as beautiful as the one flying in front of my house being stomped on and set on fire by these ungrateful criminals who have broken our immigration laws to come here and gain access to the freedom to act in a manner that would result in prison or worse in most countries including the one they have escaped.
