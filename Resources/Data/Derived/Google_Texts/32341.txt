Testing for sexually transmitted diseases (STD) will become more convenient for youths in the metro beginning Sept. 1.

The Douglas County Board of Health on Wednesday announced that express testing will soon be an option.

No wait times, no appointments and same-day results and treatments will be available during the extended hours.

The health department hopes that the expanded hours will eliminate barriers that young people might have when deciding if and when they need to be tested.



“Young people told me they wanted this. They wanted to be able to just walk in, and have more convenient hours,” health director Adi Pour said. “They don’t like appointments, and they just needed different hours because they’re at work or at school during the day. We listened to our youth.”



In 2004, the STD trend was labeled as an epidemic in Douglas County.



“It was unacceptable,” Pour said. “The levels that we saw in our community were higher than the national average, and have been higher than the Nebraska average.”



In 2014, Douglas County saw over 3,000 cases of chlamydia alone.



“That's not what this community wants, and that is not what we want to be known for,” Pour said.



The department hopes to target youth between the ages of 15 and 20 with the extended hours. That age group has the highest number of positives within the community, according to the health department.



Starting Sept. 1, walk-in hours will be from noon through 7:45 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. On Saturday, the clinic will be open from 9 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.

The clinic is located at the Douglas County Health Department in Omaha at 1111 South 41st Street.
