It also conducts investigations, audits and tax assessments to make sure its licensees operate their businesses lawfully.\n\nIf a follow up of the DOL\u2019s investigation uncovers any further violations, the agency could impose more penalties upon the restaurants.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "We\u2019ve been warning you that the Department of Labor (DOL) cops are out in full force, and they just made a series of big busts.", "title": "Massive crackdown: DOL busts 152 firms, collects $1M in back wages", "url": "http://www.hrmorning.com/massive-crackdown-dol-collects-back-wages-152/", "image": {"width": 507, "identifier": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/466049981.jpg", "height": 338}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hrmorning.com/wp-content/uploads/466049981.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "keywords": "FLSA, violations", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-06T19:27:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T19:27:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c72\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019ve been warning you that the Department of Labor (DOL) cops are out in full force, and they just made a series of big busts.\nIf a follow up of the DOL\u2019s investigation uncovers any further violations, the agency could impose more penalties upon the restaurants.\nIn total, the DOL determined that 1,518 workers in the Tampa Bay area were owed back wages.\nIt also conducts investigations, audits and tax assessments to make sure its licensees operate their businesses lawfully.\nAs a result, the businesses named in the investigation will have to cut checks totaling $861,820 to meet those back pay obligations."}
