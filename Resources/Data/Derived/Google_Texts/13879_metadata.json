More than 50% of web traffic came from mobile devices, a 25% increase over last year. Almost 30% of sales came from mobile devices.\n\nThough people were browsing sales on their smartphones more than tablets, they were slightly more likely to make the actual purchase from a tablet rather than a smartphone.\n\nAnd while mobile traffic and sales are increasing, desktop PCs still made up almost 50% of online traffic and 71% of online sales, according to IBM\u2019s data. Desktop shoppers also spent more, averaging $135.55 compared to the mobile average spend of $116.02.\n\nThe National Retail Foundation\u2019s survey of over 4,600 people showed that the average online shopper spent $159.55 online over the long holiday weekend. The shoppers planned to spend about 42% of their overall shopping budget on online purchases.\n\nIBM\u2019s data showed that New York City residents spent the most money online over the holiday weekend, followed by Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nNone of these online shopping reports including Cyber Monday data, meaning more online spending is likely going to occur this week.\n\nEarly reports from IBM show that as of noon on Cyber Monday, online sales had a 9.2% increase over last year.\n\nGet Free Updates!
