SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley has become the first Democratic presidential candidate to make a stop in Puerto Rico this campaign as part of an effort to woo Latino voters.

He met Saturday with legislators to talk about their concerns as the U.S. territory battles an economic slump and struggles with $72 billion in public debt. O’Malley also was scheduled to attend a fundraiser late Saturday.

O’Malley told The Associated Press in a brief interview that Puerto Rico should receive the same benefits as the U.S. He said that Wall Street, forces on the mainland and a Republican Congress were treating the island unfairly.

Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla has been pushing for the right for public agencies to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9.
