(AP) \u2014 Three decades after Republicans dared Jay Rockefeller to \u201cspend it all\u201d in a campaign for governor, billionaire businessman Jim Justice will help bankroll his own Democratic run for the state\u2019s top executive job.\n\nIn the 1980 election, Republican Arch Moore slapped \u201cMake him spend it all, Arch\u201d bumper stickers across the state to chide Rockefeller, a wealthy Democratic governor from a famed American family.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nMoore, who served three terms as one of the state\u2019s most popular GOP governors, still couldn\u2019t overcome Rockefeller and the $12 million he personally put toward that election.\n\nWest Virginia is no stranger to self-funded campaigns. But banking on your own cash doesn\u2019t always equal success in politics, either in the Mountain State or across the country.\n\nJustice\u2019s wealth easily trumps Rockefeller\u2019s. The 64-year-old built a $1.7 billion fortune in coal and agriculture, and has painted himself a job creator who bought and restored The Greenbrier historic resort.\n\nJustice hasn\u2019t said how much he will personally spend on his campaign. He has said he doesn\u2019t want to use his cash \u201con an unbelievable scale\u201d so he can keep supporters feeling invested in his candidacy.\n\n\u201cI want to contribute because I think it would be selfish and inconsistent to say Jim Justice is going to ask everybody in the world to bring him all the money to take care of his campaign,\u201d Justice told reporters this week.\n\nIn addition to Rockefeller\u2019s win, Democrat Gaston Caperton also beat Moore in 1988 for governor after using $3.2 million of his own money, according to media reports. Current Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey spent $1.4 million of his money in a 2012 win.\n\nStill, many more hopefuls burned through millions of dollars only to lose.\n\nRepublican contender John Raese lost after spending $2.4 million in 2010 and $1 million in 2012 against Democratic U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin. He also loaned himself $2.3 million for a failed campaign against the late Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd in 2006.\n\nDemocrat Jim Humphreys funneled $6.1 million in 2000 and another $7.7 million in 2002 into losing U.S. House races against Republican Shelley Moore Capito, now a senator.\n\nNationally, Justice would join a list of wealthy political neophytes who put their money on the line for office. One of the most prominent recent examples is Republican Gov. Rick Scott of Florida. The former hospital chain executive spent $75 million of his own cash to get elected in 2010.\n\nRepublican Meg Whitman didn\u2019t fare as well. The Hewlett-Packard executive dumped a whopping $175 million into a failed 2010 run for governor in California.\n\nThe price of politics in West Virginia is a fraction of those two states. In 2012, Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin won re-election after raising and spending $3.4 million.\n\nThe stats don\u2019t necessarily work in self-funders\u2019 favor. From 2002 to 2009, Only 668 of 6,171- or 11 percent \u2013 of self-funded candidates for state office won, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics.\n\n\u201cThe amount of money that (Justice) could bring to the table certainly is noteworthy,\u201d said West Virginia Republican Party Chairman Conrad Lucas. \u201cHowever, you can only spend so much without diminishing marginal returns. Voters across America have a history of rejecting self-funded candidates, with some exceptions.\u201d\n\nWhile running for governor, Rockefeller spun his self-funding into a positive, arguing he wouldn\u2019t be beholden to special interests, said West Virginia Wesleyan College political science professor Robert Rupp.\n\nRockefeller and Caperton also climbed the political ladder more traditionally. Rockefeller worked his way up through elected slots as a Democrat, while Caperton was involved in Democratic Party politics, Rupp said.\n\nJustice has changed his party affiliation multiple times, and was recently a Republican. He said he is still hashing out his policy views and wants to bridge the partisan divide with fresh ideas.\n\nHis candidacy has yielded criticisms from Democratic state Minority Leader Jeff Kessler, the only other mainstream candidate officially in the race.\n\n\u201cThe hardworking men and women of West Virginia will decide if big ideas and hard work will beat big money,\u201d Kessler said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrat Billionaire to Self-Fund West Virginia Gubernatorial Campaign", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Democrat Billionaire to Self-Fund West Virginia Gubernatorial Campaign", "title": "Democrat Billionaire to Self-Fund West Virginia Gubernatorial Campaign - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/jim-justice-ap.jpg", "height": 1229}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/17/democrat-billionaire-to-self-fund-west-virginia-gubernatorial-campaign/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrat Billionaire to Self-Fund West Virginia Gubernatorial Campaign", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/jim-justice-ap.jpg", "title": "Democrat Billionaire to Self-Fund West Virginia Gubernatorial Campaign - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jim Justice, Self-Funded Campaign, West Virginia Governor,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "West Virginia Governor", "published_time": "2015-05-17T15:34:12-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The price of politics in West Virginia is a fraction of those two states.\nWest Virginia is no stranger to self-funded campaigns.\n\u201cThe amount of money that (Justice) could bring to the table certainly is noteworthy,\u201d said West Virginia Republican Party Chairman Conrad Lucas.\n\u201cThe hardworking men and women of West Virginia will decide if big ideas and hard work will beat big money,\u201d Kessler said.\nHis candidacy has yielded criticisms from Democratic state Minority Leader Jeff Kessler, the only other mainstream candidate officially in the race."}
