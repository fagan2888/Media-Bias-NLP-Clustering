North Carolina's largest health insurer is considering dropping coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

The News & Observer of Raleigh reported that Blue Cross and Blue Shield expects to report its second consecutive financial loss as it deals with cost overruns.

CEO Brad Wilson said Wednesday the company cannot continue to suffer losses indefinitely in North Carolina. Wilson said the company may have to decide later this year whether to stop offering coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

The company raised rates by nearly one third this year but says it was not enough to cover losses.

Executives at other major insurers have also threatened to drop their Affordable Care Act business if it continues losing money.

The move could affect more than 300,000 North Carolina residents.
