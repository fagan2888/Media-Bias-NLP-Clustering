STERLING, Colo. (AP) — Authorities say a Wyoming teen was killed when the car he was driving collided with a horse on a northeastern Colorado highway.

The Sterling Journal-Advocate reports (http://tinyurl.com/o3kwmko) two other people were injured in collision early Sunday on Colorado 61.

The Colorado State Patrol says 19-year-old Austin W. Robertson of Cheyenne was killed. The patrol says two passengers were taken to a Greeley hospital with serious injuries.

Investigators say the horse was standing in the path of the southbound vehicle. The horse was euthanized because of its injuries.

Investigators say no one in the car was wearing a seat belt and neither speed, alcohol nor drugs was considered a factor in the crash.
