The reason is obvious: Everyone now recognizes that prohibitions against interracial marriage, which the Supreme Court struck down in the aptly named Loving v. Virginia, were completely irrational and thoroughly unjust. If the analogy with gay marriage is valid, then that debate is over.\n\nIt probably is anyway. But its demise could be hastened by federal District Judge Robert Shelby\u2019s ruling against Utah\u2019s amendment forbidding gay marriage, which invokes Loving time and again.\n\nUtah\u2019s marriage amendment parallels Virginia\u2019s in many ways. Utah passed a law forbidding gay marriage in 1977, two years after Virginia did. In 2004, both states then doubled down by passing additional measures foreclosing the possibility of civil unions or other approximations of gay marriage. Utah then passed a constitutional amendment forbidding gay marriage that took effect in 2005. Virginians approved the commonwealth\u2019s amendment the next year.\n\nShelby \u2014 an alumnus of U.Va. Law \u2014 notes that the developments in Utah were \u201cinfluenced by a number of events occurring nationally,\u201d including cases legalizing gay marriage in Vermont and Massachusetts. During debate over Virginia\u2019s amendment, Republican Del. Bob Marshall decried \u201cattempts to radically alter an institution that must antedate history. And this has come about by social engineering judges in Massachusetts, Vermont, and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nArguments like that ring with historical echoes. \u201cAlmighty God created the races white, black, yellow, malay and red, and he placed them on separate continents,\u201d decreed Leon Bazile, the judge who convicted Mildred and Richard Loving. \u201cAnd but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages.\u201d God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.\n\nGay-marriage foes object that gender is central to procreation in a way race isn\u2019t. This is true, but it ignores the legal parallels between gay marriage and racial intermarriage. Those parallels should especially trouble anyone who believes in limited government. Asking why gays should be allowed to marry asks the wrong question. The right question is: Why should government stop them?\n\nMarriage, as Shelby observes, is a fundamental right \u2014 so fundamental that even prison inmates retain the right, despite their \u201creduced expectation of liberty\u201d and the unlikelihood of jailhouse weddings producing offspring. Why then should a state deny free gays and lesbians a right it affords to inmates?\n\nDefenders of Utah\u2019s Amendment 3 respond that gays and lesbians enjoy the same right to marry as everyone else: the right to marry persons of the opposite gender. But the right to marry entails a right to choose whom you marry. If it didn\u2019t, then the state could pick your spouse for you: \u201cA person\u2019s choices about marriage,\u201d Shelby writes, \u201cimplicate the heart of the right to liberty.\u201d\n\nUtah\u2019s defenders claim the amendment does not discriminate because it applied to men and women equally. But as Shelby notes, \u201cThe Supreme Court rejected an analogous argument\u201d in Loving: \u201cVirginia argued that its anti-miscegenation laws did not discriminate based on race because the prohibition against mixed-race marriage applied equally to both white and black citizens.\u201d\n\nLike Utah, Virginia claims same-sex marriage is not a fundamental right, but rather a new kind of right \u201cfirst recognized in this country [only] a decade ago.\u201d Shelby finds this argument unpersuasive: \u201cThe Supreme Court did not adopt this line of reasoning in\u201d Loving: \u201cInstead of declaring a new right to interracial marriage, the Court held that individuals could not be restricted from exercising their existing right to marry on account of the race of their chosen partner. ... This right is ... implicit in the concept of ordered liberty because it protects an individual\u2019s ability to make deeply personal choices about love and family free from government interference. ... Both same-sex and opposite-sex marriage are therefore simply manifestations of one right \u2014 the right to marry \u2014 applied to people with different sexual identities.\u201d\n\nLike Utah, Virginia argues that traditional marriage is the optimal arrangement for child-rearing \u2014 that the traditional definition of marriage is hallowed by time as \u201cthe ideal ordering of human relationships.\u201d\n\nWell. Set aside for the moment the profoundly authoritarian implications of assuming that \u201cordering ... human relationships\u201d is any part of government\u2019s job. And that government can be trusted to know what is \u201cideal\u201d and \u201coptimal.\u201d And that it should seek to enforce its vision of what is \u201cideal\u201d rather than simply protect individuals\u2019 liberty to pursue their own happiness as they define it.\n\nEven if you accept such premises, Shelby notes that there is no evidence to think prohibiting gay marriage achieves any of the prohibition\u2019s ostensible aims: \u201cThe court\u2019s focus is not on whether extending marriage benefits to heterosexual couples serves a legitimate governmental interest.\u201d Rather, \u201ccourts are required to determine whether there is a rational connection between the challenged statute and a legitimate state interest.\u201d\n\nVirginia had an interest \u201cin providing marriage to same-race couples,\u201d Shelby noted, but \u201cVirginia\u2019s exclusion of interracial couples from marriage\u201d had no bearing on that interest. Likewise, prohibiting marriage by gay couples has no effect on how many straight couples marry or have children: \u201cIn an amicus brief submitted to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals by the District of Columbia and fourteen states that currently permit same-sex marriage, the states assert that the implementation of same-sex unions in their jurisdictions has not resulted in any decrease in opposite-sex marriage rates, any increase in divorce rates, or any increase in the number of nonmarital births.\u201d\n\nIn short, supporting straight marriage does not require stifling gay marriage. The only remaining reasons to stifle it, then, are reasons government cannot embrace: a desire to preserve the traditional institution of marriage and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality. But preserving tradition and expressing disapproval are not valid grounds for circumscribing individual rights.\n\nVirginia\u2019s arguments in Loving, Shelby concludes, \u201care almost identical to the assertions made by the State of Utah in support of Utah\u2019s laws prohibiting same-sex marriage. ... Anti-miscegenation laws in Virginia and elsewhere were designed to, and did, deprive a targeted minority of the full measure of human dignity and liberty by denying them the freedom to marry the partner of their choice. Utah\u2019s Amendment 3 achieves the same result.\u201d\n\nSo does Virginia\u2019s marriage amendment. That is why the challenge to it could become a reprise of the Loving case \u2014 whether its defenders like that or not.\n\nThis column originally appeared in the Richmond Times-Dispatch.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Foes of gay marriage \u2014 a shrinking cohort \u2014 do not like comparisons to interracial marriage.
