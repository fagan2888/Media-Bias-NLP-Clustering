John Fleming John FlemingOvernight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns House panel approves Puerto Rico debt relief Path clears for passage of Puerto Rico bill MORE (R-La.), who was chairing the hearing.\n\n\u201cAn aggressive offshore leasing strategy would truly demonstrate a true commitment to [outer continental shelf] oil and gas production in the U.S. It would also demonstrate a commitment to our nation\u2019s long-term energy security and to American jobs,\u201d he continued.\n\nRep. Cynthia Lummis Cynthia LummisThe Hill's 12:30 Report GOP women push Trump on VP pick GOP lawmaker suggests Trump pick woman as VP MORE (R-Wyo.) was particularly concerned with a plan to hold only one lease sale for the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\u201cIndustry\u2019s expressed an interest in participating in more lease sales than you propose, including in the Atlantic,\u201d Lummis said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it make more sense to err on the side of more?\u201d\n\nHopper defended the plan and said it reflects Obama\u2019s commitment to domestic oil and gas production.\n\n\u201cIncludes nearly 80 percent of estimated undiscovered, technically recoverable oil and gas resources on the outer continental shelf,\u201d she told the panel.\n\nShe said the low number of lease sales is only because the agency chose to consolidate sales in the Gulf of Mexico that previously would have been separated.\n\n\u201cSo, if you broke them in the way we break them out now, they would add up to 30 instead of 10,\u201d she said.\n\nRep. Alan Lowenthal (D-Calif.) said the oil industry is always going to want more area opened, and lawmakers should push back.\n\n\u201cMost in the industry wouldn\u2019t, quite frankly, be satisfied until every acre of the outer continental shelf is open for drilling,\u201d he said. \u201cThey always want more.\u201d\n\nLowenthal also urged BOEM to account for the entire greenhouse gas impact of the oil and gas that comes from offshore drilling.\n\n\u201cBOEM\u2019s draft program does have not a lot to say about climate change,\u201d he said.\n\nHopper said she and Interior officials are still figuring out how to account for the climate impact of the lease sales.\n\nLawmakers also heard from North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R), who was supportive of offshore drilling in his state\u2019s section of the outer continental shelf.\n\n\u201cHarnessing America\u2019s offshore energy reserves in an environmentally safe and responsible manner will lead to greater energy independence and more prosperity for North Carolina and the entire nation,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCrory estimated that drilling off North Carolina\u2019s shores could bring 55,000 jobs and $3 billion to the state\u2019s economy over 10 years.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "House Republicans chastised the Obama administration Wednesday for putting forth a \u201crestrictive\u201d plan for offshore oil and natural gas drilling.", "description": "House Republicans chastised the Obama administration Wednesday for putting forth a \u201crestrictive\u201d plan for offshore oil and natural gas drilling.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "House Republicans chastised the Obama administration Wednesday for putting forth a \u201crestrictive\u201d plan for offshore oil and natural gas drilling.", "title": "GOP criticizes Obama\u2019s \u2018restrictive\u2019 offshore drilling plan", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/238994-gop-criticizes-obamas-restrictive-offshore-drilling-plan", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/238994-gop-criticizes-obamas-restrictive-offshore-drilling-plan", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-15T17:24-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Offshore drilling, oil, Natural gas,Cynthia Lummis, John Fleming,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-15T17:24:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/238994-gop-criticizes-obamas-restrictive-offshore-drilling-plan", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "House Republicans chastised the Obama administration Wednesday for putting forth a \u201crestrictive\u201d plan for offshore oil and natural gas drilling.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP criticizes Obama\u2019s \u2018restrictive\u2019 offshore drilling plan"}, "dcterms.title": "GOP criticizes Obama\u2019s \u2018restrictive\u2019 offshore drilling plan"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fd1\"", "article_summary": "House Republicans chastised the Obama administration Wednesday for putting forth a \u201crestrictive\u201d plan for offshore oil and natural gas drilling.\nPat McCrory (R), who was supportive of offshore drilling in his state\u2019s section of the outer continental shelf.\n\u201cMost in the industry wouldn\u2019t, quite frankly, be satisfied until every acre of the outer continental shelf is open for drilling,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAn aggressive offshore leasing strategy would truly demonstrate a true commitment to [outer continental shelf] oil and gas production in the U.S.\n\u201cIndustry\u2019s expressed an interest in participating in more lease sales than you propose, including in the Atlantic,\u201d Lummis said."}
