Leon said the Health and Human Services Department practiced \u201cregulatory favoritism\u201d by exempting houses of worship on grounds that its employees are less likely to want the contraceptives, while rejecting pleas from March for Life, a secular group that says its employees also don\u2019t want contraceptives, particularly those they equate with abortion.\n\n\u201cHHS may be correct that this objection is common among religiously affiliated employers. Where HHS has erred, however, is in assuming that this trait is unique to such organizations. It is not,\u201d wrote Judge Leon, who was appointed to the District of Columbia bench by President George W. Bush.\n\nOn Thursday, secretaries of the Treasury and Health and Human Services and Labor departments filed notice with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\nThe birth control mandate is an outgrowth of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 that requires employers to cover 20 types of drugs and services approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of their health care plans. Pitched as a boon for women\u2019s health, the rules quickly spawned controversy, with dozens of religious nonprofits and devout business owners filing suit.\n\nUntil now, the court battles hinged mainly on religious rather than moral objections to the mandate, and the debate centered on family-owned companies and faith-based nonprofits, not nonreligious businesses.\n\nJudge Leon said the government was being hypocritical when it boxed out March for Life, an organization that shares the same concerns as religious employers that have received exemptions.\n\nMarch for Life was founded in 1973 after the Supreme Court upheld the right to abortion in its Roe v. Wade decision. Every year, it attracts hundreds of thousands of activists to the National Mall and Capitol Hill to protest the ruling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration filed notice Thursday that it will appeal a federal ruling that blocked it from enforcing its birth control mandate on a pro-life nonprofit known for its massive D.C. rallies against abortion.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration filed notice Thursday that it will appeal a federal ruling that blocked it from enforcing its birth control mandate on a pro-life nonprofit known for its massive D.C. rallies against abortion.", "title": "Anti-abortion March for Life faces Obama appeal on birth control mandate", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/29/anti-abortion-march-life-faces-obama-appeal-birth-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/31/AP_801214065104.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/31/AP_801214065104.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration filed notice Thursday that it will appeal a federal ruling that blocked it from enforcing its birth control mandate on a pro-life nonprofit known for its massive D.C. rallies", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Anti-abortion March for Life faces Obama appeal on birth control manda"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4a7\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration filed notice Thursday that it will appeal a federal ruling that blocked it from enforcing its birth control mandate on a pro-life nonprofit known for its massive D.C. rallies against abortion.\nMarch for Life was founded in 1973 after the Supreme Court upheld the right to abortion in its Roe v.
