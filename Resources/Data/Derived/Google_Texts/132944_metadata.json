But advocates say the administration\u2019s system for verifying eligibility is seriously flawed, and consumers who are legally entitled to benefits are paying the price.\n\n\u201cSame dog, different collar,\u201d said Jane Delgado, president of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health, evoking an old Spanish saying about situations that do not seem to change. \u201cThe bottom line is people got taken off health insurance when they applied in good faith.\u201d\n\nThe National Immigration Law Center says it believes the overwhelming majority of the 423,000 people whose coverage was terminated are legal U.S. residents and citizens snared in a complicated, inefficient system for checking documents.\n\nAngel Padilla, the center\u2019s health policy analyst, said it defies common sense that that many immigrants without legal authorization to be in the country would risk alerting a federal agency by applying for taxpayer-subsidized benefits.\n\n\u201cSomebody who is trying to submit documents over and over \u2026 is someone who believes they have an eligible immigration status,\u201d Padilla said. By comparison, a total of 109,000 people lost coverage because of citizenship and immigration issues during all of 2014.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s health care law specifies that only citizens and legal U.S. residents are entitled to coverage through the new insurance markets that offer subsidized policies. The administration says this year the law provides just a 95-day window for resolving documentation issues that involve citizenship and immigration. There was no such clock in 2014 because it was the first year of HealthCare.gov\u2019s coverage expansion.\n\nLast year, \u201cwe had the authority to provide consumers more flexibility \u2013 we were not taking action on the strict timeline,\u201d said Ben Wakana, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cIn 2015, we moved to the timeline of about three months, so consumers need to act quickly to submit supporting documentation.\u201d\n\nPadilla said a shorter time window might not be so much of a problem if the administration would clearly communicate which documents are needed. \u201cIf it was clearer what the consumer needed to do, we wouldn\u2019t have the numbers that we have,\u201d he said.\n\nThe administration says it is continually making improvements to help consumers.\n\nHispanics, the nation\u2019s most numerous ethnic group, have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act. The uninsured rate for Latino adults ages 18-64 dropped from nearly 41 percent in 2013 to about 28 percent in the first three months of this year, according to a government survey. But Hispanics are still more likely to be uninsured than people of other ethnic and racial backgrounds. Signing up more Latinos is a priority for the administration and the law\u2019s supporters.\n\nThe administration is highly sensitive to Republican accusations that it is dispensing health benefits to people who are not legally entitled to them, including those who cannot prove their citizenship or legal status. Investigators for the congressional Government Accountability Office successfully enrolled fictitious characters through HealthCare.gov in 2014, and at least initially, renewed their coverage for this year.\n\nBut the nonpartisan probe also found evidence of problems with HealthCare.gov\u2019s consumer communications about problem applications.\n\nFor example, the federal insurance marketplace asked eight of the GAO\u2019s bogus beneficiaries to submit additional documentation to prove citizenship and identity. But GAO said the list of suitable documents that could be sent in consisted of paperwork for verifying income. After documents were sent in, HealthCare.gov failed in some cases to say whether they were acceptable.\n\nHealthCare.gov \u201cdid not always provide clear and complete communications,\u201d said the GAO\u2019s report this summer. \u201cWe did not always know the current status of our applications or specific documents required in support of them.\u201d\n\nThe number of coverage terminations could actually be higher. The 423,000 figure only represents states served by the federal health insurance market. That does not include immigrant-rich California and New York, which run their own insurance exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A change in government procedures has led to a big jump in people losing coverage under the Obama health care law because of immigration and citizenship issues.", "pubdate": 20150912, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "A change in government procedures has led to a big jump in people losing coverage under the Obama health care law because of immigration and citizenship issues.", "title": "Spike in number of immigrants losing health law coverage", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RTR3FIUH.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/spike-number-immigrants-losing-health-law-coverage/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "A change in government procedures has led to a big jump in people losing coverage under the Obama health care law because of immigration and citizenship issues.", "title": "Spike in number of immigrants losing health law coverage", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RTR3FIUH.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "PBS NewsHour Weekend"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Health Care Act, health care, immigrants, national immigration law center, PBS NewsHour Weekend"}, "article_summary": "The 423,000 figure only represents states served by the federal health insurance market.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A change in government procedures has led to a big jump in people losing coverage under the Obama health care law because of immigration and citizenship issues.\n\u201cSomebody who is trying to submit documents over and over \u2026 is someone who believes they have an eligible immigration status,\u201d Padilla said.\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s health care law specifies that only citizens and legal U.S. residents are entitled to coverage through the new insurance markets that offer subsidized policies.\nBy comparison, a total of 109,000 people lost coverage because of citizenship and immigration issues during all of 2014."}
