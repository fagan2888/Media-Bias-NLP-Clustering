It criticizes the Japanese government\u2019s decision to stop promoting the vaccine amid concerns about injuries. And it implies patients are incorrectly blaming the HPV vaccine for unrelated ills.\n\nCritics say it\u2019s an example of hidden cronyism among physicians and corporations who use medical journals to influence public policy.\n\n\u201cIndividuals who have the misfortune to be unwell with rare or difficult to treat disorders have been encouraged by antivaccination advocates to blame the HPV vaccine, especially in an unrestrained media environment,\u201d writes lead author Dr. Sharon J.B. Hanley.\n\nBut a key disclosure is omitted from the article: Hanley\u2019s financial ties to Merck and GlaxoSmithKline\u2014makers of the multi-billion dollar HPV vaccines promoted in the article.\n\nCritics say it\u2019s an example of hidden cronyism among physicians and corporations who use medical journals, regarded as pillars in the medical community, to influence physicians and public policy.\n\nDebate Over Disclosure\n\nIn the HPV vaccine article, Hanley reported receiving fees for lectures from \u201cJapan Vaccine\u201d and \u201cthe Japanese Expert Board for the Eradication of Cervical Cancer.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s omitted is the disclosure that \u201cJapan Vaccine\u201d is a venture of GlaxoSmithKline; and \u201cthe Japanese Expert Board\u201d has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Merck and GlaxoSmithKline. GlaxoSmithKline makes Cervarix vaccine. Merck makes Gardasil.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to acknowledge and recognize conflicts of interest could influence what someone who\u2019s viewed as an expert in the field says and how it\u2019s interpreted,\u201d says Dr. Michael Carome, an internationally recognized expert on research ethics and head of the Health Research Group at watchdog Public Citizen.\n\nContacted by email, Hanley insisted she followed The Lancet\u2019s conflict of interest disclosure policy. She added that HPV vaccine safety data has been analyzed by respected international bodies and \u201ccommercial entities cannot influence this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would disagree with that,\u201d says Carome. \u201cWith any commercial product, drugs or vaccine, an author\u2019s financial conflicts of interest could influence how they are describing or recommending a particular treatment or intervention.\u201d\n\nReached for comment, The Lancet indicated that, upon further review, Hanley\u2019s disclosure did not comply with their conflict of interest disclosure policy.\n\n\u201cThank you for bringing this to our attention,\u201d Lancet senior editor Audrey Ceschia wrote to me in an email. \u201cWe will publish a correction stating that the [Japanese Expert] Board received funding from [GlaxoSmithKline and Merck].\u201d Hanely would not confirm to us that Japan Vaccine is a GlaxoSmithKline venture, but Ceschia later acknowledged that it is.\n\n\u2018A Very Bad Idea\u2019\n\nCritics say too often corporate influence encroaches on respected scientific journals\u2014unbeknownst to the physicians and patients who read them.\n\nThree former senior editors of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) recently blasted what they view as some medical journals, including their former employer, allowing and defending drug industry influence.\n\nTheir essay in the British Medical Journal is titled, \u201cJustifying conflicts of interest in medical journals: a very bad idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a series of rambling articles, one of the [NEJM\u2019s] national correspondents, Lisa Rosenbaum, supported by the editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Drazen, tried to rationalise financial conflicts of interest in the medical profession,\u201d write former NEJM heavyweights Robert Steinbrook, Jerome Kassirer and Marcia Angell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to be transparent about conflicts of interest so readers can make their own judgement,\u201d says @Public_Citizen\u2019s Michael Carome\n\n\u201c[W]e find it sad that the medical journal that first called attention to the problem of financial conflicts of interest among physicians would now backtrack so dramatically and indulge in personal attacks on those who disagree. \u2026 Put simply, financial conflicts of interest in medicine are not beneficial, despite strained attempts to justify them and to make a virtue of self interest.\u201d\n\nCarome says disclosure is crucial:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to be transparent about conflicts of interest so readers can make their own judgement about whether real or apparent conflicts of interest are being reflected in what authors are saying.\u201d\n\nHanley declined to provide a list of pharmaceutical industry compensation she has received.\n\nJapan began offering free HPV vaccine in December of 2010. In June of 2013, amid concerns about adverse event reports, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare instructed local governments and doctors to cease promoting the HPV vaccine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sharyl Attkisson investigates what critics say is an example of cronyism among physicians and corporations who use medical journals to influence policy.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Sharyl Attkisson investigates what critics say is an example of cronyism among physicians and corporations who use medical journals to influence policy.", "title": "What You Didn't Know About Doctor's Stance on HPV Vaccine", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150701_HPV1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-01T19:17:28+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1C9L2hh"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Sharyl Attkisson investigates what critics say is an example of cronyism among physicians and corporations who use medical journals to influence policy.", "title": "What You Didn't Know About Doctor's Stance on HPV Vaccine", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150701_HPV1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "public health,transparency", "published_time": "2015-07-01T16:22:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-01T19:17:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "hpv vaccine, conflict of interest, gardasil, Cervarix, glaxosmithkline, merck, pharmaceutical industry, japan, lancet"}, "article_summary": "And it implies patients are incorrectly blaming the HPV vaccine for unrelated ills.\nJapan began offering free HPV vaccine in December of 2010.\nIn June of 2013, amid concerns about adverse event reports, the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare instructed local governments and doctors to cease promoting the HPV vaccine.\nShe added that HPV vaccine safety data has been analyzed by respected international bodies and \u201ccommercial entities cannot influence this.\u201d\u201cI would disagree with that,\u201d says Carome.\nContacted by email, Hanley insisted she followed The Lancet\u2019s conflict of interest disclosure policy."}
