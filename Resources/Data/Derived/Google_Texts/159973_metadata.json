Kornhaber: Kids these days. Yik Yaking and Snapchatting and Slendermanning and vanishing so as to serve as an invisible living reminder that life is meaningless and no one should feel any sort of warmth toward anyone else. I\u2019m tempted to read tonight\u2019s episode-ending revelation that Evie and her friends had run away to join the Guilty Remnant as a commentary on Millennial idealism, though the ideal at issue is the opposite of hope-changeiness. You could alternately argue that it\u2019s utterly un-stereotypical for 2015 teenagers to rebel like this: They had to leave their iPhones in the car! Related Story The Leftovers: Cross or Jump Either way, it\u2019s a good twist, one that I didn\u2019t see coming but that makes total sense in retrospect. The Leftovers this season has largely let viewers forget the extreme measures and ambition of the Guilty Remnant: The corpse manipulation, the self-stoning, and the assorted harassments that made up much of the first season\u2019s action are foggy memories by now. The glimpse into Tommy and Laurie\u2019s anti-Remnant efforts in the third episode almost mostly made you sympathize with the white-shirts; the nattering of ghost-Patti increasingly seemed like a personal expression of pain or Kevin\u2019s psychosis rather than a tactic of an organization hellbent on expunging optimism from Earth. So from a viewer\u2019s perspective, Meg is right when she tells Matt that Jarden doesn\u2019t feel like somewhere the Remnant would go. But think about it for a sec and it becomes clear that it\u2019s where the Remnant must go to complete its mission. Back when the season premiere aired, I wrote that Evie\u2019s \u201cmischievous eye glint and quietly confident demeanor makes me hope she hasn\u2019t capital-D Departed.\u201d Now we know what some of that confidence was about and can make better educated guesses about why the three girls were seen running naked through the woods\u2014practicing their escape, maybe? In any case, the philosophical implications of their con are multi-layered. By pretending to Depart, they\u2019ve sent the message that Miracle isn\u2019t special. But the fact that they didn\u2019t actually Depart means that Miracle may be just as special as everyone else thinks. And the fact that their disappearance coincided with a river-draining earthquake means that\u2014unless the GR possess yet-unrevealed geotechnical engineering skills\u2014we\u2019ve got another possibly divine coincidence to puzzle over. It\u2019s a statement of nihilism that may actually endorse the opposite. It\u2019s the knock-knock joke about pointlessness, writ large.\n\nWhich brings us to Meg. At first, her descent into radicalism seemed a little arbitrary: The show needs a Remnant member to turn terroristic for plot reasons, I thought, and Liv Tyler\u2019s character just happened to have nothing to do this year. But then I remembered how brutal her first-season arc was. The aggressive tactics of the GR in Mapleton got her to leave her fianc\u00e9; she finally fully committed to the cause once Gladys was stoned; she seemed to relish getting a beatdown from townsfolk in the finale. And tonight\u2019s opening flashback revealed that she was the kind of woman who needed cocaine in order to stomach small talk with her mom, which is to say that she never much enjoyed the polite order of civilization to begin with. So it\u2019s not too much of a stretch to think that with some cult influence, following the apparent apocalypse, she\u2019d go full havoc-causer. Meg offered a line that Leftovers viewers can cheer for: \u201cDon\u2019t give me that mysterious bullshit.\u201d Tyler is great at portraying defiance and rage through soft-spoken words and small eye movements. I loved how she alternated between disdainful skepticism and wounded hope in her scene with Isaac, whose mention of walnuts might be the most clearest evidence of the supernatural we\u2019ve yet seen\u2014besides, of course, Kevin\u2019s resurrection. I also loved Meg\u2019s sassy interactions with the Guilty Remnant authorities who told her not to target children\u2014an admonition that we now know has been spectacularly defied in Jarden. \u201cExplanations are useless,\u201d the main chainsmoker said, to which Meg offered a reply that Leftovers viewers can cheer for: \u201cDon\u2019t give me that mysterious bullshit.\u201d Tommy, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t have the inner conviction to react so strongly to the global trauma of the Departure. He is, at heart, a follower, as we saw all throughout his season one storyline with Holy Wayne. Which explains why he couldn\u2019t pull off his hug-giving scheme for long\u2014though even in that scheme, he was a follower of his mom\u2014and why he becomes so fascinated with Meg, despite everything she\u2019s done and all the horror he\u2019s seen the GR cause. For a moment, it seemed like he might intervene in the stoning of the guy who stumbled into the barn. But of course he didn\u2019t.\n\nSophie, what do you think Meg has planned for the bridge in the finale? How will John Murphy react if he finds out what\u2019s become of his daughter? Is the final miracle of the season going to be that Tommy really is pregnant? Gilbert: I think unless the mention of Meg ordering plastic explosive was a diversion, the season might well come to another fiery end. Perhaps she\u2019s going to blow up the camp outside Jarden? It\u2019s impossible to envision her getting any kind of device into the town given the security infrastructure in place, although maybe that\u2019s part of the plan for the girls\u2014if they surprise everyone enough with their return, possibly people won\u2019t notice the bomb vests they\u2019re wearing? When Tommy was prising open the door to the caravan, in fact, I was convinced he\u2019d open it and find some kind of elaborate IED. But no, it was Evie, doubling (or tripling) down on the season-long punchline in her response to Tommy asking who she was: It doesn\u2019t matter (it\u2019s pointless). So Evie\u2019s knock-knock joke was more than a joke! It was an expression of nihilist disaffection with the reality of post-Departure life! But \u2026 why? The whole point of the GR is that they appeal to people who are broken and whose lives have been distorted by loss. What about them might appeal to Evie and her friends? Yes, teenagers are inherently rebellious and cynical, and Evie\u2019s home life obviously isn\u2019t as happy as it appeared in the first episode, but I\u2019m still eager to find out what might have drawn her to Meg beyond a disaffection with the false hope of Jarden and a mutual love of baby carrots. But I have to counter that I find Meg\u2019s evolution totally implausible. She\u2019s a completely different person, with a different name, even (I don\u2019t remember anyone calling her Megan last season, but it was pretty much the only name used in this episode). Sure, grief can make you cruel, but it doesn\u2019t totally erode your humanity. It doesn\u2019t make you petrify children by throwing grenades onto their school bus, or order random trespassers to be stoned to death, or want to put out your cigarette in someone\u2019s eye just to make them feel as crappy as you do. Meg last season seemed like someone suffering from a classic case of post-Departure existential crisis (and pre-wedding jitters) but she was essentially kind and empathetic, encouraging Laurie to keep the lighter Jill gave her, presumably because she was thinking a little of her own mother. I remember her sitting on the sidewalk shaking in the finale after the GR conflagration, but I don\u2019t buy that even the most vicious backlash from the people of Mapleton could turn her into such a palpably cruel, manipulative, and brutal person. I\u2019m eager to find out what might have drawn Evie to Meg beyond a disaffection with Jarden\u2019s false hope and a mutual love of baby carrots. It seems more like the show wanted a new Big Bad after Kevin wrestled (metaphorically) with Patti on a spiritual plane, and so Meg was drafted to fill the void. But it feels cheap. Throwing in a classically snippy mom (\u201cladies don\u2019t say \u2018pee\u2019\u201d) and a possible cocaine habit as backstory doesn\u2019t do much to illuminate her character, and if anything Liv Tyler is too good in the role\u2014she really fills out Meg with a kind of radiant menace, and the result is that she seems fairly unrecognizable from season one. So I\u2019m edging toward disappointed when it comes to the obvious setup of a season-finale conflict between the Guilty Remnant and the good people of Jarden. For one thing, it\u2019s exactly what happened last season. For another, the whole point of Jarden was that it offered new threats and new mysteries and new antagonists. The local GR chapter might look like a rebel militia (they\u2019re more into camo and work boots than white K-Mart sweaters) but they\u2019re essentially there with the same intent\u2014to #disrupt the people intent on moving on from the Departure and returning to their daily lives. In Jarden, where as Meg put it, the place is safe, and people \u201cjust aren\u2019t suffering like the rest of us are,\u201d the temptation to shake up the town\u2019s sense of security and \u201ccorrupt its exceptional properties\u201d must be even more acute. But it still feels a little like a letdown.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Meg\u2019s back, and she isn\u2019t the only one.", "author": "Sophie Gilbert and Spencer Kornhaber", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Meg's back, and she isn't the only one.", "title": "'The Leftovers': A Surprise Return", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/11/meg_leftovers_209/facebook.jpg?1448817522", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/11/leftovers-209-roundtable-review/417906/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "So from a viewer\u2019s perspective, Meg is right when she tells Matt that Jarden doesn\u2019t feel like somewhere the Remnant would go.\nHe is, at heart, a follower, as we saw all throughout his season one storyline with Holy Wayne.\nGilbert: I think unless the mention of Meg ordering plastic explosive was a diversion, the season might well come to another fiery end.\nIs the final miracle of the season going to be that Tommy really is pregnant?\nBut think about it for a sec and it becomes clear that it\u2019s where the Remnant must go to complete its mission."}
