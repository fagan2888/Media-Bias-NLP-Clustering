Following rulings on emotional issues such as same-sex marriage and Obamacare, reactions to the Supreme Court remain extremely polarized. This new poll shows that Americans would support a change in how the Supreme Court works.\n\nHistorically, the President appoints Supreme Court justices and they serve for life (or until they decide to retire). The Reuters survey shows many Americans would rather see term limits on judges, and have more say in how they are selected.\n\nOverwhelming, those polled supported limiting the justices to a 10-year term. The two-third majority view didn\u2019t change much based on political party. Results of the survey showed 66% of Democrats, 74% of Republicans, and 68% of Independents all preferred term limits when given the two options of judges serving \u201c10 years\u201d or \u201cfor life.\u201d\n\nThe majority (48%) preferred an outright election instead the current system of a presidential nomination followed by a senatorial confirmation. Only 32% of those surveyed still support the current process.\n\nThe survey showed most Americans would not change the role of the judicial branch. According to Reuter\u2019s results, most people approve of the Supreme Court having the final say when it comes to the constitutionality of the law. Only 29% want the legislative or executive branch of government to have the power to override rulings from the Court.\n\nThis chart shows the poll\u2019s results:\n\nSenator and Presidential candidate Ted Cruz (R-TX) expressed extreme disappointment with recent Supreme Court verdicts. He suggested judicial retention elections as a result of justices \u201cnot honoring their judicial oaths\u201d and politicizing the court.\n\nRecent polling from Gallup shows that the Supreme Court has caused an increase in polarization, with Democrats and Republicans responding to rulings with very different levels of approval.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Political affiliation didn't factor into their answers.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "Political affiliation didn't factor into their answers.", "title": "Americans Were Just Asked If Supreme Court Justices Should Have Term Limits", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 621, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/scotus.jpg", "height": 361}, "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/07/373263-americans-just-asked-supreme-court-justices-term-limits/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Political affiliation didn't factor into their answers.", "title": "Americans Were Just Asked If Supreme Court Justices Should Have Term Limits", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/scotus.jpg", "creator": "@MPHaus", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Hausam", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-23T10:58:33-04:00", "wp-categories": "4889 482 1471", "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "published_at": "2015-07-23T10:58:33+00:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/07/373263-americans-just-asked-supreme-court-justices-term-limits/", "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "wp-category-slugs": "legal, nation, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Legal", "published_time": "2015-07-23T10:58:33-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/MPHaus.US/"}, "post_id": 373263, "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/scotus.jpg", "tags": "Politics", "is_https": 0}, "article_summary": "Historically, the President appoints Supreme Court justices and they serve for life (or until they decide to retire).\nThis new poll shows that Americans would support a change in how the Supreme Court works.\nFollowing rulings on emotional issues such as same-sex marriage and Obamacare, reactions to the Supreme Court remain extremely polarized.\nThe Reuters survey shows many Americans would rather see term limits on judges, and have more say in how they are selected.\nAccording to Reuter\u2019s results, most people approve of the Supreme Court having the final say when it comes to the constitutionality of the law."}
