Many doctors believe that 50 percent of diseases go from bad to worse because of improper or late diagnosis. Google is hoping to change this statistic however by creating a technology that can extract continuous medical-grade information about the wearer. Doctors can then study and understand recurring patterns of diseases and find the best solution to combat them.\n\nRELATED TOPIC: How Google will be affected when Ruth Porat becomes CFO\n\nIs Google branching out entirely into health?\n\nThe Google X team previously brought us Google Glass and seems to continue to want to venture into the health sciences realm.\n\nIt is reported that the team will be launching a range of medical products including a blood glucose-monitoring lens, the Lift ware spoon designed to counteract tremors caused by Parkinson\u2019s disease, nanoparticles that will detect disease and Baseline.\n\nRELATED TOPIC: Google is a health tech enterprise: 7 ventures to watch entering 2015\n\nAnd while Google Glass wasn\u2019t initially promoted as a consumer device, interest from individuals later saw the glasses being paired with high fashion designers and made available to anyone willing to pay its price of $1,500.\n\nThe device is only for medical professionals right now, and even if it does become available for consumers, that doesn\u2019t seem to be anytime soon. Nevertheless, Google remains to be a software tech giant first and foremost.\n\nLet's connect!
