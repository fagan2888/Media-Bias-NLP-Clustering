It turns out that you also might not be able to keep using the prescription drugs you\u2019ve been taking for years. And you may not be able to use a drug a doctor prescribes you for simple illnesses, too.\n\nDr. Donna Barsky of Texas Star Pharmacy told KTRH she saw it happen to a woman that was given an antibiotic for an infection.\n\n\u201cThey rejected her because she was seventy years old and she was given a minor antibiotic for a local infection,\u201d Barsky told KTRH.\n\nBarsky says that unfortunately it\u2019s not the first time she has seen this. And it won\u2019t be the last.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to see more of it, including with drugs that patients have been taking for decades,\u201d Barsky explained.\n\nAn even scarier prospect for patients is that the list of drugs that are covered change constantly.\n\n\u201cA drug that is covered today might not be covered next week,\u201d Barsky stated.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re taking drugs for a more serious illness it could become very costly if the drugs aren\u2019t covered under Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking several thousand dollars a year. Sometimes even in the tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the medication they are using,\u201d Barsky said.\n\n<PSI_END_OBJECT>And this isn't the only problem with prescription drugs under Obamacare. Barsky says all of your co-pays are going up under the law. In fact a new report revealed the average co pay is up 34%\n\n\u201cWe had one family come in and their co pay for generic drugs went from $10 to $30. For a trade name drug it went from $30 to $60,\u201d Barsky explained.\n\nAnd this veteran pharmacist says you are simply fed up.\n\n\u201cThey get very frustrated. They\u2019re diagnosed with something, given a prescription and the insurance company won\u2019t pay for it. We\u2019re back at ground zero,\u201d Barsky said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Will you be able to take drugs you\u2019ve been on for years?", "application-name": "KTRH", "og": {"site_name": "KTRH", "description": "Will you be able to take drugs you\u2019ve been on for years?", "title": "Obamacare Limiting Prescription Drug Coverage | KTRH", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2NvbnRlbnQuY2xlYXJjaGFubmVsLmNvbS9jYy1jb21tb24vbWxpYi83MDAvMDkvNzAwXzEyODUwMzE5MDUuanBn?ops=", "url": "http://www.ktrh.com/articles/houston-news-121300/obamacare-limiting-prescription-drug-coverage-12071202/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.ktrh.com", "description": "Will you be able to take drugs you\u2019ve been on for years?", "creator": "@ktrhnews", "url": "http://www.ktrh.com/articles/houston-news-121300/obamacare-limiting-prescription-drug-coverage-12071202/", "image": "http://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2NvbnRlbnQuY2xlYXJjaGFubmVsLmNvbS9jYy1jb21tb24vbWxpYi83MDAvMDkvNzAwXzEyODUwMzE5MDUuanBn?ops=", "title": "Obamacare Limiting Prescription Drug Coverage | KTRH", "site": "@ktrhnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "keywords": "obamacare, limiting, prescription, drug, coverage, houston news talk, houston weather, houston traffic, michael berry, matt patrick, glen beck, rush limbaugh, fox news, ktrh, 740.0, am, houston-galveston, tx, radio, listen, live, iheart, iheartradio, newstalk, houstons, news, wear, traffic, station", "fb": {"app_id": 107754932643325}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2NvbnRlbnQuY2xlYXJjaGFubmVsLmNvbS9jYy1jb21tb24vbWxpYi8xLzIwMTQvMDQvZGVmYXVsdC9uZXcta3RyaC1tYXN0aGVhZC1sb2dvXzBfMTM5ODMzODIzMC5wbmc=?ops=", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "thumbnail": "http://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2NvbnRlbnQuY2xlYXJjaGFubmVsLmNvbS9jYy1jb21tb24vbWxpYi83MDAvMDkvNzAwXzEyODUwMzE5MDUuanBn?ops=", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc950f\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare Limiting Prescription Drug CoverageWe already know that under Obamacare you can\u2019t necessarily keep your insurance plan or doctor, even if you like them.\nIt turns out that you also might not be able to keep using the prescription drugs you\u2019ve been taking for years.\n<PSI_END_OBJECT>And this isn't the only problem with prescription drugs under Obamacare.\nAnd if you\u2019re taking drugs for a more serious illness it could become very costly if the drugs aren\u2019t covered under Obamacare.\nThey\u2019re diagnosed with something, given a prescription and the insurance company won\u2019t pay for it."}
