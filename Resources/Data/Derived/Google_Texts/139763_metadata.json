He never had his chance, until now \u2013 a chance brought about by the sudden unexpected retirement of Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-Pa.) after 12 years in office.\n\nCostello has worked as a municipal attorney since graduating in 2002. He has also served in successive elected positions in his native Chester County, the fastest growing county in suburban Philadelphia, including his current role as chairman of the Chester County Board of Commissioners.\n\nThe 37-year-old lives with his wife and son in West Chester and would be the youngest member of Pennsylvania\u2019s Congressional delegation should he win in November.\n\nHis chances of achieving his dream seem very likely, considering the incumbent won the district in 2012 with 57 percent of the vote. The Cook Political Report puts the district in the \u201cLeans Republican\u201d category.\n\nCostello says his brand of conservatism is issue-oriented and driven by a desire to think outside of the box rather than getting stuck behind partisan talking points. Polls show the sort of partisan rancor that has become a staple in American politics in recent years has become a turnoff for younger voters.\n\n\u201cI have a reputation for being very authentic, which is to say that I say pretty much what I\u2019m thinking,\u201d Costello explains to Red Alert Politics. \u201cI think that keeps people listening a little bit longer than they would of a typical politician. Once you hear a few talking points you tune out, and, again, I think for myself.\u201d\n\nYou may not agree with everything everyone says, Costello notes, but it\u2019s still important to make them feel heard. Doing so makes a candidate or elected official more informed and better able to get his message across, Costello thinks.\n\nCostello argues that a taking a listening approach to politics increases interest among the electorate because \u201cyou might just say something that\u2019s just a little bit different.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you need to be a little bit unpredictable, but it\u2019s something that\u2019s got to be well-reasoned,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I think the next generation of voters, and frankly, all voters are really interested in.\u201d\n\nHe is critical of the GOP\u2019s inability to articulate its ideas without getting defined by the Democrats and their media allies. Republicans have a lot of great ideas when it comes to helping all Americans and young people in particular, but their message gets lost, he says.\n\n\u201cThe response to the unfair criticisms is either ignored, or instead it\u2019s lost in the attack that the other political party is doing,\u201d Costello says. \u201cThey are not good at explaining why the criticism or the allegation is not accurate.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with the one that the Republican Party is \u2018the party of the rich,\u2019\u201d Costello continued. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the Republican Party is \u2018the party of the rich\u2019 for the following reason: Less regulation, a simpler tax code and reforming health care in a way that doesn\u2019t cost younger Americans more means that you are going to have a better environment for people to get jobs.\u201d\n\nCostello argues that issues need to be explained in the simplest possible terms, and the rhetoric needs to avoid \u201cthe \u2018Gotcha!\u2019 predictable fiery rhetoric that oftentimes get political activists and politicians in trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitics is the art of persuasion and getting people to move to your position,\u201d Costello said. \u201cIf you are not open-minded, and you are not looking to persuade people in a respectful way then all you are doing is being a talking head. If I wanted to be a talking head, I\u2019d be in a different profession.\u201d\n\nIssues such as the future of Social Security and the negative impact of Obamacare on America are important to him. He is a proponent of reforming Social Security to keep it around for younger Americans who may never see a dime the way the way things are going.\n\nDemocrats have only demagogued the issue and refused to address any sort of meaningful reform that would keep it around for future generations in Costellos\u2019s opinion, which stands to harm young people in the long run.\n\nCostello also is worried about what Obamacare will do to younger workers and small businesses once the employer mandate is enforced.\n\n\u201cIf you are a 27-year-old living in the Philadelphia region, single and in good health, your premiums have jumped,\u201d Costello said. \u201cMeanwhile, the cost of college is going up; rents remain stable or are going up; the cost of living has gone up; the job market has been depressed, making it more difficult to get a job coming out of college.\n\n\u201cNow you have to pay for health care.\u201d\n\nSuch a situation is not fair to young people.\n\nRepublicans have the right ideas, he says. But now it\u2019s a matter of listening to where people are at and explaining those ideas in a way that people will listen.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Running for Congress has been a dream for Ryan Costello since he was in law school at Villanova University during the late \u201890s and early 2000s.
