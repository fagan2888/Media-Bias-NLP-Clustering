The seven representatives of the U.S. unit of Austrian firm Red Bull GmbH visited Cuba in June 2009, Treasuryâ€™s Office of Foreign Assets Control said.

The travel was approved by Red Bull North America management and the company took steps to conceal the transactions, OFAC said. The firm did then implement a sanctions compliance program in a remedial effort, the office said.

The sanctions office has recently settled a number of investigations involving Cuba travel. In recent months, Dutch travel company CWT B.V. and American International Group Inc. both agreed to settlements involving travel to the island.
