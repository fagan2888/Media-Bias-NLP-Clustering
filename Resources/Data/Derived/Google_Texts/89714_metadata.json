It celebrated its latest anniversary last Saturday and looks forward to many more.\n\nThe church is located in Lafayette Springs, and though its original congregation numbered right at 100 members, attendance now sits around 40.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t keep up with numbers like a lot of churches do. Between 40 and 70 members is pretty common for country churches,\u201d said the Rev. Steve Weaver. \u201cLafayette Springs was originally planned as a tourist destination. There used to be natural springs out here, but they dried up over time.\u201d\n\nThe present building was constructed in 1881, and still uses most of its original furnishings. It isn\u2019t much: a few wooden pews and a simple podium raised up on an eight-inch platform. There is no choir loft or pipe organ, no sound system or instruments. But to say the church lacks these things \u2013 that it needs them to be complete \u2013 wouldn\u2019t quite be true.\n\n\u201cOur services are simple,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cOur music is congregational singing only. Not many of us sing well, but when we blend together, we\u2019re all right. We feel like it\u2019s pretty close to the same way the apostles did it.\u201d\n\nWeaver said ministering to such a small flock has its advantages. For one, the Sunday service structure allows an hour for prayer requests. Everyone gets heard, Weaver said, during service.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very personal. If one of mine misses, I know it. I truly believe scripture teaches that a preacher is called by God to shepherd his flock, and that God will hold us accountable for that,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI know every problem they have. It\u2019s humbling.\u201d\n\nMembers also offer their input on church decisions. Everything is voted on and must be agreed on unanimously.\n\n\u201cIf the vote comes out 98 to 2, we ask those other two to concede,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cThey usually do, but not always.\u201d\n\nOne of the few changes to the church is the plaque outside honoring former pastor the Rev. E.D. McCutcheon, who preached at Laodicea B.C. from 1949 to 2002. It bears scripture from Jeremiah 6:16, which reads, \u201cStand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe left such a legacy,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cSo many preachers came up under him.\u201d\n\nWeaver is no exception. He came to ministry in 1992, and served as an elder at Laodicea B.C. for four years before becoming pastor. He was intimidated by the idea of preaching, and he\u2019d kept his burden for the pulpit to himself for the most part.\n\n\u201cWhen I met with the deacons I told them, \u2018I\u2019m not McCutcheon.\u2019 God gives everyone different gifts. I\u2019m a very cut and dry person. I tend to lay it all out plain as I can, and if there\u2019s a disagreement, we can sit down and talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were good to me and I felt right at home.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d be surprised what a small but dedicated congregation can do, Weaver said. His congregation contributes to two orphanages and three churches in Africa, along with two churches in the Philippines.\n\n\u201cThey take care of the community, too,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cMost people don\u2019t want sound doctrine. They want feel-good doctrine. I can honestly say we try to do what the Lord has asked us to do. We understand that the things of this world, and what\u2019s going on in it, have nothing to do with the kingdom of God.\u201d\n\nAccording to Weaver, Primitive Baptists were originally called \u201cRegular\u201d Baptists. When a sect wanted to expand mission work to foreign countries, they changed some of the doctrine to make it more palatable, and these changes were what split the church.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the original mold of Baptists. They called us \u2018hard shells\u2019 at first,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cWe\u2019re about the \u2018shalls\u2019 in scripture. If God allowed 70 scholars to come together, compile the cannon of the King James Bible and agree on the result, the spirit was in it. The Bible says not to add to or take from the scriptures. God himself says, \u2018I am God and I change not.\u2019\u201d\n\nriley.manning@journalinc.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Riley Manning Daily Journal LAFAYETTE SPRINGS \u2013 They don\u2019t make them like they used to \u2013 churches, that is \u2013 but the old way has served Laodicea Primitive Baptist Church well for the past 175 years.
