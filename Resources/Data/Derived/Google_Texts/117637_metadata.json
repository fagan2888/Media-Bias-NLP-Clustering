Immelt, G.E.\u2019s chief executive, has described the strategy as a historic \u201cpivot.\u201d And in a morning conference call with analysts, he invoked the term again and pointed to the company\u2019s fourth-quarter performance as evidence that the plan was succeeding.\n\nSome crucial measures beyond top-line sales and profit also showed the progress, despite an uncertain global economy, weakness in some product lines and a stronger dollar. For example, so-called organic growth in its industrial business, which excludes the effect of acquisitions, grew by 9 percent to $32.2 billion. And the profit margins in G.E.\u2019s industrial operations, helped by cost-cutting initiatives, continue to improve, rising by half a percentage point to 18.8 percent.\n\n\u201cOver all, G.E. is doing the things it said it would,\u201d said Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein Research.\n\nG.E.\u2019s results were helped by improving industrial demand in the United States, which is the company\u2019s largest single market, accounting for just under 45 percent of revenue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe American market for G.E. products, Mr. Immelt said, was \u201cthe best we\u2019ve seen since the financial crisis.\u201d\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, G.E.\u2019s net income jumped 61 percent, to $5.2 billion. But the percentage increase was so large only because the year-earlier quarter included a charge of nearly $1.8 billion for payments related to a consumer finance business in Japan that G.E. had sold off.\n\nThe company\u2019s operating earnings per share rose 6 percent to 56 cents. That result was slightly above the average estimate of analysts of 55 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe company\u2019s quarterly revenue rose 4 percent to $42 billion, which was just below the Wall Street consensus of $42.1 billion. A stronger American currency, which reduces the dollar-denominated value of goods sold abroad, trimmed G.E.\u2019s reported revenue by $600 million in the quarter.\n\nG.E. has pursued a strategy of paring back its big finance unit, GE Capital, and expanding its industrial business since the financial crisis. The company is on track to reach its goal of cutting the earnings contribution from its finance arm to a quarter of the corporate total by next year, down from nearly half.\n\nG.E. has returned to its roots as a manufacturer of industrial equipment including jet engines, gas turbines, locomotives and medical-imaging equipment. Its biggest move to date, agreeing to buy the energy-generation business of Alstom of France, came last year in a transaction that is expected to close by July, Mr. Immelt said.\n\nThe steep drop in oil prices, G.E. executives warned, will hit profits over the course of 2015. The company\u2019s division selling equipment for oil and gas drilling and production generated $18.7 billion in revenue in 2014 and about 15 percent of the earnings from G.E.\u2019s industrial business.\n\nEquipment orders typically trail oil-price movements by six to 12 months, so the impact was muted in the fourth quarter. Revenue from G.E.\u2019s oil and gas business declined 6 percent, to $5 billion, with operating profits rising 1 percent, to $814 million.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut G.E. expects things to get worse for its oil and gas unit as the year proceeds, said Jeffrey S. Bornstein, the company\u2019s chief financial officer. But that division\u2019s management, he said, is moving swiftly to contain costs as demand deteriorates and that the problem should be \u201cmanageable.\u201d\n\nYet investors and analysts are skeptical. \u201cIt\u2019s still a significant concern,\u201d said Mr. Winoker of Bernstein. The company\u2019s shares have fallen 4.6 percent in the last six months, though they were up 1.9 percent, to $24.75, in afternoon trading on Friday.\n\nG.E.\u2019s broad portfolio of industrial businesses should help to offset the falloff in orders for oil and gas equipment. G.E.\u2019s aviation business, which makes and services jet engines, and reported revenue of $24 billion last year, stands to gain from lower oil prices. When fuel prices drop, analysts say, airlines tend to use those savings to buy more aircraft \u2014 and consumers with more cash in their pockets travel more.\n\nG.E.\u2019s health care business is picking up in the United States, after being weak for a couple of years. Orders for the company\u2019s medical-imaging equipment increased 9 percent in the American market in the fourth quarter. Hospital administrators, it seems, have learned enough about the likely impact of the Affordable Care Act to formulate plans and move ahead with investments again.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150123073653, "twitter": {"description": "As the company returns to its roots as a maker of industrial products like jet engines and medical equipment, it has pared back its finance arm.", "title": "G.E.
