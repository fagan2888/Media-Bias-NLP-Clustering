For instance, Tauzin was influential in killing attempts to allow the reimportation of pharmaceuticals at lower prices or to let Medicare negotiate with drug companies for lower prices \u2014 both unsuccessful Clinton-era proposals that resurfaced in 2006.\n\nWhile Tauzin is cast as the arch villain, Republicans, Democrats and presidents George W. Bush and Obama are all targets in the piece.\n\nThe authors overarching concern seems to be that the rising cost of drugs will put treatment out of reach for all but the wealthiest and that the United States is light years behind the rest of the world when it comes to putting reins on what drug companies can charge.\n\nThey also express healthy skepticism at Big Pharma's arguments that price controls will curb research and development by pointing out that a large portion of R & D is done through taxpayer-funded programs at colleges and universities.\n\nThe heart of the problem is politics, they write, pointing out that within three years of Bush signing into law Medicare drug benefit legislation that left a gaping hole in Part D coverage \"at least 15 members of Congress, congressional staffers and administration officials who had played a role in the bill's passage had left office and joined the pharmaceutical industry.\"\n\nTauzin was one of them.\n\nRead the excerpt here.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Billy Tauzin, drugs, health, homepage, news, politics", "title": "New book targets former Rep.
