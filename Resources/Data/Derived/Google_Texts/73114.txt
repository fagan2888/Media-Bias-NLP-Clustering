BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) - The state Game and Fish Department is looking for help in identifying bald eagle nests in North Dakota.

Conservation biologist Sandra Johnson says the agency is looking for locations of nests with eagles present. She says it’s easy to distinguish an eagle nest because of its enormous size, and eagles are actively tending to eggs or their young in April.

Eagle nests historically have been found along the Missouri River. But in recent years they’ve been observed in more than three-quarters of the state’s counties, near streams and lakes and in rural shelterbelts.

Johnson estimates North Dakota has at least 170 active bald eagle nests.

Nest observations should be reported to Game and Fish at 701-328-6300, or by email at ndgf@nd.gov. Observers are asked to not disturb nests.
