America will mourn his departure, at least until Jeff Zucker gives him a CNN show. Who is hurt the most by Leno\u2019s ouster from \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d? Besides people with some sort of \u201ccelebrities in small cars\u201d fetish? It is, as Politico reports, Republicans.\n\nRepublicans, Hadas Gold explains, see the world of late night comedy as enemy territory. The jokesters have no respect for family values or deregulation. But Jay Leno\u2019s \u201cTonight Show\u201d was a friendly oasis, where a Republican senator or governor always felt welcome. Leno specialized in making politicians feel comfortable, as frequent talk show guest John McCain explains:\n\nCalling Leno his favorite late-night host, McCain said Leno would do little things like making sure there were cupcakes in the green room (McCain\u2019s favorite) or show the senator around his car collection. \u201cThat\u2019s just the kind of guy he is,\u201d McCain said. \u201cAnother reason I like him so much is he uses humor but he doesn\u2019t have the sharp edge that some others do, the kind of put-down that is popular with some others.\u201d\n\nCupcakes!\n\nThere are a few cute things about this comment from Sen. McCain. First, there is McCain\u2019s own well-documented proclivity for jokes predicated on, to use his elementary school-derived term, \u201cput-downs.\u201d Second, there is the fact that McCain was for years a favorite guest and welcome presence on both Letterman\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d and Jon Stewart\u2019s \u201cDaily Show\u201d (where he was for a time the most-frequent guest of all time) until his 2008 presidential campaign, when he suddenly stopped appearing on those shows. After McCain\u2019s canceling on Letterman at the last minute led to weeks of nightly excoriations by the irked host, McCain made a disastrous apology appearance, which helped to illustrate the actual reason politicians preferred Jay to Dave: Dave is actually a tough interviewer who doesn\u2019t accept bullshit. Letterman is easily the best interviewer of the current late night hosts, which is a better reason for politicians to avoid him than the partisan breakdown of the targets of his monologue jokes.
