Victoria Steele testified that she was a victim of sexual assault as a child, during a hearing in the State House Committee. The Federalism and States' Rights Committee went on to pass a bill that prohibits health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act from providing abortion coverage.\u201cThis bill would require women who are seeking an abortion after being traumatized by rape or incest to share personal, private and emotional information with an insurance company if they want coverage for the procedure. It will force victims to suffer another trauma. Telling my story today was difficult, and I have had years to deal with and recover from the incident. I can\u2019t imagine the position this legislation would put recent victims in if they attempt to get medical care,\u201d Steele said . \u201cAdditionally, this bill endangers doctors who provide a legal, medical service to women by making the doctors\u2019 personal information public. The bill is inappropriate on many levels. Politicians should not be creating laws that target women and doctors.\u201dThe committee also approved an amendment that requires abortion providers to tell women they have the option to reverse the effects of abortion medication in case they change their minds, The Associated Press reported.Supporters of SB 1318 , sponsored by Republican state Sen. Nancy Barto of Phoenix, say tax dollars shouldn't support abortionsFrom the Center for Arizona Policy, a conservative group that's been watching this bill like a hawk:Many others argue this is just another intrusion of conservative lawmakers into women's health care decisions and rights.The state Senate's Health and Human Services Committee passed the bill last month . It now moves to the House for a constitutional review.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "The Range Blog Post", "description": "This morning, State Rep.
