–Over the holidays, Real Time Economics will be running a selection of top themes for 2014 from economists around Asia. We kick off this series today:

Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economic research, HSBC, Hong Kong:

Investors are in a cheery mood. After all the turmoil of the past year, the hope is that 2014 is shaping up to be better: Tapering is out of the bag, stronger growth in the West should give a nice lift to Asian exports and China seems to be getting serious about reform.

Alas, we’ve been here before: For the past three years, markets expected faster growth than Asia delivered. Could it happen again?

Possibly. Risks are finely balanced. With the region’s growth already near a decade low, an even bigger slip-up – as many feared over the course of 2013 — doesn’t appear to be in the cards. On the other hand, a sharp pick-up also appears unlikely. More likely is that Asia will continue to deliver steady but disappointing growth in 2014.

My main themes for 2014:

–Inflation – or the lack thereof. A striking feature over the past two years, and one likely to become more pronounced in 2014, is the collapse in nominal GDP growth. While investors usually pin their attention on consumer inflation, which mostly has remained within central banks’ comfort ranges, broader price pressures have fallen rapidly. Excess capacity in some economies, along with sub-trend growth in most, is largely to blame.

This raises two problems. The first is that profit growth suffers. Over the past several years, margins have been squeezed amid slowing productivity gains. Capital spending could thus take a hit, curtailing GDP growth further even if, over the longer term, restrained investment should help restore corporate profitability. The second problem is financial: Slowing nominal GDP growth impairs the debt-servicing capacity of governments, households and companies alike. With leverage increasing sharply in recent years and growth still dependent on a further increase in debt, the risks are evident.

–Higher interest rates. Weaker cash flow and higher debt expose emerging Asia to a possible spike in funding costs. Markets have taken the Fed tapering decision well so far, buying the region more time to get its house in order before the actual tightening begins. The biggest risk to Asia is if unexpectedly strong U.S. economic performance forces the Fed to act more aggressively. Then, higher interest rates would not be offset, as optimists argue, by faster shipments: Right now, rates matter more to Asia than exports.

But it’s not all about the Fed. In China, interest rates have continued to climb in recent months, reflecting officials’ desire to restrain the build-up in debt. Even if the climb in market rates exaggerates the general rise in funding costs to some extent — not least because credit is shifting back to banks and away from more costly shadow financing — the process could present a headwind to more speculative parts of the economy. In India and Indonesia, too, officials may need to tweak rates higher if stubborn price pressures in the former, and the trade deficit in the latter, don’t show swift improvement.

–The role of Japan will prove critical in all of this. With the risk of higher interest rates posing challenges for the leverage cycle in emerging Asia, liquidity injected by the Japanese central bank should have a stabilizing effect. Expectations of surging capital flows to emerging Asia ran high after the BOJ’s surprise announcement last April that it would double its monetary base within two years. But between taper jitters and a soaring equity market at home, Japanese investors ultimately stayed quiet.

That likely will change during 2014, with Japanese banks already moving to expand market share in many ASEAN economies and foreign direct investment by Japanese manufacturers rising briskly. That could go a long way toward cushioning the region against higher dollar rates. But here, too, questions remain: An early disappointment with Abenomics could lead Japanese firms to scotch expansion plans, while BOJ liquidity may not be sufficient to offset another sharp jump in U.S. dollar funding costs. It’s a fine balance for emerging Asia.

–Politics, and the impact on the reform agenda. Slower economic growth, declining productivity growth and rising financial risks point to the need for far-reaching structural reforms to put Asia’s economies on a more sustainable path. This requires political determination. In India, Indonesia, and Thailand, however, looming elections may sap the appetite for reform. In Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, governments will need to reassure investors that hard choices will be tackled.

China, at last, has rolled out an impressive agenda and appears determined to press on. But this raises another risk: Not only does it take time for reforms to yield results, but their implementation can at first prove disruptive to growth. Cutting back on subsidies, scaling back excessive investment, raising the cost of funding and putting public financing on a sounder footing may initially retard growth before launching the economy toward a brighter future.

In short, 2014 may be the year when difficult decisions are finally taken. But don’t expect growth to surge ahead just yet.
