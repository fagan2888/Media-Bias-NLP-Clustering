Martin Luther King Jr. went to jail to focus national attention on the injustice of segregation, he was stung by criticism from Christian clergy who feared upsetting the status quo and urged \u201cmoderation,\u201d prompting his historic rejoinder from the Birmingham jail, as Rev. Howard Bess recalls.\n\nBy Rev. Howard Bess\n\nMartin Luther King Jr. was my contemporary, a person whom I supported in his demand for full inclusion of people of color in the life of America. Yet, as that history played out, I did not fully realize the greatness of King and the significance of the events of the late Fifties and the early Sixties.\n\nAs we look back on those events, there are an endless number of reasons why Dr. King\u2019s statue stands on the Tidal Basin across from the Jefferson Memorial in Washington DC \u2014 and why King\u2019s birthday is a national holiday.\n\nI have read his writings, and his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech is etched on my heart and mind. But I believe his letter to clergy, \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail,\u201d is his greatest communication articulating his cause and one of the great documents of American history.\n\nI marvel at the document because it was written from a jail cell where King had no access to reference materials. The date of the letter was April 16, 1963, when the modern civil rights movement for people of color was still relatively young, but the movement was becoming stronger and the opposition was becoming more entrenched.\n\nThe letter came from what was stored in King\u2019s maturing mind. He wrote on whatever scraps of paper he could find, addressing the letter to \u201cMy Dear Fellow Clergymen,\u201d a group of clergy who had written a letter to King to discourage his coming to Birmingham. These clergy counseled patience and moderation and questioned why King, as an \u201coutsider\u201d had come to their Alabama community.\n\nIn the letter, King wrote, \u201cWhile confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement calling my present activities \u2018unwise and untimely.\u2019\u201d Then, he responded by saying that Negroes had waited long enough and that \u201cmoderation\u201d was not useful in righting wrongs of segregation that had been inflicted on African-Americans over generations:\n\n\u201cI am in Birmingham because injustice is here. Just as the prophets of the eighth century B.C. left their villages and carried their \u2018thus saith the Lord\u2019 far beyond the boundaries of their home towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the gospel of freedom beyond my own home town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aid.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, King called not for moderation or patience but for non-violent and peaceful extremism, arguing that clergymen \u2014 the very people who should be at the forefront calling for justice in the name of Jesus \u2014 were betraying the Christian gospel by calling for moderation and gradualism. King wrote:\n\n\u201cWe know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was \u2018well timed\u2019 in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word \u2018Wait!\u2019 It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This \u2018Wait\u2019 has almost always meant \u2018Never.\u2019 We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights.\u201d\n\nDisappointing Churches\n\nKing\u2019s letter moves on to express his \u201cdisappointment with the churches.\u201d King was an ordained Baptist minister, the son and grandson of Baptist ministers. He had been nurtured and educated by churches and their institutions. He loved the churches, knew church history, and knew that movements to reform society and to deliver society from injustice many times had come from churches and clergy. He wrote:\n\n\u201cI must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro\u2019s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen\u2019s Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \u2018order\u2019 than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \u2018I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\u2019; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man\u2019s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \u2018more convenient season.\u2019\n\n\u201cShallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\n\n\u201cI must honestly reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church. I do not say this as one of those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church. I say this as a minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord of life shall lengthen.\n\n\u201cWhen I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery, Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be supported by the white church. I felt that the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the South would be among our strongest allies. Instead, some have been outright opponents, refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders; all too many others have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anesthetizing security of stained glass windows.\n\n\u201cIn spite of my shattered dreams, I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white religious leadership of this community would see the justice of our cause and, with deep moral concern, would serve as the channel through which our just grievances could reach the power structure. I had hoped that each of you would understand. But again I have been disappointed.\n\n\u201cI have traveled the length and breadth of Alabama, Mississippi and all the other southern states. On sweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at the South\u2019s beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have beheld the impressive outlines of her massive religious education buildings.\n\n\u201cOver and over I have found myself asking: \u2018What kind of people worship here? Who is their God? Where were their voices when the lips of Governor Barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification? Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred? Where were their voices of support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of creative protest?\u2019\n\n\u201cYes, these questions are still in my mind. In deep disappointment I have wept over the laxity of the church. But be assured that my tears have been tears of love. There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love.\u201d\n\nPinnacle of a Message\n\nMost reviewers of the life of Martin Luther King Jr. see his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech as the high point of his career. I beg to differ. Birmingham and the letter may have been the pinnacle of his career as he confronted not simply society but Christian churches and their clergy.\n\nThe Letter from Birmingham Jail was published in leading Christian publications and in the nation\u2019s most read newspapers. His confrontation with moderation was blunt yet gracious. Segregation and injustice were not his primary targets, rather he turned his searchlight of truth-telling on all those who took refuge in moderation.\n\nNot many of those clergy in Birmingham may have understood the significance of King\u2019s rejoinder, but a large part of the nation took note. Many believe that it was the Letter from Birmingham Jail that pushed President John F. Kennedy to initiate civil rights legislation.\n\nModeration in the face of injustice has been the great disease of Christian churches. The vast majority of Christian clergy are hiding behind the mission of saving souls while ignoring the social teachings of Jesus, the one they claim to serve as their Lord. These clergymen play the game of advocating the cause of social justice but only with great moderation.\n\nOn a related front, I have been involved in the struggle for full acceptance of people who are gay for over 40 years. I have taken my lumps because of my outspoken insistence that gay people be fully accepted in the life of our churches and in American society.\n\nI have been shunned, had employment disrupted and was dis-fellowshipped, not because I am gay but for speaking out about injustice toward gays. In recent years, however, full acceptance of gay people in America has made great progress, though we still have a long way to go.\n\nKind, loving, peaceful extremists for justice are in short supply in our nation and especially in our Christian churches.\n\nIn the Jan. 13 edition of Sports Illustrated, columnist Phil Taylor took on the National Football League for its tolerance of homophobia in the league. He cited the case of punter Chris Kluwe, formerly of the Minnesota Vikings. No one was suggesting that Kluwe is gay. He is, however, a vocal advocate of gay marriage and full rights for LGBT persons. His coach counseled him toward moderation. Even though he was identified as one of the league\u2019s best punters, Kluwe is now unemployed, a free agent.\n\nTaylor\u2019s column makes the case that the National Football League is homophobic from headquarters to owners, to coaches, to the locker room. Gay players (there are believed to be many) in the NFL will remain tightly closeted.\n\nJustice was a centerpiece of the life work of Jesus. As Americans we confess that justice is for all, even in the NFL. Yet, \u201cmoderates\u201d will never make the dream of justice-for-all a reality. It turns out that the path to hell is not paved with good intentions; it is paved with moderation.\n\nThe Rev. Howard Bess is a retired American Baptist minister, who lives in Palmer, Alaska.
