Insurance carriers that underwrite the entertainment industry may ground actor Harrison Ford from flying after his vintage airplane experienced engine trouble and crash-landed on a California golf course.

Ford, who was hospitalized with moderately serious injuries, was not working on a film production when the accident happened Thursday. The actor best known for his roles in the “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” films recently wrapped filming on “Star Wars: Episode VII” in the UK.

Nonetheless, underwriters are likely to closely scrutinize his flying hobby before agreeing to insure his next movie, insurance brokers and safety experts said.

“It will be stipulated in bold, black ink that he won’t be able to fly while he’s on the set,” said Angela Plasschaert, Los Angeles-based risk management consultant who works with film producers and insurance companies, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. “There wouldn’t be a sane person on the planet that would want to write that policy.”

As a hedge against losses, filmmakers buy a broad package of insurance that includes coverage for equipment and vehicles, props and sets as well as the costs of reshoots because of bad weather, defective film stock or even damage caused by computer viruses.

Then there is so-called cast coverage, which compensates producers for losses they incur because of an injury, illness or death of an actor.
