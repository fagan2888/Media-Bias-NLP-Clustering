They were able to get medical and dental coverage for $107 a month, a rate they said they were pleased with.\n\n\u201cWe would take whatever free programs there were \u2014 it wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d said Carmen Del Valle, a 47-year-old homemaker. \u201cThis is a relief.\u201d\n\nHealth insurance marketplace enrollment assistants say many people they\u2019re encountering are like the Del Valles \u2014 waiting until just before the March 31 deadline to sign up. They are also generally pleased with the rates they\u2019re getting.\n\nAntoinette Kraus, director of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, which has been helping to enroll people in the marketplace throughout the state, said about 80 percent of the people her organization has worked with have been able to get coverage for $100 or less a month.\n\nMy Lien Nguyen, a Bethlehem resident who has been volunteering to help people enroll, said most people she\u2019s assisted also have gotten good rates.\n\n\u201cIn general, they\u2019ve been pleased with the rates and pleased with the offerings,\u201d said Nguyen, who volunteers with the Reading-based organization Berks Encore. \u201cIn general, people are thrilled \u2014 you have people who haven\u2019t been covered in five years in some cases.\u201d\n\nMost have qualified for subsidies to help pay for the insurance, enrollment assistants said. People who earn up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 up to $45,000 for a single person and higher amounts for families \u2014 can obtain a subsidy.\n\nGet Covered America\u2019s New Jersey chapter estimates 85 percent of the people its workers have helped have qualified for subsidies, chapter spokeswoman Alescia Teel said.\n\n\u201cWe really want people to look at their options because a lot are receiving it,\u201d she said.\n\nPennsylvania enrollment assistants said their only real obstacle has been not being able to help residents who would have qualified for the Medicaid expansion had Gov. Tom Corbett allowed it. Corbett has applied to be able to use federal Medicaid dollars to subsidize commercial insurance for those who would have qualified but that plan has yet to be approved by the federal government.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people falling through the gap,\u201d said Cathy Cortijo, an outreach and enrollment specialist with the Neighborhood Health Centers of the Lehigh Valley.\n\nOne such woman was at an enrollment assistance session at the Bethlehem Area Public Library last week. The woman said she would have qualified for the Medicaid expansion but instead was offered a plan for $211 a month, an amount she couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nWilson Borough resident Lisa Smith wasn\u2019t sure if she also might fall into that gap. The unemployed 49-year-old has been twice rejected for Medicaid because she receives financial assistance from a friend. She attended an enrollment assistance session at Lehigh Carbon Community College\u2019s Allentown facility last week to see what she might qualify for.\n\n\u201cYou can see here a lot of people who need help,\u201d she said, referring to the crowd at LCCC. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have insurance and you go to the hospital, you\u2019re not getting the proper help you should be.\u201d\n\nThrough the end of February, 74,370 people in New Jersey and 159,821 in Pennsylvania had enrolled in the Health Insurance Marketplace. Another 123,000 in New Jersey had signed up under the Medicaid expansion.\n\nEnrollment has increased significantly in March, with 800,000 nationwide signing up through March 16, boosting overall enrollment over 5 million. President Barack Obama\u2019s goal had been to enroll 7 million by the end of the month.\n\nLocal enrollment assistants also are seeing a major increase in the last few weeks, they said. Cortijo said it\u2019s been nearly impossible to keep up with her voicemails, and she is almost booked solid through March 31.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t have health insurance by April 1 face an annual penalty of $95 or up to 1 percent of their taxable income, whichever is greater. Fines increase annually.\n\nFrancisca Collado narrowly avoided those fines. The 53-year-old Allentown woman signed up for health insurance Thursday at LCCC. She had been without it since moving to the Lehigh Valley from the Dominican Republic 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big relief because she knows now if she has to go to the emergency room or anything, there\u2019s nothing holding her back in terms of worrying about payments,\u201d said her daughter-in-law, Jennifer Collado.\n\nReporter Colin McEvoy contributed to this story.\n\n\n\n*****\n\n\n\nHow to enroll in the Health Insurance Marketplace:\n\nHealthcare.gov or call 800-318-2596\n\nPennsylvania residents can also get assistance by calling 855-486-9331.\n\nCognosante, a medical solutions services provider, is offering assistance enrollment sessions in Hunterdon, Warren and Sussex counties:\n\nPhillipsburg Free Public Library, 200 Broubalow Way, from 3 to 8 p.m. Monday and March 31\n\nHunterdon County Library, north branch, 65 Halstead St., Clinton, from noon to 5 p.m. Tuesday and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday\n\nHunterdon County Library, 314 Route 12, Flemington, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. March 31\n\nSussex County Community College, 1 College Hill Road, Newton, N.J., from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Wednesday\n\nGetCoveredAmerica.org also has information on enrollment events.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act,allentown,bethlehem,cognosante,health insurance marketplace,neighborhood health centers of the lehigh valley,news poll,obamacare,pennsylvania health access network,wilson borough", "title": "Health insurance enrollment picks up in Lehigh Valley as deadline nears", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Health insurance enrollment picks up in Lehigh Valley as deadline nears\", \"link\": \"http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/breaking-news/index.ssf/2014/03/health_insurance_marketplace_e.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.lehighvalleylive.com/home/lvlive-media/width620/img/express-times/photo/2014/03/14538353-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12485880\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-23T12:15:59Z\", \"author\": \"Lynn Olanoff | The Express-Times\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@topstories\",\"affordable care act\",\"allentown\",\"bethlehem\",\"cognosante\",\"health insurance marketplace\",\"neighborhood health centers of the lehigh valley\",\"news poll\",\"obamacare\",\"pennsylvania health access network\",\"wilson borough\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.lehighvalleylive.com/express-times/photo/2014/03/14538353-small.jpg", "creator": "@LynnOlanoff", "site": "@lehighvalley", "card": "summary", "description": "Obamacare enrollment assistants say many people they're seeing a lot of people waiting until just before the March 31 deadline to sign up and are generally pleased with the rates they're getting."}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, March 23, 2014,  9:19 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.lehighvalleylive.com/express-times/photo/2014/03/14538353-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"lolanoff\", \"author_nickname\": \"Lynn Olanoff | The Express-Times\", \"author_id\": \"1953\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Lehigh Valley Breaking News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/breaking-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "lehighvalleylive.com", "description": "Obamacare enrollment assistants say many people they're seeing a lot of people waiting until just before the March 31 deadline to sign up and are generally pleased with the rates they're getting.", "title": "Health insurance enrollment picks up in Lehigh Valley as deadline nears", "url": "http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/breaking-news/index.ssf/2014/03/health_insurance_marketplace_e.html", "image": "http://media.lehighvalleylive.com/design/alpha/img/logo_lvlive.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "lehighvalleylive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, March 23, 2014,  8:00 AM", "article_author": "Lynn Olanoff | The Express-Times", "Description": "Obamacare enrollment assistants say many people they're seeing a lot of people waiting until just before the March 31 deadline to sign up and are generally pleased with the rates they're getting."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7a3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is a relief.\u201dHealth insurance marketplace enrollment assistants say many people they\u2019re encountering are like the Del Valles \u2014 waiting until just before the March 31 deadline to sign up.\nShe attended an enrollment assistance session at Lehigh Carbon Community College\u2019s Allentown facility last week to see what she might qualify for.\n*****How to enroll in the Health Insurance Marketplace:Healthcare.gov or call 800-318-2596Pennsylvania residents can also get assistance by calling 855-486-9331.\nOne such woman was at an enrollment assistance session at the Bethlehem Area Public Library last week.\nThe 53-year-old Allentown woman signed up for health insurance Thursday at LCCC."}
