In the prairie chicken\u2019s case, regulators listed the bird after determining not enough landowners and companies operating in its territory had enrolled in a voluntary protection program.\n\nAn oil and gas association challenged the listing in federal court, arguing the voluntary program would have done enough to protect the bird.\n\nThe court ruled that the FWS should have better predicted how many people would participate in the protection program before moving forward with an Endangered Species Act listing.\n\n\u201cThe Court finds FSW did conduct an analysis,\u201d U.S. District Judge Robert Junell wrote in a decision released Tuesday, \u201chowever this analysis was neither \u2018rigorous\u2019 nor valid as FWS failed to consider important questions and material information necessary to make a proper \u2026 evaluation.\u201d\n\nThe endangered status of the prairie chicken is contentious, with Republicans and some industries arguing that protections for the bird are too burdensome for the energy sector.\n\nOklahoma lawmakers looked to attach a provision to this year\u2019s defense authorization bill blocking its re-listing under the ESA until at least 2021.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. District Court decision ruled that by listing the Lesser Prairie Chicken as threatened, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been illegally steamrolling states by their own secret rules,\u201d Rep.
