PHILADELPHIA, Pa. — Say what you will about oddball millionaire Chen Guangbiao — the man has a knack for publicity stunts.

Within China, he has made a name for himself as a sort of homegrown Donald Trump. Though not China’s richest man (he has an estimated $740 million net worth from his recycling businesses), Chen has commanded outsize attention by staging grandiose, sometimes ridiculous displays of his wealth, generosity, and keen instinct for the spotlight.

In 2008, after the devastating Sichuan earthquake, he donated $15 million for reconstruction — and held a photo shoot in which he asked survivors to brandish bundles of cash he had given them.

In 2012, during anti-Japanese riots, Chen bought 43 Chinese-made cars for people whose Japanese-branded cars had been smashed. At the event, he wore a lime-green suit and leapt on the roofs of the cars, which had been specially covered with red carpet.

In 2013, during the nadir of Beijing’s noxious winter smog, he began selling cans of air plastered with his face and offered in “flavors” such as “post-industrial Taiwan.”

Now, in the midst of tensions between foreign journalists and the Chinese, Chen claims he wants to buy the crown jewel of American media — The New York Times.

He declared his plans on Monday at a media awards ceremony in Shenzhen, saying he would soon be flying to New York City “to discuss the acquisition of The New York Times.”

Chinese media reported that he intended to fly to New York City on Friday and then “have dinner with a middle-level leader from The New York Times on Sunday.”

Asked about Chen’s supposed meeting with a Times executive, a company spokeswoman saidthat “We have no information about any such meeting.”
