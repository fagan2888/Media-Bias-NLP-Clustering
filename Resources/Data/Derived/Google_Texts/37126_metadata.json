But we need to say it anyway.\n\nWe stand up for our fellow journalists. We stand up for free speech.\n\nWe denounce those who killed in their opposition to free speech, in the name of religious extremism.\n\nNous sommes Charlie. We are Charlie.\n\nCharlie Hebdo has been a frequent target. Its office was firebombed in 2011. Its editor, who was killed Wednesday along with nine other journalists and two police officers, lived under a constant threat \u2014 and with police protection.\n\nSome commentators have said that the newspaper crossed the line with its satire, that it wasn\u2019t tasteful \u2014 or smart \u2014 to continue to poke as it did at Islam, or any other religion. The view isn\u2019t quite \u201cthey asked for it\u201d but it\u2019s pretty close.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear that much of what Charlie Hebdo published wouldn\u2019t see the light of day in an American publication. It would be considered inappropriate or obscene.\n\nBut the concept of free speech must allow it. The quote \u201cI disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it\u201d \u2014 attributed to Voltaire but actually written by his biographer, Evelyn Beatrice Hall \u2014 is cited so often that it has almost become a cliche, but it\u2019s still valid.\n\nWe fight offensive ideas and words with other ideas and words, not with bullets.\n\nThe attacks aren\u2019t limited to Charlie Hebdo. Around the world, journalists and commentators are under threat \u2014 by radical Islamic extremists and by other groups and individuals who seek to intimidate and enact a twisted sense of revenge through violence.\n\nIn the end, we stand with our colleagues who, under much more difficult circumstances than we face in America, are simply trying to do their jobs, armed with the freedom of speech and freedom of the press that are unalienable rights.\n\nWe will defend those rights.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1BP2x3b", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "We can\u2019t let those who respond with violence win.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "We can\u2019t let those who respond with violence win.", "title": "Editorial: We stand with Charlie Hebdo on free speech", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/01/11/editorial-stand-charlie-hebdo-free-speech/21553821/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We can\u2019t let those who respond with violence win.", "title": "Editorial: We stand with Charlie Hebdo on free speech", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/00f0e516adaa615cf08d9eb35e4ff608262becc9/c=350-0-1780-1430&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2015/01/10/B9315816708Z.1_20150110124436_000_GI69KU0RH.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@postcrescent", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc26c\"", "article_summary": "Clay Bennett, Chattanooga Times Free Press (Photo: Chattanooga Times Free Press)It should go without saying that we stand up for the victims of the attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.\nIt\u2019s also clear that much of what Charlie Hebdo published wouldn\u2019t see the light of day in an American publication.\nWe denounce those who killed in their opposition to free speech, in the name of religious extremism.\nWe stand up for free speech.\nBut the concept of free speech must allow it."}
