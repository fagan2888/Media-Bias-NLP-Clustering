Gawker revealed that Andrew Roberts, the New York Times Book Review\u2019s choice to review the authorized biography of Henry Kissinger, had in fact been Kissinger\u2019s original choice to write the authorized biography.\n\nRoberts also was a long-time friend of Niall Ferguson, the man who Kissinger wound up choosing to write his authorized biography. Roberts and Ferguson had even written a lengthy chapter together in a volume of essays edited by Ferguson. Worse yet: Roberts had revealed almost none of these involvements \u2014 with Ferguson, with Kissinger \u2014 to the New York Times when it asked him to write the review.\n\nSo unseemly were these entanglements, and the lack of transparency about them, that Margaret Sullivan, the New York Times public editor, felt called upon to rap the paper\u2019s knuckles. Which prompted a further back and forth between Sullivan and Pamela Paul, the editor of the Times Book Review. While the back-scratching world of book reviews in the New York Times is an old topic \u2014 unlike other publications, the Times purports to be objective and untainted by personal connections, and its reviews help promote or kill books \u2014 this scandal brought it into especially sharp relief.\n\nThe person who revealed the scandal in Gawker was Greg Grandin, an NYU historian and winner of multiple academic and literary prizes. Grandin has his own book out on Kissinger, \u201cKissinger\u2019s Shadow,\u201d which was reviewed by the Times the same day that Ferguson\u2019s bio was.\n\nBy coincidence, I was scheduled to interview Grandin at the Brooklyn Public Library on the day his review came out. I was thrilled by the prospect. (Full disclosure: Grandin and I are long-time friends. Just in case you thought the personal dimensions of this story couldn\u2019t get any gummier.)\n\nA lot of Kissinger commentary focuses on a simple-minded opposition between two traditions of U.S. foreign policy: the realist tradition, which is hard-headed about power, human rights, and America\u2019s ability to do good in the world; and the idealist tradition, which believes the U.S. should promote freedom and democracy around the globe.\n\nGrandin shows how irrelevant that debate is. His Kissinger is neither a realist nor an idealist; his Kissinger is a \u201cpolitical existentialist.\u201d And where sentimentalists look back on Kissinger\u2019s reign as a time when wise men governed, Grandin shows that there\u2019s a direct link between the insanity of Bush\u2019s Iraq War \u2014 and Obama\u2019s endless wars \u2014 and Kissinger\u2019s insanity in Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa.\n\nBeyond the novel interpretation Grandin offers of Kissinger, his book is a literary triumph, a marriage of style and substance that\u2019s rare in books on U.S. foreign policy. Grandin\u2019s chapter on the deeply troubled and personal relationship between Kissinger and Daniel Ellsberg reads like the opening act of a John Adams opera. Grandin manages to take a serious topic \u2014 the fantastically strange, and unnerving, worldview of Henry Kissinger \u2014 and make it funny. Kissinger\u2019s Shadow is like Dr. Strangelove, but on paper. It shows you how scary Kissinger\u2019s reign truly was, but never lets you forget the farce that was the man.\n\nWhat follows is an edited transcript of our interview at the Brooklyn Public Library.\n\nThere\u2019ve been many books about Henry Kissinger, including critical treatments by Christopher Hitchens and Seymour Hersh. Why do we need another book?\n\nKissinger is an outsized personality, and in these other books, he tends to outstrip the context. You learn much about Kissinger, but not so much about the national security state that he exemplifies. My book sees in Kissinger the workings of the larger system, the longer arc of post-war U.S. foreign policy.\n\nBut I want to also take on the notion that Kissinger is a foreign policy realist, that he\u2019s opposed to the idealist strain of U.S. foreign policy. Kissinger is supposed to think the U.S. should only get into battles it knows it can win, and should only do so in defense of its interests, not its ideals. That notion of Kissinger the realist is often juxtaposed with the adventurism of the neoconservatives who drove us into Iraq. I think that\u2019s a misrecognition of Kissinger, and my book shows how.\n\nPicking up on that, if there\u2019s a through-line in the book, it\u2019s the senior thesis Kissinger wrote when he was at Harvard in the late 1940s. Tell us about this thesis, and why it\u2019s so important to you?\n\nHe submitted it in 1950. It was the longest thesis in Harvard\u2019s history. In fact, it supposedly prompted the creation of the \u201cKissinger rule,\u201d where you aren\u2019t allowed to submit an undergraduate thesis longer than 200 pages.\n\nHow long was it?\n\nFour hundred pages.\n\nYou did say he was outsized.\n\nIt was a meditation on European philosophers and historians: Oswald Spengler, Immanuel Kant and Arnold Toynbee. Its title was \u201cThe Meaning of History,\u201d and it reflected its historical moment. It has a strong flavour of post-war existentialism. You read it and you think of Sartre: the idea that life is meaningless, has no purpose, that there\u2019s an emptiness to the universe, that there\u2019s no moral order. But, like Sartre, Kissinger also believed that individuals could act freely and that that the best way to achieve freedom was to accept that meaninglessness and emptiness of history. What\u2019s interesting about that thesis is that you can see how Kissinger refers back to it throughout the years and in all of his critiques of how U.S. foreign policy was practiced.\n\nYou say he\u2019s a subjective irrationalist, a political existentialist. What does that mean?\n\nKissinger says that the past is a series of meaningless events and it is we in the present who impose order on the past by our present concerns. He rejects any and all forms of determinism. He also insists that there is a range of possibilities for action, that there is freedom.\n\nThis influences his ideas about diplomacy. The responsibility of statesmen is to recognize that they have freedom to move, they shouldn\u2019t be constrained by the past, they shouldn\u2019t let the past be a prison house of the present. He also believes \u2014 and this is where he links up to neoconservatism \u2014 that action creates meaning, and that we \u2014 states, statesmen, diplomats \u2014 don\u2019t know our interests until we act in the world.\n\nThere\u2019s a circularity to Kissinger\u2019s thought. Kissinger often is held up as somebody who believes states should act out of a strong sense of interest and purpose. A constant critique that he makes of whatever the current administration happens to be is that it knows how to project power but doesn\u2019t know why it is projecting power. But if you start to peel back the layers and get at what he means by purpose, there\u2019s no \u201cthere\u201d there. Ultimately, he believes we have to project power to create purpose and that our purpose is to project power. And that\u2019s a circularity that I think is the motor force of American expansionism.\n\nAgain, a traditional realist is someone who believes that there are limits to power and that states have interests, and that have have to operate within those limits to secure those interests. You show that Kissinger has an animus to what underlies that view: namely, cause and effect. He doesn\u2019t really believe that there are causes in the world that affect things.\n\nAfter the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kissinger has this great line: \u201cThere are two kinds of realists. One that observes reality and responds to it, and the other that makes reality.\u201d And what the West needs is the latter. That view was echoed by Karl Rove when he was in the Bush administration: \u201cWe\u2019re an empire now and when we act, we create reality.\u201d\n\nThis is all in the undergraduate thesis; he explicitly rejects the idea of cause and effect, of causality. We can\u2019t think of the present as the cumulative effect of past actions because the past didn\u2019t cause the present, because nothing causes anything. So you can\u2019t allow the past to determine or even shape what you do in the present; you can dispense with the past.\n\nYou can see that idea with someone like Cheney, who will look at Iraq today and say, \u201cLook, we can debate what we did twelve or thirteen years ago, whether we were right or wrong. But there\u2019s a crisis now, and we have to act now to solve that crisis.\u201d That\u2019s Kissingerism: statesmen shouldn\u2019t let yesterday\u2019s catastrophe get in the way of today\u2019s bold action.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He was a mad man, not a realist.
