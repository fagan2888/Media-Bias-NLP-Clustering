That hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nMr. Brady said the numbers cited by HHS don\u2019t refer to people who are paying their premiums yet, so the topline enrollment number will drop off.\n\nThe chairman also chided Mrs. Burwell for failing to turn over documents that outline her agency\u2019s justification for funding Obamacare\u2019s cost-sharing program without explicit approval from Congress.\n\nMrs. Burwell said program payments were permanently authorized by part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHer aides are working to produce what Congress wants, she said, although the dispute is tied up in federal court.\n\n\u201cI think you know this is a matter where the House of Representatives is suing the department and myself,\u201d Mrs. Burwell said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's top health official told Congress Wednesday that Obamacare is making \"historic\" strides, even if 2016 enrollment on its web-based exchanges amounted to little more than half of what budget scorekeepers initially projected.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s top health official told Congress Wednesday that Obamacare is making \u201chistoric\u201d strides, even if 2016 enrollment on its web-based exchanges amounted to little more than half of what budget scorekeepers initially projected.", "title": "HHS: Look at uninsured rate, not Obamacare signups", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/10/hhs-look-uninsured-rate-not-obamacare-signups/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/10/HHS_Budget.JPEG-029fa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/10/HHS_Budget.JPEG-029fa.jpg", "description": "President Obama's top health official told Congress Wednesday that Obamacare is making \"historic\" strides, even if 2016 enrollment on its web-based exchanges amounted to little more than half of what", "card": "summary", "title": "HHS: Look at uninsured rate, not Obamacare signups"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Congress, Sylvia Mathews Burwell"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think you know this is a matter where the House of Representatives is suing the department and myself,\u201d Mrs. Burwell said.\nMrs. Burwell said program payments were permanently authorized by part of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe chairman also chided Mrs. Burwell for failing to turn over documents that outline her agency\u2019s justification for funding Obamacare\u2019s cost-sharing program without explicit approval from Congress.\n\u201cThis is the first time in our nation\u2019s history that this has been true,\u201d Mrs. Burwell told the Ways and Means Committee at a hearing to discuss President Obama\u2019s fiscal 2017 budget request.\n\u201cPoor enrollment results show Americans just aren\u2019t buying what the president\u2019s selling on this law,\u201d Mr. Brady, Texas Republican, said."}
