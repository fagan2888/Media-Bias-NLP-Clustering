He said the U.S. would send additional troops to Iraq to advise local groups fighting the extremists. And he also touted new involvement from \"allies and partners\" in the fight against ISIS.\n\n\"This week, Arab nations agreed to strengthen their support for the new Iraqi government and to do their part in the fight against [ISIS], including aspects of the military campaign,\" he said. \"Saudi Arabia will join the effort to help train and equip moderate Syrian opposition forces. And retired Marine Gen. John Allen -- who during the Iraq war worked with Sunnis in Iraq as they fought to reclaim their communities from terrorists -- will serve as our special envoy to help build and coordinate our growing coalition.\"\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry has been jet-setting throughout the region this week to corral support from Arab Gulf states and other regional partners to help defuse the threat posed by ISIS.\n\nBack home, Congress is already knee-deep in negotiations on a proposal that would give the president authority to equip and train the moderate Syrian rebel groups. Democratic and Republican leaders have advised their rank-and-file to support the president's request. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, for example, said Thursday that it's \"important we give the president what he's asking for.\"\n\n\"The issue here is about defeating a terrorist threat that is real and imminent,\" Boehner said.\n\nThe president said Saturday that U.S. intelligence services have \"not yet detected specific [ISIS] plots against our homeland,\" but he noted that ISIS leaders \"have repeatedly threatened the United States.\"\n\n\"If left unchecked, these terrorists could pose a growing threat beyond the Middle East, including to the United States,\" he said. \"So we're staying vigilant.\"\n\nU.S. officials are particularly concerned about the thousands of foreign fighters who have flocked to Iraq and Syria to join ISIS' cause. Officials estimate that ISIS can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 foreign fighters -- an increase from a previous estimate of roughly 10,000. Of those thousands, over a hundred may be Americans. The fear is that those individuals may evade detection and return home, battle-hardened and ready to attack the U.S.\n\nDespite the expansion of the U.S. campaign against ISIS, Mr. Obama pledged to \"avoid the mistakes of the past,\" effectively ruling out the commitment of American troops to a combat role in the conflict.\n\n\"American military power is unmatched, but this can't be America's fight alone,\" he said. \"And the best way to defeat a group like [ISIS] isn't by sending large numbers of American combat forces to wage a ground war in the heart of the Middle East. That wouldn't serve our interests. In fact, it would only risk fueling extremism even more.\"\n\nIn the weekly Republican address Saturday, Arizona congressional candidate Andy Tobin condemned Democrats for \"overregulation\" and deficit spending, saying it's time to \"restore the balance of power for hardworking taxpayers.\"\n\nTobin, the speaker of the Arizona House, also stressed the imperative of repealing Obamacare, warning of insurance rate hikes and people losing access to their longtime doctors.\n\nTobin said that House Republicans are making a \"good-faith\" effort to advance ideas to help the middle class but Senate Democrats \"won't give them a vote.\"\n\n\"They're more worried about losing their Senate majority than the concerns of the American people,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President details America&#039;s expanded military mission against jihadists with Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in his weekly address", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-vows-relentless-fight-against-isis-in-iraq-and-syria/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/09/13/d041ff1e-1065-44c3-913d-9f1de7b30df0/thumbnail/1200x630/de2a8c794e0a4b7db8918041199743f4/satmo091314isis276728640x360.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "President details America's expanded military mission against jihadists with Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in his weekly address", "title": "Obama vows \"relentless\" fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria"}, "twitter": {"description": "President details America's expanded military mission against jihadists with Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in his weekly address", "title": "Obama vows \"relentless\" fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/obama-vows-relentless-fight-against-isis-in-iraq-and-syria/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/obama-vows-relentless-fight-against-isis-in-iraq-and-syria/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-vows-relentless-fight-against-isis-in-iraq-and-syria/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/09/13/d041ff1e-1065-44c3-913d-9f1de7b30df0/thumbnail/1200x630/de2a8c794e0a4b7db8918041199743f4/satmo091314isis276728640x360.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-vows-relentless-fight-against-isis-in-iraq-and-syria/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/obama-vows-relentless-fight-against-isis-in-iraq-and-syria/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "U.S. officials are particularly concerned about the thousands of foreign fighters who have flocked to Iraq and Syria to join ISIS' cause.\nHe said America would continue launching targeted airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and that the U.S. is \"prepared\" to take action in Syria as well.\nPresident Obama again detailed America's expanded military mission against jihadists with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, in his weekly address Saturday, vowing a \"targeted, relentless counterterrorism campaign\" against the extremists that have swept across much of Iraq and Syria in recent months.\nAnd he also touted new involvement from \"allies and partners\" in the fight against ISIS.\nHe said the U.S. would send additional troops to Iraq to advise local groups fighting the extremists."}
