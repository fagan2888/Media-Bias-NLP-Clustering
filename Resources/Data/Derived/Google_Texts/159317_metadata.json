They want the park to pay up, claiming the waiver they signed won\u2019t hold up in court.\n\nKids rushed into Gravity Park near San Mateo and Alameda and parents like it because, \u201cAfter they\u2019re done, they go home and sleep,\u201d Linda Solis says.\n\nHowever, some say they won\u2019t be taking their kids back. Christopher Saucedo is the attorney for a Rio Rancho family who is suing, saying their 15-year-old son broke his ankle on a trampoline.\n\n\u201cA trampoline gym or park like that should have more supervision. It should have more direction,\u201d Saucedo says.\n\nThe Gravity Park owner says a safety video plays in the park, rules are posted and everyone signs a waiver explaining the risks.\n\n\u201cWe explain in the waiver that same exact thing. There are certain rules to be followed. If they\u2019re not followed, there\u2019s certainly potential for injury,\u201d says Zane Hansen, co-owner of Gravity Park.\n\nAttorneys tell KRQE News 13 that New Mexico law isn\u2019t clear when it comes to waivers and even if you sign, it doesn\u2019t always mean a business is off the hook.\n\n\u201cThese waivers, I do not believe are enforceable,\u201d Saucedo says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a true warning of the danger.\u201d\n\nIf you ask Paul Archuleta who is to blame he\u2019ll say, \u201cI think that it does fall on the business itself to a degree. Yeah, they should be able to help out with expenses if something happens and that\u2019s just common.\u201d\n\nSolis disagrees.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was their fault,\u201d says Solis. \u201cYou\u2019re a kid. You\u2019re going to jump. You\u2019re going to hurt yourself, and you\u2019re going to jump a certain way but I wouldn\u2019t blame the Gravity Park.\u201d\n\nSaucedo says the teen who broke his ankle had to have surgery. The family wants those medical bills paid for and stricter rules at the park. Another family is suing Gravity Park for similar reasons. The attorney says a 12-year-old broke her ankle when she slipped through the padding that covers the springs on the trampolines.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two families are suing for what happened at a popular place for kids.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.krqe", "og": {"site_name": "KRQE News 13", "description": "Two families are suing for what happened at a popular place for kids.", "title": "Family sues ABQ trampoline park", "url": "http://krqe.com/2015/02/18/family-sues-trampoline-park-in-abq/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/gravity-park.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two families are suing for what happened at a popular place for kids.", "title": "Family sues ABQ trampoline park", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkrqe.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/gravity-park.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@krqe", "site": "krqe", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Albuquerque - Metro, Home, News, SmartTV, Top Stories, Top Video", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-tooltip": "Albuquerque News and Weather, Santa Fe, Rio Rancho, New Mexico | krqe.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488525050", "fb": {"pages": 98691658081}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://krqe.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/8ec5fa807657323809caf8c9db73e4ed?s=16", "application-name": "KRQE News 13", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/krqenews", "published_time": "2015-02-18T13:55:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-18T16:05:15+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "D680B65910F40B115B0DE7298B906E56", "google-site-verification": "DybmyJ3qnLleDwi_e3uE6Wh_x8CKcwUamZdUxoElU1M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd76c8\"", "article_summary": "The Gravity Park owner says a safety video plays in the park, rules are posted and everyone signs a waiver explaining the risks.\nAnother family is suing Gravity Park for similar reasons.\nKids rushed into Gravity Park near San Mateo and Alameda and parents like it because, \u201cAfter they\u2019re done, they go home and sleep,\u201d Linda Solis says.\nIf they\u2019re not followed, there\u2019s certainly potential for injury,\u201d says Zane Hansen, co-owner of Gravity Park.\nChristopher Saucedo is the attorney for a Rio Rancho family who is suing, saying their 15-year-old son broke his ankle on a trampoline."}
