Elburn Days festival features new events, old favorites

hello

Even with 85 years of Elburn Days, there's always something new mixed in with festival traditions when residents come out to Lions Park.

A pie-baking contest debuted this year, joining the craft show, carnival rides, food vendors, livestock judging and mud volleyball tournament.

For Kyle Westrom, however, the big draw is the truck and tractor pull. The Elburn man and his extended family have been coming to the event for about 15 years and have a viewing spot right near the starting line.

"It's a good family event. Fun for the kids," he said.

The truck and tractor pull Saturday featured the machinery in five different classes. John Deere, Farmall and Oliver tractors delighted the crowds, as well as Ford, Dodge and Chevy trucks.

Children watching on the sidelines wearing protective ear coverings broke into huge smiles as engines revved and tires dug into the dirt at the starting line.

Westrom's sister, Jill Jeppesen, also of Elburn, cheered on friend Lara Tuma of Paw Paw, Illinois, who was competing in the tractor pull with a two-cylinder 1940 John Deere G tractor.

"I love coming up here," Jeppesen said. "It's just become tradition for our family."

About 30,000 to 40,000 attendees visit the festival each year, said Chris Halsey, a member of the Elburn Days committee.

The festival continues Sunday. Highlights include a craft show from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., mud volleyball at 11:30 a.m. and livestock auction at 1 p.m., all at Lions Park, 500 Filmore St.

"Everyone comes to Elburn Days for a different reason," event chairman Dave Broz said last week. "We really try and provide a place for anyone in the community to come and have a good time."
