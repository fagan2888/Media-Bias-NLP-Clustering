No more head coach interviews are scheduled. Why waste anybody\u2019s time when the entire NFL world believes Kubiak is the choice?\n\nAfter spending nine years with the Broncos as Elway\u2019s backup quarterback from 1983-91 and 11 more years as the Broncos\u2019 offensive coordinator from 1995-2005 (including four seasons coaching Elway), Kubiak was an easy choice.\n\n\u201cThose guys have spent countless hours together on bus rides, plane trips, dorm rooms in training camp,\u201d said former Broncos quarterback Jake Plummer, who had Kubiak as his offensive coordinator from 2003-05. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it couldn\u2019t work. I think for the future of that organization, Kube is the guy. Everybody talks about him meshing with (Peyton) Manning. But they can make it work.\u201d\n\nIt figures the Broncos will have to make a final determination on Kubiak by Tuesday because that\u2019s when the Ravens\u2019 coaching staff heads to Phoenix for the Pro Bowl.\n\nBaltimore coaches are replacing the Broncos\u2019 at the Pro Bowl because Denver\u2019s staff is now split up following head coach John Fox\u2019s departure Monday and arrival Friday in Chicago as the Bears\u2019 new coach.\n\nJust because Kubiak was Elway\u2019s choice from the start, though, doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t concerns. Kubiak\u2019s offense not only features the zone blocking, one-cut rushing style, but a passing game heavy on play-action bootleg passes.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem like an ideal fit for Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, whose immobility became more pronounced this season.\n\nThe root of Kubiak\u2019s offense, though, is similar to what Manning operated for years with the Indianapolis Colts.\n\n\u201cGood coaches can coach anybody,\u201d Plummer said. \u201cManning was highly successful running it for most of his career. If Manning can do some of it \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have to do all of it. You don\u2019t have him boot left six times a game and throw 25-yard comebacks. Let\u2019s be realistic. But he can play-fake, boot out, turn his shoulders and throw a flat route to the fullback or tight end. They\u2019ll find a way to make it work.\u201d\n\nIf Kubiak becomes the head coach as expected, he and Elway in short order will work to improve a Broncos roster that won another AFC West Division title last year but was one-and-done in the postseason.\n\nThe Broncos are expected to first look for a right tackle and one more guard with the type of agility and athleticism that can get to the second level in Kubiak\u2019s zone-blocking rushing system.\n\nLeft tackle Ryan Clady is the only Broncos\u2019 offensive lineman who was originally drafted to play in this system.\n\nTo help teach Kubiak\u2019s system, he is expected to bring along Ravens quarterbacks coach Rick Dennison to again serve as Broncos\u2019 offensive coordinator, as he did from 2006-08.\n\nOn defense, the Broncos are expected to look at acquiring help at middle linebacker and safety, as Nate Irving and Rahim Moore are free agents, and possibly defensive tackle if free agent Terrance Knighton isn\u2019t re-signed.\n\nElway did interview Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase for the head coach position on Thursday and Cincinnati Bengals defensive backs coach Vance Joseph on Friday.\n\nBoth are considered fallback candidates. Gase has been talking with other teams in need of offensive coordinators. He does have an interview set up with the Jacksonville Jaguars, according to an NFL source.\n\nThe Jaguars make sense because they drafted quarterback Blake Bortles with the No. 3 overall pick last year. His rookie season proved he can use some Gase-caliber coaching after Bortles threw 11 touchdowns against 17 interceptions.\n\nJoseph figures to have a better chance at becoming the Broncos\u2019 new defensive coordinator, as he was Kubiak\u2019s secondary coach for three seasons in Houston.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gary Kubiak appears to be \u2018the guy\u2019 for Broncos, but concerns remain", "title": "Gary Kubiak appears to be \u2018the guy\u2019 for Broncos, but concerns remain", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/17/gary-kubiak-appears-to-be-the-guy-for-broncos-but-concerns-remain/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150116__gary-kubiakp1-1.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150116__gary-kubiakp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-17T18:43:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:59:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Left tackle Ryan Clady is the only Broncos\u2019 offensive lineman who was originally drafted to play in this system.\nElway, the Broncos\u2019 general manager, seemingly had his heart set on hiring Kubiak, the Baltimore Ravens\u2019 offensive coordinator, early in the process.\nThat doesn\u2019t seem like an ideal fit for Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, whose immobility became more pronounced this season.\nElway did interview Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase for the head coach position on Thursday and Cincinnati Bengals defensive backs coach Vance Joseph on Friday.\nNo more head coach interviews are scheduled."}
