It\u2019s a fabulous way to introduce healthy produce to our patients and staff. Recently, I saw the kale growing. Who knew that it\u2019s such an odd plant? I buy it at the farmers market all the time, but on a stalk, it looks like a little palm tree.\n\nThe workout I suggest for my patients is more like 30 minutes three days per week\u2014and get a pedometer and increase your activity to include 10,000 steps every day.\n\nI sleep 5\u20136 hours per night.\n\nI drink 1\u20134 alcoholic beverages a week.\n\nThe diagnosis I fear most for myself or my family is heart disease.\n\nI wish my patients wouldn\u2019t answer cell phones in the exam room.\n\nIf you adopt one healthy habit this year, make it drinking three to four servings of milk per day.\n\nRonald Miller, M.D.\n\nRehab specialist\n\nMy guilty pleasures are pizza and french fries.\n\nMy exercise regimen is running, elliptical, biking, and weights.\n\nThe workout I suggest for my patients is more like low-impact cardio and core strengthening.\n\nI am 0 pounds overweight.\n\nI sleep 6\u20137 hours per night.\n\nI\u2019ve smoked 0 cigarettes in the past month.\n\nI eat red meat 4\u20135 times a week.\n\nThe diagnosis I fear most for myself or my family is cancer.\n\nPatients are most often not forthcoming about their bad habits.\n\nThe smartest question my patients ask me is \u201cIs my condition going to get worse?\u201d\n\nI wish my patients wouldn\u2019t listen to the advice of family and friends rather than their physician.\n\nI\u2019m seeing more patients for narcotic addiction than I did five years ago.\n\nIf you adopt one healthy habit this year, make it exercising on a regular basis.\n\nThe best attribute to look for when choosing a doctor is the ability to communicate and explain your condition and the treatment planned.\n\nErnest O.
