Republican Senator Ted Cruz is prepared to filibuster the continuing resolution bill, if Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid attempts to reinsert funding for Obamacare after the House stripped it from the legislation Friday.

“Anticipating the likelihood that Senator Reid will strip the crucial defunding language, it may be necessary to oppose cloture to block him from changing the bill,” Cruz’s communication director, Sean Rushton, said in a statement Friday night about a possible filibuster.

“We’ll use any procedural means necessary to protect the House bill and keep debate open, standing guard against any attempt to reduce this opportunity to another show vote,” Rushton added.

“Senator Reid must not be allowed to add Obamacare funding back into the House-passed bill,” he continued.

The Texas firebrand said himself in an earlier statement on Friday he hopes that “every Senate Republican will stand together and oppose cloture on the bill in order to keep the House bill intact and not let Harry Reid add Obamacare funding back in.”

“Now is a time for party unity,” Cruz said, challenging his colleagues to “stand side-by-side with courageous House Republicans.”

“The fight to save America from Obamacare is just beginning — it may well go back and forth from the House and Senate several times — and a united Republican front means that Harry Reid and the President cannot ignore the American people,” Cruz added.
