Judge Pfiffner asked Legislative Council attorney Erin Murphy why he shouldn't "slow-roll" his decision to allow for a possible resolution of the matter in the Legislature, citing two Medicaid reform bills currently in the Senate. The Legislature could also decide the entire issue in a vote, and if legislators would "stand up and be counted," voters will know their positions, Pfiffner said.
