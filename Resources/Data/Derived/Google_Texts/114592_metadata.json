Fitbit shares briefly traded just below $32 before falling back at the close.\n\nThe price demonstrated rising investor enthusiasm as the IPO date approached \u2014 the fitness tracker company\u2019s stock had first projected to sell at around $14 to 16 per share. Because of huge demand shown by investors, the offer price was raised to $20 and the company increased the number of shares for sale from 29.9 million to 34.5 million.\n\nThe 8-year-old San Francisco-based company makes wearable devices that track health data such as distance walked, calories burned and stairs climbed. The devices, which range from watches and wristbands to pocket clips, have caught on and Fitbit sold 10.9 million devices and earned over $700 million in revenue last year.\n\nCLSA analyst Ed Maguire thinks Fitbit will benefit significantly from being the first company to go public in what may soon be a crowded market. \u201cFitbit has taken brand awareness to a far greater level than competitors,\u201d he said.\n\nSome believe Fitbit\u2019s success might be more of a reflection of the profitability of the emerging market than the product itself.\n\nAngelo Zino, an equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, compared Fitbit\u2019s initial success to that of the Blackberry, a once-dominant smartphone that eventually lost out to Apple\u2019s iPhone. \u201cFitbit has to find a way to defend the position they\u2019ve built here,\u201d he said.\n\nAlex Gauna, a technology analyst for JMP Securities, said he was optimistic that Fitbit can continue navigating the market, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot to fear for Fitbit. It\u2019s a clear leader in the market obviously, with more than 11 million units sold last year.\u201d\n\nAnother threat to Fitbit\u2019s financial success comes from below. Alternative, cheaper rivals such as the Mi Band made by Chinese company Xiaomi could challenge Fitbit\u2019s current lead. The company could find itself caught in a no-man\u2019s land between the expensive, multitask smartwatches and cheaper, simpler fitness bands.\n\nAdded to these concerns are recent legal troubles.\n\nA competitor, Jawbone, recently filed a lawsuit against Fitbit, accusing them of hiring former employees who stole intellectual property. The lawsuit essentially claims that every Fitbit product infringes on Jawbone patents.\n\nBut the successful IPO was testament to investors\u2019 faith that Fitbit\u2019s market lead and its current price advantage over rivals such as Apple will make it a formidable force in a growing market segment.\n\nThe potential is huge. About 126 million wearable devices are expected to be shipped in 2019, representing nearly $28 billion in revenue, according to the industry monitoring firm IDC. In 2014, about 20 million units were shipped.\n\nAnd analysts noted that Fitbit currently gets only about 20 percent of its revenue from the international market, giving it plenty of room to grow.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fitbit, inspirer of uncounted billions of steps, took a giant leap of its own Thursday with an initial public offering which saw investors snap up shares at a much higher valuation than anticipated.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fitbit, inspirer of uncounted billions of steps, took a giant leap of its own Thursday with an initial public offering which saw investors snap up shares at a much higher valuation than anticipated.", "title": "Fitbit steps out on Wall Street with first stock sale", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/18/fitbit-steps-out-wall-street-first-stock-sale/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/20/b614cf163864af086e0f6a7067002859.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/20/b614cf163864af086e0f6a7067002859.jpg", "description": "Fitbit, inspirer of uncounted billions of steps, took a giant leap of its own Thursday with an initial public offering which saw investors snap up shares at a much higher valuation than anticipated.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Fitbit steps out on Wall Street with first stock sale"}, "Author": "Andrew Nachemson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd304b\"", "article_summary": "The devices, which range from watches and wristbands to pocket clips, have caught on and Fitbit sold 10.9 million devices and earned over $700 million in revenue last year.\nFitbit strode across the finish line in style on its first day of public trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday.\nIn 2014, about 20 million units were shipped.\nSome believe Fitbit\u2019s success might be more of a reflection of the profitability of the emerging market than the product itself.\nAnd analysts noted that Fitbit currently gets only about 20 percent of its revenue from the international market, giving it plenty of room to grow."}
