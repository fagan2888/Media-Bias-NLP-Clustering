The upgraded version also reduces application processing times, benefitting citizens and case workers alike.\n\nThe upgrade also enables states to meet an Affordable Care Act requirement for passive renewal of Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) Medicaid benefits. This eliminates the need for citizens to submit recertification applications online, simplifies the overall recertification process and reduces manual work by case workers. As a result, applicants will be able to check their application status online, helping them stay better informed and reducing the likelihood of duplicate applications.\n\nIn addition, Version 7.1 includes a new portal that enables service providers to update government agencies on services and citizen cases and also enables case workers to refer citizens to appropriate service providers electronically.\n\n\u201cOur upgraded software brings greater efficiency to agencies and case workers, reduces citizen wait times and paper work, strengthens data accuracy, and helps states meet Federal compliance goals and guidelines,\u201d said David McCurley, global managing director of Accenture\u2019s public sector software business. \u201cBy closely tracking what states need and the difficulties they are facing with legacy systems, we are providing a cost-effective pathway to help governments address cost and operational pressures while improving citizen services.\u201d\n\nThe Human Services Suite is designed to help agencies replace and modernize legacy eligibility systems. It can fully replace a legacy system or its components can be used to upgrade functionality in a phased manner. Health and human service agencies and organizations in Kansas, Idaho and Ohio are using Accenture Software to modernize benefit programs.\n\n\u201cCitizens increasingly expect better levels of service from governments,\u201d said Adelaide O\u2019Brien, research director for government IT transformation at IDC. \u201cEase of use is a requirement for beneficiaries as well as case workers. Enabling applicants to apply online, with passive renewal of MAGI Medicaid benefits allows citizens to receive near real-time eligibility determination. This automation frees caseworkers from working on processing applications and allows them to spend more time on helping beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nLearn more about the Accenture Human Services Suite and Delivering Public Service for the Future.\n\nAbout Accenture\n\nAccenture is a global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company, with more than 336,000 people serving clients in more than 120 countries.
