Symptoms include hospitals that hemorrhage money, disintegrating facilities and a population in poor health. East New York, for example, has the highest diabetes rate, 18%, in the city.\n\nThe latest plan to fix health care in Brooklyn was to tap an insider to Gov. Andrew Cuomo: James Introne, a former state deputy secretary of health who retired in June 2013. The state Department of Health hired Introne to help manage \u201cthe transformation of the health care system in central and eastern Brooklyn,\u201d said an agency spokesman, adding that Introne will cajole hospitals to undertake \u201cstrategies that can assure the availability of sustainable, high-quality health services in Brooklyn.\u201d\n\nThat means hospitals must form networks or merge. Last week, Jason Helgerson, the state\u2019s Medicaid director, said consolidation makes sense for a hospital like Brookdale Hospital Medical Center, which gets a $100 million annual state subsidy. Heavily reliant on Medicaid, Brookdale is one place where the free market \u201cdoesn\u2019t work very well,\u201d said Helgerson.\n\nMarket intervention will be courtesy of Introne. By consolidating, Brooklyn hospitals will be in a better position to use $500 million set aside in the state budget to build a new facility to replace the campuses of three competing institutions\u2014but that\u2019s still only half the construction cost.\n\nDoc fingers Silver as trial begins\n\nDr. Robert Taub testified that he referred asbestos cases to Sheldon Silver and his law firm in exchange for $500,000 in state funds as the trial of the former Assembly speaker got underway last week.\n\nJet.com joins the unicorns\n\nAmazon rival Jet.com scored funding that values the startup at $1.5 billion. The year-old online shopping site is close to raising $500 million to $550 million in a round led by Fidelity Investments.\n\nWTC progress, setback\n\nOne World Trade Center celebrated its first birthday last week with the announcement that mobile-\u00adadvertising tenant xAd had taken more space in the building. But problems persist. Westfield\u2019s luxury mall at the lower Manhattan site will not open early next year as anticipated because of a water leak from construction at adjacent 3 WTC. Meanwhile, Silverstein Properties is using a popular visa program known as EB-5 to raise $500 million from Chinese investors so it can start erecting 2 WTC.\n\nLegalizing pot sooner\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo has until Nov. 11 to sign a bill that will expedite access to medical marijuana, which will become legal in January, for patients with terminal illnesses.\n\nData point East Side Access, a commuter-rail tunnel 14 stories below Grand Central Terminal that will connect the transit Hub to the Long Island Rail Road, is costing $1 million per foot to construct. Its debut is scheduled for 2022.\n\n\n\nPenalty on sanction violations\n\nDeutsche Bank agreed to pay $258 million to settle investigations by state and federal banking regulators on its dealings with countries such as Iran and Syria that violate U.S. sanction laws. It is the latest deal in a string of similar cases involving large European-based banks that use their New York operations to do business with blacklisted countries.\n\nNY probes oil companies\n\nThe state attorney general is investigating ExxonMobil and Peabody Energy for allegedly deceiving investors by hiding research results on the causes and effects of climate change. The probe may lead to inquiries into other oil companies.\n\nViceland to air\n\nTo capture more advertising dollars, Brooklyn-based Vice Media is launching a cable channel in partnership with A+E Networks. Viceland will focus on gay culture, marijuana and music.\n\nTrump book launch\n\nCrippled America, a campaign manifesto, offers little insight into the presidential hopeful\u2019s policy goals.\n\nA Flintstones-like museum addition\n\nThe American Museum of Natural History revealed designs by architect Jeanne Gang for its $325 million Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education and Innovation at West 79th Street. The plan \u201cconsumes less park space than expected, while introducing an aesthetic that evokes Frank Gehry\u2019s museum in Bilbao, Spain,\u201d The New York Times wrote. The design is subject to City Council approval as well as a Landmarks Preservation Commission review.\n\nSign Up for Health Pulse Brought to you by Crain's New York Business, Health Pulse is a subscription-only website focused on the business of health care.
