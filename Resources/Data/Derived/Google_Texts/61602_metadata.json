The bill would codify the Hyde Amendment, which bars any federal funding for elective abortion, to assure it would not need to be reauthorized, and that no program would be exempt from its provisions.\n\n\u201cUnder ObamaCare billions of dollars in the form of tax credits are buying abortion-subsidizing health insurance plans,\u201d Smith, a New Jersey Republican, told the annual march. \u201cLike the president's promise that you can keep your insurance plan if you like it, the massive public funding of abortion in ObamaCare insurance plans breaks another promise.\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who was the first speaker at the pro-life rally after March for Life President Jeanne Monahan kicked things off, announced that the bill would come up for a vote in the House next week.\n\nIf passed, its provisions could save lives, according to Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-MO. \u201cStudies have shown that if tax dollars are removed from subsidizing abortion, abortions are reduced by 25 percent,\u201d she told the annual Pro-Life Con, sponsored by the Family Research Council .\n\nHartzler announced four pro-life and pro-family bills, including HR7, which are intended to motivate the party's pro-life base.\n\nThe Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act was authored by Rep. Smith and would compel insurance companies to inform consumers whether individual plans available for purchase under the Affordable Care Act offer abortion coverage. The bill currently has 125 co-sponsors.\n\nThe Protecting Adoption Act , introduced by Hartzler, would establish a National Responsible Father Registry to ease the adoption process. The congresswoman gave a joyous recounting of her experiences as an adoptive parent at the D.C. March.\n\nThe fourth measure, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Bill, passed the House last June but languished five months before being introduced in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has not yet scheduled a vote on the measure.\n\nThe last bill appears unlikely to pass the Democrat-controlled Senate, and President Obama has promised to veto the measure if it lands on his desk.\n\n\u201cAlthough the senate Democratic leadership refuses to even vote on pro-life legislation, that's not the case\u201d in the House, Smith said, asking the tens of thousands of people who braved the snow and windchills dipping below zero to contact their congressmen before next week's vote.\n\nCantor seemed resigned to the bill's fate, saying the House passed it \u201cfor the first time\u201d last year, adding that the bill, which would institute a national ban on abortions after 20 weeks due to fetal pain, will remain \u201ca top priority for me and for my colleagues.\u201d\n\nAfter pro-abortion activists seized upon a remark Trent Franks made about rape , Cantor introduced a controversial rape and incest exception to the bill, in consultation with Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer.\n\nThe decision to introduce that exception irked Save the One founder Rebecca Kiessling, who was conceived in rape. \u201cI feel pain,\u201d she said. \u201cIf somebody flubs, don't immediately introduce a rape exception. Bring people in,\u201d she told the Law of Life Summit. \u201cWe have an army of people who are available to testify on this issue and to lobby. Use us.\u201d\n\nIn his speech to the March, Cantor promised that in the future the \u201cHouse will stand for life.\u201d RNC Chairman Reince Priebus foreshadowed those comments, telling Pro-LifeCon yesterday morning, \u201cWe're the pro-life party.\u201d\n\nThe GOP is attempting to engage pro-life conservatives ahead of the pivotal 2014 midterm elections, when the party hopes to regain control of the Senate. After dismal results in the last two presidential elections, which many chalk up to moderate candidates' inability to energize the pro-life movement, Priebus addressed the Family Research Council's Pro-Life Con on Tuesday.\n\nCantor's rhetoric seemed targeted toward the \u201cvalues voters\u201d credited with swinging the 2004 presidential election for George W. Bush. Cantor told March attendees that the GOP \u201cwill continue to advocate and will continue to fight for the unborn, because it is the right and moral thing to do,\u201d and called the 20-week abortion ban \u201can utterly decent and moral proposal.\u201d\n\nHe praised the pro-life movement's resilience, hoping they will be as committed to showing up the polls this fall. \u201cThose of us in public office are really fortunate to stand on your shoulders,\u201d Cantor told the march attendees, saying they gave him \u201cmuch hope.\u201d\n\nChris Smith was somewhat more effusive, calling the march a \u201cmagnificent celebration of God's gift of life.\u201d\n\nHe said that momentum was on the pro-life side. \u201cA record 200 pro-life laws have been enacted in the states.\u201d\n\nNational Right to Life President Carol Tobias shared those sentiments in a press release, saying that \u201crecent legislative gains, coupled with increasingly pro-life public opinion and data suggesting the annual number of abortions continues to decline, gives the right-to-life movement hope for further success in 2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause of you, your prayers and hard work, we are winning,\u201d Smith said.\n\nRep. Dan Lipinski, a pro-life Democrat, had been scheduled to address the event, but his flight was grounded in his native Illinois due to inclement weather.
