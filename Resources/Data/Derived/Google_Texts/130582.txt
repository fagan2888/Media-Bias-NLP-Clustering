Jindal urges GOP to be more than 'Party of No'

Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said on Sunday the Republican Party needs to be more than the Party of No.

“The GOP, to earn the right to be a governing party, we can’t just be the Party of No, we have to be the Party of Solutions, not only repeal but also replace Obamacare. We need to offer detailed plans for energy independence, manufacturing renaissance, school choice… a stronger foreign policy where our friends trust us, our enemies respect us and fear us, where we invest in our military,” the governor said. “We don’t need to be a second liberal party, but we need to be more than just the Party of No.”

Appearing on ABC’s “This Week” the potential 2016 Republican presidential contender discussed how the party and candidates are shaping themselves ahead of the next presidential election.

Jindal - who did not attend the major conservative Republican forum in Iowa this weekend, choosing to attend a prayer rally instead - said he believes voters need a leader who will be able to speak the truth.

As an example, he cited a recent speech he gave in London where he claimed there are “no-go zones” in Europe where governments have no authority over Muslim immigrants — a theory many discredit or say is greatly over exaggerated.

“I know it made a lot of people upset,’ Jindal said, but we need leaders to tell the truth, for example people coming to our country need to integrate and assimilate.”
