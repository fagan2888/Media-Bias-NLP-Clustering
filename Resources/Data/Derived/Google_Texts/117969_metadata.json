Oracle recommends that DBAs upgrade their certification to version 11g or later, the site states.\n\nOracle stands to benefit financially from the recertifications, given the fees charged to take the tests.\n\nStill, one longtime Oracle DBA, who asked to remain anonymous, praised Oracle's decision.\n\n\"It was never a good idea that certifications were permanent,\" the DBA said via email. \"Changes in features and architecture, for example 12c multi-tenant, should render previous certifications null and void. Will it ruffle some feathers? Yeah probably. Should it? No. In my opinion certifications should apply to a single release and nothing more.\"\n\nThere could be more news on this front yet to come. A decision on whether to require all product certifications to be recertified is \"currently under discussion,\" according to the Oracle FAQ.\n\nChris Kanaracus covers enterprise software and general technology breaking news for The IDG News Service.
