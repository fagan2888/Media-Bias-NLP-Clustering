In a new weekly feature, we'll be bringing you some funny stuff every Friday.\n\n(If you've heard a good one or have a link to share, please send it our way at editor@ictmn.com.)\n\nHere's one to kick it off -- admittedly, and oldie but a goodie:\n\nWhen NASA was preparing for the Apollo project, they did some astronaut training on a Navajo Indian reservation. One day, a Navajo elder and his son were herding sheep and came across the space crew. The old man, who only spoke Navajo, asked a question, which the son translated: \"What are the guys in the big suits doing?\" A member of the crew said they were practicing for their trip to the moon.\n\nThe old man got really excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts. Recognizing a promotional opportunity for the spin-doctors, the NASA folks found a tape recorder. After the old man recorded his message, they asked the son to translate. He refused. So the NASA reps brought the tape to the reservation, where the rest of the tribe listened and laughed, but refused to translate the elder's message to the moon.\n\nFinally, NASA called in an official government translator. He reported that the moon message said: \"Watch out for these guys; they've come to steal your land.\"\n\n[Source: Snopes.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beware astronauts bearing flags.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/11/friday-funny-what-did-navajo-elder-say-moon-155772", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/apollo-moon-flag.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Friday Funny: What Did the Navajo Elder Say to the Moon?"}, "abstract": "Beware astronauts bearing flags.", "dc": {"title": "Friday Funny: What Did the Navajo Elder Say to the Moon?"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/11/friday-funny-what-did-navajo-elder-say-moon-155772", "dcterms.creator": "jrobertson", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Friday Funny, Joke, American Indian Humor, NASA, Navajo Language, Navajo Elder, Native American Joke, Native American Humor", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 6}, "dcterms.date": "2014-07-11T09:30-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Friday Funny: What Did the Navajo Elder Say to the Moon?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96f2\"", "article_summary": "The old man, who only spoke Navajo, asked a question, which the son translated: \"What are the guys in the big suits doing?\"\nThe old man got really excited and asked if he could send a message to the moon with the astronauts.\nOne day, a Navajo elder and his son were herding sheep and came across the space crew.\nAfter the old man recorded his message, they asked the son to translate.\nHe reported that the moon message said: \"Watch out for these guys; they've come to steal your land.\""}
