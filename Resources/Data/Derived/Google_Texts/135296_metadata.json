The intent was to help small businesses in Montana, initially those with nine or fewer employees, provide health insurance for their workers.\n\nIn exchange, the state gave a tax credit or premium incentive and assistance payments to those employers who pay at least 50 percent of the premium for their employees. That credit is set to sunset next year.\n\nJesse Laslovich is the chief legal counsel for the state Insurance Commissioner. He says about 1,000 businesses are using Insure Montana and it's covering about 6,000 people, employees and their families.\n\n\"It\u2019s a program, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, that has worked, that has worked very well, that has been a Montana solution to all of the confusion that has come from the federal government. It\u2019s about Main Street Montana and its about helping our workers as part of their employment,\" Laslovich said.\n\nOriginally, Senate Bill 99 sought to seek federal dollars to cover its costs, but that idea was rejected in committee. Because of the nearly $12 million hit to the state\u2019s General Fund, it was sent to the Senate Finance and Claims committee to consider its fiscal ramifications.\n\nAnd that brought a series of questions from Senator Mary Caferro. The Democrat from Helena wanted to know why employees didn\u2019t migrate from Insure Montana to the marketplace to shop for insurance coverage created as part of the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as ObamaCare.\n\nLaslovich answered, \"I know your argument is, 'there is no need for insure Montana anymore for the same reason'. We would argue that because it\u2019s a state-run program that\u2019s been successful and small businesses are utilizing it in a resounding way that we wanted to keep the opportunity for them to provide insurance to their employees through Insure Montana available.\"\n\nInsure Montana does have a waiting list. About 175 businesses are on that list.\n\nLaslovich was asked why he thinks Montana employers have not pushed their employees to get their coverage through the ACA. Laslovich says he didn\u2019t know, only that the office has had some conversations with business owners and that they didn\u2019t feel comfortable sending their workers to the exchange.\n\n\n\n\"And if I can say, Mr. Chairman, for me it\u2019s a hell of a lot easier working with the state than the federal government.\"\n\nHe also says these small businesses are seeking a continuation of Insure Montana for the consistency and predictability of the tax credits they\u2019re currently receiving to provide that health insurance. Laslovich says questions remain about the future of the ACA.\n\nNo one spoke against Senate Bill 99.\n\nThe measure already has won approval in the Senate Business, Labor and Economic Affairs Committee. If it passes the Senate Finance and Claims Committee it would go to the full Senate for consideration.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Montana News", "description": "A made-in Montana health insurance program aimed at helping small businesses cover their employees is seeking money from the general fund to continue", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://mtpr.org/post/insure-montana-program-seeks-state-funds-continue-operation", "image": "http://mtpr.org/sites/kufm/files/styles/medium/public/201502/capitol-dome-interior-%28William-Marcus%29.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A made-in Montana health insurance program aimed at helping small businesses cover their employees is seeking money from the general fund to continue", "title": "Insure Montana Program Seeks State Funds To Continue Operation"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@mtpublicradio", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Jackie Yamanaka - Yellowstone Public Radio", "wordCount": 610, "dc": {"title": "Insure Montana Program Seeks State Funds To Continue Operation"}, "nid": 31967, "datePublished": "2015-03-10", "story_id": 392193053, "keywords": "Montana Legislature, Jesse Laslovich, Mary Caferro, Insure Montana, health insurance, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Senate Bill 99", "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Insure Montana Program Seeks State Funds To Continue OperationA made-in Montana health insurance program aimed at helping small businesses cover their employees is seeking money from the general fund to continue operation.\nLaslovich answered, \"I know your argument is, 'there is no need for insure Montana anymore for the same reason'.\nInsure Montana was created before the ACA became law.\nHe says about 1,000 businesses are using Insure Montana and it's covering about 6,000 people, employees and their families.\nInsure Montana does have a waiting list."}
