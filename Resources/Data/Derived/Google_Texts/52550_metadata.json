That\u2019s why, after overcoming an eating disorder, she joined the international group Endangered Bodies to lobby against industries that don\u2019t celebrate the diversity of body types.\n\nWeingarten\u2019s battle recently reached a new frontier: Facebook. Earlier this month, she launched a Change.org campaign to get the \u201cfeeling fat\u201d emoticon removed from the social media site. More than 16,000 people have joined the movement so far, more than halfway toward Endangered Bodies\u2019 goal of 25,000 signatures.\n\nThe \u201cfeeling fat\u201d emoticon \u2014 a puffy, rosy cheek, double chinned character \u2014 currently counts among more than 100 preloaded statuses that users can use to express their feelings when they post a status update. Weingarten, however, does not see \u201cfat\u201d as a feeling, saying that she considers the keyboard symbol to be insensitive to people of various body types and particularly women who feel self-conscious about their bodies.\n\n\u201cWhen Facebook users set their status to \u2018feeling fat,\u2019 they are making fun of people who consider themselves to be overweight, which can include many people with eating disorders,\u201d Weingarten wrote in the petition. \u201cThat is not ok. Fat is not a feeling. Fat is a natural part of our bodies, no matter their weight. And all bodies deserve to be respected and cared for.\u201d\n\nEndangered Bodies\u2019 fight has sparked a debate about the power of social media to promote images that lower viewers\u2019 self-confidence and compel them to seek superficial ideas of beauty, even when the means of doing so may threaten their life. As shown in a March 2014 study, a college-aged woman\u2019s exposure to Facebook, even if for just 20 minutes, can cause body dissatisfaction, one significant symptom of an eating disorder.\n\nEating disorders \u2014 defined as any psychological condition characterized by abnormal eating habits \u2014 affect nearly 24 million people of various ages and demographics in the United States. The most prevalent disorders include anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder, all of which may be fueled by a desire to control one part of an otherwise hectic life. The issue has especially gained prominence in the era of global media where consumers \u2014 particularly women \u2014 are increasingly exposed to doctored pictures that skew perceptions of beauty.\n\nTaking in those adulterated images, which accurately represent just five percent of American women, can pose dangerous consequences for viewers that emerge at a young age. For example, more than 80 percent of 10-year-olds said they\u2019re afraid to be fat. Nearly 70 percent of girls between grades 5 and 12 reported that images in magazines influenced their ideas of beauty. Nearly half of girls in the same group said wanted to lose weight upon viewing that media.\n\n\u201cIt may not seem like a big deal, but fat talk is a problem,\u201d Art Markman, PhD, a psychologist at the University of Texas, told Yahoo Health. \u201cThe more time that people \u2014 and particularly women \u2014 spend thinking about their weight and their diet, the more difficulties they end up having eating in a healthy way. There are many people \u2014 again particularly women \u2014 who internalize a thin ideal from media and that ideal influences their behavior,\u201d Markman said.\n\nExperts say that adding Facebook to the equation further damages young women by allowing them to reinforce those negative views about their weight and body image on a public forum. The issue becomes even more problematic if users don\u2019t receive comforting messages from their followers.\n\n\u201cWhen body hatred is normalized, that\u2019s unhealthy for everyone,\u201d Claire Mysko, the director for programs at the National Eating Disorders Association, told ABC News. \u201cOn the flip side, body positivity in social media can be a powerful tool both in recovery and early intervention.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, Facebook defended its use of the \u201cfeeling fat\u201d emoticon by alluding to the other choices that users have to express their feelings. \u201cYou can choose from over 100 feelings we offer based on people\u2019s input or create your own,\u201d said officials from the social media company.\n\nWhile this particular weight-related status has become the subject of controversy, the social media site has also recently attempted to connect users with tools to aid their physical and mental wellness that have been more well-received. Those services include links to eating disorder resources and a new app that connects troubled people to suicide prevention support.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"Fat is not a feeling.
