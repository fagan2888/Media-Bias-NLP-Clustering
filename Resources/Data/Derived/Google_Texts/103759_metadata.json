The stuff that\u2019s happened outside of the cage isn\u2019t good. It\u2019s not a proud moment for me, and it\u2019s not a proud moment for Jon.\n\n\u201cSo we have to carry ourselves better and show people why they\u2019re really tuning into the fight.\u201d\n\nThe heavily anticipated bout takes place Sept. 27 at UFC 178, which is slated for MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Jones (20-1 MMA, 14-1 UFC) and Cormier (15-0 MMA, 4-0 UFC) headline the pay-per-view card, which is shaping up to be onet of the year\u2019s best lineups.\n\nFor more on UFC 178, check out the UFC Rumors section of the site.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a dramatic, hostile and nearly violent week of UFC 178 PR duties, Daniel Cormier admits it hasn't exactly been one of the his finest moments.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=876544448, app-argument=", "og": {"site_name": "MMAjunkie", "description": "After a dramatic, hostile and nearly violent week of UFC 178 PR duties, Daniel Cormier admits it hasn\u2019t exactly been one of the his finest moments.", "title": "Daniel Cormier on weeklong drama with Jon Jones: 'Not a proud moment' for us", "url": "http://mmajunkie.com/2014/08/daniel-cormier-on-weeklong-drama-with-jon-jones-not-a-proud-moment-for-us", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/jon-jones-daniel-cormier-fight-video-3.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/jon-jones-daniel-cormier-fight-video-3.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@mmajunkie", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "UFC and MMA news, rumors, live blogs and videos", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.uts.mmaj", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "application-name": "MMAjunkie", "google-site-verification": "2Od7ybpFVLgJXhT8g-Xtj8nNXprtmxPC5ZjnJxeTztI", "keywords": "news, ufc, videos, daniel cormier, jon jones, ufc 178", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/MMAjunkiecom/105550656158763", "published_time": "2014-08-09T21:00:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-09T21:00:05+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://mmajunkie.com/feed;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2bca1d844f05b69f1f0b535fc8139f0b?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f31\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s not a proud moment for me, and it\u2019s not a proud moment for Jon.\nFor more on UFC 178, check out the UFC Rumors section of the site.\nAfter a dramatic, hostile and nearly violent week of UFC 178 PR duties, Daniel Cormier admits it hasn\u2019t exactly been one of the his finest moments.\nJones (20-1 MMA, 14-1 UFC) and Cormier (15-0 MMA, 4-0 UFC) headline the pay-per-view card, which is shaping up to be onet of the year\u2019s best lineups.\n\u201cI think we need to focus more on that than all the stuff that\u2019s happened outside of the cage."}
