It\u2019s not because the state wants to undermine cleanliness. Lawmakers are trying to pressure manufacturers across the country to do away with the chemical, known as triclosan, because there\u2019s evidence it could be hazardous to the environment without actually offering any public health benefits.\n\nThis may not sound like the most exciting policy development \u2014 but it\u2019s actually the culmination of more than three decades of pressure to crack down on the controversial ingredient, which is now included in at least 2,000 individual products on the market.\n\nTriclosan was first developed in the 1960s to disinfect hospitals, and now, it\u2019s added to products to give the impression they\u2019re a better alternative to soap and water. But that\u2019s not actually the case. The Food and Drug Administration acknowledges that \u201cthe agency does not have evidence that triclosan in antibacterial soaps and body washes provides any benefit over washing with regular soap and water.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, multiple studies have found that triclosan may disrupt hormones, impair muscle function, and contribute to the rise of antibiotic resistance. University of Minnesota researchers found that increasing amounts of triclosan in lakes and rivers could be contributing to harmful toxins. While the chemical hasn\u2019t been definitively proven to be harmful to humans, consumer advocates argue that it\u2019s not worth taking the risk considering the fact that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefits.\n\nNonetheless, the chemical has become incredibly common over the past several decades, as the FDA has dragged its feet on finalizing guidelines to regulate it. A recent study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that triclosan was detected in the urine of nearly 75 percent of the participants.\n\nIn the absence of FDA rules \u2014 the federal agency is notoriously slow to regulate potentially harmful substances, and is currently asking companies that use triclosan to submit evidence that their products are safe \u2014 lawmakers in Minnesota decided to take matters into their own hands. The new law, which was signed by Gov. Mark Dayton (D) on Friday, bans the use of triclosan in cleaning products sold in the state.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s law won\u2019t take effect until 2017, so it\u2019s not an immediate fix. But the lawmakers who pushed for it hope that it will help nudge other states, as well as the federal government, in the right direction. There\u2019s already some evidence that public pressure can have this effect. Companies like Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, and Avon have begun to phase out triclosan products.\n\n\u201cWhile this is an effort to ban triclosan from one of the 50 states, I think it will have a greater impact than that,\u201d state Sen. John Marty (D), who sponsored the legislation, told the Associated Press. Marty believes that more manufacturers will stop using the chemical on their own even before the law officially takes effect.\n\n\u201cI think one day we\u2019re going to look back and say, why didn\u2019t we do this much sooner?\u201d Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, pointed out in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "It's the first state to do so.
