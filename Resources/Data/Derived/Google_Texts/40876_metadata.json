Businesses do it because that\u2019s a less complicated process than dealing with an official health insurance plan, but continuing to do so after July 1 could cost them hundreds of dollars in fines each day.\n\nBusiness groups are calling attention to what they say is an obscure part of Obamacare that could crush small businesses who are unaware of it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest penalty that no one is talking about,\u201d said Kevin Kuhlman, policy director for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, on Tuesday.\n\nThe penalties will only affect businesses with less than 50 employees. Those with more than 50 employees are already required to offer a health insurance plan.\n\nThe new rule is the result of an Internal Revenue Service interpretation of part of the ACA. It seems intended to force employers to offer a group health insurance plan (or leave their employees to fend for themselves on the health insurance exchanges).\n\nThe IRS says those reimbursements \u2014 technically known as \u201cemployer payment plans\u201d \u2014 are \u201cconsidered to be group health plans subject to the market reforms, including the prohibition on annual limits for essential health benefits and the requirement to provide certain preventive care without cost sharing.\u201d\n\nThe end result?\n\n\u201cSuch an arrangement fails to satisfy the market reforms and may be subject to a $100/day excise tax per applicable employee (which is $36,500 per year, per employee) under section 4980D of the Internal Revenue Code,\u201d according to the taxmen.\n\nBusiness groups say the punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime.\n\nEven though the total fine is capped at $500,000 per year, that\u2019s still miles ahead of the $2,000 fine that could be waiting for larger companies (those with more than 50 employees) that fail to comply with the individual mandate part of the ACA.\n\nThe NFIB says 14 percent of their members do not provide health insurance plans, but instead offer reimbursement.\n\nThe owner of a Minnesota-based company with 17 employees told NFIB the new rules would require health benefits to go through the payroll process. That means it is subject to taxes, which reduces employees\u2019 benefits and increases the business\u2019 costs.\n\n\u201cReimbursing employees for the cost of insurance or medical services is a way for small businesses to help their workers without the administrative headache of setting up a costly group plan,\u201d said Kuhlman. \u201cMost small employers don\u2019t have HR departments or benefits specialists, so this is a simpler, easier way to help their employees.\u201d\n\nThe prohibition on employer reimbursement was supposed to start last year, but the IRS postponed implementing it until July 1.\n\nThere has been bipartisan support in Congress for eliminating the harsh penalty on small businesses, but bills have not advanced.\n\n\u201cThis would be devastating to small businesses and impose hardships on their employees,\u201d said U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, in January, referring to the potential $100-per-employee-per-day fine. \u201cCongress has to fix this problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Business groups are calling attention to what they say is an obscure part of Obamacare that could crush small businesses who are unaware of it.", "title": "Inside Obamacare: 'the biggest penalty no one is talking about' - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/Obamacare.png", "updated_time": "2015-08-04T21:36:52+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/226796/obamacare-punishes-small-businesses/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Federal Government", "published_time": "2015-07-01T04:00:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-04T21:36:52+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Business groups are calling attention to what they say is an obscure part of Obamacare that could crush small businesses who are unaware of it.", "title": "Inside Obamacare: 'the biggest penalty no one is talking about' - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/03/Obamacare.png"}, "creator": "@ericboehm87", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Business groups are calling attention to what they say is an obscure part of Obamacare that could crush small businesses who are unaware of it."}, "article_summary": "There has been bipartisan support in Congress for eliminating the harsh penalty on small businesses, but bills have not advanced.\nBusiness groups are calling attention to what they say is an obscure part of Obamacare that could crush small businesses who are unaware of it.\nThe NFIB says 14 percent of their members do not provide health insurance plans, but instead offer reimbursement.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest penalty that no one is talking about,\u201d said Kevin Kuhlman, policy director for the National Federation of Independent Businesses, on Tuesday.\nIt seems intended to force employers to offer a group health insurance plan (or leave their employees to fend for themselves on the health insurance exchanges)."}
