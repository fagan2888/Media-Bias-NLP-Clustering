Government contractors who appeared before the House Energy and Commerce committee said that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversaw the website, allotted just two weeks to fully test one of the largest government information technology projects in history.\n\n\u201cMonths would have been nice,\u201d said Andrew Slavitt, of QSSI, a part of UnitedHealth Group charged with testing parts of the troubled web site. Slavitt said in the time his company had to test healthcare.gov, the site meant to serve uninsured people in 36 states, the firm uncovered numerous software bugs and problems. \u201cWe informed CMS that more testing was necessary\u2026[and that] pieces of the system that we had tested that had issues,\u201d said Slavitt.\n\nWhen asked why healthcare.gov was launched as scheduled on Oct. 1 even though problems were identified ahead of time that seemed likely to affect it\u2019s operation, another contractor at the congressional hearing said CMS made the call to proceed anyway. \u201cIt was not our decision to go live\u2026It was CMS\u2019s decision,\u201d said Cheryl Campbell, an executive from CGI Federal, the lead contractor that developed the web site in concert with CMS and other firms. The federal insurance website, which cost about $400 million to develop, build and maintain, was launched the same day that the federal government temporarily shut down over Republican demands that the health care law be delayed, defunded or altered.\n\nThroughout Thursday\u2019s hearing, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers criticized the contractors for offering what was, in retrospect, an overly positive assessment of healthcare.gov\u2019s readiness at a hearing in September. \u201cThey said there was nothing wrong and they expressed nothing but optimism,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette. \u201cThree weeks later, here we are. We\u2019re still hearing reports of significant problems.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, the contractors insisted they fulfilled their responsibilities. They said their individual portions of the project to develop the federally run website for insurance enrollment all worked separately. But when the computer code behind the site was sewn together, the system failed to operate properly. Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes CMS, is scheduled to appear before the same committee on Oct. 30. Ahead of that, Republican committee members on Thursday repeatedly asked for the names of top HHS officials or bureaucrats that made critical decisions before healthcare.gov was rolled out. Campbell said several times that CMS\u2019s Henry Chao, the agency\u2019s deputy chief information officer, was a key decision-maker.\n\nIn written testimony submitted to the committee, Slavitt said a last-minute decision to disable a healthcare.gov function that would allow users to browse health plans without providing personal information to set up accounts contributed to the site\u2019s slowness and crashes. Campbell said CMS decided not to allow such browsing a few weeks before the site was launched. Republican critics have suggested CMS did not want to display total insurance prices, preferring instead to display costs after federal subsidies were applied, which required that users register. Healthcare.gov has subsequently added a limited browsing function that can show prices before registration.\n\nOn a call with reporters after the hearing concluded, Julie Bataille, the director of communications for CMS, said the move to initially not allow browsing was a \u201cbusiness decision,\u201d and declined to elaborate. She also said the pre-launch testing process for healthcare.gov was not as rigorous as it should have been. \u201cThe system just wasn\u2019t tested enough,\u201d she said. More than three years after the health care law was signed by President Obama, Bataille said a \u201ccompressed timeline\u201d made adequate testing impossible.\n\nSince the website went live on Oct. 1, Administration officials, including President Obama, have blamed the site\u2019s woes on unexpected heavy traffic from consumers interested in buying new health insurance. Some consultants who have worked with officials developing exchange websites at the state levels\u201415 states plus the District of Columbia are running their own exchanges\u2014have said heavy volume is not the sole cause of the crashes and error messages plaguing the federal site, pointing to faulty computer code.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s hearing, Democratic Rep. Ann Eshoo said blaming healthcare.gov\u2019s problems on heavy traffic is \u201creally kind of a lame excuse\u2026eBay and Amazon don\u2019t crash the week before Christmas.\u201d\n\nCampbell, of CGI, and Slavitt, of QSSI, said Thursday their firms are working around the clock to fix computer problems that have inhibited healthcare.gov from operating at full capacity. Campbell said the site is improving and will be able to enroll consumers in health plans before a Dec. 15 deadline to purchase coverage that begins Jan. 1. Bataille, talking with reporters, said CMS had put new website testing functions in place since the Oct. 1 launch and said some 700,000 Americans across the country had filed applications for insurance so far.\n\nBut Bataille declined to say how many of these applications were filed through the troubled healthcare.gov site, as opposed to state-run exchange sites, or how many people have successful enrolled, and not just applied. Bataille also did not say whether Sebelius knew about the major website problems before healthcare.gov went live, and declined to identify the technology experts CMS has brought on board in recent days as part of its \u201ctech surge\u201d to help fix the web site.\n\nThese and many more questions remain about how a faulty web site at the centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act was launched earlier this month. Thursday\u2019s House hearing, titled \u201cDidn\u2019t Know or Didn\u2019t Disclose?\u201d did not offer many answers. More may come next week, when Sebelius herself appears before the Energy and Commerce Committee. She\u2019ll face Republicans eager for a chance to show the health care law is fundamentally flawed and Democrats who seem increasingly frustrated that a law they passed at huge political cost isn\u2019t functioning well enough to help many of the people it was intended to serve.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government mismanaged the launch of a federal website meant to provide insurance coverage for millions of Americans under Obamacare, according to testimony before a congressional panel on Thursday.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "In congressional testimony, representatives of the companies hired to build healthcare.gov said the White House didn't give them enough time to fix errors", "title": "404 Accountability Not Found: Contractors Blame Feds for Obamacare Snafu", "url": "http://swampland.time.com/2013/10/24/404-accountability-not-found-contractors-blame-feds-for-obamacare-snafu/", "image": "https://timeswampland.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/185719385.jpg?w=753", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Political insight from the Beltway and beyond", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://swampland.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/11d9978cfec7d5a71822113fdc067df5?s=16", "application-name": "Swampland", "keywords": "health care,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health care,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fca\"", "article_summary": "They said their individual portions of the project to develop the federally run website for insurance enrollment all worked separately.\n\u201cWe informed CMS that more testing was necessary\u2026[and that] pieces of the system that we had tested that had issues,\u201d said Slavitt.\nBut Bataille declined to say how many of these applications were filed through the troubled healthcare.gov site, as opposed to state-run exchange sites, or how many people have successful enrolled, and not just applied.\nShe also said the pre-launch testing process for healthcare.gov was not as rigorous as it should have been.\nSince the website went live on Oct. 1, Administration officials, including President Obama, have blamed the site\u2019s woes on unexpected heavy traffic from consumers interested in buying new health insurance."}
