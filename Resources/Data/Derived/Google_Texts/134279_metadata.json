This seems some pretty strong evidence that holiday purchasing is growing.\n\nTotal Seasonally Adjusted Retail Sales \u2013 Dollar Volume (blue line, left axis), Month-to-Month Change (red line, right axis)\n\nCould this growth be a distortion caused by US Census in their seasonal adjustment process? The unadjusted numbers say things are a little weaker this year.\n\nThe thick purple line in the middle of the graph below is the unadjusted year-over-year growth in retail sales. Note that the rate of growth was lower in November 2013 than it was in November 2012.\n\nUnadjusted Year-over-Year Growth \u2013 Non-store Retailers (blue line), General Merchandise Stores (red line), Autos (green line), Department Stores (orange line), and Total Retail Trade (purple line)\n\nNo question retail is growing \u2013 but likely not growing at the same rate as last year. The major exceptions are autos (green line) whose rate of growth is up, and department stores whose rate of growth has contracted almost 5% from last year.\n\nDo I trust this data? I trust nothing that is called \u201cadvance\u201d from any government reporting agency. It could be too high, too low \u2013 but hardly ever just right. The only confidence level I can assign to this is that the unadjusted growth plots out within the expected range. It could be that the computer program fills in the data using the current trend lines when the data is not available. This is how advance data (and the jobs report which is released too far in advance of reasonably accurate data) miss economic turning points.\n\nAs I am complaining \u2013 you will note that I did not use the word Christmas in describing the Christian gift giving rituals responsible for the \u201choliday season\u201d retail sales increase. I don\u2019t think the founding fathers are smiling at the new interpretation of separation of church and state. Christmas is religious and therefore bad, holidays are good. Without Christmas, there is no retail cheer.\n\nThe retail sales spikes in the above chart are caused by CHRISTMAS \u2013 repeating that this is a CHRISTIAN ritual and not a \u201choliday\u201d created by the USA government.\n\nColor me too old to put up with this nonsense. Merry Christmas.\n\nOther Economic News this Week:\n\nThe Econintersect economic forecast for December 2013 again improved. What this forecast cannot see is the real effect of austerity and Obamacare \u2013 but it does see that business is betting the effects on the economy will be minimal.\n\nThe ECRI WLI growth index value has been weakly in positive territory for over four months \u2013 but in a noticeable improvement trend. The index is indicating the economy six month from today will be slightly better than it is today.\n\nCurrent ECRI WLI Growth Index\n\n/images/z weekly_indexes.PNG\n\nInitial unemployment claims went from 368,000 (reported last week) to 379,000 this week. Historically, claims exceeding 400,000 per week usually occur when employment gains are less than the workforce growth, resulting in an increasing unemployment rate. The real gauge \u2013 the 4 week moving average \u2013 degraded from 328.750 (reported last week) to 343,500. Because of the noise (week-to-week movements from abnormal events AND the backward revisions to previous weeks releases), the 4-week average remains the reliable gauge.\n\nWeekly Initial Unemployment Claims \u2013 4 Week Average \u2013 Seasonally Adjusted \u2013 2011 (red line), 2012 (green line), 2013 (blue line)\n\n/images/z unemployment.PNG\n\nBankruptcies this Week: Privately-held Constar International Holdings\n\nWeekly Economic Release Scorecard:", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "81mKPeNoK2AdXUzIIgladUq0VieusTnqUAUxuRpnjes", "blogcatalog": "9BC9564332", "description": "A new economics based website.
