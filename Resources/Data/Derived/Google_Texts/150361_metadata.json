Noting that \"the clear consensus is it's time for an update to this definition,\" the GWU program asked a variety of healthcare leaders, including 11 CEOs, how they would define the concept.\n\nWhile the responses varied, these leaders primarily described population health as \"an opportunity for healthcare systems, agencies and organizations to work together in order to improve the health outcomes of the communities they serve,\" according to an advance copy of the survey results.\n\nSome, such as Richard J. Gilfillan, M.D., president and CEO of Michigan-based Trinity Health, and Patrick Herson, M.D., president of Minneapolis-based Fairview Medical Group, referenced the Triple Aim of improved care, improved outcomes and reduced cost. Others, like Ryan Jensen, CEO of the Memorial Hospital of Salem County in Salem, New Jersey, tied the concept to the industry's transition from fee-for-service to value-based care.\n\n\"Population health signifies the movement from a silo-focused delivery of medicine to a communal effort with the purpose of improving the overall health outcomes of a population,\" Jensen said.\n\nHowever it is defined, population health management has fueled a number of trends in the healthcare industry, including accountable care organizations, payer-provider collaboration and hospital-community partnerships. In the future, an increased focus on population health may also lead to more assumption of risk in the provider market as well as better infrastructure to manage risk, FierceHealthcare has reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- check out the survey results\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nThe future of population health management\n\nThe key trends behind the growth of population health management\n\nHow Medicaid ACOs can pave the way for population health management\n\nHIMSS15: Population health management is this year's biggest buzzword\n\nThe increasing importance of population health management\n\n3 keys to a successful population health management approach\n\nHow healthcare executives can take the lead in population health management\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Population health management\u00a0is a\u00a0concept embraced by the healthcare industry,\u00a0but because there is no real uniform definition of the term, George Washington University's online Executive Master of Health Administration program decided to ask healthcare leaders their opinions on what it really means.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Population health management\u00a0is a\u00a0concept embraced by the healthcare industry,\u00a0but because there is no real uniform definition of the term, George Washington University's online Executive Master of Health Administration program decided to ask healthcare leaders their opinions on what it really means.", "title": "How do hospital CEOs define population health?", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/how-do-hospital-ceos-define-population-health/2015-04-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs),Care Delivery,Fairview Medical Group,Memorial Hospital of Salem County,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,payer-provider partnerships,Population Health Management,Trinity Health,Triple Aim,value-based care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- check out the survey resultsRelated Articles:The future of population health managementThe key trends behind the growth of population health managementHow Medicaid ACOs can pave the way for population health managementHIMSS15: Population health management is this year's biggest buzzwordThe increasing importance of population health management3 keys to a successful population health management approachHow healthcare executives can take the lead in population health management\n\"Population health signifies the movement from a silo-focused delivery of medicine to a communal effort with the purpose of improving the overall health outcomes of a population,\" Jensen said.\nIn the future, an increased focus on population health may also lead to more assumption of risk in the provider market as well as better infrastructure to manage risk, FierceHealthcare has reported.\nHowever it is defined, population health management has fueled a number of trends in the healthcare industry, including accountable care organizations, payer-provider collaboration and hospital-community partnerships.\nSome have noted, however, that this definition leaves out providers' role in improving health outcomes."}
