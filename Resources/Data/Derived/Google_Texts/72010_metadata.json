Photo by Steve Sands/WireImage\n\nHillary Clinton has been polarizing her entire political career. But now, ahead of a second presidential run, she wants to be a uniter, not a divider. People should \u201cget out of the kind of very unproductive discussion that we\u2019ve had for too long, where people are just in their ideological bunkers, having arguments instead of trying to reach across those divides and have some solutions,\u201d she said, speaking to labor leaders and policy wonks during a Monday event at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank that doubles as the Clinton administration-in-waiting.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nElsewhere in Washington, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities\u2014another left-leaning think tank\u2014released its analysis of the new Republican budgets. \u201cEach budget plan,\u201d notes the CBPP, \u201cderives more than two-thirds of its [approximately $5 trillion] budget cuts from programs for people with low or modest incomes even though these programs constitute less than one-quarter of federal program costs.\u201d This includes billions in cuts to tax credits for working families as well as trillions in cuts to health care for low-income people. At the same time, House Republicans are mulling huge tax relief for the wealthiest Americans; later this week the House Ways and Means Committee will consider a bill to repeal the federal estate tax.\n\nClinton hasn\u2019t announced a full agenda for 2016, much less a campaign for president. But when she does, it will stand on the opposite bank of anything offered by Republicans, with a vast distance between the two. She will give a plan for growing the welfare state. They will offer a plan for gutting it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPut differently, she has to know that there\u2019s no way to bring the two sides together. Democrats and Republicans aren\u2019t just polarized; they\u2019ve adopted distinct ideologies, and they\u2019ve prioritized a maximalist approach to using power and influence. The first two years of the Obama administration weren\u2019t modest. Part of this was a massive economic crisis that demanded a proportional response, but part of it was policy ambition. From the stimulus to the auto bailouts, Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank, and a host of other, smaller policies, Obama and the Democrats steered the country in a much more liberal direction than any president and Congress since Lyndon Johnson.\n\nLikewise, if elected president in 2012, Mitt Romney had promised a full repudiation of the Obama administration. His White House would have slashed social spending, repealed the Affordable Care Act, and pushed a sweeping agenda of broad tax cuts and deregulation. It would have been a complete ideological victory, scored without any input from liberals.\n\nIf elected president, Hillary Clinton won\u2019t bring anyone together.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the \u201ctogetherness\u201d talk is unreasonable. The public craves political comity and wants its leaders to affirm values like cooperation and bipartisanship. And even if they\u2019ve built their appeal on the opposite, most politicians will oblige. \u201cThe answer will not come from Washington,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz\u2014of all people\u2014in his presidential announcement speech. \u201cIt will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country, when the American people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that have made this country great.\u201d\n\nBut even if they try\u2014and candidates tend to pursue their promises once in office\u2014there\u2019s no way anyone can keep this pledge. If elected president, Hillary Clinton won\u2019t bring anyone together, just like Barack Obama didn\u2019t overcome bitter partisanship and George W. Bush couldn\u2019t sustain the national unity of his first two years in office (not that it was a huge priority). Not only are presidents pressured by party elites and activists with distinct visions, but the public is more polarized, and less willing to give approval or support to presidents from the other side. It\u2019s why Clinton polarized more than Bush, why the second Bush polarized more than Clinton, and why Obama stands as the most polarizing president we have known\u2014until we elect the next one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIndeed, the only person in the present presidential field who seems to understand that political comity is a fool\u2019s errand is Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, which, given his record for sowing ideological rancor, isn\u2019t a surprise. In 2013\u2014just after the government shutdown\u2014he spoke at a breakfast for reporters in Washington, D.C. And when asked about polarization, he refused to say he could bridge the divide:\n\n\u201cFor years, the conventional wisdom was that Americans want divided government,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019ve seen in the last few years that that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing. Instead of checks and balances you get a lot of gridlock.\u201d \u2026\n\n\u201cWhat we learned in Wisconsin and what many of the other battleground states, particularly in the Midwest, learned during the 2010 election, was that if you want to get big, bold reform done in your state you need a team to help you do that. So in our case everything switched from Democratic control to Republican control in 2010 and that empowered us to go out and make reforms that would\u2019ve been much more difficult without those changes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Clinton wants to echo Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign of change and togetherness. But, as per her critique in the 2008 Democratic primaries, Obama\u2019s message was a mistake. Outside of the most technical or non-salient issues, there\u2019s no chance of bipartisan cooperation in the next presidential administration, and to promise otherwise is to set yourself up for failure. The only way a President Hillary Clinton will succeed in 2017 is if she has a Democratic Congress to pass her policies, confirm her judges, and staff her administration.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Forget all this talk about uniting America.
