And Texas has the third-highest property taxes in the U.S.\n\nAlso galling to the business community is research showing that for every $1 the state paid toward Medicaid expansion, it would earn back $1.30 in new economic activity, which would include the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\n\"You look at the numbers, and you say, this is a no-brainer,\" said Ray Perryman, a leading Texas economist, in an interview with NPR.\n\nRead MoreObamacare case is political pickle for Republicans\n\n\n\nBut no change is likely in the near future as the Texas Legislature isn't even debating the merits of expanding Medicaid.\n\nMedicaid expansion is a key component of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act and its goal of providing coverage to uninsured Americans. An estimated quarter of all low-income adults without health insurance in the U.S. live in Texas, more than 1 million people.\n\nTraditional Medicaid is jointly run by the federal government and individual states, and enrollees do not pay premiums for their health coverage. States have the power to set restrictions on who can receive coverage, whose costs are split, more or less evenly, with the federal government.\n\nIn Texas, no childless adult can obtain Medicaid coverage. And adults with children who earn above 19 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $3,800 for a family of three, are also barred from coverage in Texas.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Texas is forgoing about $100 billion in federal funds by rejecting the idea of expanding a major health program for the poor to more adults.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Texas is forgoing about $100 billion in federal funds by not expanding a major health program for the poor.", "title": "Don't mess with Medicaid expansion?
