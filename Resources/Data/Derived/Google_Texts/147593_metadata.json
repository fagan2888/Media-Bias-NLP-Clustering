Presidential candidates have discussed the matter on the campaign trail, and lawmakers in Washington have put forward proposals aimed at providing relief from that sector.\n\nBut the latest data show that even with an economy on the mend, more and more borrowers are finding the debt too much to handle.\n\nWhile more and more borrowers aren\u2019t paying back student loans, the New York Fed found that just 95,000 Americans added a foreclosure to their credit reports, the lowest ever level in the 16-year survey.\n\nClimbing delinquencies in student loan debt came even as overall delinquencies fell in the second quarter to 5.6 percent, down slightly from 5.7 percent in the first quarter of the year.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The number of Americans failing to pay back their student loans is growing, even as overall delinquencies are in decline, according to a new report.", "description": "The number of Americans failing to pay back their student loans is growing, even as overall delinquencies are in decline, according to a new report.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Schroeder", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The number of Americans failing to pay back their student loans is growing, even as overall delinquencies are in decline, according to a new report.", "title": "Student loan delinquencies on the rise", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/251044-student-loan-delinquencies-on-the-rise", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/students_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/251044-student-loan-delinquencies-on-the-rise", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-13T13:14-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Schroeder", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Student loan, Debt,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-13T13:14:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/251044-student-loan-delinquencies-on-the-rise", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The number of Americans failing to pay back their student loans is growing, even as overall delinquencies are in decline, according to a new report.", "card": "summary", "title": "Student loan delinquencies on the rise"}, "dcterms.title": "Student loan delinquencies on the rise"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6804\"", "article_summary": "Climbing delinquencies in student loan debt came even as overall delinquencies fell in the second quarter to 5.6 percent, down slightly from 5.7 percent in the first quarter of the year.\nADVERTISEMENTThat 0.4 percent increase in delinquencies was twice as much as any other form of consumer credit, and comes as student loan debt has emerged as the largest form of non-housing consumer debt.\nDelinquencies were defined as payments past due by more than 90 days, and climbed as the overall amount of student loan debt held steady at $1.19 trillion.\nThe number of Americans failing to pay back their student loans is growing, even as overall delinquencies are in decline, according to a new report.\nStudent loans overtook auto loans and credit card debt as the nation\u2019s largest pile of non-mortgage consumer debt in 2012."}
