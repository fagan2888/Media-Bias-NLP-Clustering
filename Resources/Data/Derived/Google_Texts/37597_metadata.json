She also served as program manager for the creation and opening of Baptist South Hospital.\n\nIn 2013, Volunteers in Medicine cared for more than 1,700 patients and has the capacity to serve many more.\n\nThe organization serves the uninsured employed who live or work in Duval County, are employed for a minimum of 20 hours per week and earn $13,000-$27,000 annually.\n\nThe services include primary and specialty care, mental health counseling and nutritional counseling, and are provided by volunteer physicians and nurse practitioners from area hospitals including Baptist Health, Mayo Clinic and St. Vincent\u0092s HealthCare.\n\nThe clinic\u0092s fundraising campaign aims to raise $125,000 this year. An anonymous donor has agreed to match up to $25,000 in donations made by Sept. 15.\n\nContributions can be made at vim-jax.org under the donations tab, or by contacting the organization at (904) 399-2766, ext. 123.\n\nFidelity Investments volunteers at Terry Parker High School\n\nOn Saturday, more than 100 Fidelity Investments employees worked with volunteers from Florida Blue and Winn-Dixie and students and teachers at Terry Parker High School\u0092s Transformation Day.\n\nThe day is an annual event to make interior and exterior renovations to the school.\n\nProjects included creating a caf\u00e9 that will be managed by culinary students and a fitness center for teachers and female students.\n\nVolunteers performed landscaping projects, painted murals and distributed classroom supply kits to teachers.\n\nTransformation events are part of Fidelity\u0092s focus on supporting the communities where employees work and live. The events are in partnership with HandsOn Network and Points of Light, the world\u0092s largest organization dedicated to volunteer service. HandsOn Jacksonville, the local affiliate of the HandsOn Network, provides project management for corporate employee volunteer programs.\n\nThe organization handles the logistics, so employees are able to simply show up, get to work and make a difference.\n\nJaguars Foundation supports veterans\n\nA $10,000 grant from the Jaguars Foundation will help provide scholarships to veterans seeking their initial pilot\u0092s license at Jacksonville University\u0092s Davis Aviation Center.\n\nThe program is supported by the Jaguars Foundation on behalf of the city\u0092s Veterans Resource and Reintegration Center.\n\nThe university will provide matching funds for two or more scholarships of up to $10,000 for the 2014-15 academic year.\n\n\u0093Many of our nation\u0092s veterans have dreamed of becoming pilots,\u0094 said Capt. Mark Willette, JU associate director of aeronautics.\n\n\u0093This award will help bridge the funding gap that sometimes cannot be overcome through VA benefits alone, and puts in place a \u0091safety net\u0092 that will give veterans studying aviation at Jacksonville University a fighting chance to succeed without the added pressure of a financial shortfall,\u0094 Willette added.\n\nFor student veterans pursuing a career in aviation, the Post 9/11 GI Bill covers only the cost of flight school tuition.\n\nFlight fees are not covered and veterans must assume the $10,000 cost, and sometimes more, out of their own pockets.\n\nThe center\u0092s Aviation Management and Flight Operations and Aviation Management programs require students to earn their private pilot\u0092s license, which typically requires 50 hours of logged flight time.\n\n\u0091Putt For The Fallen\u0092 at Adventure Landing\n\nFamily Entertainment Centers across the nation have joined forces to support children going to college by participating in the Putt For The Fallen nationwide fundraiser.\n\nDuring September, Adventure Landing will ask guests for a $5 donation in exchange for a paper golf ball. Donors will receive recognition by writing their names on the ball and also will receive a free round of mini-golf with the purchase of a round, for their next visit.\n\nThere are 17 family entertainment centers operated by Adventure Landing, with three in Northeast Florida: 1944 Beach Blvd. in Jacksonville Beach, 4825 Blanding Blvd. in Jacksonville, and 2780 Florida 16 in St. Augustine.\n\nThe money will benefit Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing college scholarships and long-term educational counseling to children who lost a parent in the line of duty.\n\n\u0093The fact that the foundation is military-related and helps children is what sparked our interest. We are in the business of entertaining children and families, and this seemed like a perfect fit for us,\u0094 said Hank Woodburn, owner of Adventure Landing. \u0093We decided to participate because 100 percent of the proceeds that we raise for them benefit the children who have lost a child in the line of duty.\u0094\n\nFor information about Children of Fallen Patriots Foundation and other ways to help the children of fallen soldiers, visit fallenpatriots.com.\n\nMaliVai Washington Youth Foundations needs tweets\n\nThe MaliVai Washington Youth Foundation is one of 10 national junior tennis and learning programs to receive a $10,000 grant through a partnership between Chase and the USTA Founda-tion.\n\nChase isn\u0092t stopping at $100,000. All 10 communities are competing for an additional $10,000 via Twitter.\n\nThe competition will continue through Wednesday.

Recent hires include positions in parts warehouse work, auto detailing, food service, sewing, and housekeeping.\n\nKristin Keen, executive director of Rethreaded, said she initially placed two women from City Rescue Mission to complete a contract from Venus Swim & Fashion, but \u0093they did so well we decided to hire them part-time.\u0094\n\nCity Rescue Mission has been caring for the homeless and needy in Northeast Florida since 1946.\n\nIn addition to the New Life Inn homeless shelter Downtown, the organization offers an 18-month, Christian-based addiction recovery program called LifeBuilders and the New Day workforce development program. The mission accepts no government financial support.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Jacksonville, Florida, Newspaper, The Financial News and Daily Record", "description": "Mary Pat Corrigan, a senior leadership professional with more than 20 years of experience in health care and information technology, has..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac1b\"", "article_summary": "Mary Pat Corrigan, a senior leadership professional with more than 20 years of experience in health care and information technology, has been named chief executive officer of Volunteers in Medicine.\nThe not-for-profit organization runs a health care clinic that provides integrated physical and behavioral health care to the area\u0092s working uninsured.\n\u0093Mary Pat brings her keen leadership and health care expertise to Volunteers in Medicine at a time when there is much confusion in the marketplace about health care reform and the impact of the Affordable Care Act,\u0094 said Leo Alonso, chairman of the board for Volunteers in Medicine.\nIn 2013, Volunteers in Medicine cared for more than 1,700 patients and has the capacity to serve many more.\nFidelity Investments volunteers at Terry Parker High SchoolOn Saturday, more than 100 Fidelity Investments employees worked with volunteers from Florida Blue and Winn-Dixie and students and teachers at Terry Parker High School\u0092s Transformation Day."}
