Following up on her success at getting Subway to eliminate the \u201cyoga mat chemical\u201d from its bread, on Wednesday Hari began a campaign targeted at Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors, asking them to voluntarily provide that information. The petition read:\n\nMillions of people consume your beverages not knowing what\u2019s actually in them. We know more about the ingredients in Windex and Coca Cola than we do about your beers. It\u2019s time for this lack of transparency to end. Please provide a full list of ingredients for all your beer product lines on your website. As you know, the Treasury Department allows a laundry list of additives, stabilizers, and flavor enhancers in beer. Many of these ingredients are allergens or could be harmful. Consumers have the right to know what they are drinking.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The beer company publicly posted its ingredients list for the first time", "title": "What\u2019s in a bottle of Budweiser?
