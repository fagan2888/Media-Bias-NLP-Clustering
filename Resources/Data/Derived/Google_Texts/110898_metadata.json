Sam Brownback, a Republican, just signed a bill prohibiting his state\u2019s welfare recipients from spending public aid on items and services that range from liquor to lottery tickets. Also off limits are tattoos, psychic readings, theme park passes and concert tickets.\n\nSLIDESHOW: 30 Things You Can\u2019t Buy on Welfare\n\nMany other states \u2013 nearly half the states \u2013 restrict the ways in which government assistance can be used. The purchase of alcohol, tobacco and adult entertainment, for example, is off limits across the board. Although enforcement is hardly ironclad, there are penalties for rulebreakers.\n\nAt least 37 states issue their TANF cash benefits through electronic benefit transfer cards. These EBT cards function much like any other debit card: Users can withdraw cash and make purchases as they see fit. But to cut down on fraud, a number of states have been restricting the venues at which these cards can be used and the purchases that can be made with them.

Guns are not off limits in Kansas, however (because residents might need them for hunting for food, or to defend themselves against a home invasion or other threat to their person or property). Indiana, however, does not allow gun store purchases with TANF benefits, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nInterestingly, in Missouri right now, legislators are considering banning from the state\u2019s food stamp program the purchase of cookies, chips and other junk food selections \u2013 and seafood and steak as well.\n\nClick here to see the 30 items you can\u2019t buy if you\u2019re on welfare.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Residents of the Sunflower State who receive public assistance through the Temporary A", "title": "30 Things You Can\u2019t Buy If You\u2019re on Welfare", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/17/30-Things-You-Can-t-Buy-If-You-re-Welfare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Theme_Parks.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/17/30-Things-You-Can-t-Buy-If-You-re-Welfare", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Theme_Parks.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Residents of the Sunflower State who receive public assistance through the Temporary A", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Click here to see the 30 items you can\u2019t buy if you\u2019re on welfare.\nSLIDESHOW: 30 Things You Can\u2019t Buy on WelfareMany other states \u2013 nearly half the states \u2013 restrict the ways in which government assistance can be used.\nSam Brownback, a Republican, just signed a bill prohibiting his state\u2019s welfare recipients from spending public aid on items and services that range from liquor to lottery tickets.\nClick here to see a list of states that limit welfare purchases.\nAt least 37 states issue their TANF cash benefits through electronic benefit transfer cards."}
