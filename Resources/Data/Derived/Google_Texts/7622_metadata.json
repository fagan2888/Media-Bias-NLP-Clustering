A suspicious fire in the house at 245 Joline Avenue followed. All of the victims had gunshot wounds, but a medical examiner determined Shane Beharry\u2019s injuries were self-inflicted.\n\nHowever, their extended family members have sought to raise doubts about the information released by authorities. They have publicly questioned whether a gun was actually recovered at the scene and they want to know what other evidence investigators have that makes them conclude that it was Shane Beharry who murdered his family.\n\nCharles Webster, spokesman for the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, has declined to comment on whether a weapon was recovered at the scene or whether they suspect Beharry set the house on fire before his death.\n\nDespite what authorities say happened, Shane Beharry is still part of the family, said Avika Lalloo, the sister of Amanda Morris.\n\n\"Regardless of what he did, we still love him,\" she has previously told the Press. \"He loved his kids ... and they loved him so much.\"\n\nMultiple 911 calls came in from the Long Branch neighborhood at 11:48 p.m. Tuesday, reporting a fire at the Beharry home. Firefighters struggled to break down the front door, but managed to enter the single-family home through a side-door and contained the blaze.\n\nAll four victims were found huddled together in a second floor bedroom. They were taken to Monmouth Medical Center but died despite efforts to save them, all according to the Prosecutor's Office.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations in memory of Brandon and Brian Beharry be made to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia Foundation, P.O. Box 781352, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19178-1352.\n\nLetters of condolence may be made online through the funeral home www.damianofuneralhome.com.\n\nThe deaths remain under investigation by the Prosecutor's Office and Long Branch Police Department. Authorities ask that anyone with information call Monmouth County Detective Pamela Ricciardi at 1-800-533-7443 or Long Branch Police Detective Rich O\u2019Brien at 732-222-1000.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1EITghy", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Lyndon \u201cShane\u201d Beharry is to be memorialized alongside the family authorities said he murdered, before ending his own life.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Lyndon \u201cShane\u201d Beharry is to be memorialized alongside the family authorities said he murdered, before ending his own life.", "title": "Funeral plans set in Long Branch murder-suicide", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/monmouth-county/2015/09/05/funeral-plans-set-long-branch-murder-suicide/71794926/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lyndon \u201cShane\u201d Beharry is to be memorialized alongside the family authorities said he murdered, before ending his own life.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d83c9975d2809c3da00c9cbcb947b927b0dc5ff6/c=490-0-1911-1421&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/05/NJGroup/AsburyPark/635770893710552408-LongBranchMurder-Suicide.jpg", "title": "Funeral plans set in Long Branch murder-suicide", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Long Branch murder-suicide, Lyndon Shane Beharry, family murdered in New Jersey, Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, crime in Long Branch"}, "article_summary": "Multiple 911 calls came in from the Long Branch neighborhood at 11:48 p.m. Tuesday, reporting a fire at the Beharry home.\nAuthorities ask that anyone with information call Monmouth County Detective Pamela Ricciardi at 1-800-533-7443 or Long Branch Police Detective Rich O\u2019Brien at 732-222-1000.\nThe deaths remain under investigation by the Prosecutor's Office and Long Branch Police Department.\nVisitation for all four family members will be held from 4 p.m. until the time of the service at 8 p.m. at the Damiano Funeral Home at 191 Franklin Ave. in Long Branch.\nDespite what authorities say happened, Shane Beharry is still part of the family, said Avika Lalloo, the sister of Amanda Morris."}
