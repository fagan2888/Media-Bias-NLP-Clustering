On the “The Big Bang Theory,” she wasn’t seen on camera as the mother of Simon Helberg’s character, Howard, but her character’s loud voice with a Brooklyn accent was instantly recognizable.

The executive producers of the CBS sitcom say Susi was a beloved member of the “Big Bang Theory” family, and they praised her “immense talent and comedic timing.”

Susi is survived by her brother, Michael Susi, and his wife, Connie.
