One response card read: \u201cDavid Lynch should be shot.\u201d (Producer) Dino De Laurentiis was unfazed, but the negative feedback lowered expectations considerably, which may have worked to Lynch\u2019s advantage. When Blue Velvet opened on September 19, 1986, in fifteen American cities, some of the most influential critics were effusive in their praise. J. Hoberman proclaimed it \u201ca film of ecstatic creepiness\u201d and lauded its \u201cboldly alien perspective\u201d in the Village Voice. In the Chicago Tribune, Dave Kehr raved: \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything else quite like it, and it\u2019s pretty wonderful.\u201d The detractors were no less vociferous. Roger Ebert\u2019s one-star review in the Chicago Sun-Times bemoaned its \u201csophomoric satire and cheap shots.\u201d In the New York Post, Rex Reed pronounced it \u201cone of the sickest films ever made.\u201d Pro or con, the reviews tended to make things personal, as befits a film that was unmistakably \u201ccharged with its maker\u2019s psychosexual energy,\u201d in Hoberman\u2019s words. Ebert accused Lynch of being even more sadistic than the psychopathic Frank Booth in submitting Rossellini to all manner of on-screen humiliations. In her New York Times rave, Janet Maslin wrote that the film confirmed Lynch\u2019s \u201cstature as an innovator, a superb technician, and someone best not encountered in a dark alley.\u201d\n\nBlue Velvet became an instant cult film, a lightning rod for think pieces, and as more people saw it, the reactions grew ever more polarized. The conservative journal National Review branded the movie pornographic, \u201ca piece of mindless junk.\u201d The Christian Century named it the magazine\u2019s film of the year, praising its serious treatment of sin and evil and even invoking Saint Paul\u2019s Epistle to the Romans. Lines formed around the block in New York City and Los Angeles; there were reports of mass walkouts and refund demands. A Newsweek article, headlined \u201cBlack and Blue Is Beautiful?\u201d, described the clamorous scene at theaters. A man fainted at a Chicago screening; after having his pacemaker checked, he went back to catch the ending. Outside a Los Angeles cinema, two strangers got into a heated disagreement, which they decided to resolve by going back in for a second viewing. For Hopper, Blue Velvet was the crowning achievement of his latest comeback from Hollywood exile. While Frank Booth is remembered as one of his defining roles, he earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for playing the town drunk in that same year\u2019s much tamer sports movie Hoosiers. Rossellini had by far the riskier part, as the reactions made clear. Her agents at ICM dropped her upon seeing the film; the nuns at her old school in Rome called to say they were praying for her. (After the media storm subsided, Lynch and Rossellini confirmed that they were a couple. He separated from Mary Fisk in 1987.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange world,\u201d the people of Lumberton keep telling one another, and the lasting impression is that it never gets less strange. So too with Blue Velvet. The critical enthusiasm at the time of its release \u2014 many reviewers put it on their year-end lists \u2014 propelled Lynch to a second, even less probable Academy Award nomination for directing. He lost to Oliver Stone for Platoon, which also won Best Picture. Yet Blue Velvet has weathered the passage of time better than any other Oscar nominee that year, possibly better than any Hollywood movie of its decade. The shock of the new fades by definition, but if it has hardly done so in the case of Blue Velvet, that may be because its tone remains forever elusive. To peruse the early reviews is to sense the emergence of the slipperiest of sensibilities, one that no one quite knew how to talk about. To encounter or revisit the film now, decades later, is to realize that we still don\u2019t.\n\nThe stiff acting and stilted dialogue inch Blue Velvet just past the realm of realism into a space without signposts that gets more disorienting the longer you stay in it. MacLachlan modeled some aspects of his straight-faced, bright-eyed character on his director \u2014 Jeffrey wears his shirts buttoned to the top \u2014 and he also sounds an awful lot like him, especially when he gets excited. (\u201cThere are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of a mystery.\u201d) The difficulties of interpreting Blue Velvet are best illustrated in the night scene in the car opposite the church, when Jeffrey poses his pained rhetorical questions about the existence of evil and Sandy responds with her dewy, evangelical vision of the robins bringing love and light. Are they serious? Is Lynch? Some journalists asked him if the characters\u2019 exaggerated sincerity was meant to be funny. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but squirt out a laugh,\u201d he told the Village Voice. \u201cThese days to be cool, you don\u2019t say stuff like that out loud. It\u2019s almost more embarrassing in a certain way than Frank stuffing blue velvet up Dorothy.\u201d\n\nEbert\u2019s review faulted the film precisely for combining both kinds of embarrassment: encouraging laughter one minute, subjecting characters and viewers to obscene brutalities the next. The incursion of humor was taken as proof of an ironic stance, which in turn signaled subversive intent or a cynical detachment from the material. But things are never so clear-cut in the Lynchian universe, where sincerity and irony can coexist without canceling each other out. If anything his natural instinct is to combine them, nest one within the other, twist these familiar categories together until new registers of feeling materialize. In 1993, three years before he published Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace wrote an essay on the deadening effects of television on literary fiction and the tyranny of \u201cinstitutionalized irony,\u201d a language and a lens that had become our default mode of communication. Lynch, without exactly intending to, was already resisting this mode with Blue Velvet. This is a particularly tricky film not for an audience that doesn\u2019t recognize irony, but for one that can see only through irony.\n\nBlue Velvet is a critical theorist\u2019s dream, a dark comedy of category confusion. \u201cHello, baby,\u201d Dorothy greets Frank, who snaps, \u201cIt\u2019s Daddy, you shithead.\u201d Within minutes, he\u2019s calling her \u201cMommy\u201d and moaning \u201cBaby wants to fuck.\u201d What is left to decipher when everything has been declared? An emblem of the postmodern moment, the film was also several steps ahead. It seemed to demand a new way of understanding narrative art, one that had little to do with traditional identification or protective irony or the sifting of symbols and metaphors for deeper meanings. What usually lurks on the level of subtext is here elevated to the status of text. When Jeffrey says he\u2019s \u201cseeing something that was always hidden,\u201d he\u2019s also voicing the modus operandi of a film that is rife with signs yet impervious to decoding. Blue Velvet leaves the unnerving impression that it has done for us the work of analysis without so much as scratching the bright, shiny surface.\n\n*\n\nLynch would engineer more decisive temporal ruptures in his later films, but Blue Velvet represents his most haunting manipulation of time in cinema, a palimpsest through which multiple eras and genres are visible. On the most obvious level, cars and interior decor, wardrobes and hairstyles all seem to have drifted in from different decades. Jeffrey\u2019s skinny tie and pierced ear, which goes unremarked, are very much of the 1980s, but Sandy and her classmates favor the long skirts of a more conservative time. Beyond such period markers, the movie also activates a host of archetypes from old Hollywood genres, slightly warped in their transposition to the present. Jeffrey on occasion resembles a film noir patsy, just as Dorothy evokes a femme fatale; Sandy, meanwhile, could have wandered out of a Sandra Dee vehicle.\n\nThe stars came with their own cultural baggage. The method actor who veered closest to madness, Hopper was a one-man history of the counterculture, born to be wild, as Easy Rider\u2019s signature anthem puts it. Frank seethes with the cumulative rage and mania of all the hell-raisers who preceded him, from the juvenile delinquent in Rebel Without a Cause to the ranting lunatic in Apocalypse Now. Rossellini\u2019s resemblance to her mother is impossible to miss from certain angles, even more so when she speaks in that husky alto. The sense that she is acting out scenarios that were expressly forbidden, maybe never even dreamed of, in the Hollywood heyday of Ingrid Bergman, who played her share of masochists in films like Gaslight and Notorious, lends the sex scenes a ghostly Oedipal charge. Free-floating signifiers abound, redolent of national myths and traumas. Dorothy is apparently named after the heroine of The Wizard of Oz, a parallel-universe urtext and a touchstone for Lynch; Hopper, as Lynch pointed out to some interviewers, was from Kansas. Dorothy lives in the bad part of town on Lincoln Street (an ominous close-up lingers on the street sign), and Frank Booth seems to be named for the sixteenth president\u2019s assassin.\n\nBut for all the mismatched period details in Blue Velvet, the film has a special relationship with the American midcentury, with what Lynch has called \u201ceuphoric 1950s chrome optimism.\u201d \u201cFrom the \u201920s up to 1958, or maybe 1963, are my favorite years,\u201d Lynch has said, adding, \u201cThe \u201970s, to me, were about the worst! There can be things in the \u201980s that I love \u2014 high-tech things, New Wave things which echo the \u201950s.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just Lynch: The 1950s obsession was a 1980s phenomenon. Blue Velvet came a year after Robert Zemeckis\u2019s Back to the Future, the highest-grossing film of 1985, which sent teen idol Michael J. Fox, a clean-scrubbed Kyle MacLachlan type minus the dark side, via time machine three decades into the past. Having assimilated the postmodern tendency toward pastiche and the pop art trope of repurposing the relics of mass culture, the zeitgeist was especially prone to backward glances, sometimes quizzical but mostly fond and even longing. Peter Bogdanovich\u2019s The Last Picture Show (1971) and George Lucas\u2019s American Graffiti (1973), both set in prelapsarian times, anticipated the nostalgia cycle. By the 1980s, most major American directors had made their contributions. High school reunions serve as jumping-off points for Jonathan Demme\u2019s Something Wild (1986), bracketed by Fredric Jameson with Blue Velvet as a quintessential \u201cnostalgia film,\u201d and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s Peggy Sue Got Married (1986), in which a middle-aged woman winds up trapped inside her seventeen-year-old self. Steven Spielberg\u2019s science-fiction fables Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) fused two strains of Cold War nostalgia, combining alien fantasies with Norman Rockwell imagery.", "article_metadata": {"description": "That was an actual test-card response to Lynch's creepy '80s classic, celebrating its 30th anniversary this year", "title": "\u201cDavid Lynch should be shot\u201d: Looking back on the madness and chaos of \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d and Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201980s", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "That was an actual test-card response to Lynch's creepy '80s classic, celebrating its 30th anniversary this year", "title": "\u201cDavid Lynch should be shot\u201d: Looking back on the madness and chaos of \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d and Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201980s", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/26/david_lynch_should_be_shot_looking_back_on_the_madness_and_chaos_of_blue_velvet_and_ronald_reagans_80s/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/blue_velvet2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "That was an actual test-card response to Lynch's creepy '80s classic, celebrating its 30th anniversary this year", "title": "\u201cDavid Lynch should be shot\u201d: Looking back on the madness and chaos of \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d and Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201980s", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/blue_velvet2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dennis Lim", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Blue Velvet, Books, David Lynch, Dennis Hopper, Editor's Picks, Movies, Ronald Reagan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "For Hopper, Blue Velvet was the crowning achievement of his latest comeback from Hollywood exile.\nTopics: Blue Velvet, Books, David Lynch, Dennis Hopper, Editor's Picks, Movies, Ronald Reagan, Entertainment NewsDavid Lynch\u2019s films have rarely fared well at test screenings, and Blue Velvet triggered some of the worst early reactions of his career.\nWhen Blue Velvet opened on September 19, 1986, in fifteen American cities, some of the most influential critics were effusive in their praise.\nBlue Velvet leaves the unnerving impression that it has done for us the work of analysis without so much as scratching the bright, shiny surface.\nBlue Velvet is a critical theorist\u2019s dream, a dark comedy of category confusion."}
