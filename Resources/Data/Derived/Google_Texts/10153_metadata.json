Ballot secrecy, declared AFP Virginia\u2019s Ben Marchi, was \u201cthe bedrock of our democracy.\u201d AFP waged a loud and sustained campaign on behalf of the secret ballot in union fights.\n\nToo bad AFP doesn\u2019t practice what it preaches. If it did, then it would not have sent out \u201cvoter audits\u201d tattling on people who, AFP believes, do not vote with sufficient regularity.\n\nAs the Chesterfield Observer reported last week, county resident Steve Serrao got one such report card in June. It listed him as a non-voter. His wife, Renee, who teaches government, strenuously disputes that. \u201cWe\u2019re contacting you and your neighbors today to let folks know who does and who doesn\u2019t vote,\u201d the report card says. \u201cAs you can see below, your neighbors who have voted are concerned about the community\u2019s well-being. Are you?\u201d\n\nNancy Meacham of Roanoke got a similarly ominous audit from the group in November\u2014as did others around the state. Many of them felt, quite rightly, that the mailings amounted to rank voter intimidation.\n\nAFP wasn\u2019t the only group this year to employ such tactics. So did the Democratic Party of Virginia. \u201cThe chart below shows your household\u2019s public voting record in past elections as well as an empty space which we will fill to indicate if you vote in this year\u2019s election on Tuesday, November 5th,\u201d reads that party\u2019s mau-mauing missive. \u201cWe intend to mail you an updated chart after the election that will show whether or not you voted. We will leave the space blank if you do not vote.\u201d\n\nAccording to state officials, the left-wing Voter Participation Center likewise sent out similar letters to citizens it deemed \u201cBELOW AVERAGE.\u201d \u201cAfter the election,\u201d the VPC wrote, \u201cwe will re-evaluate your voting record and hope to share it with your neighbors to see if there is improvement.\u201d\n\nThe VPC gained notoriety last summer when, as The Times-Dispatch reported, it sent 200,000 voter registration forms, many to \u201calready registered voters, as well as to children, non-citizens, the deceased and family pets.\u201d\n\nThis was not fraud itself, but it was a long way from seemly. In 2008, a felon used a form sent by the VPC to vote illegally, for which she received a (suspended) 10-year sentence. Is AFP proud to emulate the tactics of the VPC? For that matter, is the liberal group proud to emulate the tactics of the conservative one?\n\nNone of the senders should be proud of invading other people\u2019s privacy and harassing them to do something they are under no obligation to do: The right to vote also entails the right not to vote.\n\nNo one should have to justify exercising a right; rights, by definition, justify themselves. Nevertheless, for many people, not voting is an entirely rational choice: The cost of learning about the candidates and the issues often outweighs the benefit to be had from casting a ballot whose odds of making a significant difference in the outcome are infinitesimal.\n\nMany people make a much bigger difference through other means\u2014mentoring kids, volunteering, charity and civic groups. Government is far from the only avenue for doing good.\n\nYet the threatening tenor of the mailings suggests there is something shameful about exercising such a right. Public shaming of this sort is nothing new; it has been used often throughout history \u2014 usually by exceedingly undemocratic and illiberal regimes, such as ancient Rome, Puritan America, contemporary Iran and 20th century communism.\n\nIt is the communist culture\u2014citizens informing upon citizens, show trials for dissidents and backsliders\u2014that echoes most loudly in the letters: \u201cComrade Jones has squandered the opportunity he has been provided to strive for the betterment of the People. The People have a right to expect that Comrade Jones will direct his every effort to the class struggle. By setting his own ego and contentment above the interests of the proletariat, Comrade Jones has demonstrated behavior unworthy of a Bolshevik. He has betrayed his fellow citizens, who have committed themselves completely to the collective good.. . .\u201d\n\nMany people\u2014harried single mothers, fathers working two jobs, adult children caring for sick parents \u2014 simply have more pressing things to do on Election Day than vote. AFP and Co. might think otherwise. If so, too bad: It\u2019s not their call to make\u2014and none of their business in the first place.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/11/27/informing-on-non-voters-has-no-place-in", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "People have the right to troop to the polls, or not, as they please.", "title": "Shaming Non-Voters Has No Place In a Free Society"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "description": "\u201cThe privacy of the ballot booth is a core American value,\u201d\ndeclared James Valvo, director of government affairs for Americans\nfor Prosperity, two years ago. \u201cAllowing individuals to make their\nown decisions about their government \u2026 free from coercion from\neither side, is paramount.\u201d\nValvo was criticizing \u201ccard-check\u201d legislation to let unions\norganize through other than secret ballots\u2014and he wasn\u2019t alone.\nBallot secrecy, declared AFP Virginia\u2019s Ben Marchi, was \u201cthe\nbedrock of our democracy.\u201d AFP waged a loud and sustained campaign\non behalf of the secret ballot in union fights.\nToo bad AFP doesn\u2019t practice what it preaches.
