Hoven, SD

Officials in the northern South Dakota town of Hoven expect to break ground on a new school this fall, more than a year after a fire destroyed the local high school.



Hoven School Board President Mark Weber tells the American News that the district has hired an architecture firm to lead the project. The bid date for the project is planned for Aug. 1 and construction should begin around the same time that the 2015-2016 school year starts.



A blaze in May left the town of about 400 people without a high school. The school had stood for over 70 years.



Seventh-graders through seniors have been taking classes at the former Holy Infant Hospital since August.



Superintendent Pat Jones has said the school's insurance policy will pay for the construction.
