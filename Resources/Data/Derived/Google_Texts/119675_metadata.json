They are warning people who may have come in contact with the infected person to take precautions.\n\nSo far this year there have been 52 cases of measles in California. Last year during the same period there were just four.\n\nPublic health said anyone at the Olive Garden restaurant in Redding last Tuesday, April 1, between the hours of 5 and 6:30 p.m. should double check to make sure they received two doses of the measles vaccine, which is usually given in the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine.\n\nThose who haven't been vaccinated should be aware if they exhibit measles symptoms, which include fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis (pink eye) and then a rash that starts at the head and spreads downwards.\n\nAnyone who thinks they may be feeling symptoms is asked to contact a doctors office via telephone rather than showing up in person due to the highly contagious nature of the disease.\n\nPeople who catch measles are usually contagious four days before their rash starts to four days after it clears up.\n\nPregnant women and children are most susceptible to contracting it.\n\nSo far this year there have been 52 cases of measles in California. Last year during the same period there were just four cases.\n\nMeasles cases this year have been detected in Southern California and the Bay Area; Shasta County is the first Northstate county to have one.\n\nShasta County Public Health said 12 of California's 52 cases were contracted by people who had traveled to countries where outbreaks are occurring. For that reason, they encourage people heading abroad to get vaccinated beforehand.", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "There have been 52 cases of measles in California so far this year; up from 4 during the same period last year", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "KRCR", "og": {"site_name": "KRCRTV", "description": "There have been 52 cases of measles in California so far this year; up from 4 during the same period last year", "title": "Shasta Co. sees first measles case in 17 years", "url": "http://www.krcrtv.com/living/health/shasta-co-sees-first-measles-case-in-17-years/25369296", "image": "http://www.krcrtv.com/image/view/-/18371956/highRes/1/-/maxh/640/maxw/640/-/2h84ufz/-/medical-health-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.krcrtv.com/living/health/shasta-co-sees-first-measles-case-in-17-years/25369296", "site": "@krcr7", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 326090907430922}, "keywords": "Redding health news", "google-site-verification": "gTTyxbmKN17E5sKQVjUGk8TIpxo_XoD5X2_F3PXfucg", "news_keywords": "Redding health news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29bd\"", "article_summary": "REDDING, Calif. -Shasta County health officials are warning the public of the first confirmed case of measles in the county in at least 17 years.\nMeasles cases this year have been detected in Southern California and the Bay Area; Shasta County is the first Northstate county to have one.\nShasta County Public Health said 12 of California's 52 cases were contracted by people who had traveled to countries where outbreaks are occurring.\nSo far this year there have been 52 cases of measles in California.\nPeople who catch measles are usually contagious four days before their rash starts to four days after it clears up."}
