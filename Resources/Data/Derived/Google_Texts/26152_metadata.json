But that\u2019s just the side show. Until Nadella put his foot in his month, this week\u2019s Grace Hopper conference was what it\u2019s supposed to be: a celebration of women in technology.\n\nSo lets turn the spotlight back where it belongs\u2014on people like Arati Prabhakar, Shafi Goldwasser, and, yes, Navy Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, the conference\u2019s namesake and perhaps the most important woman in the long history of technology.\n\nHeck, Hopper is one of the most important people in the history technology, period. Working with early computers like the Harvard Mark I and the UNIVAC, she eventually created the first compiler for turning human readable programming language code into something a machine can understand. She popularized the notion of the computer \u201cbug.\u201d And she helped spawn a language, Cobol, the would lay the groundwork for all other languages over the years\u2014and is still used to today.\n\nHeck, Hopper is one of the most important people in the history technology\u2014man or woman.\n\nDavid Letterman knows how important she was. In 1986, he hosted the then 80-year-old Hopper on his late-night talk show, and for a man who\u2019s notorious for hazing his guests, he showed her an unusual amount of respect\u2014as she deserved. \u201cOur first guest,\u201d Letterman says, \u201chas credits that are far too impressive for any guest on this program.\u201d\n\nSitting with Letterman (see video above), Hopper talks about adjusting from the Navy to civilian life as an employee of Digital Equipment Corporation, and she flashes back to her time working on the Mark I, one of the first general purpose computers ever invented. It was 51 feet long, 8 feet high, and 8 feet deep, but, as she points out, would have fit on the corner of a tiny chip even in 1986.\n\n\u201cHow did you know so much about computers then?\u201d Letterman asked.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, it was the first one,\u201d she replied, matter of factly.\n\nThe interview provides a glimpse into the woman behind the legend\u2014her sense of humor, and quick wit. But it only hints at the importance of Hopper\u2019s contributions to computer science. Yes, she popularized the term debugging. But more than that, she paved the way for computer scientists to write programs in English-like languages, instead of in machine code, the instructions the computer hardware actually winds up executing when you run a program.\n\nThat\u2019s the importance of Hopper\u2019s \u201ccompiler,\u201d a type of computer program that translates code written in one programming language into another\u2014generally from a \u201chigh level\u201d language, meaning one that humans can understand, into a \u201clow level\u201d language that actually instructs the computer. For those of us who still find even the most simple programming languages cryptic, that might not sound like much. But Hopper enabled programmers to create far more complex applications, and create the much more quickly, than had been previously possible.\n\nShe also created what may have been the first programming language to use English like syntax, Flow-Matic, which became the foundation of the programming language COBOL, short for Common Business-Oriented Language. Although it\u2019s the butt of many jokes, the language enabled the business world to take advantage of computers. And for what it\u2019s worth, Hopper can\u2019t be blamed for the infamous Y2K computer bug that plagued many COBOL applications, requiring countless hours for programmers to fix.\n\nAlthough many banks, insurance companies and financial institutions still rely on COBOL applications running on old mainframes, the language is slowly being replaced by more modern technologies. But its influence can be felt in just about every modern programming language. The same goes for Grace Hopper.", "article_metadata": {"Subsection": "WIRED", "description": "Yes, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella put a bit of damper on things, with his, shall we say, ill-advised comments on the gender pay gap.
