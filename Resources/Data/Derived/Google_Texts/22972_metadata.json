Reuters/Alvin Baez/Files\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - Organizers of rock concerts and conferences in Latin America or fringe events at the Rio Olympics beware: if you still need insurance to cover cancellation due to the Zika virus, it's probably too late.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) should be fine. It took out cancellation insurance for this August's games in the Brazilian city years ago, long before the mosquito-borne virus spread from the country through the Americas.\n\nAnyone else who acted early is probably also safe. \"Existing policies are unaffected and cover is provided,\" said Gary Flynn, at insurance broker JLT Specialty.\n\nBut organizers still seeking protection are finding clauses that block any payout, should their event be called off due to the Zika outbreak. \"Insurers are now excluding this peril from any new cancellation policy for events in an affected area,\" said Flynn, who is JLT's practice leader for sport federations.\n\nInsurers said they were unaware of any events being canceled because of Zika, but underwriters are not taking any chances about the possible impact on sponsors or hospitality providers, as well as on other events in the region.\n\nMuch about Zika remains unknown and a link with microcephaly in babies, a condition defined by unusually small heads that can result in developmental problems, has yet to be proved.\n\nNevertheless, the World Health Organization has advised pregnant women against traveling to areas affected by the outbreak, due to the potential risk of birth defects.\n\nSome organizations and countries have gone further. The United States has told sports federations that athletes and staff concerned for their health should consider not going to the 2016 Olympics.\n\nIOC PREPARED\n\nThe IOC says it has bought cancellation insurance worth about $800 million for the Olympics, with a premium of about $13 million.\n\nCover for such big events is bought at least five years beforehand, underwriters say. But sponsors, hotels and bar owners or people running venues such as fan parks - where sports enthusiasts can watch events on giant TV screens - may not yet have bought insurance, they add.\n\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil had an estimated event cancellation cover including television rights and sponsorship of $1.25 billion, according to underwriter Beazley Plc. Other cancellation cover for hotels or hospitality providers added around $600 million, it said.
