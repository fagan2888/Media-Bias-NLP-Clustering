This experience may be compared to when a woman gets her first period, or buys her first bra, except this time, it\u2019s more invasive and has to do with your lady parts, specifically your vagina. Before you walk into the clinic and open your legs to a world of stirrups and Pap smears, put your anxiety aside and relax with this step-by-step gynecology exam guide that will help you take control of your body and your health as a woman.\n\nPre-Gyno Visit\n\nChoose Your Gyno\n\nBefore you call the closest gyno near you, it\u2019s important to do your research, ask your friends, look at reviews, and try to find a doctor that is right for you. \u201cThe first GYN visit should not be viewed with apprehension,\u201d Dr. Georges Sylvestre, board certified in obstetrics and gynecology in New York, maternal-fetal medicine and assistant professor, Weill Cornell Medical College, told Medical Daily in an email. \u201cDo you prefer a female doc?\u201d \u201cDo you prefer a doctor who can speak your first language?\u201d \u201cDo you need a doctor who can relate to important cultural issues about sex and womanhood?\u201d \u201cIf you find the right doctor, he or she might the one you'll go to for your birth control in your teens and twenties, pregnancies and babies in your 30's and forties, then for your menopause,\u201d he said.\n\nGo Back in Time\n\nAfter you choose your gyno, it\u2019s important for you to go back in time and think about your sexual history and menstrual history. The number of partners, the age you started having sex, and how you prevent pregnancy/sexually transmitted diseases is all relevant information you should tell your gyno. Ladies, it\u2019s also important to keep track of your menstrual cycle by recording your last period, the length of your periods, how heavy and frequent they are, and if you experience any period-related problems like cramps. Dr. Sara Mornar, obstetrician and gynecologist in Texas, tells Medical Daily women should be prepared to share their medical background and menstrual and contraceptive information with their doctor.\n\nTo Shave or Not to Shave?\n\nThe age-old question of whether to shave or not to shave your hoo-hah has crossed the minds of many women before their first gyno visit. Before you schedule a bikini wax, or run to the pharmacy to stock up on razors and shaving cream, it\u2019s important to know there is no need to shave before seeing your gyno. Gynecologists do not expect their patients to shave their vulva since pubic hair is not as dense as the hair on the scalp, and it can easily be moved aside during the examination.\n\nThe only expectation your gyno has is to practice basic hygiene \u2014 take a shower or a bath within 24 hours. Women should not use spermicide, medications, lubricants, or douche a day before the exam because this could interfere with the accuracy of a Pap test. The night before the exam is not an ideal time to get busy between the sheets, either. Intercourse without a condom the night before a Pap smear may obscure cervical cells which then cannot be read accurately.\n\nThe Waiting Room\n\nSo you\u2019ve made it this far and have managed to stir up the courage to bare your hoo-hah to your gyno for the very first time. The waiting room is similar to any visit at the doctors' where the receptionist will hand you a pile of forms to fill out. Questions range from the number of sexual partners you\u2019ve had (if any) to the date of your last period. It\u2019s important to answer these questions carefully and honestly so your gyno can accurately assess you and keep track of your health. This information stays confidential between your gyno and you.\n\nBehind Closed Doors: The Exam Room\n\nThe most frightening part of your first gyno visit has arrived \u2014 going into the exam room. If you\u2019re still nervous at this point, tell your nurses and doctors and let them know it\u2019s your first time, so they can guide you step-by-step on the procedure. Like a regular doctor\u2019s visit, the nurse will take your height, weight, and blood pressure.\n\nAfter the basics, you will be left alone to change into a gown as you remove all your clothing \u2013 including your underwear. The doctor will shortly knock on your door and will ask you a series of questions ranging from if you\u2019re sexually active to your periods and how long they last. Your gyno will even ask you if you want to have an STD or HIV/AIDs testing on the day of your first gyno exam, too.\n\nBreast Exam\n\nDuring a gyno exam, your doctor will ask you to lay back and check your breast and underarms for any lumps. According to Woman\u2019s Hospital your gyno will check for breast abnormalities that include lumps, nipple discharge, and skin changes. Women should do breast self-exams regularly, and if you\u2019re not sure how to do this, you can ask your gyno and he or she will show you how.\n\nPelvic Exam\n\nAfter the breast exam comes the moment of truth for every woman \u2014 the pelvic exam. Your doctor will lay you on your back and gently press several areas of your lower stomach to see if you experience any discomfort prior to the exam. At the initial start of the exam, the dreaded instruments, the speculum and the spatula, will be used to examine your vagina. Mayo Clinic says the speculum \u2014 the plastic or metal-hinged instrument \u2014 will help spread open your vaginal walls so your gyno can view your vagina and cervix. If your pelvic exam includes a Pap test, your doctor will collect a sample of your cervical cells before removing the speculum. After this is removed, your gyno will examine your other pelvic organs for signs of abnormalities. After this the exam is officially done, you have survived your first gyno exam.\n\nYOU Ask the Questions\n\nWhether you choose to ask them before or after your exam, or when your gyno asks if you have any questions, it\u2019s time to ask everything you\u2019ve wanted to know from your periods to sex. A common misconception women have is that their gyno will judge them and therefore fear asking questions about birth control, STDs, and infidelities, among many others. However, Sylvestre says, \u201cAgain, any questions are okay: about your periods, sex, pain during sex, fear of your first intercourse, dildos, orgasm (or lack of), pregnancy, and abortion. Again, don't be shy, s/he heard it all.\u201d\n\nLike Sylvestre, Mornar recommends patients to ask their gynos: \u201cWhy are PAP smears necessary? How often do I need one? When do i need a mammogram? How do I prevent pregnancy and transmission of diseases? What is HPV, and do I need the vaccine for it?\u201d\n\nWhat Does Your First Gyno Visit Mean?\n\nYou\u2019re finally done with the exam, and exit the clinic, but you may ask yourself: what does this first visit mean for your health? \u201cThe breast screening is looking for abnormalities such as lumps or masses,\u201d Mornar said. She advises women to start getting Pap smears by the age of 21, and mammograms by the age of 40 and older, depending on family history.\n\nUnlike the breast screening, the Pap exam can reveal signs of cervical cancer, ovarian cysts, fibroids in the uterus, and other possible reason for heavy periods. A clean bill of health at a gyno exam can signify that \u201cher Pap is normal, that she has no STD, that her organs are fine,\u201d Sylvestre said.\n\nWomen should have their first gynecological exam when they are 18 years old, but it is recommended earlier than 18 if they are sexually active or have a medical problem requiring a pelvic exam.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "gynecologist, gyno, breast exam, pelvic exam, vagina", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This gynecology exam guide will help explain what to expect on your first gynecologist visit, from making the appointment to asking the \"gyno,\" your most embarrassing questions about your vagina.", "title": "What To Expect On Your First Visit To The Gynecologist", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/gynecology-exam-guide-what-expect-your-first-gyno-visit-271212", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/13/gynecologist-looking-patients-vagina.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This gynecology exam guide will help explain what to expect on your first gynecologist visit, from making the appointment to asking the \"gyno,\" your most embarrassing questions about your vagina.", "title": "What To Expect On Your First Visit To The Gynecologist", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/gynecology-exam-guide-what-expect-your-first-gyno-visit-271212", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/13/gynecologist-looking-patients-vagina.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/13/gynecologist-looking-patients-vagina.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-03-14T09:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-14T09:32:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "This gynecology exam guide will help explain what to expect on your first gynecologist visit, from making the appointment to asking the \"gyno,\" your most embarrassing questions about your vagina."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b52\"", "article_summary": "What is HPV, and do I need the vaccine for it?\u201dWhat Does Your First Gyno Visit Mean?\nBehind Closed Doors: The Exam RoomThe most frightening part of your first gyno visit has arrived \u2014 going into the exam room.\nThe age-old question of whether to shave or not to shave your hoo-hah has crossed the minds of many women before their first gyno visit.\nThe day you\u2019ve been dreading has finally arrived, and you\u2019re most likely anxious as your palms are sweaty and knees are shaking because it\u2019s time for your first gynecologist (gyno) visit.\nYour gyno will even ask you if you want to have an STD or HIV/AIDs testing on the day of your first gyno exam, too."}
