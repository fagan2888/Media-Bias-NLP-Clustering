Ross Hunter said it doesn't create any major opportunities, especially since there are problems that need to be resolved and ongoing litigation that could impact the budget.“This doesn't drive a lot of behavioral change,” Hunter said.State projections still aren't accounting for any money that could be raised from looming introduction of taxed marijuana sales.Hunter said lawmakers have no idea how much money that sector could raise for the state, and he doesn't want to include it in budget projections until the state can actually count the dollars.The extra money in Wednesday's forecast could help lawmakers as they search for ways to put more dollars into the public education system.Still, forecasters say there are a number of economic risks, including congressional gridlock, rising mortgage rates and possible economic turmoil in Europe.“We do feel that there are substantial downside risks,” said Dr. Steve Lerch, executive director of the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council.
