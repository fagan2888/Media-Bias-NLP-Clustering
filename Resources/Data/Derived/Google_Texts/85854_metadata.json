She was covered as a teenager through Medicaid.\n\n\u201cAnd I knew a little bit, but I didn\u2019t pay attention to it, because I\u2019m not a type of person that is always in the hospital. But now that I\u2019m growing up, I know that I need to know this, just in case that something happened.\u201d\n\nLast year as a freshman, the decision was easy: the college worked with a private company to offer a plan for $53 a month. It was basic coverage and financial protection in case something big happened.\n\nBut this year, that plan\u2019s been scrapped because it doesn\u2019t meet the stricter requirements under the ACA.\n\nThe new plan offered by the college is $125 per month. It covers more, including free preventive care and no annual limits, but it also comes with higher co-pays and deductibles.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s changed,\u201d says Pam Spear, who oversees student health insurance for Colby-Sawyer. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s gone up. They don\u2019t understand co-pays or co-insurance or any of that. Nor, unless they are sick, do they really want to hear about it, either.\u201d\n\nAfter getting quoted the new price, the school decided to relax its policy of mandating all students carry coverage, though the ACA requires basically everyone to be insured anyway.\n\nLast year, 300 undergrads bought in. This year it\u2019s closer to 60.\n\nSpear says the health law will bring down prices for a lot of people, and guarantees coverage for the sick.\n\n\u201cBut for this particular group of people, I don\u2019t see this as advantageous.\u201d\n\nPrices Up Across The State\n\nStudents at other schools face a similar pinch. St. Anselm\u2019s plan jumped nearly 50%, New England College is up a quarter, while UNH and Dartmouth report only modest price increases.\n\nThe national average for public school plans this year is around $2,000, while private school premiums average $2,300.\n\nOnly a minority of students actually buy these plans, however, even at schools that mandate coverage. That\u2019s because since 2009, New Hampshire has allowed anyone under age 26 to stay on a parent\u2019s plan. So-called Obamacare extended that provision to all states a year later, and the feds report more than 3 million young Americans have taken up the offer.\n\nAnd most schools provide some medical care regardless of insurance.\n\n\u201cI think for what the majority of college students need, they get here,\u201d says Christine Burke, Director of the Center for Health and Wellness at Keene State College, an on-campus clinic where student can see a nurse practitioner or pick up a prescription.\n\nIt\u2019s paid in part by a mandatory $180 student fee.\n\n\u201cThe challenge comes if and when they need some type of specialist,\u201d says Burke.\n\nThe specialist issue can get complicated, especially for students who are coming from out-of-state. For them, buying a New Hampshire policy to ensure you\u2019re covered locally may make sense.\n\nNo Shortage Of Choices\n\nThere\u2019s another option for students looking for coverage, according to Jennifer Patterson with the N.H. Insurance Department.\n\n\u201cThat is the age demographic that can purchase the catastrophic plans. If they are under 30 and that\u2019s the way they want to go, and there isn\u2019t one through their university, maybe that would be a great option for them, because it should be cheaper, and it really is catastrophic. It is in case something really bad happens.\u201d\n\nAnthem\u2019s Catastrophic Plan for a 20-year old is $96 a month, but it comes with a deductible north of $6,000, something a college student may not have stashed away.\n\nAnd, as if this health insurance multiple choice test isn\u2019t confusing enough, here\u2019s another bubble: Medicaid could be an option for some students, depending on what state lawmakers decide to do about expanding the program.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "It is the rare 20-year old who sits around a dorm room comparing deductibles or provider networks. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t talk about health insurance,\u201d says Colby", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://nhpr.org/post/aca-shakes-college-health-insurance-plans-new-hampshire", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/nhpr/files/styles/medium/public/201401/5428557783_e665057c9c_b.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It is the rare 20-year old who sits around a dorm room comparing deductibles or provider networks. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t talk about health insurance,\u201d says Colby", "title": "ACA Shakes Up College Health Insurance Plans In New Hampshire"}, "story_id": 270869592, "twitter": {"site": "@nhpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bookmannhpr"}, "author": "Todd Bookman", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "ACA Shakes Up College Health Insurance Plans In New Hampshire"}, "nid": 42811, "datePublished": "2014-02-03", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act", "wordCount": 756, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdece9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s changed,\u201d says Pam Spear, who oversees student health insurance for Colby-Sawyer.\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t talk about health insurance,\u201d says Colby-Sawyer College nursing student Maria Antonio.\nThey don\u2019t understand co-pays or co-insurance or any of that.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s gone up.\nBut this year, that plan\u2019s been scrapped because it doesn\u2019t meet the stricter requirements under the ACA."}
