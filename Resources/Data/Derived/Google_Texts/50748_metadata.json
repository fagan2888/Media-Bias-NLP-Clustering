It would order an independent analysis to determine the degree of impact rates have on access to care in California.\n\nThe bill to reinstitute pre-2011 Medi-Cal provider rates is AB 1805 by Assembly member Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley) with Richard Pan (D-Sacramento) as co-author. The independent analysis of rates\u2019 impact on access is AB 1759, with Pan as lead author and Skinner as co-author.\n\nThe provider rate reduction started going into effect in September last year after the law was held up in court for more than two years. California providers, who already faced some of the lowest Medicaid reimbursement rates in the country before the cuts were approved, will fall even further behind their counterparts in other parts of the country as the cuts are implemented. Medi-Cal is California\u2019s version of the federal Medicaid program.\n\nIn addition, some California providers will need to pay back two years\u2019 worth of \u201cclawback\u201d money by returning 10% of their Medi-Cal reimbursements from the past two years. Because the cuts were not immediately enacted pending outcome of court challenges, the state is now owed an additional 10% by some providers, according to court rulings.\n\nAll of that adds up to providers who don\u2019t want new Medi-Cal patients, Pan said.\n\n\u201cThe real problem is we have the second-lowest rate of physicians accepting Medi-Cal patients in the nation,\u201d Pan said. The low rate of taking on new patients has already started to create a serious access problem in California, he said.\n\n\u201cEven when Medi-Cal rates have dropped in the past, providers still see their [Medi-Cal] patients, because that\u2019s what providers do, they\u2019re not going to just drop patients,\u201d Pan said. \u201cThe problem is, they don\u2019t take up new ones \u2014 and that creates the access problem.\u201d\n\nMillions of additional Californians joining Medi-Cal because of Medicaid expansion associated with the Affordable Care Act creates a need for additional primary care and specialty providers but low reimbursement rates are a deterrent to providers.\n\nPatricia Samuelson, a family practice physician in Sacramento, said her clinic sees a large number of Medi-Cal patients, something other physicians in California would like to do, but can\u2019t afford.\n\n\u201cThe cut has resulted in rates that are already so low we can\u2019t afford to operate our offices. [Most physicians] just can\u2019t afford to see these patients,\u201d Samuelson said.\n\n\u201cThe state\u2019s perspective that physicians will just continue to lose money is unrealistic,\u201d Samuelson said. \u201cThere are people right now leaving their Medi-Cal practices.\u201d\n\nIn the past, providers subsidized low reimbursement rates with grant money or with higher rates paid by employer-sponsored insurance. But health plans are squeezing those higher employer rates, Samuelson said, so that\u2019s becoming less effective.\n\n\u201cRight now, I am personally taking care of people who should be seeing someone else,\u201d Samuelson said. Because of the dearth of specialists who see Medi-Cal patients, she is the only alternative for many patients needing a specialist, she said.\n\n\u201cThere are horrific access problems now,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the next few years, it will get worse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>One bill introduced in the California Assembly yesterday\u00a0seeks to\u00a0reverse the state's 10% reimbursement cut to Medi-Cal providers.
