IRS was worse than Watergate. Bill Kristol said the other day that Obamacare is worse than Watergate in its impact on the country. What do you make of those comparisons?\u201d\n\nWoodward, who\u2019s had some unfortunate missteps this year, didn\u2019t fully answer, but the question itself gave me pause. Bill Kristol actually said the other day that Obamacare is worse than Watergate?\n\nAs it turns out, yes , he really said that.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich this week compared the Affordable Care Act to the Watergate Scandal, but Kristol believes the healthcare law is far worse. \u201cObamacare, honestly, will do more damage to the country than Watergate ever could\u2019ve done,\u201d he said. \u201cWatergate was stupid, petty, partisan politics and [President Richard] Nixon did misuse the Oval Office and then did lie to the country about it, probably. But, here, we have a legislative takeover of a huge percentage of the economy and an area that\u2019s so important to everyone\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nRemember, as far as the Beltway is concerned, Bill Kristol is an establishment figure in good standing. He also thinks Nixon \u201cprobably\u201d lied about the criminal conspiracy the disgraced president ran out of the Oval Office.\n\nBut it\u2019s the comparison to the Affordable Care Act that\u2019s uniquely incomprehensible. \u201cObamacare\u201d critics are on safe ground complaining about a dysfunctional website, but to suggest that the law itself \u2013 a Republican-friendly reform system, which focuses on private insurers, cost-saving measures, and deficit reduction \u2013 is worse than the constitutional crisis posed by the Nixon White House becoming a criminal enterprise is plainly silly , even for contemporary Republicans.\n\nThat said, I suppose it\u2019s time to updating a post from last year.
