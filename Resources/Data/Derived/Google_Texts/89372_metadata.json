We\u2019re awash in excuses not to get outside and move freely, and exercise seems secondary to just getting through the day. Yesterday, when it started raining ice, for instance, didn\u2019t you just want to wrap up in layers with a hot cup of sweet tea? But, of course, that\u2019s precisely what you shouldn\u2019t do.\n\nTwo recent reports re-emphasize everything you already know, but with added detail: fitness (and that involves weight, nutrition, exercise and overcoming a sedentary lifestyle) matters.\n\nWhy? Well, here are some of the specifics (that are not actually about exercise per se, but related to it): for women, staying at a healthy weight and avoiding obesity can truly allow you to age (past 85, even) without disability.\n\nHere\u2019s Paula Span in The New York Times on \u201cWeight Gain and Older Women\u201c:\n\nWhen the researchers looked at the impact that obesity or being overweight \u2014 calculated by body mass index \u2014 took on the women\u2019s health, \u201cwe found that women with a healthy body weight had a greater chance of living to 85 without developing a chronic disease or a mobility disability,\u201d Dr. Rillamas-Sun said. \u201cThe heavier you are, the worse your chances of healthy survival.\u201d\n\nAnd in another blow to the reclining life, researchers at Northwestern report that \u201cevery additional hour a day you spend sitting is linked to doubling the risk of being disabled.\u201d\n\nThis is less a \u201cwhy to exercise\u201d finding than a \u201cwhy not to sit\u201d finding. Still, my point is that the more you\u2019re jogging (or doing water aerobics, or yoga, or shoveling when necessary) the less you\u2019re sitting.\n\nHere\u2019s how the Northwestern news release sums things up: \u201cIf there are two 65-year-old women, one sedentary for 12 hours a day and another sedentary for 13 hours a day, the second one is 50 percent more likely to be disabled.\u201d The study is published in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit more from Northwestern:\n\nThe study is the first to show sedentary behavior is its own risk factor for disability, separate from lack of moderate vigorous physical activity. In fact, sedentary behavior is almost as strong a risk factor for disability as lack of moderate exercise\u2026 \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve shown sedentary behavior was related to increased disability regardless of the amount of moderate exercise,\u201d said Dorothy Dunlop, professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and lead author of the study. \u201cBeing sedentary is not just a synonym for inadequate physical activity.\u201d Disability affects more than 56 million Americans. It\u2019s defined by limitations in being able to do basic activities such as eating, dressing or bathing oneself, getting in and out of bed and walking across a room. Disability increases the risk of hospitalization and institutionalization and is a leading source of health care costs, accounting for $1 in $4 spent.\n\nDunlop is quoted offering these ways to cut down on sitting:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two recent reports re-emphasize everything you already know, but with added detail: fitness (and that involves weight, nutrition, exercise and overcoming a sedentary lifestyle) matters.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Two recent reports re-emphasize everything you already know, but with added detail: fitness (and that involves weight, nutrition, exercise and overcoming a sedentary lifestyle) matters.", "title": "Why To Exercise Today:  For Women, Svelte Aging Without Disability \u2014 And It\u2019s Not Sitting", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/02/why-to-exercise-today-for-women-svelte-aging-without-disability-and-its-not-sitting", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/02/water-aerobics-620x465.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/02/why-to-exercise-today-for-women-svelte-aging-without-disability-and-its-not-sitting", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/02/water-aerobics-620x465.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Why To Exercise Today:  For Women, Svelte Aging Without Disability -- And It's Not Sitting"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-20", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Thu, 20 Feb 2014 08:07:59 -0500"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd865e\"", "article_summary": "Why To Exercise Today: For Women, Svelte Aging Without Disability \u2014 And It\u2019s Not SittingThis winter is a struggle.\nWe\u2019re awash in excuses not to get outside and move freely, and exercise seems secondary to just getting through the day.\n\u201cBeing sedentary is not just a synonym for inadequate physical activity.\u201d Disability affects more than 56 million Americans.\nDisability increases the risk of hospitalization and institutionalization and is a leading source of health care costs, accounting for $1 in $4 spent.\nTwo recent reports re-emphasize everything you already know, but with added detail: fitness (and that involves weight, nutrition, exercise and overcoming a sedentary lifestyle) matters."}
