At the same time, our defense budgets are declining,\" he said.\n\nCuts of $500 billion over a decade to the Pentagon's budget began last year after lawmakers failed to agree on closing the federal budget deficit. That set off the automatic \"sequestration\" spending cuts and added to already-scheduled defense cuts of $500 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nThe cuts forced the Army to scale back to two ready combat brigades, Hagel said.\n\nWhile 12 of 37 Army combat brigades are now trained at the highest level of combat readiness, \"it falls short of what I believe is sufficient to defend our nation and our allies with minimum risk,\" he said.\n\nHagel said the Pentagon would face a shortfall of $70 billion over the next five years if Congress does not reverse the cuts.\n\nLawmakers reduced the cuts some in 2014 and 2015, but the sequester is slated to return next October.\n\n\"If Congress does not act, it will return in 2016, stunting and reversing the Army's readiness, just as we've have begun to recover and requiring even more dramatic reductions in force structure,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"The world is becoming more volatile\" and \"our defense budgets are declining,\" he said.", "description": "\"The world is becoming more volatile\" and \"our defense budgets are declining,\" he said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kristina Wong", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\"The world is becoming more volatile\" and \"our defense budgets are declining,\" he said.", "title": "Hagel pressures Congress to reverse defense budget cuts", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/220870-hagel-pressures-congress-to-reverse-defense-budget-cuts", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/220870-hagel-pressures-congress-to-reverse-defense-budget-cuts", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-15T16:32-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Kristina Wong", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-15T16:32:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Chuck Hagel,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/220870-hagel-pressures-congress-to-reverse-defense-budget-cuts", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\"The world is becoming more volatile\" and \"our defense budgets are declining,\" he said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hagel pressures Congress to reverse defense budget cuts"}, "dcterms.title": "Hagel pressures Congress to reverse defense budget cuts"}, "article_summary": "That set off the automatic \"sequestration\" spending cuts and added to already-scheduled defense cuts of $500 billion over the next 10 years.\nHagel said the Pentagon would face a shortfall of $70 billion over the next five years if Congress does not reverse the cuts.\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel Chuck HagelHagel says NATO deployment could spark a new Cold War with Russia Overnight Defense: House panel unveils 5B defense spending bill Hagel to next president: We need to sit down with Putin MORE pressured Congress Wednesday to reverse the Pentagon's deep budget cuts, saying the cuts put soldiers' lives at risk at a time of growing threats.\nCuts of $500 billion over a decade to the Pentagon's budget began last year after lawmakers failed to agree on closing the federal budget deficit.\nThe cuts forced the Army to scale back to two ready combat brigades, Hagel said."}
