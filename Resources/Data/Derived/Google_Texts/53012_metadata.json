Bruce Braley and state senator Joni Ernst has, thus far, been dominated by the candidates\u2019 personalities. Ernst in particular has been trying to make the race about her manufactured political persona \u2013 that of the pig-castrating, motorcycle-riding veteran. Braley has been trying to make it about her other persona \u2013 the far-right conspiracy theorist who wants to impeach the president. Reporters are, by and large, happy to indulge this sort of thing. Campaigns that revolve around \u201cgaffes\u201d and questions of character are more fun than stodgy policy debates, and so the coverage of the Iowa race has been dominated by an absurd story about whether Braley threatened to sue a neighbor over some chickens.\n\nErnst wants the race to be about character because she doesn\u2019t actually have a whole lot of offer when it comes to policy. That became perfectly clear on Friday, when the two candidates met for their second debate and Ernst refused to answer a very important question about healthcare reform.\n\nHere\u2019s the video of the debate. At around the 7:45 mark, the debate moderator reads a question from an Iowa resident who is a \u201cnew enrollee under Obamacare.\u201d The question was straightforward: given that this guy is newly insured under the ACA, and Ernst wants to fully repeal the law, \u201chave you given any thought to how individuals in my situation won\u2019t lose coverage should the repeal occur?\u201d\n\nBasically, this guy was looking for assurance that Ernst, if she\u2019s elected, won\u2019t screw him over. Here\u2019s Joni Ernst\u2019s response, in full:\n\nEvery Iowan and every American has the right to affordable, quality healthcare. But Obamacare is not the answer to that. And Congressman Braley gave the closing argument to Obamacare. He said he read every single page of this bill. But what we have seen, even here in Iowa, is that it is an additional tax to Iowans and all Americans of $1.2 trillion. It is a jobs killer here in this state, and it\u2019s taking our personal healthcare decisions out of our hands, and placing them in nameless, faceless bureaucrats in Washington, DC. Just this past week the insurance commissioner announced that plans through the exchange will go up an estimated 19 percent. I don\u2019t see how this is affordable for anyone. When the president and Congressman Braley promised us that we would see an average reduction of $2,600 per family. Families are paying more and they\u2019ve lost their coverage.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Braley, in his response, defended the Affordable Care Act, pointing out that Iowa\u2019s Republican governor, Terry Branstad, hammered out a deal with the Department of Health and Human Services to expand Medicaid and that over 100,000 Iowans had benefitted from access to coverage. Ernst was given a few seconds to respond, and she used them to reiterate her belief that Obamacare is the worst thing ever. She didn\u2019t even offer the perfunctory GOP pabulum about \u201cpatient-centered care\u201d and \u201cmarket-oriented alternatives.\u201d She just blew off the question and, more significantly, the very real concerns of a newly insured Iowa resident.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joni Ernst was asked to explain how repealing Obamacare won't screw over the newly insured.
