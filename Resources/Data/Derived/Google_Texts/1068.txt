In 1926 a daring bank robbery was committed in Hartselle that held the town captive for almost four hours. This robbery still remains on the FBI unsolved crime list.

Now, 87 years later, a historical reenactment will be performed during Hartselle's famous "Depot Days" that includes two descendants of the bank executive, Mr. Peck.

Tickets are only $5. Shows are September 19th at 7pm and September 21st at 6pm at the Hartselle Fine Arts Center, 307 College Street.
