Attkisson reports that \u201cBanks remembers being told only that it was a way to help her baby, Destiny.\u201d\n\nThe SUPPORT study was conducted from 2005 to 2009 and involved 1,300 infants born at 24 to 27 weeks. It took place in 23 medical centers nationwide and was led by the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The $20.8 million preemie research program was conducted under the National Institutes of Health, a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cI trusted them with my baby\u2019s life\u201d\n\n\u201cI trusted them with my baby\u2019s life,\u201d Cook said last August. \u201cI feel there was a lack of information given to parents, and because of this, I feel taken advantage of and I feel responsible for my child\u2019s participation in this study.\u201d\n\nWatch Cook\u2019s comments below:\n\nDreshan is now 7 years old and struggles with \u201cmyriad health problems,\u201d according to Attkisson\u2019s report.\n\nShawn and Carrie Pratt also participated in the study after their daughter Dagen was born at 25 weeks, weighing 1 pound, 11 ounces.\n\n\u201cWe were guaranteed that the study wouldn\u2019t hurt Dagen in any way, that it was just gathering information,\u201d Shawn Pratt said at the HHS public meeting last August.\n\nThe Pratt\u2019s \u201csole motivation\u201d was the health of their daughter, he said. \u201cWe assumed her doctors felt the same and were shocked to learn the care she received was based not on what she needed but on some protocol. In our minds the SUPPORT study turned Dagen into a subject of an experiment, instead of a participant in a study.\u201d\n\nThe preemies in the study were randomly placed into two groups and given either higher or lower levels of oxygen. Supplemental oxygen is life-giving for preemies, who have difficulty breathing because their lungs are not fully developed, but high oxygen levels can also lead to retinopathy of prematurity and vision loss.\n\nA goal of the study was to identify a sweet spot between putting babies at risk for eye disease from too much oxygen and causing death because of inadequate oxygen.\n\nThe risks were not disclosed to parents, charges Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer advocacy organization founded by Ralph Nader.\n\n\u201cThe consent forms for the SUPPORT study had egregious deficiencies, and there was a failure to disclose the serious risks of the research, including the risk of death, brain injury and blindness from an eye disease called retinopathy of prematurity,\u201d says Michael Carome, M.D., director of Public Citizen\u2019s Health Research Group. \u201cWe believe that had parents been adequately informed, many would not have enrolled their premature infants in this study.\u201d\n\nActual results from the experiment reveal the risks. More infants died in the low-oxygen group \u2013 19.9 percent, or 130 out of 654 \u2013 than did preemies in the high-oxygen group \u2013 16.2 percent, or 107 out of 662.\n\nInfants died as a result of study\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that some infants died because of their participation in the research, and had they not been in the research they wouldn\u2019t have died,\u201d says Carome, a former senior leader at the Office for Human Research Protections, or OHRP, within the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nPreemies in the higher oxygen group developed eye disease at more than twice the rate of those in the low-oxygen branch of the study, 17.9 percent versus 8.6 percent. OHRP, the HHS watchdog for research on humans, called that result \u201chighly significant\u201d and criticized the scientists who did the study in a March 2013 letter, asserting that \u201cparticipating in the study did have an effect on which infants died, and on which developed blindness.\u201d\n\nOHRP also determined in its letter to the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the lead site for the experiment, that \u201cthe informed consent document for this trial failed to adequately inform parents of the reasonably foreseeable risks and discomforts of research participation.\u201d\n\nResearch community rallies in support\n\nMany in the research community, including the NIH, fired back and vigorously defended the SUPPORT study.\n\n\u201cWe are dismayed by the response of the OHRP and consider the SUPPORT trial a model of how to make medical progress,\u201d three medical professionals wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nNIH Director Dr. Francis Collins and two colleagues took the rare step of publicly disagreeing with OHRP in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nAnd they did more than disagree. Public Citizen obtained emails through a Freedom of Information Act request revealing a coordinated effort by senior NIH and HHS officials to interfere in OHRP\u2019s investigation.\n\nSpecifically, NIH was given the opportunity to view and edit drafts of a second OHRP letter, dated June 4, 2013, in which OHRP placed \u201con hold\u201d compliance actions against the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the SUPPORT study leader.\n\n\u201cSuch interference by NIH is unprecedented in my knowledge of the office,\u201d said Carome, who spent 24 years in the U.S. Public Health Service.\n\nDespite the NIH intervention, OHRP\u2019s second letter affirmed its earlier determination that the study inadequately informed parents of the risks their children faced by enrolling in the experiment.\n\nDo researchers shade truth to recruit participants?\n\nAsked if researchers shade the truth when recruiting study participants, Carome listed the pressures at play.\n\n\u201cInvestigators are motivated to get their research done as quickly as possible so they can get grant dollars so they can get funding for research so they can get published in publications to advance their academic careers,\u201d he said. \u201cToo often I think investigators write consent forms where the risks are downplayed, where the benefits are overstated, where the nature of the research is not clear in order to avoid discouraging potential subjects from enrolling in the research.\u201d\n\nShawn and Carrie Pratt still don\u2019t know why researchers urged them to participate in a study that posed additional risk to their fragile, extremely premature daughter. And they wonder whether it is a factor in their daughter Dagen\u2019s health problems, which include \u201cmultiple incidences of collapsed lungs, breathing problems and other life-threatening conditions,\u201d Attkisson reports. Dagen has cerebral palsy and had laser eye surgery at two months for retinopathy.\n\n\u201cWhy were we not fully informed of the risk and why is omitting information not considered lying?\u201d Carrie Pratt asked at a press conference last August, held on the sidewalk outside the Health and Human Services headquarters in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very blessed that Dagen survived and has her eyesight, but every day that she cries because she is different, it just kills us. And we worry about her future as a special needs child, and especially as an adult.\u201d\n\nWatch the Pratt family\u2019s press conference below:\n\nJohn Aman is a writer and communications consultant.
