But most of all, especially after the Supreme Court ruled the ACA constitutional, they opposed Medicaid expansion.\n\nAt the front of this anti-populist gang of executive officers is our Florida Gov. Rick Scott. It was Florida's attorneys general in both the Charlie Crist administration before him and his current administration that led the charge against \"Obamacare.\"\n\nThe Republican Party was getting desperate to block implementation of the law, including tagging the ACA as Obamacare.\n\nChanging the name worked in the 1950s when Harry Truman tried to develop a Federal Health Care policy, and it failed partly because a PR firm recommended that the opposition party call it \"Socialized Medicine.\" That struck fear in the hearts of Americans who feared that socialism would dominate America.\n\nBut it didn't work this time.\n\nObamacare and Medicaid expansion were being accepted in state after state. And in February Scott stunned the other obstructionist governors when he announced that he was now in favor of the expansion in his state, calling it \"unconscionable\" if we did not go forward with one of the seminal parts of Obamacare.\n\nHis move to endorse the expansion makes more sense when you consider that Scott came from the world of managed care. He also had declared that a state should be run more like a business and had just gotten a waiver to put more Medicaid users into mandatory Managed Care Organizations (MCO), many of which were run by old colleagues.\n\nScott's switch gave hope to 1.2 million Floridians who would finally get coverage and not have to fear the harsh economic consequences if they tried to go to a doctor outside of an emergency room.\n\nSo select committees were assigned to investigate the possibility of moving forward with Scott's wishes.\n\nThey heard testimony from citizens (including myself) who gave a human case for the expansion. Hospitals, academics and even business lobbyists said it made financial sense.\n\nBut what seemed to catch the attention of the conservative committee members was the testimony of a gentleman who gave a bleak picture of Arizona's ill-fated attempt at its own Medicaid expansion.\n\nTarren Bragdon, president & CEO of the Foundation for Government Accountability, completed his testimony by stressing that Arizona would never give in to the federal government's attempt to make the expansion a reality in that state.\n\nForget the fact that he said that testing welfare recipients for drugs was warranted, even though the tests came out 97 percent negative. He claimed that the testing scared away drug-using applicants.\n\nThe most amazing thing about his testimony was that, despite his bleak picture of Arizona almost going broke funding the program, Gov. Jan Brewer threatened to veto every bill, including the budget, if legislators did not move forward with it.\n\nShe pressured both sides of the aisle until they agreed to the state-sponsored expansion.\n\nThis is the Jan Brewer who was taking people off transplant lists to fix the state budget. This is the Jan Brewer who practically put her finger up the president's nose on the tarmac when he came to visit her. The very same Jan Brewer who supported a bill that declared that all Hispanics be considered undocumented until proven otherwise.\n\nGranted, Arizona is not Florida. They worked to cover only 300,000 uninsured citizens. Florida has 1.2 million. Yet the select committees pointed to Arizona's testimony over the guidance offered by Florida citizens, hospitals, academics and business people, who urged them to expand Medicaid.\n\nWhen the session closed without any action on the matter, Scott did nothing.\n\nHe could have vetoed the budget, as Brewer had threatened, but he didn't. Instead, he vetoed funds to help build a housing development for the homeless in Pasco.\n\nIn the meantime, Medicaid expansion is in a coma in Florida. Poor people continue to flock to emergency rooms, costing hospitals enormous amounts of money.\n\nThe billions of dollars offered by the federal government to pay for the plan will go elsewhere, as will the jobs the expansion would have created.\n\nIs that how you run a business, governor?\n\nThis article was originally posted in the new commentary and news e-magazine, Context Florida.\n\nFollow Gary Stein on Twitter: www.twitter.com/gjsteinmph", "article_metadata": {"description": "It sounds bizarre, but it involves Florida and Arizona politics, so it's par for the course.\n\nIt is January 2013 and a group of Republican governors have...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-10-12 10:58:22 -0400", "og": {"url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gary-stein/the-medicaid-expansion-drama_b_4072181.html", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "It sounds bizarre, but it involves Florida and Arizona politics, so it's par for the course.\n\nIt is January 2013 and a group of Republican governors have...", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "height": 1000}, "creator": "gjsteinmph", "description": "It sounds bizarre, but it involves Florida and Arizona politics, so it's par for the course.\n\nIt is January 2013 and a group of Republican governors have...", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-11 10:58:22 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4072181", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "miami,jan brewer,Rick Scott,medicaid expansion,obamacare,Affordable Care Act,florida,medicaid,arizona,health care,Managed care", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "miami,jan brewer,Rick Scott,medicaid expansion,obamacare,Affordable Care Act,florida,medicaid,arizona,health care,Managed care", "published_time": "2013-10-11 10:58:22 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-12-11 05:12:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0cc9\"", "article_summary": "But most of all, especially after the Supreme Court ruled the ACA constitutional, they opposed Medicaid expansion.\nObamacare and Medicaid expansion were being accepted in state after state.\nIn the meantime, Medicaid expansion is in a coma in Florida.\nThe very same Jan Brewer who supported a bill that declared that all Hispanics be considered undocumented until proven otherwise.\nJan Brewer threatened to veto every bill, including the budget, if legislators did not move forward with it."}
