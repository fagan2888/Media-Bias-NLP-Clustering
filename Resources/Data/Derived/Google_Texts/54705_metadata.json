Facebook/ Black Women Do Breastfeed\n\nKarlesha Thurman, 25, caused a stir at her graduation. No, it wasn\u2019t for her outstanding academic achievement or any other profound reason \u2014 she was merely breastfeeding her child.\n\n\u201cI found out I was pregnant my last year of college, had my daughter one week into my last semester, she was my motivation to keep going, so me receiving my BA was OUR moment, so glad I captured the moment and so glad you shared it with the world so thank you again.,\u201d she wrote on her Facebook page, according to a BuzzFeed report.\n\nThe recent graduate of California State University, Long Beach, decided to share the photo on the Facebook page, Black Women Do Breastfeed. Thurman expected positive feedback, and while there were some supporters, there was also a plethora of hateful messages. \u201cUhhh....what? Anyone else think this is more [weird than] cool?\u201d said one Facebook user. Twitter was no better.\n\nThis hoe was breastfeeding her baby through her grad.Gown at her graduation ... \u2014 chasity\ufe0f (@imperfectionC_) June 9, 2014\n\nNever shorty got a pic breast feeding at her graduation. How ratchet can this generation get... \u2014 SLEEPiNG BEAUTY (@AlprazolamKilla) June 8, 2014\n\nThis type of shaming happens all over the world against women who want to feed their babies in public. Rhea Holley of London felt similarly humiliated by a couple in a coffee shop. According to the Daily Mail, she was feeding her 11-month-old son when a couple called her a \u201cslut\u201d for breastfeeding her baby inside the establishment. Holley said the incident ruined the breastfeeding experience for her.\n\nThurman seems to have a more positive outlook on the situation, and she doesn\u2019t intend to let it get the best of her. \u201cI am so shocked that it has gotten this much attention,\u201d Thurman told BuzzFeed.\n\nDespite the controversy this might have caused, Thurman was not doing anything illegal or against school policy. According to California Civil Code Section 43-53, \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a mother may breastfeed her child in any location, public or private, except the private home or residence of another, where the mother and the child are otherwise authorized to be present.\u201d\n\nDespite the negative responses that Karlesha Thurman received on the Internet, she still has a positive spirit and isn't ashamed of breastfeeding her baby in public.
