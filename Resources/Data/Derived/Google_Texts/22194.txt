JUNEAU — With the legislative session concluded, Governor Walker and the Legislature will both be looking into the next steps for Medicaid reform and Expansion. The Department of Health and Social Services released an RFP in the spring to provide technical support and analysis in regards to Medicaid expansion in Alaska. Anchorage consulting Agnew::Beck submitted the winning proposal. The contract begins this summer, with a final report expected in the spring of 2016.

When the Governor’s Medicaid expansion bill died in the House, the House Majority Caucus announced that the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee would release its own RFP for Medicaid reform and expansion. According to the RFP, the Committee seeks an:

…independent professional consultant in the area of Medicaid reform

and expansion to analyze and evaluate benefits and risks associated with reform proposals and expansion proposals, their financial consequences, their interrelationship with Medicare services and providers, and to assist the Alaska State Legislature in understanding and acting upon these proposals.

The Committee is expected to select a consultant in August and conclude work by the end of the 2016.

While both DHSS and the legislature seek independent analysis, their preferred outcomes for Medicaid expansion were made clear during the legislative session. DHSS Commissioner Valerie Davidson has been the standard bearer for the Governor’s Medicaid expansion plan since she took over as Commissioner. Meanwhile, the Legislative Budget and Audit Committee consists of 11 members, all but two of which are members of the House and Senate Majorities that killed Medicaid expansion this year.
