Police from several jurisdictions are looking for a missing Shawnee girl.

According to her mother, 15-year-old Alexia Howell hosted a “sleepover” with a friend Saturday night in Shawnee.

However, her mother Brandy Thomas said the two girls sneaked out of their home sometime after midnight.

Thomas said this is out of her daughter’s character.

Alexia is on the Tecumseh ladies’ basketball team, and is well-liked at school.

“She’s been playing competitive softball since she was 6, and this is not like her. Not at all. She left the house without anything, without a phone charger, clothes, toothbrush,” she said.

Anyone with information is asked to call Shawnee police at (405) 273-2121.
