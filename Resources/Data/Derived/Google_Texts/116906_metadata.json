On Twitter and Facebook, the chatter was louder. Some people posted that it was time to unseat the long-serving council leader, who was first elected nearly two decades ago. \u201cI will spend almost all my political energy getting her out of her seat,\u201d one observer posted.\n\nOthers, angry over Johnson\u2019s descriptions of crime problems in her north Minneapolis ward, were offended by Johnson\u2019s comments. \u201cI feel sick listening to City Council Prez Johnson right now,\u201d tweeted Minneapolis NAACP president Nekima Levy-Pounds, \u201cveiled racial references \u2026 it\u2019s too much!!\u201d\n\nBut from her seat on the council dais \u2014 and in conversation weeks later \u2014 Johnson didn\u2019t back down. As she has for years, on issues ranging from the city budget to parking regulations, the council president appeared undeterred by criticism. With growing interest in and pressure about police-community relations and racial disparities in her ward, some critics have questioned if she fully represents the interests of people in an increasingly diverse part of the city. Johnson, however, maintains that she knows what her community needs and advocates for it at City Hall.\n\nIn her council office, when asked about the vote on the lurking and spitting laws, Johnson pulled out a map dotted with marks where the city\u2019s high-tech gunfire detection system picked up the sound of shots. More than 70 of the shots were in north Minneapolis, and 27 in the rest of the city.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s concerned about the people who are living with this activity?\u201d she asked. \u201cI am. That\u2019s my main concern. All this other stuff for me is chatter when my constituents are feeling the brunt of really heavy criminal activity.\u201d\n\nBARB JOHNSON Represents: Minneapolis\u2019 Fourth Ward, which covers seven neighborhoods in the northwest corner of the city. Age: 65 Hometown: Minneapolis Occupation: Registered nurse, first elected to the council in 1997 Family ties: Johnson holds the council seat previously held by her mother and cousin. It\u2019s been in the family since 1971.\n\nRooted in North Side\n\nJohnson is quick to note that north Minneapolis has been her lifelong home. She\u2019s represented the Fourth Ward since 1997 and served as council president since 2006, but her family\u2019s connection to the council seat stretches further. Before Johnson\u2019s election, the seat was held by her mother, Alice Rainville, for more than two decades. Before Rainville, there was Johnson\u2019s cousin, John Derus.\n\nBy the end of Johnson\u2019s current term, the Fourth Ward seat will have been in the family for 46 years.\n\nJohnson, who worked as a nurse before getting into politics, has won over a long parade of council members and community leaders with her calm, decisive attitude toward council matters big and small. Minneapolis\u2019 system of government divides power more evenly between the mayor and council than some other cities, so the council president ranks at or near the top of the power list at City Hall.\n\n\u201cShe takes very strong stances and sometimes they are not what everyone wants to hear,\u201d said Roberta Englund, executive director of the Folwell Neighborhood Association. \u201cShe generally does not apologize for what she believes is ethical and correct, and that\u2019s something I respect her for.\u201d\n\nOn a generally like-minded council made up of 12 DFL members and one Green Party member, Johnson is one of the most frequent voices for fiscal restraint. While she often votes alongside her colleagues on progressive issues, she also questions spending on issues others champion. In last year\u2019s heated budget debates, Johnson argued that spending on public safety should be prioritized, even if it meant cuts to funding for bike lanes or new equity programs.\n\nTodd Klingel, president & CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber of Commerce, backed Johnson\u2019s vote on the lurking and spitting ordinances. The two laws were targeted by groups that said police used them as tools to arrest minorities. Minneapolis police statistics show that of the nearly 400 people arrested for lurking \u2014 defined as lying in wait with intent to commit a crime \u2014 between 2009 and 2014, 59 percent were black, while 24 percent were white.\n\nJohnson argued that police are fighting a major battle against crime in her ward and others, and need to be able to make arrests to prevent crime.\n\nKlingel said Johnson has been an advocate for business. But he said he saw her vote on lurking as a community, rather than business issue.\n\n\u201cI think the key is for people to realize it\u2019s not being antagonistic for its own sake,\u201d he said of Johnson\u2019s position. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to make sure these things are thought through.\u201d\n\nOthers see it differently. Levy-Pounds, with the NAACP, took particular issue with Johnson\u2019s explanation for her vote. At one point, the council president discussed the amount of crime in ward, noting that residents deal with regular vehicle break-ins. She said many of her constituents note that CDs are often left behind in the burglarized car, \u201cbecause the music tastes are different.\u201d\n\nThe remarks sparked a backlash in the council chambers and on Twitter, where Levy-Pounds and others said Johnson was essentially suggesting black people were responsible for the crime problems.\n\nStatistics compiled after a 2012 city redistricting show that less than half the residents in Johnson\u2019s ward are white. About a third are black, 11 percent are Asian and 7 percent Hispanic.\n\nWithout naming Levy-Pounds, Johnson also called out comments made by the NAACP leader, who had suggested that Minneapolis could end up like Ferguson, Mo., if police-community tensions are not resolved. Johnson said the comparison was unfair and that advocates should tone down their rhetoric.\n\n\u2018Time for new leadership\u2019\n\nLevy-Pounds said she and others hope Johnson will join other council members who have aligned themselves with advocates calling for change in the police department. If not, she said, she expects the council president will face challenges in the next election.\n\n\u201cIt is definitely time for a new leadership in light of the calls for justice and equity in the city of Minneapolis,\u201d Levy-Pounds said. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of the status quo and we\u2019re ready for people to step up to the plate who are going to be a force for social change and social justice.\u201d\n\nBoth Johnson and Levy-Pounds said they have no plans to meet with each other. Both said they were open to listening, but believed such a meeting would likely be unproductive.\n\nJohnson said she is interested in finding ways for the police department to improve the way it interacts with residents. She\u2019s supportive of more training and education and said the council should back the police chief in disciplining officers who don\u2019t treat people fairly.\n\nShe\u2019ll likely face the topic soon. Levy-Pounds and members of Neighborhoods Organizing for Change have called for a review of other laws they say unfairly target minorities. Anthony Newby, NOC\u2019s executive director, said his group is pushing the city to collect data from police stops, in addition to arrests, so officials can assess how police spend their time.\n\nAnd with or without Johnson on board, Newby said the 12-1 vote on lurking and spitting shows the council is moving in a clear direction on issues of race and policing.\n\n\u201cI think what we saw with the last vote is what we interpreted as a real desire on the part of the council to add another level of transparency to our current policing environment,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson said she intends to stay on the council as long as she can. She said she wants to be an advocate for people in her ward who, like her, work hard and speak their minds.\n\n\u201cI want to explain I\u2019m not an ogre,\u201d she said. \u201cI come from that community. I\u2019ve lived there darn near my whole life. I know the challenges, but I know we have really good people and I want to make sure that community stays viable and vibrant.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Barb Johnson defends her record by saying she's an advocate for her ward's interests.", "title": "Despite criticism, Minneapolis City Council President Barb Johnson says she advocates for her ward", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/despite-criticism-minneapolis-council-president-barb-johnson-says-she-advocates-for-her-ward/311647801/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/COUNCIL.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/COUNCIL.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Barb Johnson defends her record by saying she's an advocate for her ward's interests.", "title": "Despite criticism, Minneapolis City Council President Barb Johnson says she advocates for her ward", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/despite-criticism-minneapolis-council-president-barb-johnson-says-she-advocates-for-her-ward/311647801/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/COUNCIL.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/COUNCIL.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Barb Johnson defends her record by saying she's an advocate for her ward's interests."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3432\"", "article_summary": "She\u2019s represented the Fourth Ward since 1997 and served as council president since 2006, but her family\u2019s connection to the council seat stretches further.\nAs she has for years, on issues ranging from the city budget to parking regulations, the council president appeared undeterred by criticism.\nAt one point, the council president discussed the amount of crime in ward, noting that residents deal with regular vehicle break-ins.\nIf not, she said, she expects the council president will face challenges in the next election.\n\u201cI feel sick listening to City Council Prez Johnson right now,\u201d tweeted Minneapolis NAACP president Nekima Levy-Pounds, \u201cveiled racial references \u2026 it\u2019s too much!"}
