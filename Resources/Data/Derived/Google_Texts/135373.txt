Interstate 29 is closed from Brookings to the North Dakota border as well as being closed from the South Dakota border to the Canadian Border in North Dakota.

Officials report white out conditions with zero visibility, icy roads, drifting and blowing snow.

Travel is difficult to nearly impossible in some areas. This creates safety concerns and increases the risk for serious accidents.

Winter maintenance is being suspended on the closed portion of I-29 as well as highways with No Travel Advisories until conditions improve.
