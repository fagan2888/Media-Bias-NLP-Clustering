Pablo Chavez , a senior lobbyist at Google, will join LinkedIn at the end of the month, marking the tech company’s continued Washington expansion.

Jeff Weiner , LinkedIn’s chief executive officer, Tweeted the news Monday morning.

“Excited to welcome @pablochavez to LinkedIn as our new VP of Public Policy,” he wrote.

Chavez, who spent seven years as Google’s senior director of public policy and government affairs, will begin his new gig on Jan. 28 and serve as the company’s first in-house lobbyist.

“His deep experience will be invaluable as we build our public-policy presence,” a spokesman for LinkedIn said in a statement.

It joins the ranks of other tech companies looking to expand their reach in D.C.

Yelp and Twitter recently registered in-house lobbying help and formed political action committees (PAC) with the Federal Election Commission, but LinkedIn remained mum on whether it would also take that step.

LinkedIn isn’t entirely new to the influence world, however, and has lobby firm Monument Policy Group on retainer. Since early last year, the company spent $180,000 on the firm.
