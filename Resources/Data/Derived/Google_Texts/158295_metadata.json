In my heart, I believe that we will best survive if we look at ourselves and our community and find things \u2014 create things \u2014 that make us happier, brighter and more welcoming than your average small town. To do that, we have to constantly share our successes with one another and celebrate each step forward.\n\nHistorically, one of the vehicles for doing that was the local paper. The local paper would investigate, critique and celebrate the \u201cgoing ons\u201d of our town. We have lost that influence.\n\nMeaning no criticism of the current HTR Media staff, we have become a homogenized Gannett document \u2014 nearly the same as all the neighboring Gannett papers.\n\nSo tonight I was able to read this paragraph in our paper \u2014 \u201cA Neillsville man accused of having sex with a donkey earlier this month now faces criminal charges and possible jail time.\u201d\n\nCarrying that story in the HTR decreases the value of a column inch in our paper to less than a plugged nickel. The story has no local appeal, and quite frankly, I do not think it is newsworthy in any venue.\n\nNo doubt the perpetrator and his family are humiliated beyond belief, and given the fact that donkeys cannot read, I don\u2019t think they feel any safer.\n\nJohn Jagemann\n\nManitowoc\n\nRead or Share this story: http://htrne.ws/1FqFpgo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Carrying that story in the HTR decreases the value of a column inch in our paper...", "og": {"site_name": "HTR Media", "description": "Carrying that story in the HTR decreases the value of a column inch in our paper...", "title": "Letter: Article had no place in HTR", "url": "http://www.htrnews.com/story/opinion/2015/09/26/article-place-htr/72898454/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/htrnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carrying that story in the HTR decreases the value of a column inch in our paper...", "title": "Article had no place in HTR", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b127ef6bdeca0a7997ada31f1919c35b81de662/c=354-0-1769-1415&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/26/Manitowoc/B9319006271Z.1_20150926184323_000_GQEC206SI.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@htrnews", "site": "@htrnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883325026", "fb": {"app_id": 179306802094584}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Historically, one of the vehicles for doing that was the local paper.\nThe local paper would investigate, critique and celebrate the \u201cgoing ons\u201d of our town.\nMeaning no criticism of the current HTR Media staff, we have become a homogenized Gannett document \u2014 nearly the same as all the neighboring Gannett papers.\nNewspaper headlines (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)As a member of our community and a business owner, I am conscious of the economics of our town.\nThe story has no local appeal, and quite frankly, I do not think it is newsworthy in any venue."}
