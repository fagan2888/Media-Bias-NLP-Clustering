But how many districts are ready to sign on?\n\nJames Woodcock, Billings Gazette/AP Photo Each year, meditation becomes more of a trend. Celebrities like Jerry Seinfeld and Goldie Hawn, businessmen like Bill George of Goldman Sachs and Exxon Mobil, and News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch, have publicly discussed practicing it. Techies and others in the corporate world have begun using mindfulness, a type of meditation, to combat the stress and overstimulation of their jobs. Even the Marines have used it to \u201cimprove mental performance under the stress and strain from war.\u201d At the same time, more and more studies are showing direct links between meditation and health benefits. A study led by researchers at John Hopkins found that just eight weeks of meditation training was as effective as medication in treating depression, anxiety, and pain. At Harvard, scientists using neuro-imaging technology showed how meditation positively affected the brain activity of the chronically stressed, a condition that the Benson-Henry Institute reports is related to more than 60 percent of all doctor\u2019s visits.\n\nSchools have also begun experimenting with the practice and discovering that its techniques can help its students. When a school in New Haven, Connecticut, required yoga and meditation classes three times a week for its incoming freshman, studies found that after each class, students had significantly reduced levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, in their bodies. In San Francisco, schools that participated in Quiet Time, a Transcendental Meditation program, had twice as many students score proficient in English on the California Achievement Test than in similar schools where the program didn\u2019t exist. Visitacion Valley Middle School specifically reduced suspensions by 45 percent during the program\u2019s first year. Attendance rates climbed to 98 percent, grade point averages improved, and the school recorded the highest happiness levels in San Francisco on the annual California Healthy Kids Survey. Other studies have shown that mindfulness education programs improved students\u2019 self-control, attentiveness and respect for other classmates, enhanced the school climate, and improved teachers\u2019 moods. These results did not surprise me. As a former teacher who now practices meditation myself, I\u2019ve often wondered how I could have used the practice in my own classroom. The stress level of teaching seemed to bring out my already-existing anxiety in the worst kind of ways. I slept poorly, unable to stop rehearsing my lessons in my head. I got irritable with loved ones. I felt obsessed with saving time when there was so much to do and so much to teach to students who I feared were behind. My students noticed, too. On a survey, one wrote, \u201cIt seems like you\u2019re really tense\u201d; another, \u201cYou can get easily frustrated with yourself.\u201d Meanwhile, my students seemed just as anxious as I was. My advisory group complained of the immense pressure of balancing school with their lives at home. Students constantly booked appointments with the school counselor to talk through their personal struggles with a professional. A common response from students on their semester reflections was \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nMonths after leaving the profession (partially due to its stress), I attended a ten-day beginner meditation retreat. It was the first time I ever attempted to learn the practice. I began to understand how powerful meditation could be in confronting the anxiety and insecurity my students felt at school and I felt while teaching, and often throughout most of my life. So when I discovered that some of my former students had participated in a mindfulness education program called Headstand in middle school before they became my high-school students, I was eager to find out its effects. \"As a 12-year-old kid, I didn\u2019t always feel comfortable moving my body in such a way.\" Headstand\u2019s mission is to \u201cempower at-risk students to combat toxic stress through yoga, mindfulness, and character education.\u201d Harvard's Center for the Developing Child defines toxic stress as \u201csevere, uncontrollable, chronic adversity\u201d and explains that it can disrupt the architecture of the developing brain, often impeding academic learning and creating long-term physical- and mental-health problems. With almost half of current public school students considered low-income, the issue of \u201ctoxic stress\u201d affecting young students has become more relevant. Katherine Priore Ghannam, Headstand\u2019s founder, says, \u201cThis is a matter of education reform and public health: Our students desperately need a way to cope with the everyday adversity of living in the conditions that they do. If we know this [stress] exists, I think we have the responsibility to provide such a simple tool to kids who need it the most.\u201d Ghannam believes her mindfulness program can serve as \u201can antidote to that stress\u201d and so far, surveys results suggest the program works: 98 percent of students in the program reported feeling \u201cless stressed\u201d and more \u201cready to learn\u201d after taking Headstand classes. Ghannam had no exposure to yoga or mindfulness growing up, and at first was skeptical it could work. Yet when the stress level during her first year teaching became overwhelming and made her begin to think her job was unsustainable, a close friend finally convinced her to take a yoga class.\n\n\u201cI had an experience in that very first class,\u201d Ghannam said. \u201cFor one of the first times in my life, I understood what it meant to be calm.\u201d Ghannam believes her yoga practice gave her the skills and strength she needed to not quit teaching during that difficult first year. After practicing yoga, she felt her new sense of calm transferred to the classroom and made the environment more welcoming for her students. Years later, she decided to merge the two areas by creating Headstand. Ghannam wants to emphasize \u201csmart practice.\u201d When she observed existing programs, she felt they lacked a crucial element: delivery. She saw many yoga instructors, accustomed to teaching in studios with middle-aged participants, not adapting their teaching strategies for children in public schools. \u201cFor teachers with that kind of experience, working with young students is like speaking a foreign language,\u201d Ghannam said, \u201cI can\u2019t emphasize enough how important it is to translate this content to the appropriate level for children. Otherwise, it won\u2019t make sense.\u201d She wondered how much greater the impact of a yoga program could be if she had academic teachers delivering the content, with a rigorous, professionally designed curriculum that made the content consistent and structured over time. Headstand employs this philosophy by only hiring yoga teachers who have three years of previous teaching experience. It also aligns its curriculum\u2019s teaching objectives with California state standards for physical education and health. Its curriculum uses the lesson plan structure taught in several teacher training programs. Lessons scaffold skills to gradually build up to the day\u2019s objective, starting with a \u201cDo Now\u201d that gets students reflecting on the day\u2019s topic and ending class with an \u201cexit ticket\u201d that assesses what they learned. Even though Headstand\u2019s mission and planning impressed me, I was still skeptical that young students could actually take yoga and mindfulness seriously. Related Story Teach Kids to Daydream Adam Moskowitz, a Headstand teacher, agreed that the practice can be difficult for some kids: \u201cAt their age\u2014and in this age\u2014the last thing some of them want to do is sit, with nothing to look at or play,\u201d he says, \u201cIn some ways, despite its great challenge, mindfulness is a very simple, repetitive practice. It\u2019s not always easy convincing kids that they\u2019re learning something by doing the same, simple thing again and again.\u201d\n\nI emailed my former students who took Headstand\u2019s classes in middle school to ask them about their impressions of the program. Michael Rivera, now a senior in high school, admitted that at first, he found yoga class \u201cdull.\u201d His next response also seemed very telling: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t as active as sports. There wasn\u2019t a lot of movement going on, so it reminded me of a \u2018time out,\u2019 like a punishment. We were stuck inside, instead of being outside and having an extra 45 minutes of P.E.\u201d His response exemplified two common attitudes: a refusal to believe anything but fast-pasted exercise can qualify as \u201cphysical education\u201d; and a tendency to equate active movement with productivity, and stillness with wasted time or even, as Michael noticed, \u201cpunishment.\u201d To me, this was the most revolutionary aspect of meditation programs: They teach the idea that slowing down is necessary, and that sometimes \u201cnot doing\u201d can be just as productive as \u201cdoing.\u201d Headstand\u2019s curriculum aims to promote this idea with its students. In one lesson plan, students brainstorm what they generally associate with the word \u201cslow\u201d and discuss why the word\u2019s connotation is generally negative. Then, they do a yoga sequence paced slowly and quickly at different times, and discuss how moving at each pace affected the tone of the room, and their own frame of mind. They brainstorm situations when acting slowly may be better than acting too quickly, like during an argument or when overwhelmed on a test. While teaching, I was always concerned with \u201cdoing,\u201d making sure my students and I constantly worked towards the goals we wanted to achieve. It wasn\u2019t until I practiced meditation that I realized what my schools and professional environment had never taught me: that instead of moving for the sake of moving, what both my students and I may have needed instead was a moment of being still. \u201cTheir minds are busy just like ours,\u201d says Emily Tsay, a Headstand teacher for first and second graders. \u201cBut you can see physically how their mood changes when we practice.\u201d She says she starts class by having students rest their minds for just three breaths and then builds up from that. On a chart posted on a wall of her class, she tracks how long they can sit with their eyes closed focusing only on their breath.\n\nNow looking back, Michael agrees that mindfulness practice was useful and appreciates the quiet environment the class provided: \u201cJust having a good 45 minutes to not hear any noise and keep to yourself mentally actually helped me prepare for the next class periods. After yoga class, I would feel pretty rejuvenated.\u201d Beth A. Keiser/AP Photo Headstand\u2019s curriculum also tries to stay true to the original purpose of yoga and meditation by framing each class around positive character traits, like compassion and gratitude. Recently, some critics have coined the term \"McMindfulness\" to criticize the mindfulness movement\u2019s tendency to only focus on reducing stress while ignoring the practice\u2019s other key goals of compassion and social awareness. Critics want to ensure that programs emphasize being mindful not only for your own benefit, but for the benefit of others. This makes the character education aspect of Headstand\u2019s curriculum significant. Each unit focuses on a certain trait. A unit on \u201cresponsibility\u201d is framed around questions like \u201cWhat does it mean to accept personal responsibility?\u201d, \u201cHow does being irresponsible affect the people around you?\u201d and \u201cHow are responsibility and power related?\u201d A unit on gratitude discusses the idea of \u201ctaking something for granted.\u201d A unit on \u201ccuriosity\u201d asks how curiosity can encourage social justice. Kelly Knoche, a yoga teacher helping to develop social-emotional curricula in Oakland, thinks this emphasis on character is imperative to providing true education: \u201cWe think we\u2019re teaching kids how to thrive by focusing on academics. But we often miss teaching them the skills they need for daily life: how to build relationships with compassion, how to support each other, how to cope with trauma. Those are the kinds of skills that will eventually keep them going.\u201d Headstand\u2019s emphasis on character education follows a trend that has gained momentum in urban education circles, particularly after the popularity of journalist Paul Tough\u2019s book How Children Succeed, based on his popular New York Times article. After dismal graduation statistics showed only nine percent of low-income students who enter a four-year college actually graduate, Tough\u2019s book theorized that the character traits of college students, even more than their academic skills, could predict whether they succeeded or not. Headstand\u2019s curriculum builds off of the seven traits that Tough argues are crucial for future success: grit, curiosity, self-control, social intelligence, zest, optimism, and gratitude.\n\nKnoche thinks bringing a program like Headstand to her school district would help accomplish this: \u201cHeadstand has a beautiful way of redefining what we believe public education should be and blending yoga, mindfulness and character education into those beliefs.\u201d But with issues like funding, class scheduling, graduation requirements, and other logistics, I wondered whether programs like Headstand and others could ever become a part of our public-education system. \u201cHeadstand has taken a specific model and made it successful within a charter network, which is relatively autonomous and flexible,\u201d Knoche says, \u201cNow the question is, how do we get an entire district on board?\u201d Parents and administrators have not always embraced these programs right away. Administrators at an Ohio elementary school discontinued the school\u2019s mindfulness program after parents felt uncomfortable with the practice\u2019s roots in Eastern religion and complained that the program did not use class time valuably. Last year, prosecutors in a prominent court case sued California's Encinitas Union school district, arguing that the district\u2019s yoga program indoctrinated students with Hindu beliefs. \u201cTo me, yoga is secular. Everybody breathes, everybody gets stressed, everybody can benefit from the skills we teach,\u201d Tsay says, \u201cBut I definitely think there is resistance with people not being aware of what yoga is because they haven\u2019t practiced it themselves.\u201d In July, the judge in the Encinitas case ruled on the side of the school district, finding that the curriculum had no trace of religion, opening up the possibility of spreading yoga to other public schools in California. But even disregarding the religious undertones of the practice, I also wondered how public school students, 48 percent of which are considered low-income and more than 40 percent of which are black and Latino, would receive a practice that is often stereotypically associated with a white, upper-class demographic. According to a 2008 study, 85 percent of yoga practitioners are white. More than 30 percent of Yoga Journal magazine\u2019s readership have incomes over $100,000 a year. \"Through yoga, I reprogrammed my mind to accept my disabilities and to not be crippled by them.\" Growing up in a Latino middle-class family, I had never known anyone who practiced yoga or meditation. My father adopted \u201cPower Yoga\u201d in his early 60s to improve his flexibility, but he still skips the meditation part at the end of the routine. Seeing how hesitant my family has been, I doubted that students from similar backgrounds would instantly embrace Headstand classes. When I asked my former students how they perceived the program, the two students who responded\u2014both students of color from lower-middle-class backgrounds\u2014agreed that at first, the ideas of yoga and mindfulness were unfamiliar.\n\n\u201cBefore the class, I had never heard about yoga before and did not know what to expect,\u201d Tracy Lord, now a senior in high school, told me. \u201cSo most students at first were hesitant to participate and try.\u201d Michael also felt that teenage insecurities often played a role in students resisting the class: \u201cAs a 12-year-old kid, I didn\u2019t always feel comfortable moving my body in such a way.\u201d Tracy echoed these insecurities: \u201cAt first, I kind of rejected the practice because it made me too vulnerable, with its awkward poses and asking me to close my eyes. I didn\u2019t want to look weird.\u201d Yet both Michael and Tracy eventually found Headstand\u2019s classes beneficial. Tracy thought her teacher helped students overcome their timidity, and \u201cwon over\u201d the majority of the class over time. Tracy ended up loving the practice so much that she wrote her college application personal statement on the effect yoga had on her life. In her statement, Tracy described a doctor\u2019s visit where she learned she had issues with her spine that caused her immense back pain and physical disability. She wrote that yoga helped her by not only easing the physical pain, but also teaching her that \u201cMy imperfections were what made me unique. Through yoga, I reprogrammed my mind to accept my disabilities and to not be crippled by them. I still have a twisted spine, but I can persevere through it.\u201d Michael still thinks middle school was too early for him to handle the \u201cembarrassing poses\u201d of yoga class, but also admits that he still found the mindfulness practice useful: \u201cBefore taking the yoga class, I used to believe that the only thing I had to work out and take care of was my body, but that isn\u2019t the case. You also have to take care of your mind.\u201d Now a senior experiencing the stress of the college application process, Michael used the skills from the class again. He noticed how his mood changed and self-confidence dipped when worrying about completing his applications. \u201cBut now I could stop and realize that this stress is all right. I meditated for an hour when I got home and submitted my applications soon after. That one hour period probably saved me another month of stress.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Meditation can help students be less stressed and more compassionate.
