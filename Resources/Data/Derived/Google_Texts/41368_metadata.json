Gut also won Friday\u2019s super-combined, beating Vonn by 0.01 of a second. She got the upper hand again this time.\n\nVonn was 10th in Sunday\u2019s morning first run but finished 13th with sunny conditions fading on the Emile-Allais course.\n\n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t quite right today. \u2026 It was pretty dark the second run, but normally I\u2019m good at that,\u201d said Vonn, who picked up 20 World Cup points compared with Gut\u2019s 80. \u201cI just kept catching my edge doing weird stuff. I didn\u2019t really feel very balanced. But it was a good effort; I tried really hard and got some points.\u201d\n\nVonn, 31, will rest before returning to action in another GS at the Austrian resort of Lienz on Dec. 28.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lara Gut second in World Cup giant slalom, first overall", "title": "Lara Gut second in World Cup giant slalom, first overall", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/20/lara-gut-second-in-world-cup-giant-slalom-first-overall/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151220__Lara-Gutp1.jpg", "height": 452}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151220__Lara-Gutp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-20T18:08:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:59:49+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Gut, who overtook Vail\u2019s Lindsey Vonn for the overall lead, finished tied for second place with Norway\u2019s Nina Loeseth, who secured a career-best result.\nGut won Saturday\u2019s downhill, which Vonn failed to finish after skiing off the course.\n\u2026 It was pretty dark the second run, but normally I\u2019m good at that,\u201d said Vonn, who picked up 20 World Cup points compared with Gut\u2019s 80.\nGut also won Friday\u2019s super-combined, beating Vonn by 0.01 of a second.\nCOURCHEVEL, France \u2014 Austrian skier Eva-Maria Brem safely protected her lead from the first leg to win a World Cup giant slalom race Sunday, picking up the second victory of her career and denying Swiss star Lara Gut a third consecutive race victory."}
