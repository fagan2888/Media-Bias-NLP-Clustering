Comedian Bill Burr took on the pronoun police in full force since Caitlyn Jenner’s public transition from a man to a woman, lamenting on “Conan” Thursday night that expressing any level of shock makes you a homophobe.

“You couldn’t on any level be like, you know, ‘what the f,’ on any level — you couldn’t say that or you’re automatically homophobic,” Mr. Burr said. “It’s like, dude, I didn’t hear your inner thoughts. I didn’t know what you were doing.”

“You shave your beard off and people are like, ‘Oh, my God, that’s your chin? Wow!’” he joked. “This guy walked out a dude, came back a woman, and you’re just supposed to be like, ‘Oh yeah, so anyways, Caitlyn, as I was saying.’”

“God bless him,” Mr. Burr said of Jenner. “God bless her — sorry! They really freak out about the pronouns too. You say, ‘God bless him’ and they’re like, ‘Her!’”

The jokes sparked the ire of social media users and The Mary Sue’s Maddy Myers, who called the segment “painful and depressing and sickening.”

“[I]t’s also unfortunately a reflection of how incredibly ignorant many cis people still are when it comes to the experiences of trans people, especially trans women who have to navigate transmisogyny in particular,” Ms. Myers wrote.
