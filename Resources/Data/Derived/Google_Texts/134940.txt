Prepare for some pissing and moaning, probably, over Old Handsome Joe Biden just being Old Handsome Joe Biden again: Thursday, at a Harvard event, His Handsomeness said a swear, kinda-sorta:

“Isn’t it a bitch, I mean … that vice president thing?” Biden joked, as the audience reportedly erupted with laughter. ”I’m joking. I’m joking. I’m joking. The best decision I ever made.”

All of which leads one to wonder, once more, what Old Handsome Joe Biden has against dogs, like that time he just cold killed one. (OK, his motorcade did. Still, he’s a monster.)

Talking Points Memo provided this note, by way of context:

Biden is known for often making verbal gaffes, perhaps his most famous coming when he was caught on an open mic telling President Obama that passage of the Affordable Care Act was a “big fucking deal.” Biden later said he was “embarrassed as hell” about it.

Is that a “gaffe,” even? A gaffe is saying something embarrassingly wrong, like when Gerald Ford said there was “no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe.” But passing the ACA really was a big fucking deal. Guys, if you’re going to talk about Biden gaffes, at least go with his real gaffes, like that weird “Shylock” line a few weeks back.

Also, sorry, OHJB — you’re going to have to go a long way to reach the stratosphere of slams on your own job. The best, of course, still belongs to John Nance Garner, FDR’s first veep, who today is known for exactly one thing, which was calling the vice-presidency “not worth a bucket of warm piss” — often toned down for the more easily upset as “warm spit” (either bucket can give you Ebola, though).
