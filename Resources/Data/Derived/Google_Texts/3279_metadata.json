A string of lucky spins and cunning puzzle solutions \u2014 really, \u201cExceptional Wildlife Preserves\u201d? \u2014 landed Manchester in the Bonus Round, poised to walk away a winner.\n\nEven in the final moments, she kept her cool. The charity letters \u2014 R, S, T, L, N, and E \u2014 danced onto the board, and immediately the solution was obvious, as if the letters were already aglow in their boxes. Loud Laughter, Manchester exclaimed immediately: a fitting solution to what later ensued, after Wheel host Pat Sajak opened the envelope to reveal Manchester had struck gold. She was walking away a millionaire \u2014 the $17,490 she\u2019d won leading up to it all but gravy.\n\nMath teacher Sarah Manchester won a million dollars on a recent episode of Wheel of Fortune.

A hefty sum by windfall standards, the conventional wisdom would suggest Manchester\u2019s celebration, under the shower of confetti, was solid indication of the happiness her winnings would bring. But a growing body of research suggests huge piles of cash \u2014 known more formally as \u201cexogenous income\u201d \u2014 may not lead to smiles. In fact, it could end in misery.\n\nWinning large sums of money all at once is reserved for two occasions. The first are the Sarah Manchesters of the world \u2014 the game show jackpot winners who beat the slim odds and then the really slim odds, to win a million dollars or something in that neighborhood. But then there are the other winners, the safe crackers, who marshal the forces of darkness to be that \u201cone\u201d in \u201cone in a billion,\u201d and who have the terribly happy problem of deciding if they want nine figures up front or seven figures for the next four decades.\n\nThe lottery, researchers now argue, could be more of a curse than a blessing. \u201cThose who win more on the lottery smoke more and engage in more social drinking, both of which are likely detrimental to general health,\u201d wrote B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Apouey and Andrew E. Clark, economists at the Paris School of Economics, in a 2010 study. More money may produce a spike in happiness initially, but over time that effect fades.\n\nThe reason it fades involves a psychological phenomenon known as \u201cadaptation level theory.\u201d Each time something new and exciting happens in our lives, we feel a surge of pleasure. Our brains get a serotonin dump. A new pair of well-fitting jeans or a novelty check with six zeroes on it both promote happiness, and, for good reason, in different measure.\n\nBut adaptation level theory respects the relativity of happiness, too. It knows, for instance, that losing the use of your limbs won\u2019t make you significantly unhappier, after you\u2019ve had enough time to habituate yourself to the new normal. This was demonstrated most famously in a 1978 study involving 22 major lottery winners, 29 paralyzed accident victims, and 22 controls. In both experimental cases, people weren\u2019t all that worse or better off than the controls. Once the major event was in the past, levels tended back toward a baseline.\n\n\u201cAs predicted, lottery winners were not happier than controls and took significantly less pleasure from a series of mundane events,\u201d the researchers wrote. Suddenly, the chore of washing dishes had turned to a sense of nostalgia, sweeping the floor romanticized. What was once a nagging burden now seemed, in hindsight, like a simple joy.\n\nA bundle of other studies affirm the same outcome: Some money makes you happier than no money, but more money won\u2019t necessarily make you happier than less. What happens to your health is largely a product of your current situation. How you spend now, in other words, without the huge pile of cash, will probably determine how you treat it once you\u2019re sitting on top of it.\n\nIn 2009, for instance, researchers from Vanderbilt University and the University of Kentucky found people who won between $50,000 and $150,000 still didn\u2019t resolve the debt they carried before winning. Roughly one percent of lottery winners go bankrupt each year, double the rate of the general population.\n\nAs for Sarah Manchester, the Silver Spring-native says she isn\u2019t sure how she\u2019ll spend the winnings. A sizable chunk will end up in the pockets of the colleges her kids eventually attend, but the remainder is up in the air. And it\u2019s probably in little danger. Even before her win, Manchester was already calculating.\n\nWhen Sajak asked if she\u2019d been figuring out her chances all the while, she responded as any math teacher who\u2019s worth her salt would: \u201cI assessed that the probability was low, but even unlikely events sometimes happen!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "wheel, fortune, contestant, wins, coveted, 1m, jackpot, sad, science, big, wins", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Huge piles of cash aren't always the godsend we make them out to be.", "title": "When Winning $1M Is Anything But A Blessing [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/wheel-fortune-contestant-wins-coveted-1m-jackpot-sad-science-big-wins-303864", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/18/money.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Huge piles of cash aren't always the godsend we make them out to be.", "title": "When Winning $1M Is Anything But A Blessing [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/wheel-fortune-contestant-wins-coveted-1m-jackpot-sad-science-big-wins-303864", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/18/money.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/18/money.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-09-18T15:41:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-18T15:41:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Huge piles of cash aren't always the godsend we make them out to be."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb439\"", "article_summary": "Math teacher Sarah Manchester won a million dollars on a recent episode of Wheel of Fortune.\nThis past Wednesday, Maryland math teacher Sarah Manchester became the third person in history to win the $1,000,000 jackpot on the rainbow-clad game show Wheel of Fortune.\nThis was demonstrated most famously in a 1978 study involving 22 major lottery winners, 29 paralyzed accident victims, and 22 controls.\nRoughly one percent of lottery winners go bankrupt each year, double the rate of the general population.\n\u201cAs predicted, lottery winners were not happier than controls and took significantly less pleasure from a series of mundane events,\u201d the researchers wrote."}
