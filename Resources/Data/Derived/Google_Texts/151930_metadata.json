The other two both came in 2010, one to announce the end of U.S. combat operations in Iraq and the other to discuss the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, an event that\u2019s slipped way, way down in ensuing years on the list of things to be angry at Obama about. The fact that that merited an Oval Office telecast while, say, the Iran deal or the disastrous launch of ObamaCare or riots in Ferguson, etc, didn\u2019t makes tonight\u2019s speech feel as random as the New York Times avoiding page-one editorials for most of the major events of the 20th century only to fart one out yesterday about gun control. In both cases the strategy seems to be that when you\u2019ve got nothing new or interesting to say about your base\u2019s hobbyhorse, you should at least say it with maximum pomp.\n\nThe White House is billing this speech as an update on the San Bernardino attack in the context of \u201cthe broader threat of terrorism.\u201d That\u2019s not the memo CBS got, though:\n\nTonight, @CBSNlive streams @POTUS' urgent address to the nation on gun control at 8 P.M. ET https://t.co/gnfoOrVB7A pic.twitter.com/heUTQRwPTK \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) December 6, 2015\n\nThat\u2019s not the memo Loretta Lynch got either:\n\nShe also said that he\u2019ll speak on the actions the United States has taken to keep the homeland safe since the attacks in Paris last month. But there will be an element of politics to the speech. President Obama will do more than just call for calm, he will ask \u201cCongress to review measures and take action.\u201d Lynch\u2019s staff later confirmed that the president will specifically call on Congress to review certain gun control measures.\n\nTom Elliott half-jokes, \u201cI foresee Obama hitting terror tonight on all three root causes: the 2nd Amendment, the 1st Amendment, and global warming.\u201d\n\nYou can imagine how this\u2019ll go. He\u2019ll start with San Bernardino, double down on his claim that ISIS is \u201ccontained\u201d on the battlefield but that its below-the-radar western sympathizers remain a threat to their home countries, and then meander towards saying that one part of any effective counterterrorism strategy is preventing terrorists\u2019 access to weapons, which is why he needs to take immediate executive action to close the \u201cgun-show loophole\u201d and/or strip people on the no-fly list of their right to buy guns without due process regardless of whether either of those things would have impeded Farook and his jihadbot wife. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll go full metal gun-grabber by dwelling on the subject, though, for the same reason he didn\u2019t do so a few days ago when he offered his \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d for the victims\u2019 families. Even this guy can\u2019t be so deluded about Americans\u2019 priorities that he\u2019d believe gun control is what most people are thinking about right now rather than pondering how many other Farooks are out there. He may be tone-deaf but he got slapped around hard enough after scolding the public for worrying about Syrian refugees a few weeks ago that he must have learned a lesson from it. You don\u2019t lecture your constituents about their supposed failings after the most deadly terror attack on the United States since 9/11. Right?\n\nHere\u2019s a question to chew on: Why is he giving this speech at all? No one expects to hear anything new from him about the terror threat. He\u2019ll go on a bit about \u201clone wolves\u201d self-radicalizing by consuming propaganda online and how that represents a \u201cnew kind of threat,\u201d but we\u2019ve heard it all before. The reason Obama took out Anwar al-Awlaki a few years ago, whatever the feds may say about his \u201coperational planning,\u201d is that his sermons about jihad seemed to hold special power to inspire far-flung amateur jihadis like Nidal Hasan. Lone wolves and Internet connections are nothing new. Meanwhile, the gun-control passages tonight will be a fine bit of pandering to his base, but they\u2019ve heard all of that before too. And the pandering in this case comes at a steep price. We\u2019re already headed towards record gun sales this year, with Black Friday a few weeks setting a new benchmark for background checks in a single day; a presidential warning about guns from the Oval Office on national TV is apt to spark the biggest gun-buying frenzy in modern history. (Maybe that\u2019s Obama\u2019s secret plan to put them out of business \u2014 to crush them under the sheer weight of demand for their product.) The smartest thing he and the Times could do to limit new gun purchases would be to stop talking about guns, and yet they persist, knowing there\u2019s not the faintest chance a Republican Congress will agree to it. So why bother? The lame duck doesn\u2019t need to impress liberal voters at this point, and his legacy as anti-gun is already secure among historians. Hillary will use gun control to rally the left whether or not Obama speaks up about it.\n\nIf there\u2019s any \u201clegacy\u201d politics being played tonight, I think it has less to do with guns and more to do with O belatedly realizing that he\u2019s going to leave office with a \u201ccaliphate\u201d in the heart of the Middle East and various western nations battling a homegrown jihadi threat that\u2019s greater now than when he took office. Americans\u2019 concern about terror is spiking and yet most of O\u2019s most memorable rhetoric has to do with ISIS being the \u201cJV team\u201d and why it\u2019s wrong to say \u201cradical Islam\u201d and how it\u2019s un-American for you to fret about jihadis exploiting the refugee process to infiltrate the country. His counterterror legacy, which started with aggressive drone strikes against jihadi leaders and peaked with the raid on Bin Laden, is collapsing. He needs to leave some kind of marker for historians that he was fully aware of the problem and took it seriously. That\u2019s the point of this speech.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Enemies.", "title": "Open thread: Obama to lay out his strategy for fighting terrorists, a.k.a. law-abiding American gun owners", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/12/06/open-thread-obama-to-lay-out-his-strategy-for-fighting-terrorists-a-k-a-law-abiding-american-gun-owners/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-07T00:31:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-06T19:18:55+00:00"}, "keywords": "farook, gun control, guns, ISIS, jihad, malik, Obama, Oval Office, San Bernardino, Second Amendment, speech, terror, weapons,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Hillary will use gun control to rally the left whether or not Obama speaks up about it.\nOpen thread: Obama to lay out his strategy for fighting terrorists, a.k.a.\nNo one expects to hear anything new from him about the terror threat.\nEven this guy can\u2019t be so deluded about Americans\u2019 priorities that he\u2019d believe gun control is what most people are thinking about right now rather than pondering how many other Farooks are out there.\nlaw-abiding American gun ownersposted at 7:31 pm on December 6, 2015 by AllahpunditLive at 8 p.m."}
