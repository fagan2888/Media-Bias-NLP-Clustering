Companies like Wellmark say as a result, they were forced to increase insurance rates to cover the cost of individuals who did not pay their premium.\n\nThe Iowa Insurance Division calls the tactic, \u201cadverse selection.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s when people choose to receive benefits at their convenience,\u201d says Tom Alger. \u201cIt\u2019s a reality of the business of insurance and sometimes that does come into play and sometimes that affects future rates.\u201d\n\nAlger affirms \u201cadverse selection\u201d is within the rules but there is nothing insurance companies can do to prohibit members from taking advantage of the system. By law, companies have to re-issue Affordable Care Act polices when requested and are not allowed to ask how the members policy was used before they canceled their coverage.\n\n\u201cThe hard part of this is, is that when you put a lot of people into the system you do have pent up demand and we all have to pay for it,\u201d says Jackson.\n\nWellmark indiviual member rates will also increase by nearly 6 %. No other members of Wellmark will be affected.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DES MOINES, Iowa - Affordable Care Act members across the state will see an increase in their insurance rates.
