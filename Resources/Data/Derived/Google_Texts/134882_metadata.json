And its members certainly can\u2019t agree which movie the latest Capitol Hill fighting best resembles.\n\nIs it \u201cStar Wars\u201d? \u201cPsycho\u201d? \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d? A Fellini film? Or \u201cHigh Noon\u201d?\n\nEach has been mentioned by congressmen in the past few weeks. Then again, so have \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d and \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d\n\nThe movie comparisons began in late September as the congressional logjam over continued government funding became apparent and have continued since.\n\nSee video: Jon Stewart: Sean Hannity Doesn\u2019t Mind the Government Shutdown, Why Should We?\n\nOn Oct. 5, for example, Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.), invoked \u201cCatch-22\u201d author Joseph Heller and Fellini while rebuking House attempts to shut down the government, then reopen agencies like the National Institutes of Health to curb negative publicity.\n\n\u201cThe Tea Party Republicans came here because they were concerned about the debt,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cNow they\u2019ve shut down their government like an arsonist sets a fire, and they\u2019re coming around, acting like they\u2019re firefighters who are trying to rescue the children who they didn\u2019t realize were in the building and who couldn\u2019t get help from the NIH for their cancer treatments and the veterans they\u2019re going to rescue who couldn\u2019t go to the memorials and the Federal workers who aren\u2019t getting paid.\n\n\u201cIt is like a Fellini movie,\u201d he said.\n\nVirginia Republican Rep. Frank Wolf, whose suburban Washington district has been heavily affected by the government layoffs, also pointed to the movies in a separate discussion that same day about a proposal to pay federal workers when the shutdown ends.\n\n\u201cI saw the movie \u2018Zero Dark Thirty.\u2019 If you looked at that movie, it was about catching bin Laden. The woman who did it, Maya, has she been furloughed? Where is Maya? We don\u2019t know where she is. But has she been furloughed? Should she not get paid?\u201d he said.\n\nAlso read: Government Shutdown Brings Ban on TV, Film Location Shoots in L.A. Federal Locales\n\nSenators offered their own comparisons.\n\n\u201cI remember the Bill Murray movie \u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 \u2014 a wonderful movie, farcical but nowhere near as farcical as the groundhog day we have once again in Congress,\u201d Vermont Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy told the Senate on Sept. 24.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) suggested a gangster film.\n\n\u201cWe think the Affordable Care Act will help more Americans get affordable health insurance. Republicans don\u2019t agree. So they should campaign on it in the next election. If they can get the votes, elect enough Senators, et cetera, repeal it. But that\u2019s not what they\u2019re doing. They are blackmailing the country,\u201d he said on the House floor on Sept 28.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a 1930s gangster film: \u2018That\u2019s a nice government you got there. That\u2019s a nice economy you got there. Pity if it should happen to blow up if you don\u2019t pay us off by giving us what we want.'\u201d\n\nSee video: Stephen Colbert on Government Shutdown: Defunding Obamacare Is a Compromise\n\nFlorida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio launched a dialogue about the appropriate movie comparison a couple weeks ago.\n\n\u201cIt feels like the horror movies where you scream at the screen: \u2018Don\u2019t go in that room. Don\u2019t do it.\u2019 But they do it anyway,\u201d he said Sept. 24. \u201cIn some ways, everything we are facing with the debt and Obamacare is similar to a horror movie. We know how it ends if we stay on this path. We know what happens in the horror movie if they open the door. The bad guy is on the other side.\u201d\n\nTexas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz jumped on the analogy, invoking the \u201cPsycho\u201d shower scene before before move onto more recent horror villains. \u201cPerhaps one of the great philosophical conundrums with which we must all wrestle is whether Obamacare is more like Jason or Freddy,\u201d he said.\n\nSee video: Jon Stewart to GOP: Own Government Shutdown, Don\u2019t Fart and Blame the Dog\n\n\u201cYou can put forth a powerful argument for Jason because Obamacare is the biggest job killer in this country and when Jason put on his hockey mask and swung that machete, there was carnage like nothing else. On the other hand, we could make a powerful argument for Freddy, because as James Hoffa, the president of the Teamsters said, Obamacare is a nightmare. It is a nightmare for the men and women of America.\n\nCruz also name-checked \u201cStar Wars,\u201d concurring with Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul that the country needed a rebellion against oppression they argue the Affordable Care Act represents.\n\n\u201cI will confess that it reminded me of a movie series \u2014 and that was the \u2018Star Wars\u2019 franchise and the discussion of a rebellion against oppression,\u201d he said during his marathon session. He said he thought of \u201cthe Rebel Alliance fighting against the Empire \u2014 the Empire being the Washington, DC, establishment. Indeed, immediately upon hearing that phrase, I wondered if at some point we would see a tall gentleman in a mechanical breathing apparatus come forward and say in a deep voice, \u2018Mike Lee, I am your father.\u201d\u2019\n\nDemocratic senators offered their own movie comparisons.\n\nSee video: Jon Stewart Calls House Republicans \u2018Self-Righteous, Orwellian Zebra Queefs\u2019\n\nSen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) warned that the House\u2019s attempt to prioritize Social Security checks and payments to foreign bondholders in the event of a debt default would result in a situation akin to \u201cThe Hunger Games.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you imagine the result? Medicare beneficiaries will be pitted against disabled vets, each fighting the other. Students receiving Pell grants will be up against patients receiving medical care; doctors conducting cancer research would be pitted against agents patrolling our borders,\u201d he said in a Sept. 26 floor speech.\n\nAlso read: Jon Stewart on Government Shutdown: Smokey the Bear Forced to Give Handjobs for Money\n\nHe said the House plan for a debt prioritization \u201cwould pit one program against another in a fight for survival\u201d in advance of the movie sequel\u2019s arrival in theaters.\n\nSen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), suggested a more classic movie comparison: \u201cHigh Noon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe two sides are walking down the street,\u201d he said Sept. 27. \u201cI just hope, like in the movie,\u2019 the good guys win. I hope reason and judiciousness and a sense of responsibility to the people of this country prevails, and not some knee-jerk reaction to what a few people in the House of Representatives want to do to our government.\u201d\n\nOther congressmen suggested that the standoff had cinematic potential.\n\n\u201cThe drama that has played out on the floor of the House would make for a great movie,\u201d said Rep. GK Butterfield (D-N.C.). \u201cI must remind my colleagues that we aren\u2019t in Hollywood, and their dangerous and thoughtless actions aren\u2019t without consequences.\u201d\n\nWhile senators and congressmen point to the movies, neither Republicans or Democrats give any indication they are expecting the words of certain Hollywood movie star, a pig named Porky, to close the fight any time soon.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/shutdown-movies-hunger-games-star-wars-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Ira Teinowitz", "description": "Congressmen keep comparing the protracted battle over the budget and the Affordable Care Act to movies", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "Congressmen keep comparing the protracted battle over the budget and the Affordable Care Act to movies", "title": "Government Shutdown as a Movie: 'Star Wars'?
