Now you’ve done it, Hobby Lobby. You’ve forced actor George Takei to drop the F-bomb in a nonsensical meme.

.@GeorgeTakei I hope that meme at least made you feel better, because it made no sense whatsoever. — The Storm Crow (@Stormcrow6) July 1, 2014

@GeorgeTakei I love when people like you get mad at rulings like this but when you win you tell us to shut up and deal with it. #hypocrite — Hokie Hunter (@Hokiehunter13) July 1, 2014

@GeorgeTakei ya know what George? I support Gay Rights & believe in freedoms. Thought you did too. But that means supporting ALL freedom. — NOTDaleJR88 (@NOTDaleJR88) July 1, 2014

That “f**king crafts store” also drove Takei to blog about “how the U.S Supreme Court believes corporations are people, yet treats women inhumanely.”

Inhumanely.

He trots out everything from Scientology to Sharia Law in his quest to portray Hobby Lobby as a company that “can refuse to provide insurance covering contraception to its female employees.” (Never mind the 16 types of birth control Hobby Lobby covers. Reading is hard.)

Takei also calls for a boycott and tells all you ladies what you should do. Because he knows best so pipe down and do as you’re told.

The only way such companies ever learn to treat people with decency and tolerance is to hit them where it counts–in their pocketbooks. I won’t be shopping there, and women everywhere should exercise their right of protest and refuse to shop there as well.

Hey, feminists, isn’t this the part where you call him out for “mansplaining” and infantilizing women by telling them what to do?

Chirp. Chirp. Chirp.
