Words By Drew Ricketts

Last night, I learned that a dress I saw as white and gold was a dress that is black and blue.

Fine.

It taught me that most of the human experience can be summed up in a phrase: It is what it is.

Rather than get hung up on differences in viewpoint, we can all go ahead and admit how strongly we felt about our own. There isn’t much to it besides that.

Yet, I shudder at the paragraphs sure to flow about #TheDress today.

So, I made you a shield from all the thinkpieces, so you can be armed and dangerous.

1. It’s the Internet and you literally have access to every way of explaining something but you go and choose to ramble. OK.

2. Heard of memes at all? Or nah?

3. Guarantee someone else is already working just as hard at NOT SAYING SOMETHING NEW.

4. Kanye does too many things to write about all of them, and so you feel guilty because instead of also doing things here you go writing about things the next man doing like your blood type = Hater.

5. TL;DR

6. Someone is already think-piecing your think piece when you, in your self-satisfied haze, thought it was over.

7. There’s a Stan with a hit-piece loaded up about your think piece and he is waiting to pull that trigger.

8. Twitter, b.

9. The Obamacare deadline is coming up. Have you finished that yet? Naw. But you 80% done with your thinkpiece? Cool.

10. Of the myriad kinds of writers, only bloggers use the word ‘think piece’ regularly.

Rant over.*
