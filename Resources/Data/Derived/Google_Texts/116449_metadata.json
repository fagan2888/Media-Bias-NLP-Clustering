Officials said a federal mandate requiring birth control coverage is unconstitutional.\n\nAve Maria University filed a lawsuit against the federal government over a year ago alleging the insurance mandate under Obamacare violated their religious beliefs.\n\nUnder the law, all employers that are not churches are required to cover contraception in their insurance plans.\n\nAve Maria\u2019s lawsuit was thrown out because many provisions in the law weren\u2019t finalized at that point. Now that they are, the university\u2019s president Jim Towey said they are seeking legal recourse once more.\n\n\u201cWe feel very strongly that as a faith-based university we are entitled to protections as a religious organization under the law, this has been granted by republican and democratic administrations alike for decades,\u201d he said. \u201cBut for some reasons this administration decided to very narrowly define religious organizations to include only churches\u201d\n\nTowey said this requirement is an overreach by the federal government.\n\n\u201cWe feel that is a mandate that is beyond the federal government\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we think it\u2019s unconstitutional. We think it\u2019s a violation of federal law and we think it\u2019s against what\u2019s been America\u2019s tradition of providing space for faith based organizations to be in the public square and not requiring them to abandon their rights and conscious.\u201d\n\nThe mandate was created by the Department of Health as a way to combat the sometimes prohibitive costs of contraception.\n\nBecause religious hospitals and university\u2019s\u2014including Ave Maria\u2014hire non-Catholics, the administration\u2019s mandate was aimed at including the widest range of employers possible.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government", "description": "Ave Maria University in eastern Collier County has filed another lawsuit against the 2010 health care law.
