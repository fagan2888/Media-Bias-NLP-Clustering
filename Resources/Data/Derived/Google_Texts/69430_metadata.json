Now, a study finds that if you're an American with low-risk prostate or breast cancer, your odds for getting an unnecessary scan vary based on where you live.\n\nOne expert said the unwarranted ordering of imaging scans can have a big ripple effect on medical bills.\n\nReining in the use of these scans \"is important not only for the immediate economic impact of inappropriate testing, but also for the downstream costs caused by additional testing, both imaging and biopsies, that result from these tests,\" said Dr. Kathryn Evers, director of breast imaging at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. She was not involved in the new study.\n\nThe study was led by Dr. Danil Makarov of NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. His team examined the 2004-2007 medical records of more than 9,200 men with low-risk prostate cancer and nearly 30,400 women with low-risk breast cancer. All were treated at one of 84 different hospital referral regions across the country.\n\nOveruse of medical imaging occurred among more than 44 percent of the men and nearly 42 percent of the women, the researchers found.\n\nHowever, there were notable differences between regions, with higher rates in the Northeast, and lower rates in the Northwest and Utah.\n\n\"These findings challenge us to move in a different direction than focusing exclusively on individual patient/doctor decision making,\" Makarov, assistant professor of urology, population health and health policy at NYU Langone, said in a center news release.\n\nPolicy makers should target areas where imaging is overused and \"promote incentives for appropriate care,\" he said. \"Such a focus would enhance efforts to cut excessive health spending.\"\n\nFor her part, Evers said the study has \"interesting and provocative questions about the role of regional differences in how health care dollars are spent.\"\n\nThe study was published online March 12 in the journal JAMA Oncology.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about medical imaging.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/health-technology-information-18/medical-technology-news-466/excessive-use-of-medical-scans-varies-by-region-697336.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/MIC090.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Doctors tend to order more imaging technologies in the Northeast, study found", "title": "Excessive Use of Medical Scans Varies By Region"}, "description": "Doctors tend to order more imaging technologies in the Northeast, study found", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "One expert said the unwarranted ordering of imaging scans can have a big ripple effect on medical bills.\nTHURSDAY, March 12, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- The overuse of expensive medical imaging such as MRI and CT scans is an ongoing cause of concern.\nMore informationThe U.S. National Library of Medicine has more about medical imaging.\nHis team examined the 2004-2007 medical records of more than 9,200 men with low-risk prostate cancer and nearly 30,400 women with low-risk breast cancer.\nThe study was led by Dr. Danil Makarov of NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City."}
