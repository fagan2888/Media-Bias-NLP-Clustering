His doctor, Ronny L. Jackson, said he was releasing the health information included in a letter to press secretary Jay Carney with the consent of the president.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s overall health is excellent,\u201d Jackson wrote. \u201cAll clinical data indicates that the President is currently healthy and that he will remain so for the duration of his presidency.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the nicotine gum, which he uses occasionally, Obama, 52, takes a daily Vitamin D supplement to treat a mild deficiency and occasionally takes ibuprofen, a non-prescription pain reliever and anti-inflammatory drug to treat intermittent plantar fasciitis, his doctor said. The president also has taken an anti-malaria pill, Malarone, for the times he\u2019s traveled to areas where the disease is endemic.\n\nCholesterol Levels\n\nObama, who in previous years blamed his cholesterol results on the plethora of desserts available to him as president, still has elevated levels. At 213 mg/dL, he falls in the range of \u201cborderline high\u201d according to the Mayo Clinic\u2019s website, which classifies anything from 200-239 mg/dL in that category.\n\nAt 6 foot 1 inch, Obama weighs 180 pounds and has perfect 20/20 vision. Exams of Obama\u2019s eyes, head, ears, nose and throat as well as neck, were all normal. So too were his neurological, pulmonary, cardiology, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tests.\n\nOther than Obama\u2019s recurrent plantar fasciitis in his right foot, which could explain why he\u2019s been playing less basketball, the president\u2019s musculoskeletal exam was \u201cunremarkable.\u201d The doctor also noted \u201cseveral small benign skin tags\u201d on his neck, though there\u2019s no evidence of skin cancer or any sort of skin disease.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Julianna Goldman", "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama has been given a clean bill of health, and even with the occasional use of a nicotine gum his doctor says that test results indicate he\u2019ll remain healthy for the rest of his time in office.", "title": "Obama Deemed Healthy With Occasional Nicotine Gum Fix", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/obama-deemed-healthy-with-occasional-nicotine-gum-fix", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iNYrPElfr8qU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Julianna Goldman", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,Barack H Obama", "news_keywords": "Health,Barack H Obama", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/obama-deemed-healthy-with-occasional-nicotine-gum-fix", "parsely-title": "Obama Deemed Healthy With Occasional Nicotine Gum Fix", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-06-12T20:50:50.835Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "President Barack Obama has been given a clean bill of health, and even with the occasional use of a nicotine gum his doctor says that test results indicate he\u2019ll remain healthy for the rest of his time in office.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Barack H Obama,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-06-12T20:50:50.835Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "President Barack Obama has been given a clean bill of health, and even with the occasional use of a nicotine gum his doctor says that test results indicate he\u2019ll remain healthy for the rest of his time in office.", "title": "Obama Deemed Healthy With Occasional Nicotine Gum Fix", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/obama-deemed-healthy-with-occasional-nicotine-gum-fix", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iNYrPElfr8qU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "President Barack Obama has been given a clean bill of health, and even with the occasional use of a nicotine gum his doctor says that test results indicate he\u2019ll remain healthy for the rest of his time in office."}, "parsely-post-id": "N72P3U6TTDT601", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iNYrPElfr8qU/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc194\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama has been given a clean bill of health, and even with the occasional use of a nicotine gum his doctor says that test results indicate he\u2019ll remain healthy for the rest of his time in office.\nObama, a former smoker, remains tobacco free, exercises daily and drinks alcohol occasionally and in moderation, according to the third physical of his presidency, which was conducted last month.\nThe president also has taken an anti-malaria pill, Malarone, for the times he\u2019s traveled to areas where the disease is endemic.\nAt 6 foot 1 inch, Obama weighs 180 pounds and has perfect 20/20 vision.\nCholesterol LevelsObama, who in previous years blamed his cholesterol results on the plethora of desserts available to him as president, still has elevated levels."}
