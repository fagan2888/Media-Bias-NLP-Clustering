Her face contorted into a playful grimace when she talked about occasionally waking up to Hancock\u2019s singing.\n\nShe was one of about 1,200 people who tried out for the television series that held one day of auditions in the belly of the Denver Convention Center.\n\nAfter the show\u2019s producers visit 11 cities nationwide, they will invite 4,000 to 5,000 people in late February or early March to the next wave of auditions \u2014 videotaped performances in front of judges Howard Stern, Heidi Klum, Mel B and Howie Mandel.\n\nLee said that that, if invited back for a potentially life-changing second audition in spring, \u201cI would be OK with that.\u201d The company she was working with in 2011 and 2012, Afterthought Theatre Company, closed shortly after she performed in its 2012 production of \u201cAnnie.\u201d\n\nFor her audition Saturday, Lee chose a song from \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d her first musical with the theater. The song \u201d Believe in Yourself\u201d became her personal and professional motto after she sang it at Hancock\u2019s mayoral victory party in 2011.\n\nIn their 20 years of marriage, Lee said she and Hancock have made a conscious effort to build their careers separately. She has identified with singing since she belted her first notes at the age of 3 and struggled to retain that independence throughout her husband\u2019s political career.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very supportive of me keeping myself,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLee said Hancock has made it to each of her musical theater shows and as many of her band\u2019s performances as he could. He was not at her audition Saturday.\n\nWaiting in the basement of the convention center with a bodyguard from his detail, Lee said she was hardly nervous.\n\nShe has performed in front of tens of thousands of people at Broncos and Nuggets games and international military events. In 1992 and 1994, she said the Department of Defense flew her around the globe to sing for American troops stationed in Korea, Japan, Panama and Honduras.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I get into the song, any nervousness I have goes away,\u201d she said.\n\nShe and the thousands of other acts who try out for America\u2019s Got Talent will be notified of their fate on the show in early 2014.\n\nAlison Noon: 303-954-1223, anoon@denverpost.com or twitter.com/alisonnoon", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mayor\u2019s wife one of 1,200 who try for \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d", "title": "Mayor\u2019s wife one of 1,200 who try for \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/07/mayors-wife-one-of-1200-who-try-for-americas-got-talent/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131206__Mary_Louise_Leep1-1.jpg", "height": 496}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131206__Mary_Louise_Leep1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-07T14:21:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:43:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd16e8\"", "article_summary": "Lee said Hancock has made it to each of her musical theater shows and as many of her band\u2019s performances as he could.\nShe and the thousands of other acts who try out for America\u2019s Got Talent will be notified of their fate on the show in early 2014.\nHaving warmed up nearly three hours earlier singing to her husband, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, the accomplished vocalist was saving her voice for producers of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d\u201cI really wake up every morning singing,\u201d Lee said.\nShe has performed in front of tens of thousands of people at Broncos and Nuggets games and international military events.\nIn their 20 years of marriage, Lee said she and Hancock have made a conscious effort to build their careers separately."}
