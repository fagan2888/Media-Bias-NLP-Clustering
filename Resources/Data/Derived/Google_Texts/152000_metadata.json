(REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)\n\n4014426\n\nPresident Obama will extend his mini-amnesty for young illegals, said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, White House director of domestic policy.\n\n\u201cAs long as this president is president\u2026 you\u2019re going to be able to renew your deferred action,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz told one illegal immigrant 23 minutes into an online question-and-answer session on immigration conducted via Skype.\n\nSo far, Obama\u2019s deputies have granted the two-year \u201cDeferred Action for Childhood Arrivals\u201d amnesty to at least 567,563 illegals aged between 15 and 31, giving them the right to get jobs in every state, get drivers\u2019 licenses in some states, to enroll in school and to receive government aid. Only 21,162 illegals have been rejected. Roughly 11 million illegals are living in the United States.\n\nObama\u2019s two-year amnesty will start timing out in 2014, shortly before the midterm elections.\n\nMunoz\u2019s promise of another mini-amnesty may torpedo the White House\u2019s closed-door to push the House leadership to pass a very ambitious business-backed immigration bill, similar to the bill passed by the Senate in June.\n\nNumerous GOP legislators already say they can\u2019t strike an immigration bargain with Obama because they don\u2019t trust him to enforce curbs on immigration. Also, polls show swing-voters strongly oppose provisions to boost the inflow of foreign workers.\n\nObama granted the mini-amnesty even though Congress voted down similar proposals. Roughly 20 million Americans are underemployed or unemployed. Wages have been stalled for several years, and many Americans are forced to take low-skill, low-wage jobs.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s been a sharp jump in the number of college grads stuck in minimum-wage jobs. Their number is 71 percent higher than in 2002, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 latest figures. In 2012, 284,000 college graduates were working at minimum-wage jobs, up from 127,000 in 2006, according to U.S. News.\n\nObama announced the new rules in June 2012 during a campaign-style speech in the Rose Garden. In the months after, his support among Latinos rose sharply, and he eventually received 71 percent of the Latino vote, which comprised roughly 8.4 percent of the electorate.\n\nMu\u00f1oz, however, downplayed Obama\u2019s role in the amnesty.\n\n\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t have the authority to suspend deportations. \u2026 That was a action by the Department of Homeland Security, and it was a use of its enforcement authority,\u201d she claimed.\n\nVice President Joe Biden was part of the video conference, and he also played down Obama\u2019s role: \u201cIt is not the president saying, \u2018I\u2019m changing the law, you can stay.'\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the authority to say that,\u201d Biden said.\n\nUp to 1.9 million illegal immigrants could be given work permits under Obama\u2019s policy, according to an August 2013 report by the Migration Policy Institute. That\u2019s triple the original estimate of 800,000 announced by the government in June 2012.\n\nRoughly 900,000 of the potential beneficiaries are aged 14 or below, making them too young to be eligible. Just over 1 million people are immediately eligible for the temporary amnesty, said the MPI report.\n\nOnly 8,000 of the 1 million immediate beneficiaries have a post-graduate degree, and only 53,000 have a bachelor\u2019s degree, according to the MPI report. That means only 6 percent of eligible illegals have college credentials. In comparison, 20 percent of native-born Americans hold college degrees.\n\nRoughly 240,000 of the eligibles, however, are enrolled in a college and may graduate with two-year or four-year degrees, said the MPI report.\n\nAlmost half, or 482,000, of the currently eligible candidates are unskilled workers, with only a high-school qualification, said the report.\n\nRead more: http://dailycaller.com/2013/08/13/obama-youth-amnesty-numbers-jump-to-1-9-million/#ixzz2nCqf0X3M\n\nIllegals older than 30 in June 2012 are ineligible, according to the current DACA rules.\n\nThe video exchange was arranged by the Bing online service, which is run by Microsoft. The company is lobbying to increase the inflow of foreign workers.\n\nMany immigration reformers are willing to offer legal status to the illegals who arrived as children, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. They\u2019d offer that prize in exchange for non-political enforcement of immigration laws, a legal requirement that employers check would-be employees\u2019 eligibility to work, plus checks at airports to record the arrival and verify the departure of tourists and business visitors, he said.\n\nBut that exchange isn\u2019t on the table because progressives and businesses are using the younger illegals as sympathetic poster-children in their allied push for the far-reaching Senate bill, he said.\n\nIf House Republicans submit to the pressure, the Senate bill would deliver millions of Democratic-leaning immigrants to Democratic politicians, more low-wage university workers to major companies and increased profits to investors, Krikorian said.\n\nThe losers from that law would be American workers and families, he said.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "'As long as this president' is in power, 'you will be able to renew your deferred action'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "President Obama will extend his mini-amnesty for young illegals, said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, White House director of domestic policy.    \"As long as this president is president... you're going to be able to", "title": "Obama will extend amnesty for young illegals, says top White House aide", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/12/11/obama-will-extend-amnesty-for-young-illegals/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-03T205406Z_1_CBRE9B21M2A00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1386799021469.jpg", "height": 276}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'As long as this president' is in power, 'you will be able to renew your deferred action'", "title": "Obama will extend amnesty for young illegals, says top White House aide Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/12/11/obama-will-extend-amnesty-for-young-illegals/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-03T205406Z_1_CBRE9B21M2A00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1386799021469.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-11 17:11:11", "sailthru.title": "Obama will extend amnesty for young illegals, says top White House aide", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "neil-munro", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "immigration reform", "sailthru.description": "President Obama will extend his mini-amnesty for young illegals, said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, White House director of domestic policy.    \"As long as this president is president... you're going to be able to", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013-12-03T205406Z_1_CBRE9B21M2A00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-e1386799021469.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "(REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)4014426President Obama will extend his mini-amnesty for young illegals, said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, White House director of domestic policy.\nRoughly 11 million illegals are living in the United States.\nThat means only 6 percent of eligible illegals have college credentials.\nFILE -- President Barack Obama speaks about the Affordable Care Act at the White House in Washington Dec. 3, 2013.\nNumerous GOP legislators already say they can\u2019t strike an immigration bargain with Obama because they don\u2019t trust him to enforce curbs on immigration."}
