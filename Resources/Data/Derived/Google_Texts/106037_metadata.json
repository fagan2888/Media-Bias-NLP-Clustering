Black students across campuses nationwide form Black Lives Matter groups, holding college presidents hostage to obnoxious demands and they\u2019re praised as activists.\n\nThe group\u2019s Facebook page stated it was formed to discuss issues affecting whites and \u201corganize against the terrorists, we have been facing from Black Lives Matter activists on campus.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with that? Many would argue black students have been terrorizing college campuses across the country to get what they want in the name of the Black Lives Matter movement. At the University of Missouri, black students blamed racism on campus on the school\u2019s white president. They protested, surrounded President Tim Wolfe\u2019s car at homecoming, and about 30 black football players refused to play until Wolfe apologized for his \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and resigned. Wolfe was forced to resign.\n\nStudents at Ithaca College are trying to do the same thing to President Tom Rochon over alleged racist incidents that don\u2019t appear racist. During a RA training session conducted two public safety officers, one officer pulled out a black BB gun and said if he saw anyone with one, he\u2019d probably shoot him because the guns look real. The RAs of color were offended by the remark, saying it was racist even though the officer never mentioned a person of a specific race.\n\nAnother incident involved a fraternity hosting a \"Preps & Crooks\" party in October. The fraternity cancelled the party because some students said it was racist. Students were invited to come dressed in either \u201cPrep\u201d attire with \u201cPolo shirt, button-down, backwards baseball cap, khakis or boat shoes\u201d or \u201cCrooks\u201d in \u201cbandanna, baggy sweats and a t-shirt, snapback, and any \u2018bling.\u201d The party was an expression of free speech not racism. Besides, your everyday robber doesn\u2019t dress like a preppy. For example, the DC Police Department Twitter feed describes crime suspects as predominately black males dressed in sweat pants, skull caps, and hoodies. I guess the DC Police Department is racist too.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has gone too far on college campuses. Some black college students are actively looking for opportunities to call any action on campus racist in an effort to get white school presidents fired.\n\n\u201cWe recognize the right to free speech and we encourage you to exercise that right when you see examples of racism, discrimination or intimidation on our campus, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Interim Chancellor Barbara Wilson said. But the school asked Facebook to remove the page because it was \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\nStudents behind the white students union said they felt intimidated by Black Lives Matter protestors\u2019 \u201canti-white rhetoric\u201d on campus. Is free speech only reserved for black students on college campuses? Does white privilege mean white students must suck it up and allow blacks to discriminate against them?\n\nThe Washington Post referred to one of the group\u2019s Facebook messages as \u201cprovocative\u201d because it urged students to post pictures of black protestors so that they would \u201cknow who anti-whites are.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll be seeing more white students form groups in a backlash to black students getting demands met using tactics of intimidation on college campuses.At Dartmouth College black students took over the library shouting Black Lives Matter, pushing and shoving other students. \u201cThe Review editorial reported that: \u201cOne female student, the editorial alleges, was pinned against a wall by demonstrators while shouting \u201cfilthy white b****!\u201d in her face.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeveral students interviewed by The Dartmouth reported witnessing chants including expletives, such as \u201cF**k your white privilege\u201d and \u201cF**k your comfort.\u201d When I was a college students protested in public areas on campus not the library where people studied in quiet. This kind of behavior is in no way acceptable regardless of the color of the protestors.\n\nBlack student protestors stormed Princeton University president\u2019s office, refusing to leave until their demands were met. One included removing Democrat President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s name from all campus buildings because of his \u201cracist legacy.\u201d Wilson was a professed racist and former president of Princeton. If black students felt that strongly about Wilson, perhaps they never should have attended Princeton to begin with.\n\nIn an effort to appease the black mob, liberal Princeton officials announced that its leaders of the school\u2019s residential colleges would change their titles from master of the college to head of the college. The word master reminded black students of slavery some 150 years later. While they\u2019re at it Princeton also should change the name of a Master\u2019s degree to something more politically palatable to blacks.\n\nAbout 30 black students occupied Virginia Commonwealth University President Michael Rao's office. They \u201ctook over the first floor of the office on Franklin Street about 10 a.m., blocking the entrance and offices on the first floor as well as disrupting daily work,\u201d demanding more black professors among other things. About 5% of the schools faculty is black and 15% of the student.\n\n\u201cYou can go a whole four years talking to white people, being taught by white people and not having anything to do with black people,\u201d sophomore Reyna Smith said. So, VCU controls who students socialize with on the weekends and outside of class time? I doubt it. If black students want a total black experience, perhaps they should attend historically black colleges and universities.\n\nIt\u2019s fair that students want to ensure their schools hire minorities. But what black students appear to be demanding is for colleges and universities to hire black professors on no other qualification than their race to teach a racist curriculum full of white blame and shame. Of course that\u2019s exactly what Yale University President Peter Solovey promised, announcing that Yale would create a center on race and other politically correct things over the next 5 years, costing $50 million.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 endorsement of the Black Lives Matter movement, particularly President Barack Obama, has fueled a perception on college campuses that blacks lives matter more than white lives. Since when did Americans\u2019 right to free speech get limited to the color of a person\u2019s skin?\n\nWhat black students should be concerned about is dismal college graduation rate for black students. Some 50 years after the Civil Rights Act was passed and affirmative action was born in America, 42% of blacks are graduating college compared to 62% of whites.", "article_metadata": {"description": "White students formed the Illini White Students Union at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and were called racist..05/27/2016 5:40:50AM EST.", "author": "Crystal Wright", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "White students formed the Illini White Students Union at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and were called racist.", "title": "Crystal Wright - Black Students Matter, White Students Don\u2019t?", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/crystalwright/2015/11/24/black-students-matter-white-students-dont-n2085055", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/326/7b3ac387-de9c-4453-8da4-7a27534467b6.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "White students formed the Illini White Students Union at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and were called racist.", "title": "Crystal Wright - Black Students Matter, White Students Don\u2019t?", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/crystalwright/2015/11/24/black-students-matter-white-students-dont-n2085055", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/326/7b3ac387-de9c-4453-8da4-7a27534467b6.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Black Students Matter, White Students Don\u2019t?, Crystal Wright, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "What black students should be concerned about is dismal college graduation rate for black students.\nWhite students formed the Illini White Students Union at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and were called racist.\nBlack students across campuses nationwide form Black Lives Matter groups, holding college presidents hostage to obnoxious demands and they\u2019re praised as activists.\nIf black students want a total black experience, perhaps they should attend historically black colleges and universities.\nDemocrats\u2019 endorsement of the Black Lives Matter movement, particularly President Barack Obama, has fueled a perception on college campuses that blacks lives matter more than white lives."}
