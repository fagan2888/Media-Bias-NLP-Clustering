Charles Mix County State's Attorney Tom Deadrick will resign his current post to join the office of incoming Secretary of State Shantel Krebs.



Deadrick will join Krebs's office on Jan. 2, where he will assume the role of deputy secretary for business services. His new position will require him to oversee business services and filings, and Deadrick says he'll be trying to ensure South Dakota is friendly for companies looking to incorporate here.



Deadrick says he anticipates his legal experience will be a plus in the new job, and he will serve as in-house legal counsel to the office.
