With the Feb. 15 deadline for open enrollment fast approaching, the California Society of Addiction Medicine (CSAM) has organized a panel to size up state marketplace plans and organized the carrier rankings in a public score card.\n\nThe CSAM panel of physicians compared 16 Bronze level insurance plans by 10 carriers, reviewing company websites, schedule of benefits, and drug formularies against the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Patient Placement Criteria standard of best practices.\n\nWhile the Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment as one of the 10 Essential Health Benefits, CSAM found that \u2018covered\u2019 does not necessarily mean \u2018covered well.\u2019 An evaluation of plans revealed significant differences in services like pharmacy benefits and methadone treatment.\n\nHealth Net PPO Bronze ranked the highest of the study with a score of 89 out of 100 points. Anthem Blue Cross of California, Bronze H.S.A EPO ranked last in this type of coverage with only 40 points.\n\nThe physicians hope that their efforts will help Californians make better informed decisions when choosing their insurance plan that go beyond just looking at premium price.\n\n\u201cThis guide is intended to be a living document, which will be updated periodically to reflect policy changes. While this is not a substitute for personally reviewing plan coverage, we hope consumers will find this guide a helpful starting point before making this important choice,\u201d said Kerry Parker, Executive Director of CSAM.\n\nRead the Consumer Guide and Scorecard: Health Insurance Coverage in California for Substance Use Disorder & Mental Health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The California Society of Addiction Medicine (CSAM) has scored state marketplace plans based on chemical dependency coverage.", "og": {"site_name": "State of Reform", "description": "California substance abuse disorder physicians give insurance plans the critical eye.
