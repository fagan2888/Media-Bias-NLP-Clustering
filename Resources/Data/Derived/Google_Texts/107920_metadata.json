He always made my breakfast \u2014 sliced strawberries on a dish, Cheerios with whole milk, and Nestle hot chocolate \u2014 to ensure I\u2019d start each day with a balanced meal. He often prepared my lunch, tucking an inspirational or funny note for me inside the bag. He drove me to and from campus, understanding my exhausted silence at 7:15 a.m., yet always eager to hear my rapid fire high school travails at the end of each day.\n\nAll the seemingly innocuous interactions and exchanges mean the world to me now, as he passed away a few months before I went off to college. I didn\u2019t have a dad to call this Father\u2019s Day, but I can be grateful for the quality time I spent with mine when he was still around. It cost him strong professional relationships, as he didn\u2019t go into the office enough to get to know his colleagues very well, but he preferred devoting as much time as possible to his family instead.\n\nIf given the choice, I\u2019m sure most dads would choose to be as attentive as mine was, especially in the aftermath of their child\u2019s birth. It\u2019s tough, however, for some men to send the message to their boss that family comes first, especially in a difficult economy where many people feel lucky to have stable work. This prevents some dads from taking full advantage of paternity leave even when it is offered at their place of employment.\n\n\u201cThere is still some stigma about men who say, \u2018My kids are more important than my work,\u2019\u201d Scott Coltrane, a sociologist studying fatherhood, told The New York Times last year. \u201cAnd basically that\u2019s the message when men take it.\u201d\n\nJoseph, a corporate accountant in Kansas City, told Forbes that he was pressured to take less leave after the birth of his child due to work obligations.\n\n\u201cI could have taken the whole week off after my son, Lyle, was born, but they said they really needed me, and they did, because it was the end of the fiscal year,\u201d he said. \u201cI could tell they weren\u2019t going to look kindly on my taking the whole week, so I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe also didn\u2019t want to be \u201con the top of the list for layoffs,\u201d at work, even though that seemed a little extreme to him in retrospect.\n\n\u201cBut that was probably me overthinking it,\u201d he continued. \u201cI should have taken the leave, and if we have another baby, I am not going to pass it up this time. It was foolish.\u201d\n\nEd, a marketing vice president at a clothing retailer, said he felt subtle judgment from his managers when he didn\u2019t think twice about going on vacation after taking his work\u2019s seven-day paternity leave.\n\n\u201cWhen I took my leave my bosses did not complain outright, but I definitely sensed an air of disappointment,\u201d Ed told Forbes. \u201dOne asked me outright if I still intended to use my already scheduled vacation days during the summer. I don\u2019t think he was happy with the \u2018yes\u2019 response he received.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Men are still stigmatized for putting family over work -- and our retrograde paid leave policies aren't helping", "title": "The paternity leave gap: Why men are so reluctant to use it", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Men are still stigmatized for putting family over work -- and our retrograde paid leave policies aren't helping", "title": "The paternity leave gap: Why men are so reluctant to use it", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/26/the_paternity_leave_gap_why_men_are_so_reluctant_to_use_it/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/shutterstock_184914998.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Men are still stigmatized for putting family over work -- and our retrograde paid leave policies aren't helping", "title": "The paternity leave gap: Why men are so reluctant to use it", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/shutterstock_184914998.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "LAURA DONOVAN", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Attn:, Paid Leave, paternity leave, Unemployment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Attn:, Paid Leave, paternity leave, Unemployment, Business News, Life News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on ATTN:For parts of my childhood, my father worked from home, a freedom that enabled him to spend substantial amounts of time with me each day.\nThis prevents some dads from taking full advantage of paternity leave even when it is offered at their place of employment.\n\u201cWhen I took my leave my bosses did not complain outright, but I definitely sensed an air of disappointment,\u201d Ed told Forbes.\nIt was foolish.\u201dEd, a marketing vice president at a clothing retailer, said he felt subtle judgment from his managers when he didn\u2019t think twice about going on vacation after taking his work\u2019s seven-day paternity leave.\n\u201cI should have taken the leave, and if we have another baby, I am not going to pass it up this time."}
