Previously, the amount of free care they provided for the poor spoke for itself.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was kind of easy to sit back and count your charity care and not think about the other things you were doing in the community,\u201d said Rob Whitehouse, Summa Health System\u2019s senior vice president for marketing and community relations.\n\n\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, for example, Akron-based Summa\u2019s community benefit total dropped from $93.1 million to $67.1 million after a significant drop in charity care and Medicaid shortfall dollars. Other buckets of community benefit \u2014 education, research, subsidized health services and community health improvement services, programs and support \u2014 remained the same.\n\n\n\nBecause Summa was able to rely on the charity care number, a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of its community benefit went unreported, Whitehouse said. The system is working to put processes in place to educate employees about what community benefit is and how to report it.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to bet our numbers are going to be good just by reporting what we\u2019re actually doing,\u201d Whitehouse said.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Affordable Care Act dramatically increased access to health insurance coverage, it hardly turned hospitals into cash cows.\n\n\n\nWhile many saw an increased number of insured patients access their systems, rarely does the coverage, especially Medicaid, cover the full cost of care. While health systems typically saw a healthy decline in the amount of completely free care provided, they saw significant increases in the amount of dollars they shifted to covering the cost difference between what Medicaid pays and the cost of treating those patients.\n\n\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic, for instance, saw charity care dollars shrink by 40.5% from $169.8 million to $101 million between 2013 and 2014. At the same time, the amount of funds the Clinic put toward covering Medicaid shortfall grew by 75%, from $124 million in 2013 to $217.5 million in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill spending\n\nThe shortfall funding need grew faster than the charity care declined, representing more than a simple shift. That difference is in part due to the Clinic increasing the number of locations in the system that provide services for Medicaid patients. But also, with Medicaid available, people who are newly qualified are signing up and actively seeking out primary care and other services, according to Steve Glass, chief financial officer for the Clinic.This significant shift of charity care cost over to shortfall cost is the bulk of the change Glass expects to see from the Medicaid expansion.\u201cI would hope that we would continue to see some of this migrate,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019ve seen it start to flatten out over the last year, so I think we\u2019ve seen the biggest impact of it.\u201dHe\u2019d like to continue to see that cost shift from charity care toward shortfall as more people are insured, but since that initial jump, it\u2019s flattened out.Meanwhile, at University Hospitals, both charity care and Medicaid shortfall funding rose between 2013 and 2014. The Medicaid shortfall spike, however, was much more drastic, increasing by 33.3% to $76 million 2014. Charity care only rose by about 3.4% to $61 million in 2014.The charity care bump was likely the result of UH bringing medical centers in Elyria and Parma into its fold, but even factoring that in, the charity care cost hasn\u2019t decreased as dramatically as one would think, said Heidi Gartland, UH\u2019s vice president of government relations.\u201cWe still have a lot of folks that, even with the Affordable Care Act, are for whatever reason either not willing to sign up for Medicaid \u2014 although I don\u2019t know how often that happens \u2014 or not eligible to sign up. There is still population above 138% of poverty that is not eligible to apply,\u201d Gartland said.\n\nWhen a new social program is available, it inspires plenty of new eligible participants to surface \u2014 something dubbed the \u201cwoodwork effect\u201d \u2014 which contributed to there not being a one-for-one transition from charity care to Medicaid shortfall costs, said MetroHealth CEO Dr. Akram Boutros. In addition, new programs often inspire non-eligibles to come out for services.\n\n\n\nAlso, being insured doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to knowing how to access care, Gartland said. So, UH has worked to more proactively educate patients who came into the emergency department for non-emergency care. A big piece of that has involved steering more patients toward its medical access clinic, where non-emergency patients are treated by a provider and a social worker teaches them how to enroll in Medicaid or other insurance, how to use that insurance, how to find a primary care doctor, why having one is important and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe took care of their medical issue and then we had a social worker come in and actually talk to them about and get them set up with a primary care physician,\u201d Gartland said.More than 90% of the patients that came through the medical access clinic did not come back to the emergency room for a non-emergency issue, meaning \u201cwe got them into a medical home, which is exactly the big hopeful outcome of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Gartland said.As for Summa, it saw its charity cost drop between 2013 and 2014 from $15.6 million to $6 million. Unlike other hospitals, however, Summa saw a decline in its Medicaid shortfall from $23.3 million and $5.4 million, which it chalks up to Medicaid expansion and a rebounding economy. Those freed up dollars present an opportunity to look at how Summa\u2019s community benefit strategy should evolve, Whitehouse said. He said Summa is developing more programs to ensure those newly insured patients aren\u2019t underserved.\u201cJust because people have access to insurance now doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re necessarily getting the screenings right or they\u2019re necessarily using the benefit properly,\u201d Whitehouse said.Population health strategies are also becoming more entrenched in hospitals\u2019 community benefit strategies.For example, of MetroHealth\u2019s more than 1.1 million patient encounters each year, only 0.3% are inpatient, but that sliver of encounters represents about 45% of revenues for the health system, Boutros said. That remaining portion and vast majority of encounters, however, is where providers can have more of an impact on the community, he said. Beyond community benefit, various federal programs incentivize focusing on a holistic picture of health, such as the Readmissions Reduction Program and the Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program.\u201c99.98% of your life is outside of the health care system,\u201d Boutros said. \u201cSo we need to figure out how to impact that 99.98% of your life because we\u2019ve been focusing on the .02% of your life that happens to come in the health care system.\u201dWhitehouse said there will be a period of adjustment from big charity care numbers to reporting existing and building new programs, \u201cbut I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get there.\u201d\u201cI think because we are evolving, going from charity care into true proactive community benefit, communities will be healthier because of it, particularly the underserved populations,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Northeast Ohio's nonprofit health systems are rethinking their so-called community benefit strategies and finding new ways to serve the region in order to prove their value to residents and ultimately defend their tax-exempt status.
