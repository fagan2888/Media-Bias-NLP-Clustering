We filled out the papers and everything. Then right before we were called back, we looked at each other, and said: \u2018Let\u2019s get out of here.\u2019\u201d\n\nWithin a couple of hours, the image, also posted to Facebook, was liked by over 300,000 people and shared nearly 10,000 times, and had racked up 5,000 comments, clearly striking a nerve.\n\nIn the picture, a man dressed in slacks and a dress shirt holds a cell phone, displaying a silly \u201cselfie\u201d of father and daughter sticking out their tongues.\n\n\u201cI was 16 when my girlfriend got pregnant. We went to the abortion clinic on 59th Street. We filled out the papers and everything. Then right before we were called back, we looked at each other, and said: \u2018Let\u2019s get out of here.\u2019\u201d A photo posted by Humans of New York (@humansofny) on Jul 20, 2015 at 1:27pm PDT\n\nIt\u2019s the sort of viral content Brandon Stanton, 31, the creator of the Humans of New York photo blog, has become known for.\n\nComments on this powerful image were equally personal. \u201cI was 15 when I got pregnant and had her at 16. People wanted me to get an abortion because a baby would \u2018ruin my life\u2019 and how \u2018difficult\u2019 it was to maintain and be responsible for another life,\u201d wrote a woman named Jessica Capitello. \u201cAnd for a moment I thought they were right, but my boyfriend and I decided that it\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault. We were willing to do whatever we had to for our daughter. Now she\u2019s 2 going on 3 and she\u2019s the greatest miracle in our lives.\u201d\n\nStanton launched Humans of New York as a side project in 2010 after being fired from a job in finance. Each day, he posts images of various New Yorkers along with snippets of their personal stories. He has since amassed over 3 million followers on Instagram and 14 million fans on Facebook. He has published two books, collections of his images. A third will be released in October.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be really cool to create an exhaustive catalogue of New York City\u2019s inhabitants, so I set out to photograph 10,000 New Yorkers and plot their photos on a map,\u201d Stanton wrote on the Humans of New York website.\n\nA woman named Jessica Hart shared her story in response to yesterday\u2019s photo as well. \u201cI feel this so much. When I found out I was pregnant, my boyfriend and I went straight to Planned Parenthood,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was 18 (he was 21) and scared sh*tless. We talked about payment options since it would have to be covered beforehand and my insurance wouldn\u2019t cover it. We had a list of phone numbers to call and I never could call them. They just sat in my wallet. At 12 weeks pregnant, I finally decided to go to the OBGYN and that I wanted my baby. I\u2019m now 19 (and he\u2019s 22), and we have a beautiful 10-week-old little girl and I love her more than life itself. We\u2019re young and we never stopped being scared, but we\u2019re living each day for our daughter.\u201d\n\nA previous Humans of New York post captured the same man. The caption reads: \u201cMy mom was driving me home from school when I told her that my girlfriend was pregnant. She\u2019s a taxi driver, so we were in her yellow cab. My whole body was hot because I was so nervous. When I finally told her, she pulled over to the side of the road, slapped me across the chest, and said: \u2018Don\u2019t ask me for sh*t anymore! It\u2019s your time to become a man.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mom was driving me home from school when I told her that my girlfriend was pregnant.

I got pregnant in my teens as well with my first and there\u2019s never been a day where I regretted having her in my life. She was a beautiful accident. When I think about how seriously I considered abortion, I want to cry. I\u2019m 100% pro choice, but I just couldn\u2019t do it. My little girl is the most important thing in my life and I\u2019m so thankful to have her.\u201d\n\nCarrie Noelle: \u201cI am glad they had the option of abortion if they needed it, and I\u2019m glad they went with what worked out best for them instead. Either way, everyone should be able to choose. Beautiful little girl!\u201d\n\nMelissa Costa: \u201cI am, and always have been pro choice, and I applaud yours. Choice means just that! She is a beautiful child, and I wish you and your family the best of everything in the future! It won\u2019t always be easy or fun, but I believe you are up to the challenge!\u201d\n\nRevilleza Lucky: \u201cGive this man a standing ovation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A picture posted to the 'Humans of New York' blog on Monday depicts a young father who debated aborting his child.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A picture posted to the 'Humans of New York' blog on Monday depicts a young father who debated aborting his child.", "title": "Viral 'Humans of New York' Photo Stirs Emotional Response", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/HONY.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-21T12:26:22+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1JuJZpg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A picture posted to the 'Humans of New York' blog on Monday depicts a young father who debated aborting his child.", "title": "Viral 'Humans of New York' Photo Stirs Emotional Response", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/HONY.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-07-21T11:51:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-21T12:26:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "abortion, Humans of New York, life"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019re young and we never stopped being scared, but we\u2019re living each day for our daughter.\u201dA previous Humans of New York post captured the same man.\n\u201cI was 16 when my girlfriend got pregnant,\u201d begins the quote accompanying a picture of a young father and his daughter posted to the Humans of New York Instagram account yesterday.\nThe caption reads: \u201cMy mom was driving me home from school when I told her that my girlfriend was pregnant.\nNow she\u2019s 2 going on 3 and she\u2019s the greatest miracle in our lives.\u201dStanton launched Humans of New York as a side project in 2010 after being fired from a job in finance.\nShe is a beautiful child, and I wish you and your family the best of everything in the future!"}
