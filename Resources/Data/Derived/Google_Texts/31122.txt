House Republicans are using taxpayer money to pay former Alaska Gov. Sean Parnell tens of thousands of dollars to work as a consultant to improve relations with state officials.

The House Republican Conference paid Sean Parnell $10,000 in both March and April. Furthermore, taxpayers have covered more than $6,000 in travel expenses for Parnell, according to a recently released House spending report.

Nate Hodson, a spokesman for House Republican Conference Chairman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), said Parnell is helping “improve coordination, collaboration, and communication between Republican state elected officials and House Republicans.” Hodson said the effort is one of McMorris Rodgers’ “goals.”

The initiative included regular calls with governors in the leadup to the King v. Burwell Supreme Court decision upholding Obamacare, as well as meetings and conversations between state-based aides to governors and House GOP leadership. Parnell’s contract is a short-term arrangement.

It’s unusual for a former statewide official to serve as an adviser to a member of Congress. Former Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) briefly served as chief of staff for former Rep. Chip Cravaack (R-Minn.).

Parnell, who served as Sarah Palin’s lieutenant governor, mounted an unsuccessful primary challenge to longtime Alaska Rep. Don Young in 2008. Young beat Parnell by several hundred votes. Parnell assumed the governorship after Palin resigned in 2009. He lost to Independent Bill Walker in 2014.
