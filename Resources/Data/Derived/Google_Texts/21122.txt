Mary Pittman, CEO and president of the Public Health Institute, will discuss health care inequities among the vulnerable during a public appearance at Rochester Institute of Technology Friday.



The presentation, “Why do we still have health care disparities?” is slated to be held 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. in the Carlson Auditorium on the RIT campus and is open to the public.



Pittman will explore social determinants of health such as physical environment, education level and economic stability.



She believes shifting focus from individual to public health is key to bridging healthcare challenges introduced by the Affordable Care Act.



“Healthcare systems are being incentivized to redesign care to not just treat disease, but to produce health and reduce long-term healthcare costs by working to keep people healthy and to prevent avoidable clinical care,” Pittman said.



Her appearance is part of RIT’s 20th anniversary celebration of its health systems administration program.
