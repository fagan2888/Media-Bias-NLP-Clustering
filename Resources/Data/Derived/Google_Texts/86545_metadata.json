Reuters\n\nAfter attending a loud concert and retreating to the quiet solitude of your bedroom, you may feel your ears filled with a rushing, screeching, or ringing noise. This sensation, associated with hearing loss, is called tinnitus, and for decades scientists have been trying to understand how the ears can \u201chear\u201d or create noise in the absence of sound, whether that\u2019s caused by structural brain changes, depression, or hearing loss \u2014 or a combination of all three.\n\nNow, a new study published in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences examines how the underlying factors in tinnitus are similar to those involved in chronic pain, offering new clues on how to treat both conditions. While tinnitus sufferers hear unpleasant sounds constantly, chronic pain patients (many of whom have had a limb amputated) can continue to feel pain from a body part that\u2019s no longer there. This is called phantom pain, and it originates in the spinal cord and brain.\n\nThe study was conducted by a collaborating team of researchers from the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and Georgetown University Medical Center, and led by Professor Josef Rauschecker, director of the Laboratory for Integrative Neuroscience and Cognition at Georgetown University, who has been studying tinnitus for years.\n\nIn 2010, Rauschecker and a team of scientists proposed that tinnitus was possibly caused by the brain\u2019s inability to \u201ctune out\u201d negative sensory signals \u2014 and his latest study builds upon that.\n\nThe researchers used an array of techniques to examine the amount of gray matter in the brain as well as brain function, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography, and voxel-based morphometry. They discovered that loss of gray matter, as well as impaired circuit function, in certain areas in the brain \u2014 referred to as \u201cgatekeeping\u201d areas \u2014 contributed to both tinnitus and chronic pain. This process is impacted by dopamine and serotonin, neurotransmitters that play a huge role in mood, depression, and energy.\n\n\u201cThese areas act as a central gatekeeping system for perceptual sensations, which determines the affective value of sensory stimuli \u2014 whether produced externally or internally \u2014 and modulates information flow in the brain,\u201d Rauschecker said in the press release. \u201cTinnitus and chronic pain occur when this system is compromised.\u201d\n\nRauschecker has examined depression\u2019s role in tinnitus as well \u2014 finding that in many cases, depression is the cause of tinnitus and not the other way around. Some severe tinnitus sufferers saw great relief in their symptoms after visiting a psychiatrist and learning mindfulness to embrace the noise \u2014 and they actually reported it lowered significantly.\n\n\u201cBetter understanding [of tinnitus and chronic pain] might allow not only for early treatment, but also more targeted and individual treatment with existing as well as novel strategies, such as dopaminergic therapy,\u201d Markus Ploner, an author of the study and a consultant neurologist at TUM, said in the press release.\n\nSource: Rauschecker J, May E, Maudoux A, Ploner M.
