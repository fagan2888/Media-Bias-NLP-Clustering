Ochsner Health System said today it is partnering with Adeptus Health Inc., a Texas-based health care provider that operates freestanding emergency rooms, to provide the same in Louisiana.

The joint venture will identify multiple sites for freestanding emergency rooms, starting in the New Orleans area, according to a news release.

The new facilities are expected to create additional full-time jobs. The announcement did not say how many are expected.

It cited a report from the American College of Emergency Physicians that emergency visits are on the rise, partly because of an increase in severity of patientsâ€™ injuries and/or illnesses.

The partnership is one of several announced by Ochsner over the past year as the health system teams with local hospitals to streamline operations in accordance with the Affordable Care Act.

Adeptus Health also provides emergency rooms in Texas, Colorado and Arizona.
