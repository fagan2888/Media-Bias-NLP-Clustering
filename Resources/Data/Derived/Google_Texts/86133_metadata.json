The Anglican Church has called on the Abbott government to change its policies on climate change. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nThe Anglican Church has told the Abbott government to change its approach to climate change, urging it to respect and base its policy on scientific evidence.\n\nAt a meeting in Adelaide, the church's Australian general synod passed a unanimous motion calling on the government to \"respect and act upon relevant independent evidence-based scientific advice\u2019\u2019 on climate change.\n\nThe 23 dioceses of the church said they were gravely concerned that Australia\u2019s target to cut carbon dioxide emissions - five per cent below 2000 levels by 2020 - was well short of what was needed.\n\nThey said they deeply regretted that it was \"future generations and other forms of life\" that would \"bear the real cost of our heavy dependence on carbon-based energy\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerth Bishop Tom Wilmot, a church leader on environmental issues, told Fairfax Media that the environment was such an important issue it should not be left just to politicians and economists to discuss it.\n\n\u2018\u2018My concern is the Abbott government seems to be deconstructing almost everything that was put in place over the last decade or so to protect the environment,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018It seems to be neutering any scientific voice and, in fact, any voice that seeks to speak on environmental matters.\u2019\n\nHe said the appointment of businessman and self-described climate sceptic Dick Warburton to head a review of the renewable energy target was a cynical way of pre-determining its outcome.\n\nAnd he accused Environment Minister Greg Hunt of being dishonest about the effectiveness of the carbon price, which is expected to be repealed next week with support of new crossbench senators.\n\nBishop Wilmot said he was concerned about the government's attitude to environmental policy generally, including handing approval powers for big developments to state governments.\n\nHe said the governments unsuccessful attempt to undo world heritage protection of some Tasmanian wilderness left Australia looking like a \u2018\u2018vandal\u2019\u2019 and a \u2018\u2018pariah\u2019\u2019.\n\nHe said he could not say that all bishops shared his views on the \u2018\u2018cavalier attitude of the federal government to environmental protection\u2019\u2019, but the majority did privately.\n\nBishop Wilmot said the church had a unique voice to add to the environmental debate, adding a theological, moral and ethical dimension.\n\nHe said there was a long tradition in Christianity of respect and care for the environment, from the theology of the old testament to the parables of nature used by Jesus \u2018\u2018to demonstrate straight truths about the kingdom of heaven\u2019\u2019.\n\n\u2018\u2018My own theology is such that Christ isn\u2019t just the redeemer of people, but the redeemer of the world,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018\u2018We say in the Lord\u2019s Prayer every Sunday in church \u2018thy kingdom come, thy will be done in Earth as it is in heaven'. Well, I take that literally.\u2019\u2019\n\nIn response to the church's motion, Mr Hunt's spokesman said the government fully accepted the science of climate change.\n\n\n\n''The problem with the carbon tax is that it has an adverse impact on families, whilst failing to significantly reduce emissions,'' he said.\n\n\n\n''We therefore hope the Anglican Church will agree that the Coalition\u2019s approach of taking pressure off electricity prices and actually achieving a significant reduction in emissions is a far better policy.''", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Political News, Climate Change", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "The Anglican Church has told the Abbott government to change its approach to climate change, urging it to respect and base its policy on scientific evidence.", "title": "Respect climate science: Anglicans urge Tony Abbott to change tack on climate change policies", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/respect-climate-science-anglicans-urge-tony-abbott-to-change-tack-on-climate-change-policies-20140704-zsvyn.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/b/c/s/8/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zsvyn.png/1404460618873.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/b/c/s/8/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zsvyn.png/1404460618873.jpg"}, "title": "Respect climate science: Anglicans urge Tony Abbott to change tack on climate change policies", "description": "The Anglican Church has told the Abbott government to change its approach to climate change, urging it to respect and base its policy on scientific evidence.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The Anglican Church has told the Abbott government to change its approach to climate change, urging it to respect and base its policy on scientific evidence."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded42\"", "article_summary": "The Anglican Church has called on the Abbott government to change its policies on climate change.\nWell, I take that literally.\u2019\u2019In response to the church's motion, Mr Hunt's spokesman said the government fully accepted the science of climate change.\nPhoto: Alex EllinghausenThe Anglican Church has told the Abbott government to change its approach to climate change, urging it to respect and base its policy on scientific evidence.\nAt a meeting in Adelaide, the church's Australian general synod passed a unanimous motion calling on the government to \"respect and act upon relevant independent evidence-based scientific advice\u2019\u2019 on climate change.\nBishop Wilmot said the church had a unique voice to add to the environmental debate, adding a theological, moral and ethical dimension."}
