He calls out Islamic fundamentalist regimes for their brutal oppression of women, and that is absolutely righteous. When he points out that not enough people criticize Saudi Arabia for torturing and murdering political dissidents on fake charges, he is completely right. He slams liberals for being too easy on Islamic radicals, and in many cases he is correct. He believes rational thought \u2014 not religious superstition \u2014 should govern society. I can get behind that.\n\nAs an atheist, it has taken me a good deal of time to articulate what exactly angers me about Bill Maher, and I\u2019ve finally figured it out. Bill Maher pisses me off because at the end of the day, realizing that there is no god doesn\u2019t absolve him or his homies from having to use critical thinking skills ever again. Atheism doesn\u2019t excuse his propagation of absurd conspiracy theories, even if they are presented in secular language. Nor does atheism exonerate people from parroting untruths without investigating the facts.\n\nAnd atheism certainly doesn\u2019t vindicate Bill Maher from demonizing other cultures based mostly on propaganda and rarely on history.\n\nIt is exactly because I reject superstition that I see Bill Maher as less of a critic of Islamic fundamentalism than an apologist for every other form of back-asswards fundamentalism. Instead of digging into the endless litany of atrocities committed in the name of every religion, every day, all over the world, he seems to suffer from some kind of selective blindness specifically obsessed with Islam, often at the expense of rationality. His dramatic statement that \u201cIt has been one culture blowing shit up for the past 30 years\u201d happens to be bullshit by any empirical metric. Just last week a Hindu Mob killed a Muslim man in India for eating beef. Over the past few years Buddhist mobs in Myanmar have killed hundreds of Muslims who do not have equal status with their Buddhist countrymen. Maher seems to completely forget that the siege of Sarajevo even happened or that the Tamil Tigers perfected modern suicide bombing in Sri Lanka. He seems to think the brutality of the Christian militias who massacred civilians in Lebanon by the thousands was part of the history of the Middle Ages and not the 1980s.\n\nMaher\u2019s recent inquisition against wrongly arrested Texas teenager Ahmed Mohammed is perhaps the ugliest example of his abandonment of rational thought in favor of superstition. When speaking of Mohammed\u2019s now notorious clock, Maher justifies the absurd incident by citing his belief that the clock \u201clooks exactly like a fucking bomb.\u201d If rationality is at stake in this particular debate, Bill Maher is firmly in the kook camp here. The fact is that Ahmed Mohammed\u2019s clock did not look like a bomb at all, but rather it looks like a prop in a bad action movie. Hollywood favors using suitcase bombs in movies because accurate portrayals of explosive devices make for very awkward props. Actual IEDs resemble the ugly and awkward-looking pressure cooker bombs that were used by the Boston Marathon bombers. Actual bombs have large explosive components and don\u2019t require much overt wiring. Maher\u2019s limited perspective shouldn\u2019t be a surprise because the entire premise of his show is Hollywood or D.C. personalities debating issues they aren\u2019t qualified to comment on. If Maher is such an expert on bombs, I suggest that next time an actual bomb is found he step in with a pair of pliers and cut the red protruding wire. After all, this is exactly the way they do it in the movies that guide his so-called rational opinion of what looks like a bomb.\n\nMaher\u2019s guests rarely have insight into the issue he seems most passionate about \u2014 yet he seems baffled that Ben Affleck and Mark Cuban haven\u2019t been able to spell out the complexities of the Middle East from his L.A. studio. In tragic irony, Maher\u2019s views on the current exodus of Syrian refugees are remarkably similar to those of Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck. Maher recently stated that he \u201cwould be more sympathetic if there was a better track record in the Muslim world of moderates standing up to extremists.\u201d If he did just a little bit of reading, he would surely find out that massive numbers of people have been displaced for trying to snatch their humanity out of the jaws of snarling extremists like Assad and ISIS. Maher asks where the Muslims who stand up to ISIS are, yet when they come in the hundreds of thousands, he perceives an invading ISIS army. Maher frequently invokes Hamas\u2019s desire to \u201cpush Israel into the sea,\u201d yet when the outlandish statement becomes a reality \u2014 with millions of Syrians literally pushed into the sea \u2014 he is mute.\n\nThere is nothing sincere about Maher\u2019s fear of an imminent collapse of western Christian civilization. Maher repeats the rhetoric of nativists in Europe who insist that the presence of a sizable Muslim population somehow makes it impossible for French or German culture to survive. Maher believes being anywhere near people practicing Islam somehow makes it impossible to write music or satire \u2014 that Serge Gainsbourg and Charles Aznavour, both children of immigrants to France, would have been incapable of playing piano or writing while breathing the same air as Muslims. He claims that the arrival of migrants will inherently lead the the rise of the radical right, and that there are \u201ca lot of young Muslim men in European cities who, even though they are newcomers to the land, really are not humble about adapting to the ways of the western world.\u201d Never mind that Europe is stable and has been home to tens of millions of Muslims for all of my lifetime. Maher has joined the ranks of westerners who bemoan the imminent collapse of western culture, yet have absolutely nothing to contribute to said culture. I find it hard to imagine what he sees as so wonderful about a culture that, according to him, couldn\u2019t survive the arrival of 2 million immigrants.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The comedian loves to rail against religious fanatics, but his treatment of Islam is no less radical and intolerant", "title": "Bill Maher, atheist fundamentalist: Why he gives nonbelievers a bad name", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The comedian loves to rail against religious fanatics, but his treatment of Islam is no less radical and intolerant", "title": "Bill Maher, atheist fundamentalist: Why he gives nonbelievers a bad name", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/10/bill_maher_is_as_irrational_as_the_religious_fundamentalists_he_loves_to_hate_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-10.57.15-AM-1280x791.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The comedian loves to rail against religious fanatics, but his treatment of Islam is no less radical and intolerant", "title": "Bill Maher, atheist fundamentalist: Why he gives nonbelievers a bad name", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-20-at-10.57.15-AM-1280x791.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Patrick Hilsman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Bill Maher, Christianity, Islam, Islamophobia, Muslims, Religion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Bill Maher, Christianity, Islam, Islamophobia, Muslims, Religion, Media News, Entertainment NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetI really want to like Bill Maher.\nAnd atheism certainly doesn\u2019t vindicate Bill Maher from demonizing other cultures based mostly on propaganda and rarely on history.\nAs an atheist, it has taken me a good deal of time to articulate what exactly angers me about Bill Maher, and I\u2019ve finally figured it out.\nMaher has joined the ranks of westerners who bemoan the imminent collapse of western culture, yet have absolutely nothing to contribute to said culture.\nBill Maher pisses me off because at the end of the day, realizing that there is no god doesn\u2019t absolve him or his homies from having to use critical thinking skills ever again."}
