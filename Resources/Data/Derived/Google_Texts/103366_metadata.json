Employers fired them because they became pregnant.\n\nIt\u2019s been illegal to discriminate against pregnant women in the workplace since the Pregnancy Discrimination Act was passed in 1978.\n\nApparently, a lot of employers still don\u2019t understand that, so last week, a government agency decided to issue a reminder.\n\nFor the first time in 30 years, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued new guidance on how to interpret the PDA and other laws protecting pregnant women on the job. Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\n1. An employer cannot fire a woman because she\u2019s pregnant:\n\nSometimes, employers try to disguise the discrimination behind good intentions. They explain they\u2019re worried about safety, for example. In other cases, the discrimination is more blatant. Either way, it\u2019s illegal.\n\nTake this example from a wings restaurant chain in the Houston-area. The company had a written policy to lay off female workers after the third month of their pregnancies. A federal investigation showed the company laid off eight pregnant employees. A manager told investigators that keeping pregnant employees at work any longer would \u201cbe irresponsible in respect to her child\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nBut companies cannot fire employees for this reason. Exceptions are rare, even when a job entails being exposed to toxic chemicals or lifting heavy objects. Courts have ruled that decisions about the safety of the woman and fetus are up to the employee and her doctor, not her boss.\n\n2. A company cannot refuse to hire a woman because she\u2019s pregnant \u2014 or because she may become pregnant in the future:\n\nPeggy Mastroianni, Legal Counsel in the EEOC, said this is very common, especially with workers applying for low wage jobs.\n\nThis problem occurs even at companies that rely on pregnant women as their customers.\n\nA Philadelphia-based franchise of clothes retailer Motherhood Maternity paid $375,000 to settle a pregnancy discrimination and retaliation suit in 2007, after the company allegedly refused to hire three qualified female applicants because they were pregnant.\n\nIt\u2019s also illegal to not hire a woman because she may become pregnant in the future.\n\n\u201cThere is still a stigma against hiring younger women for some jobs, where an employer wants to know somebody is going to be on a job for years without interruption,\u201d said Vicki Shabo, vice president at the National Partnership for Women & Families.\n\n3. New mothers have the right to pump breast milk at work in a safe place. A company cannot fire or discriminate against a woman because she\u2019s lactating:\n\nYou can thank Obamacare for this protection.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires employers provide reasonable breaks to new mothers to pump breast milk for up to one year after a child\u2019s birth. Employers are also required to provide a safe and private place other than a bathroom, to do so.\n\nBut there is an exception for small companies. If a company with fewer than 50 employees can prove that offering breaks or a private space would cause \u201cundue hardship\u201d to the company, it may not have to offer this accommodation to their employees.\n\n4. In some cases, pregnancy-related conditions may entitle women to special accommodations:\n\nA normal pregnancy without complications is not considered a disability under federal law, and it does not entitle a worker to special treatment.\n\nThat said, women who have complications or temporary impairments related to their pregnancy, must be treated the same as other workers with medical impairments.\n\nIf a company has a policy in place that, for example, offers a light-duty assignment for a few months to a worker who injured his back, the company is also expected to provide \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d to a pregnant woman who requires light-duty due to her pregnancy.\n\nOther examples of reasonable accommodations may include letting a worker sit on a stool rather than stand during her shift, changing her work schedule if she has severe morning sickness, or allowing her to keep a water bottle at her work station.\n\nThe worker usually needs to provide a doctor\u2019s note, establishing there\u2019s a medical condition that may temporarily limit her work capabilities. In the case of a pregnancy, common impairments include severe morning sickness, back pain, high blood pressure, gestational diabetes and complications that require bed rest.\n\nThere are some exceptions, but again, to avoid providing an accommodation, an employer has to prove that doing so would cause \u201cundue hardship\u201d to the company.\n\n5. An employer cannot force you to take time off or change jobs, if you\u2019re still able to do your job:\n\nSometimes an employer thinks they\u2019re acting in the best interest of the employee \u2014 or protecting itself from liabilities \u2014 when it decides to reassign a pregnant woman or new parent to a less strenuous job.\n\nEmployers cannot base employment decisions on assumptions about pregnant women\u2019s capabilities and health concerns.\n\nFor example, a boss cannot prevent a pregnant worker from traveling on business trips, because he\u2019s concerned about her health. A company cannot deny a pregnant woman a promotion, assuming once she returns to work after childbirth, she will be less committed to her job. Employers also cannot reassign workers to less desirable jobs, even temporarily, due to concerns about a pregnancy.\n\nThis also applies to mothers returning to the workforce after their child is born.\n\n\u201cWomen may not be given the same opportunities after they come back from leave, because there is an assumption that they may want to take it easy because they have young children at home. That can still be viewed as discrimination,\u201d said Tracy Billows, a partner at Seyfarth Shaw, specializing in labor and employment law.\n\n6. Non-medical leave must be equally available to both women and men:\n\nMaternity leave is granted strictly to women, but if a company also has a policy in place for non-medical leave for purposes like bonding with children, male employees are entitled to the same amount of leave as women.\n\nAs for getting paid during that leave, the United States is the only developed country that does not mandate some sort of paid maternity leave. While the Family and Medical Leave Act does require some employers to offer up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to female and male employees for the birth and care of a newborn child, about 42% of American workers are not covered by this law.\n\n7. You can\u2019t be harassed based on pregnancy, childbirth or related conditions:\n\nSexual harassment is illegal in the workplace. While one-off remarks about a pregnancy won\u2019t usually rise to the level of harassment, repeated insults or comments that create a hostile or offensive work environment are illegal.\n\n8. You cannot be fired for having an abortion or considering having an abortion:\n\nThe Pregnancy Discrimination Act protects women from being discriminated against because they either had an abortion or considered having an abortion.\n\nFaced with discrimination? Here\u2019s what to do:\n\nDiscrimination can be hard to prove, but keeping records that help piece together the discussions you had with your employer and actions taken against you, will help your case. To prove discrimination, you may also have to demonstrate that you were treated differently than other workers who had similar qualifications and performance records.\n\nYou can begin the process by arranging an appointment with an EEOC counselor in your region.\n\nOf all the pregnancy discrimination complaints received by the EEOC, about 1 in 4 are settled in the worker\u2019s favor. The other 75% of cases are dismissed for a variety of reasons, including lack of evidence, improper jurisdiction or employers settling privately with the worker.\n\nA 25% success rate may not sound like much, but it\u2019s high for discrimination cases. Pregnancy discrimination charges are more likely to end in the worker\u2019s favor than other discrimination charges filed with the EEOC, including complaints about race, religion, disability or age-related discrimination in the workplace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Women are still getting fired simply because they're pregnant.
