Only three in 10 people with HIV have suppressed the virus in their system, lowering it to an undetectable level. And this disease still affects different ages, races, sexual orientations, and even different regions of the country in disproportionate ways.\n\n\n\n\"That\u2019s why this is the first administration to release a comprehensive strategy on HIV/AIDS, and that\u2019s why we are updating it for the rest of this decade. It seizes on the rapid shifts in science and policy as we\u2019ve learned more about this disease.\"\n\nThe officials say on President Obama will sign an executive order Thursday releasing this update to the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, taking it through 2020.\n\nThe headline from Douglas M. Brooks, MSW, who is director of the Office of National AIDS Policy and will speak at Thursday morning's presentation, is that the level of HIV infection in the U.S. is \u201cstable overall, but the risk to gay men remains severe. We still have an HIV epidemic, especially for young black men.\u201d\n\nRight now, 1.2 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV, said Brooks, adding that a statistic to be cited by the president in the video -- that one in eight people who have HIV are undiagnosed \u2014 is an improvement from 2010.\n\nStill, for that and other reasons, HIV, said Brooks, \u201cremains a major health crisis for the United States.\u201d\n\nBrooks referred to the strategy of the next five years as a continuation of what the administration has already done, not just at a federal level but nationwide, with state, local and private organizations working with the administration toward these goals:\n\n\u2022 A push for more widespread testing of HIV\n\n\u2022 Expanded treatment across the Southern U.S. and major metropolitan areas\n\n\u2022 Enabling people with HIV access to earlier testing\n\n\u2022 Broad support for comprehensive treatment of HIV\n\n\u2022 Universal viral-suppression among people living with HIV \u2014 helping people attain better health reducing exposure and risk\n\n\u2022 Full access to pre-exposure prophylaxis services.\n\nAs reported extensively in The Advocate, PrEP is a way for people who don\u2019t have HIV to prevent HIV infection by taking a pill every day.\n\nAlso in the video, the president said this next phase of his strategy focuses on \"making sure that every American, no matter who you are, where you live, or how much money you\u2019ve got, can get access to life-extending care.\"\n\nBrooks said a common misconception persists among most Americans, not realizing \u201cthat you can live with HIV; it is no longer a death sentence.\"\n\nBut for certain groups, highlighted by Brooks, attention is a priority. They include gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men of all races and ethnicities, black women and men, Latinos and Latinas, people who inject drugs, people between the ages of 13 and 24, people living in the Southern United States, and transgender women.\n\nBrooks noted the particularly high burden of HIV among black transgender women and black gay and bisexual men \u2014 in the latter group, especially among young men.\n\nThe first five-year plan, begun in 2010, had four major goals:\n\n\u2022 Reduce new HIV infection\n\n\u2022 Improving access to care and improving outcomes for people living with HIV\n\n\u2022 Reducing HIV-related health disparities and health inequities\n\n\u2022 Achieving a more coordinated national response to HIV and AIDS\n\n\u201cFive years later, the efforts of the administration and of people working to implement the strategy have paid off,\u201d said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, assistant to the president and director of the White House Domestic Policy Council.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen significant progress in our work to address HIV broadly but we know we have a lot more work to do,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said in a conference call Wednesday with The Advocate and other reporters in advance of Thursday\u2019s announcement.\n\nSo how much does all this cost? White House officials told The Advocate $24.1 billion was allocated in 2015 for domestic HIV prevention, care, and research. The budget for 2016 asks Congress to approve $25.3 billion.\n\nAdministration officials also provided reporters with details on how the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, helps ensure that Americans living with HIV have better access to care and cannot be denied coverage because of preexisting conditions.
