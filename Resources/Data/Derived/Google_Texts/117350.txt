A recent Carnegie Mellon University alumna has been named a Rhodes Scholar for 2014.

Courtney Wittekind, of Mason, Ohio, is among the 32 American students across the country to receive the scholarship. The program covers the full cost for recipients to study at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom. Depending on the program of study, the scholarship will cover two to four years of tuition.

Approximately 80 scholars worldwide are selected each year. The list was announced Saturday.

Ms. Wittekind graduated from CMU in May with majors in sociocultural anthropology and art, with a focus on displaced persons and refugees, according to The Rhodes Trust. At CMU, she served as news editor for the school newspaper and also sat on its editorial board. She created arts initiatives in a poor neighborhood in Pittsburgh as well as one in Nicaragua, allowing the young participants to share their art with each other, according to information from the trust. She also studied in Thailand on a Boren Scholarship.

Ms. Wittekind is working for the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, following work with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees field office in Myanmar, according to the trust. She plans to earn a doctorate in anthropology from Oxford, with studies beginning in the fall of 2014.
