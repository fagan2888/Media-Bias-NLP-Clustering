(Chad Greene/Special to the News Sentinel)\n\nBy Shelley Kimel Shelley.Kimel@Knoxvillebiz.Com 865-342-6343\n\nMore than 338 East Tennesseeans will lose their jobs by the end of the year as several local companies announce layoffs and closures.\n\nKnoxville-based Community Health Alliance, which last month said it would cease offering insurance coverage in 2016, has notified the Tennessee Department of Labor that it will lay off 148 employees at the end of November.\n\nThe state Department of Commerce and Insurance said in October that CHA had \u201cvoluntarily entered runoff,\u201d when an existing insurance provider stops taking new customers to \u201cwind down.\u201d It will still pay existing policy-related claims, and its network of healthcare providers will stay in place through the end of 2015.\n\nThe department had frozen CHA\u2019s enrollment of new customers on the marketplace in January, but had approved new rates this summer, and CHA planned to offer coverage in 2016 with a premium increase of more than 40 percent.\n\nCommunity Health Alliance was the state\u2019s first qualified \u201cConsumer Operated and Oriented Plan,\u201d or \u201cco-op,\u201d designated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as part of the Affordable Care Act. The federal government awarded a $73.3 million loan to the member-owned and -governed company, which was intended primarily for individuals and small businesses who typically pay more for insurance policies.\n\nSeveral other, albeit smaller, companies also made layoff announcements over the past month.\n\nTwenty-five full-time production employees \u2014 out of about 200 total workers \u2014 have been laid off at ProNova Solutions\u2019 new Blount County facility this week due to project delays, the company confirmed Thursday, along with some part-time and contract workers.\n\n\u201cThe ProNova piece of the business is building ... proton therapy equipment that we\u2019re shipping around the world, and over the last six months we\u2019ve seen a delay in the buildings getting completed,\u201d said Bill Hansen, vice president of strategic development at ProNova\u2019s parent company, Provision Health Partners.\n\nThose delays will affect building and installation of systems at the Singapore Biopolis campus, an international research and development center for biomedical sciences; an agreement with Oxford University to equip the United Kingdom\u2019s first proton research center there with three treatment rooms; and work at The Amsterdam Proton Therapy Center in The Netherlands.\n\nBecause the delays are controlled by permits and government licensing, the company does not have a timeline for when those projects will resume, Hansen said.\n\n\u201cWe put a whole group and plan together for the employees, brought in people to assist them with finding jobs, register for unemployment, got their resumes done, got them into job fairs and other opportunities with recruiters we brought in,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cWe tried to take care of that as best we could. This is not easy for anyone.\u201d\n\nOther companies that have notified the state of impending layoffs include Rocore, an Indiana-based company with Knoxville operations at Forks of the River Industrial Park, which said it will lay off 50 employees at the end of December when the business closes. The company makes heat-exchange products including radiators, oil coolers, charge air coolers and cooling packages for power generation.\n\nAlso effective in December, The Great Smoky Mountain Lumberjack Feud in Pigeon Forge will close, laying off 115 workers.\n\nProNova is just one of several companies that have taken advantage of support systems provided by the state of Tennessee to assist their employees in collecting benefits and finding new jobs, said Ray Abbas, manager of the Knoxville office of the Tennessee Career Center.\n\nThe center has a rapid-response team to meet with employees facing mass layoffs or a business closure. The organization has about $600,000 in funding to help displaced workers this year, and Abbas said he\u2019s confident most workers will find other jobs.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a little tiny uptick in the layoffs this past year, (but in general) our job listings are enormous, the economic indicators point to everything being better, our job fairs are through the roof, and we have businesses begging for applicants,\u201d he said.\n\nBusinesses that are expanding or coming to town need staff, he said, and many focus on recently displaced workers as a proven skilled pool of applicants.\n\n\u201cIf you had to get laid off, it\u2019s so much different now than even a year ago where the prospects were frankly gloomy,\u201d he said. \u201c It\u2019s picked up so much that with the proper job-search skills, these folks can definitely go back to work again.\u201d\n\nThe career center also provides help for workers who lose jobs through no fault of their own, whether their company reaches out or not, at its offices at 2700 Middlebrook Pike or by calling 865-594-5500. Other locations are in Oak Ridge, Lenoir City, Vonore and Sevierville, among others.
