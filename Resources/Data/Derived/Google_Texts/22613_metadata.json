The last several decades of federal politics have been dominated by center-right policies and truly left-wing politicians have been largely marginalized (e.g., Bernie Sanders). Even Clinton and Obama \u2014 the last two Democratic presidents who, theoretically, should be leftists \u2014 are corporate-friendly moderates who have triangulated during negotiations with Republicans to pass center-right policy compromises (e.g., Obama\u2019s Heritage Foundation-inspired ACA or the Clinton Defense of Marriage Act compromise).\n\nWhile electoral results may support the idea of a center-right nation, looking beyond electoral politics \u2014 which involve a mixture of policy choices, party politics, fundraising and propaganda \u2014 and focusing purely upon raw policy preferences leaves us with an entirely different picture.\n\nHere is a compilation of polling data from various reputable American polling organizations, describing the policy preferences of the Americans people over the last year.\n\nEconomic Issues\n\nAccording to Gallup polling, 59 percent of Americans think that U.S. wealth \u201cshould be more evenly distributed\u201d among a larger percentage of the people while only 33 percent thought that the current \u201cdistribution is fair.\u201d While this is down from the 2008 modern high point, where 68 percent of Americans supported more redistribution, the public opinion of redistribution has held a stable majority, if not super-majority, for decades.\n\nThe fact that such a large number of Americans believes that the distribution of wealth is currently too skewed toward the wealthy is made far more relevant by the fact that they don\u2019t actually know just how skewed the wealth distribution has become. As explained by Michael Norton of the Harvard Business School, Americans think that the current distribution of wealth is far more equal (middle bar graph) than it actually is (top bar graph) \u2014 in short, they recognize the problem, but lack an understanding as to just how bad it has become.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, 69 percent of Americans oppose any cuts to Social Security or Medicare, even in order to cut the deficit, while only 23 percent support such cuts. Additionally, 59 percent oppose cuts on programs assisting the poor in order to address the deficit, while only 33 percent support such austerity.\n\nA multitude of polls have indicated that between 60 percent and 80 percent of Americans support increasing taxes on the wealthy, depending upon how the question is worded and the polling venue \u2014 this indicates that a majority of Americans support increasing taxes on top-earners in order to reduce the deficit.\n\nAccording to Quinnipiac Polling, 71 percent of Americans support increasing the minimum wage to at least $10.10 an hour, while only 27 percent oppose increasing the minimum wage.\n\nAccording to Gallup Polling, 54 percent of Americans support labor unions, while only 39 percent disapprove of unions.\n\nAccording to Gallup Polling, 37 percent of Americans think that we spend too much on defense, while only 28 percent think that we spend too little.\n\nDuring the fight over letting jobless benefits expire, Quinnipiac Polling found that 58 percent of Americans supported extending benefits by at least three months, while only 37 percent of Americans supported letting benefits expire.\n\nCultural Issues\n\nAccording to Washington Post/ABC polling, 59 percent of Americans support gay marriage, while only 34 percent oppose marriage equality.\n\nAccording to Pew Research, 54 percent of Americans support keeping abortion \u201clegal in all/most cases,\u201d while only 40 percent support making abortion \u201cillegal in all/most cases.\u201d While informative of public opinion, this poll is moot, as abortion is a constitutionally protected right, and there is no way for even a majority of antiabortion voters (that hasn\u2019t existed for decades) to legally make abortion illegal in most cases.\n\nAccording to ABC/Washington Post polling, 51 percent of Americans disagree with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to strike down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, while only 33 percent support the decision. This decision was a direct result of the Alabama GOP\u2019s attempts to circumvent the Voting Rights Act preclearance provision, and was engineered to allow right-wing legislatures to pass voter disenfranchisement laws.\n\nAccording to polling by the Feldman Group, 62 percent of Americans support the Paycheck Fairness Act \u2014 which seeks to close the gender-based wage gap \u2014 while only 29 percent of Americans oppose the act.\n\nAccording to Gallup Polling, 58 percent of Americans support legalizing marijuana, while only 39 percent support continued criminalization.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From minimum wage to the environment to abortion, America is far more liberal than the media or the right admit", "title": "GOP\u2019s 30-year spin job is over: Why we are not a center-right nation", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From minimum wage to the environment to abortion, America is far more liberal than the media or the right admit", "title": "GOP\u2019s 30-year spin job is over: Why we are not a center-right nation", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/28/gops_30_year_spin_job_is_over_why_we_are_not_a_center_right_nation/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/reagan_ryan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From minimum wage to the environment to abortion, America is far more liberal than the media or the right admit", "title": "GOP\u2019s 30-year spin job is over: Why we are not a center-right nation", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/reagan_ryan.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joshua Sager", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, America, cultural issues, economic issues, Editor's Picks, Environment, GOP, Guns, marijuana, Medicare, Minimum wage, Propaganda, Social Security, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "According to Gallup Polling, 58 percent of Americans support legalizing marijuana, while only 39 percent support continued criminalization.\nAccording to Gallup Polling, 54 percent of Americans support labor unions, while only 39 percent disapprove of unions.\nAccording to Gallup Polling, 37 percent of Americans think that we spend too much on defense, while only 28 percent think that we spend too little.\nCultural IssuesAccording to Washington Post/ABC polling, 59 percent of Americans support gay marriage, while only 34 percent oppose marriage equality.\nAccording to Quinnipiac Polling, 71 percent of Americans support increasing the minimum wage to at least $10.10 an hour, while only 27 percent oppose increasing the minimum wage."}
