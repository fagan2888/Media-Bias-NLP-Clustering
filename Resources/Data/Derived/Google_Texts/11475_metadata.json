Courtesy Sunrise/Channel Seven\n\nAFTER hitting back at her ex\u2019s new squeeze on social media last week, Brynne Edelsten has now penned an open letter to \u201cnasty\u201d Gabi Grecko.\n\nBrynne initially kept a relatively low profile while the flame-haired model-DJ was doing the rounds with various media outlets, but it appears she has sold her side of the story to New Idea magazine.\n\nGeoff steps out with Brynne lookalike\n\nWHO IS GABI GRECKO?\n\nIn the lengthy letter, published in today\u2019s issue of the magazine, the reality TV star pleads with Grecko to leave her alone, saying it is \u201cbizarre that you\u2019re obsessing about me.\u201d\n\nBrynne begins: \u201cDear Gabi, I\u2019m not sure what your issue with me is, but please leave me alone,\u201d before calling the 24-year-old \u201cobsessed\u201d and \u201cnasty\u201d.\n\n\u201cClearly you\u2019ve got something against me, which is a bit confusing. I don't understand why you\u2019ve said the things you\u2019ve said. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s jealousy or insecurity or what it is. I understand you\u2019re only 24, so maybe you\u2019ve just got a lot of learning to do,\u201d the 31-year-old writes.\n\n30 LIFE LESSONS LEARNT BY 30\n\nLast week, Grecko accused Brynne of being \u201crude\u201d, \u201ctacky\u201d and of treating her ex-husband badly during an appearance on Seven\u2019s Sunrise.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how you think I\u2019m rude. I think you\u2019re rude and your opinion is judgmental, to be honest. If anything, you\u2019re revealing a lot about yourself.\u201d\n\nThe recently single star revealed in the letter that Grecko had sent a Twitter picture of herself kissing Geoffrey via email to Brynne\u2019s mother Mariel Gordon.\n\n\u201cI contacted Geoff and asked for you not to contact myself or my family and your message back was basically: \u2018All publicity is good publicity\u2019.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for me to put up with it, but to try to attack my mother like that is just disgusting. Leave me and my family alone, they have nothing to do with you,\u201d Brynne writes.\n\nGeoffrey denied such an email exists.\n\nBrynne also hit out at Grecko\u2019s claims that she is a gold-digger, saying: \u201cFrom the day I came to Australia, there were people calling me a gold-digger. It\u2019s a low blow but it\u2019s nothing new. If you want to hurt me, be more creative.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Grecko to hit back on Instagram, posting this morning: \u201cTo be honest and clear I only said the things I said because of how horribly she treated Geoff and I\u2019ll stick up for my man.\n\n\u201cWho would want to stalk her.\n\n\u201cIf anyone knew even close to the truth about how horrible she treated him after he gave her so much you\u2019d do the same! #standbymyman.\u201d\n\nLast week, Brynne posted a quote from designer Coco Chanel on her Facebook and Instagram in response to Grecko\u2019s cruel words.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care what you think about me. I don\u2019t think about you at all,\u201d the quote reads.\n\nBrynne\u2019s manager Rob Menzies said that the My Bedazzled Life star won\u2019t be \u201cdragged into\u201d the Grecko drama.\n\nThe medical entrepreneur and his new love, who is 47 years his junior, first made headlines last Monday, causing a stir at the funeral of AFL legend Tom Hafey.\n\nBrynne, who parted ways with her 71-year-old husband in January after four years of marriage, has received an outpouring of support from her fans on social media in the wake of the split.\n\nShe spent most of last week in her new Port Melbourne apartment but ventured out for first time publicly last night, appearing as a judge at the Mr World competition.\n\nSurrounded by shirtless muscle men, the party girl helped crown Nick Kennett Mr World Australia, before continuing on to her favourite nightclub Eve until early this morning.\n\nBrynne and Geoff are trying to settle their divorce, and it is understood the pair did not sign a pre-nuptial agreement.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "description": "AFTER hitting back at her ex&#8217;s new squeeze on social media last week, Brynne Edelsten has now penned an open letter to &#8220;nasty&#8221; Gabi Grecko.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "NewsComAu", "description": "AFTER hitting back at her ex&#8217;s new squeeze on social media last week, Brynne Edelsten has now penned an open letter to &#8220;nasty&#8221; Gabi Grecko.", "title": "Brynne pens open letter to Geoffrey Edelsten\u2019s new girlfriend Gabi Grecko", "url": "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/brynne-pens-open-letter-to-geoffrey-edelstens-new-girlfriend-gabi-grecko/story-fn907478-1226931570906", "image": "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2014/05/26/1226931/569679-2cc2c15a-e462-11e3-addf-ef174a6b8f2d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2014/05/26/1226931/569679-2cc2c15a-e462-11e3-addf-ef174a6b8f2d.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@newscomauHQ", "id": "@newscomauHQ"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273", "app_id": 113758722003364}, "articleid": 1226931570906, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "news.com.au", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Mon May 26 14:41:39 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Mon May 26 14:41:39 EST 2014", "author": "CHARLOTTE WILLIS"}, "keywords": "brynne, edelsten, open letter, new idea, girlfriend, magazine, gabi, grecko, geoffrey, split, divorce", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d37\"", "article_summary": "VideoImage Edelsten's new flame calls Brynne 'tacky' 7:56 Play video Geoffrey Edelsten's new flame Gabi Grecko says she doesn't want to be compared to his ex-wife Brynne as she's 'tacky'.\nCourtesy Sunrise/Channel SevenAFTER hitting back at her ex\u2019s new squeeze on social media last week, Brynne Edelsten has now penned an open letter to \u201cnasty\u201d Gabi Grecko.\n#standbymyman.\u201dLast week, Brynne posted a quote from designer Coco Chanel on her Facebook and Instagram in response to Grecko\u2019s cruel words.\nGeoff steps out with Brynne lookalikeWHO IS GABI GRECKO?\n30 LIFE LESSONS LEARNT BY 30Last week, Grecko accused Brynne of being \u201crude\u201d, \u201ctacky\u201d and of treating her ex-husband badly during an appearance on Seven\u2019s Sunrise."}
