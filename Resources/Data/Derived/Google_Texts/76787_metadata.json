(Paul Sancya/Associated Press)\n\nAppearing on multiple Sunday shows, Donald Trump demonstrated how maddeningly incoherent and inconsistent he can be. Listening to him over and over again, however, one begins to suspect this is an act to avoid close scrutiny.\n\nWhen pressed, for example, on whether he wants an individual mandate, a position he took with Anderson Cooper at last week\u2019s town hall, he rambled thusly on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d:\n\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, question: do you support the individual mandate on Obamacare or not? TRUMP: Right. Let me explain to you. First of all, I don\u2019t want mandates for anything. I want people to get. I don\u2019t want people dying in the streets. I was actually talking over Anderson Cooper, who I thought it was a great interview and he\u2019s a great interviewer. But I was talking over him. He was talking at the same time. He mentioned the word \u201cmandate,\u201d and I was talking about something else, to be honest with you. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s not a very complicated \u2014 WALLACE: But, wait, you said \u201cI like the mandate\u201d. TRUMP: I like \u2014 I want people to be covered that cannot afford to be covered that are \u2014 I don\u2019t want people dying in the streets. That\u2019s not mandate. That\u2019s me. That\u2019s having a heart. I don\u2019t want people dying in the streets. I don\u2019t want people to have no health care whatsoever and they\u2019re in the middle of the street dying. And I talk about it all the time. And you know what? When I give these speeches where I have 10,000 and 15,000 and 20,000 people and I talk as a Republican, as a conservative Republican, and I talk about that and I say, \u201cI don\u2019t want people dying because they have no money,\u201d I get standing ovations. You know, the Republicans are not bad people. I get standing ovations. So, I think it\u2019s very important. I\u2019m not going to have people dying in the street if I\u2019m president. I can tell you that. You can call it whatever you want.\n\nHuh? But wait. He gave just about the same answer on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d:\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Well, on the mandate, if you look at the mandate, we had a situation where we were, Anderson Cooper, who\u2019s terrific, by the way, and did a terrific job, but we were talking over each other. Look, I want, we\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a total and complete disaster. It\u2019s going to be gone. We\u2019re going to come up with a great healthcare plan, whether it\u2019s healthcare savings accounts, we have a lot of different things. We\u2019re going to get rid of the lines between states, we\u2019re going to have great competitive bidding. But I say all the time, you can call it anything you want. People are not going to die in the middle of the street. People are not going to die on the sidewalk if I\u2019m president, okay? CHUCK TODD: Well, let me get something definitive from you on this. DONALD TRUMP: But Chuck, I say that, excuse me, I say that to packed houses with thousands and thousands of people, Republicans mostly, and I get standing ovations. I\u2019m not going to let that happen. If I\u2019m president, we\u2019re not going to have people dying on the streets. So you can call it whatever you want. I don\u2019t call it a mandate, I just say it\u2019s common sense. CHUCK TODD: No, I understand that. Well, let me ask you this. Do you think that it should be a law that anybody who can afford health insurance has to have it? DONALD TRUMP: I think, no, I think it\u2019s going to be up to them, okay? I want it to be up to them. But I\u2019m really talking about people that can\u2019t afford it. We\u2019re not going to let people die in squalor because we are Republicans, okay? That\u2019s part of the problem with the Republicans, where somehow they got fed into this horrible position. We\u2019re going to take care of people. But no, people don\u2019t have to have it. We\u2019re going to have great plans, they\u2019re going to be a lot less expensive than Obamacare. They\u2019re going to be private. There are going to be lots of different options. We\u2019re going to have a lot of different options. Right now you have no options. You know why? Because the insurance company controlled Obama because they gave him a lot of money. That\u2019s why you have lines around the states. And you can\u2019t get competitive bidding.\n\nTalk about operating by rote. He insists whatever inanity he said earlier was a mistake, denies he took or takes a liberal position and declares there will not be people \u201cdying in the streets.\u201d (Does he understand there is a duty now to treat people, but what we are debating is insurance?) Then he ends with assurances he is loved by crowds. Superlatives by the bushel may be funny, but they also substitute for concrete answers. It may seem like a word salad or stream of consciousness at first glance, but it is a salad he tosses up over and over again, each time avoiding close scrutiny.\n\nOn health care and most every issue, he has not bothered to try \u2014 or is incapable of \u2014 getting up to speed. Instead, he has decided to repeat a couple of canned lines and bluff his way through questions. The same pattern emerges whether it is his claim to have been against the Iraq War or his assertion President George W. Bush knew there were no WMDs in Iraq. When pressed on his comments in 2002 supporting the war, Trump threw this out:\n\nWell, what I mean by that is it almost shouldn\u2019t have been done. And you know, I really don\u2019t even know what I mean, because that was a long time ago, and who knows what was in my head. I think that it wasn\u2019t done correctly. In retrospect, it shouldn\u2019t have been done at all. It was sort of, you know, it was just done. It was just, we dropped bombs. Now if you look back, actually, that was probably the correct way of doing it, not going in, and not upsetting, giving them a lesson or not. I mean, I think Senior actually did a pretty good job of what he was doing. He went in, he taught them a lesson. What happened is he was taunted. Because Saddam Hussein was saying, \u201cWe drove back the Americans. The ugly Americans were driven back, the power of Iraq, the power.\u201d\n\nTalk about incoherent. Unfortunately, no one will say to his face he is talking nonsense because he has no real answer.\n\nDonald Trump won the Feb. 20 South Carolina GOP primary. Here's how. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nCertainly, there is a hard-core base of non-college-educated, lower-income voters who do not care what he says, do not care about substance and are unbothered by virulent bigotry and misogyny. Nevertheless, it would seem every voter not in that category is ripe for another candidate\u2019s picking. (As we saw in South Carolina, for example, Trump is still getting 25 percent of college graduates.) His complete lack of understanding of issues and a dearth of sane policy solutions should be fodder for other candidates. They can mock him, pull a \u201cChris Christie\u201d (force to give the same nonanswer over and over again) and use every forum possible to drill down on his ignorance.\n\nFurthermore, Trump still not has revealed his foreign policy team (how many times has he promised?). He now says his tax returns are not coming soon. (Again, how many times did he promise to release those?) Both opponents and media need to hit him hard on hiding basic information from voters and refusing to do what candidates with far fewer resources routinely manage to do (e.g. Bush put out 33 years of returns). There plainly is a reason why we do not know his foreign policy team. Maybe his team is unimpressive or does not exist at all. Likewise, there is a reason he has not put out his taxes. (Does he avoid paying anything? Is he stingy on charity? Does he over- or understate his wealth?)\n\nIn short, Trump needs to be held accountable for his babbling on policy and his refusal to release basic information. In the endless stream of words and excuses, he, one suspects, is trying to conceal just how unprepared he is for the presidency and all that it requires.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's time to call out Trump", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "It's time to call out Trump", "title": "Trump\u2019s word salads conceal his ignorance", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/02/22/trumps-word-salads-conceal-his-ignorance/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/21/Editorial-Opinion/Images/APTOPIX_GOP_2016_Trump-007d6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2016/02/22/trumps-word-salads-conceal-his-ignorance/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "trump word salad, trump ignorance, trump tax returns, trump foreign policy team", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "trump word salad, trump ignorance, trump tax returns, trump foreign policy team"}, "article_summary": "He mentioned the word \u201cmandate,\u201d and I was talking about something else, to be honest with you.\nDONALD TRUMP: I think, no, I think it\u2019s going to be up to them, okay?\nI don\u2019t want people to have no health care whatsoever and they\u2019re in the middle of the street dying.\nI\u2019m not going to have people dying in the street if I\u2019m president.\nI was actually talking over Anderson Cooper, who I thought it was a great interview and he\u2019s a great interviewer."}
