There’s plenty of good news in the job market these days. The unemployment rate continues to fall, and companies are finally increasing their hiring plans. As of the end of May, there were 5.4 million job openings, the highest number in 15 years.

A report, released last month by CareerBuilder, projected that the U.S. workforce would expand 5 percent from 2014 to 2019. That’s more than the 3.5 percent growth rate from 2009-2013, but lower than the pre-recession 2003-2007 period, when jobs grew 5.8 percent annually.

About 10,000 baby boomers celebrate their 65th birthday every day, a trend that will continue for more than a decade, according to the Pew Research Center.

Of the 10 fastest-growing jobs, only three require a bachelor’s degree or higher, and four don’t even require an associate’s degree.
