The music mogul, whose real name is Sean Combs, faces assault charges for an alleged attack involving a weight-room kettlebell at the athletic facilities of the University of California at Los Angeles, where Diddy's other son Justin plays football.\n\n\"Hiccups happen in life. You push that to the side. You worry about that later,\" Brown told The Associated Press. \"That's why we here right now just enjoying the BET Awards. We come every year. We're supporting the family, supporting my dad. And my dad's got a big performance this year.\"\n\nDiddy led a reunion of original Bad Boy musicians including Faith Evans, the Lox and Ma$e at the show. He also debuted a new song with Pharrell, \"Finna Get Loose.\"\n\n\"This is a big moment,\" Brown said. \"This is like a family reunion for Bad Boy. ... Bad Boy is still here. We ain't never went nowhere. Can't stop, won't stop.\"\n\nThe performance was a huge crowd pleaser, but it didn't go all smoothly: Diddy fell through an open trap door on stage while performing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Diddy's son Quincy calls father's arrest a 'hiccup' - AP News: LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Diddy's son Quincy Brown has dismissed .05/27/2016 8:42:42AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Diddy's son Quincy Brown has dismissed his father's recent arrest as", "title": "AP News - Diddy's son Quincy calls father's arrest a 'hiccup'", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2015/06/29/diddys-son-quincy-calls-fathers-arrest-a-hiccup-n2018843", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\180\\3a8cf63c-d16b-4133-94f5-20acb04a1f24.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Diddy's son Quincy Brown has dismissed his father's recent arrest as", "title": "AP News - Diddy's son Quincy calls father's arrest a 'hiccup'", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2015/06/29/diddys-son-quincy-calls-fathers-arrest-a-hiccup-n2018843", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/180/3a8cf63c-d16b-4133-94f5-20acb04a1f24.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Diddy's son Quincy calls father's arrest a 'hiccup', AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Diddy's son Quincy Brown has dismissed his father's recent arrest as a \"hiccup.\"\nWe're supporting the family, supporting my dad.\nDiddy led a reunion of original Bad Boy musicians including Faith Evans, the Lox and Ma$e at the show.\n\"This is like a family reunion for Bad Boy.\n...
