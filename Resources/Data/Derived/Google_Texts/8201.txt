WASHINGTON — Dallas Rep. Pete Sessions claimed on the House floor today that Obamacare coverage costs federal taxpayers $5 million for each newly covered American.

He was off by a lot — nearly $5 million, in fact.

“If you just do simple multiplication, 12 million into $108 billion, we’re talking literally every single recipient would be costing this government more than $5 million per person for their insurance,” said Sessions, chairman of the House Rules Committee.

The actual math is this: $108 billion divided by 12 million equals $9,000.

Sessions’ comments came during a debate on the Republican budget plan for 2016. Aides declined to explain or comment on the inflated cost estimate.

At a Rules hearing Monday night on the GOP budget plan, House Budget Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., cited a $104 billion cost for Obamacare coverage. In his floor remarks, Sessions cited Price as the source of his figure, and said he was awaiting precise cost estimates from the Budget Committee.

The White House says about 16.4 million previously uninsured people have obtained coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the law’s coverage provisions will cost the federal government $1.5 trillion between 2015 and 2024. That’s about $150 billion per year – which comes to 9,146 each for 16.4 million people.

Democrats quickly challenged Sessions’ math.

“By what possible means do you think that we’re paying $5 million for everybody’s health care, each person’s health care on the Affordable Care Act?” Rep. Louise Slaughter of New York, the senior Democrat on the Rules Committee, said on the House floor shortly after Sessions spoke. “Nobody ever paid $5 million for anybody’s health care in a single year. It’s the most atrocious thing I think I’ve heard on this floor.”
