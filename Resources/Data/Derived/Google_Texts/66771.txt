This letter is to refute Mr. (Rueben) Thompson’s remarks about conservatives (Letter: Conservatives should realize Jesus was a liberal, Oct. 12, amarillo.com), and more especially my savior Jesus Christ.

As a Christian, I agree with conservative Republican ideals.

The Democratic Party was the party of slavery. The abolitionist political party was the party of Lincoln — the Republican Party. History shows the Democratic Party could not have passed the Civil/Voting Rights Acts without the help and votes of the majority of the Republican minority party.

The Democrats supported welfare programs that increased single-parent households. In the African-American community, single-parent households are now 70 percent.

The majority of the money collected by government designated for welfare programs goes to administrative costs.

The reverse is true for most ministries.

Jesus was neither liberal or conservative.

You will find in Proverbs, spoken twice — “Do not be a surety for your neighbor.”

I do not want to support the lifestyles of individuals who continue in risky behavior. I also do not want to pay for the killing of unborn children, since they are made in the image of God. These actions are supported in the Affordable Care Act. Jesus forgave the prostitute, but said to not continue in risky behavior (sin) — and he certainly never condoned infanticide.

Conservatives do not like governmental waste — Jesus was definitely not wasteful. He even collected the scraps left behind by the multitude.

Jesus received financial benefit from the wives of the rich. Rich or poor, conservative or liberal; Jesus is the savior of whosoever accepts his sacrifice on the cross — and him into their hearts.
