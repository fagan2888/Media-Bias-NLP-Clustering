It\u2019s a feeling of isolation that has crept up on other rural corners of the state following a spate of 10 hospital closures in the past two years. And financial data collected by the state and federal government shows revenue is falling for other rural hospitals, suggesting more may be on the brink.\n\nPolicymakers, operating on tight budgets, must decide whether they are willing to spend more money on small hospitals serving a limited number of patients, hospitals that in most cases could not keep their doors open without government assistance. But without them, people, inevitably, will die.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the crash that\u2019s coming in the next five years,\u201d said Lynn Butler, an Austin-based lawyer who has worked on hospital bankruptcy cases. \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s more interested in cutting revenue and cutting services than providing the basic services for these rural communities. This is a perfect storm of events that\u2019s going to hit the state, hard.\u201d\n\nTexas' rural hospitals have long struggled to stay afloat, but new threats to their survival have mounted in recent years. Undelivered promises of federal health reform, payment cuts by both government programs and private insurers, falling patient volumes and a declining rural population overall have been tough on business \u2014 a phenomenon one health care executive called \"death by a thousand paper cuts.\" Add to that Texas\u2019 distinction as the state with the highest percentage of people without health insurance and you get a financially hostile landscape for rural hospital operators.\n\n\u201cHospital operating margins, and this is probably true of the big guys and the small guys, too, are very small, if not negative,\u201d said John Henderson, chief executive of the Childress Regional Medical Center. \u201cIn a way, Texas rural hospitals are kind of in a worst-case scenario situation, because we lead the nation in uninsured, and we took Medicare cuts hoping that we could cover more people.\u201d\n\nThat was part of an agreement negotiated by the American Hospital Association when Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature health care law. The idea was that hospitals would take cuts to their Medicare payments, but in return they would have to spend less on \u201ccharity care\u201d because most patients would have health insurance.\n\nBut because Texas' Republican leadership has vehemently opposed expanding Medicaid to low-income adults, hospitals say they are paying the price for cost savings they didn't receive.\n\nFederal health reform mandated penalties for hospitals, rural and urban, that have too many patients re-admitted for follow-up care. Another program cracks the whip on hospitals where too many patients get sick during their stay. Federal sequestration, meanwhile, has meant a 2 percent across-the-board cut to Medicare payments.\n\nRural hospitals took a further hit from the federal health law\u2019s reductions in \u201cdisproportionate share hospital\u201d payments to hospitals with large numbers of indigent and uninsured patients. And then there was the Texas Legislature\u2019s 10 percent cut for Medicaid outpatient care in 2011.\n\nThe sum of all these changes has people like Don McBeath, who lobbies for rural hospitals, warning of a repeat of the widespread hospital closures Texas experienced three decades ago. In 1983, the federal government restructured the way Medicare made payments to hospitals, meant to reward efficient care. Those changes proved untenable for small hospitals with low patient volume, heralding decades of closures that claimed more than 200 small Texas hospitals as casualties, McBeath said.\n\nSome counties can afford to raise taxes to keep their hospitals open; others cannot, or find that raising taxes is politically impossible.\n\nAnd when a small county hospital closes, often the hospital in the next county over must shoulder a bigger burden of uninsured patients. Even patients with insurance face higher deductibles and often can\u2019t pay their bills.\n\n\u201cWhen it closes, you\u2019re forced to make other decisions, other plans,\u201d said Becky Wilbanks, a judge in East Texas\u2019 Cass County, which saw a hospital closure last year. \u201cThat\u2019s an economic hit that we took.\u201d\n\nRural hospitals are often one of the biggest and highest-paying employers in a community, Wilbanks said.\n\nAnd when they close, it can have a domino effect on other local businesses, said Hall County Judge Ray Powell. When his county\u2019s hospital closed in 2002, it prompted the local farm equipment dealership to close its doors and move to Childress.\n\n\u201cIt was a big loss,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was devastating.\u201d\n\nAcross Texas, rural counties are seeing their populations dwindle. King County, home to Guthrie, is one of Texas\u2019 46 rural counties that are projected to lose population over the next four decades \u2014 at a time when the rest of the state\u2019s population is expected to double.\n\nIt\u2019s a trend of urbanization that is only hastened when a small hospital shuts down, Henderson said, because the hospital\u2019s closure can be the death knell for an entire community.\n\n\u201cWho would choose to live in or retire to a community that doesn\u2019t have a local hospital or local ER?\u201d said Henderson. \u201cHow can a rural community hope to be there if you can\u2019t provide health care?\u201d\n\nKing County is one of 24 counties that lacked even a single physician, according to a 2010 analysis by the state demographer.\n\nJeannie Sweeney, the King County emergency medical service director, said the county is required to have at least one certified care attendant present on its ambulance. There are only two certified people in the county, she said.\n\nKeitha Tiffin said she hoped other rural communities would be spared tragedies like her husband\u2019s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late for my husband,\u201d she said, \u201cbut dear God, this should not happen to anyone else.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
