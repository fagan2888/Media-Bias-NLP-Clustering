There I was, last Sunday morning, reading the news of actor James Garner\u2019s death on my laptop and nostalgically recalling how much my father, a longtime TV critic, had loved Garner\u2019s benchmark 1970s-era private-eye drama, \u201cThe Rockford Files.\u201d But my memories of the show were vague \u2014 I was 12 when it premiered. I wondered idly if Netflix might carry it. Because isn\u2019t that what our contemporary digital lifestyle is all about? Access to whatever we want, whenever we want. Time has no meaning in 2014 \u2014 get me the 1970s, now!\n\nBefore I could check myself, I was sucked down a time-warp rabbit hole, a fact I could not easily explain to my 16-year-old son, who was curious, and perhaps slightly alarmed, as to why I was spending a Sunday afternoon binge-watching car chases. I had expected to be charmed by James Garner. I didn\u2019t expect to become obsessed with the question of how Jim Rockford\u2019s adventures in L.A. would be different if he had owned an iPhone.\n\nThe wide-lapel shirts. The endless car chases. The shocking lack of racial diversity in Los Angeles as presented on 1970s television. There are plenty of obvious differences between the America of 40 years ago and the America of right now. But I couldn\u2019t stop fixating on just how often everything stopped in its tracks so that Jim Rockford could put a dime in a payphone: multiple times an episode. Without those payphones, the plot wasn\u2019t going anywhere. But in between those payphones, Rockford lived in a kind of L.A. limbo-land, his whereabouts gloriously unknowable. No one is as isolated today as Rockford was in his Pontiac Firebird on an L.A. freeway.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch\u2019s Sherlock Holmes uses a smartphone just as you would expect a genius detective to, with the entire Internet at his disposal to assist in the deductive process. It\u2019s clever, but it always seemed like cheating. Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s Sherlock didn\u2019t need no stinkin\u2019 smartphone! A few puffs on his pipe was all that was necessary!\n\nIt was hard for me to avoid the sinking feeling that Jim Rockford with an iPhone would no longer be Jim Rockford. Always-on Wi-Fi would accelerate his genial slouch. The languid ocean outside his trailer would end up a trivialized mote in his Instagram-feed. The string of dames in distress wouldn\u2019t appear unannounced at his door; they\u2019d find him on Tinder first.\n\nI don\u2019t want Jim Rockford with a smartphone in his pocket. But that forces an uncomfortable conclusion. If I assume that a smartphone will mess up that \u201970s show, am I not admitting that it is screwing with my own current serial arc?\n\nThose pay phones, of course, stand out in \u201cThe Rockford Files\u201d because now, for the most part, they are gone, a prominently invisible marker of massive technological change. The transition has happened so quickly that on Monday I was surprised to read Bloomberg News reporting that Google is one of a number of companies \u201cconsidering a plan that uses pay-phone locations to give New Yorkers free wireless Internet access.\u201d\n\nMy immediate reaction: No way! New York still has payphones?\n\nYes, according to Bloomberg \u2014 around 7,300 of them, down from 30,000 in the mid-\u201990s. Nationwide, the U.S. only has around 430,000 payphones, down from a peak of 2.2 million. Those that remain are mostly located in low-income areas, where the price of a cellphone minute still matters. In the larger pop-culture imagination, they\u2019ve vanished. Pick an hour, any hour, of contemporary television \u2014 excluding \u201cDoctor Who\u201d \u2014 and your chances of seeing a payphone are just about nil.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NYC now plans to turn old pay phones into wireless hotspots, raising new questions about our hyper-connected lives", "author": "Andrew Leonard", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NYC now plans to turn old pay phones into wireless hotspots, raising new questions about our hyper-connected lives", "title": "The truth about our Wi-Fi society: What the quest for constant connection really means", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/27/the_truth_about_our_wi_fi_society_what_the_quest_for_constant_connection_really_means/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/nyc_wifi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NYC now plans to turn old pay phones into wireless hotspots, raising new questions about our hyper-connected lives", "creator": "@koxinga21", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/nyc_wifi.jpg", "title": "The truth about our Wi-Fi society: What the quest for constant connection really means", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The truth about our Wi-Fi society: What the quest for constant connection really means", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, iPhone, James Garner, The Internet, The Rockford Files, Wi-Fi", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2953\"", "article_summary": "It was hard for me to avoid the sinking feeling that Jim Rockford with an iPhone would no longer be Jim Rockford.\nTopics: Editor's Picks, iPhone, James Garner, The Internet, The Rockford Files, Wi-FiBeware the dark powers of Netflix.\nBut in between those payphones, Rockford lived in a kind of L.A. limbo-land, his whereabouts gloriously unknowable.\nThose pay phones, of course, stand out in \u201cThe Rockford Files\u201d because now, for the most part, they are gone, a prominently invisible marker of massive technological change.\nI don\u2019t want Jim Rockford with a smartphone in his pocket."}
