It's time to think big and unite the GOP.\n\nFirst, I believe that Trump is our generation\u2019s Reagan. Reagan was also lightly regarded, laughed at by liberals, the media and the GOP establishment, considered unelectable and an intellectual lightweight, and someone whose finger could never be allowed near the nuclear button -- until he won in two landslides and became a great president.\n\nSo here\u2019s my advice for Trump moving forward.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Donald Trump to act like Reagan, become presidential and unite the GOP.\n\nIt\u2019s time to claim victory and start announcing the amazing \u201cdream team\u201d that this one-of-a-kind CEO will assemble to run the country and save the economy.\n\nIt\u2019s time to praise the Republicans that Trump has been running against -- and bring all their supporters into the Trump tent.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nIt\u2019s time to show the country and the world how a billionaire CEO assembles a dream team.\n\nIt\u2019s time to dazzle the other half of the electorate that doesn\u2019t understand the amazing talents of Donald Trump.\n\nIf Trump shows he can be presidential and assemble an All-Star GOP Dream Team, I believe he is the next president of the United States. So here goes. Here\u2019s a list of potential candidates that could dazzle and excite both the GOP base and the general electorate.\n\nTHE DONALD TRUMP DREAM TEAM:\n\nVice President: Marco Rubio.\n\nRubio brings youth, energy and great orator skills to the table. He can attract Latino voters, soften Trump\u2019s harsh image with women and minorities, and campaign day and night in Florida- thereby guaranteeing victory in THE key state that any Republican Presidential candidate must win. Rubio has a fantastic conservative voting record- with the exception of one issue: immigration. But the Vice President has nothing to do with immigration. Only President Trump is in charge of immigration policy. Rubio is therefore quite an asset.\n\nHealth Czar/Surgeon General: Dr. Ben Carson.\n\nI\u2019d make Dr. Ben the second most important member of the Trump Dream Team. His only job 24/7/365 will be to repeal & replace ObamaCare- as only the world\u2019s most brilliant surgeon can. Dr. Ben will bring hope to millions of middle class Americans and small business owners (job creators) who have been badly hurt by ObamaCare, but also faith and confidence that the new option will work for everyone.\n\nAttorney General: Rudy Guliani\n\nHomeland Security Chief: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (if he can block a bridge, he can also seal the border)\n\nICE (Border & Customs): Sheriff Joe Arpaio (known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Toughest Sheriff\u201d)\n\nSecretary of State: Mike Huckabee (everyone likes Mike -- he is the perfect person to travel the world making peace through strength)\n\nNational Security Adviser: General Jack Keane\n\nDefense: Allen West\n\nTreasury: Mitt Romney\n\nFed Chief: Ron Paul (wouldn\u2019t it fun to torture the people at The Fed who have printed all that fake money and put us $19 trillion in debt)\n\nCommerce: Carly Fiorina\n\nDebt Czar: John Kasich (he was the architect the last time Congress balanced the budget)\n\nCouncil of Economic Advisers- Jack Welch, Carl Icahn, Steve Wynn, Sheldon Adelson, Phil Ruffin, Herman Cain, Stephen Moore, Art Laffer, Mark Skousen (a brilliant economist and Professor of Economics & Finance at Chapman University, formerly Economics Professor at Columbia Business School, Founder of FreedomFest, where Trump gave his first major speech as presidential candidate)\n\nLabor: Scott Walker (he fought the unions in Wisconsin and won against-all-odds)\n\nEnergy: Sarah Palin (who else? Drill baby, drill)\n\nEducation: Bobby Jindal\n\nSmall Business Administration: Wayne Allyn Root (OK, I'm biased, but wouldn't it be nice for first time in history to have a real-life small businessman as the leader in charge of helping small business?)\n\nUN Ambassador: Jeb Bush (yes, I gave him an important role)\n\nNext Supreme Court Justice: Judge Andrew Napolitano (of Fox News fame)\n\n*NOTE: I purposely left both Ted Cruz and Rand Paul in the Senate -- where they can do the most good\u2026leading the battle in Congress to back President Trump\u2019s fight to cut taxes, spending and debt, roll back regulations, and repeal ObamaCare.\n\nWayne Allyn Root is a Capitalist Evangelist, serial entrepreneur, conservative national media commentator, and proud champion of the middle class. He is a former Libertarian vice presidential nominee, now back to the GOP. Wayne's latest book is \"The Murder of the Middle Class\" (Regenery 2014).
