As you may have heard, Planned Parenthood has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, also giving her $20 million. But isn’t Planned Parenthood a non-profit organization and so forbidden, like Christian ministries, from overt political involvement? And since one-third of its income comes from the government, doesn’t that mean that tax dollars are funding a political campaign?

It turns out that Planned Parenthood has formed a separate advocacy group to be its political arm. It presumably is financed by separate money. Still, I remember how careful Christian organizations I’ve been involved have had to be to distance themselves from the very appearance of political involvement in order to protect their tax-exempt status. When it is being said that “Planned Parenthood” is endorsing, rather than “the Planned Parenthood Action Fund,” that would normally invite IRS scrutiny.

Anyway, the endorsement may backfire, both against Planned Parenthood and against Mrs. Clinton. Bernie Sanders supporters are furious at the endorsement and are pulling their funds from Planned Parenthood.
