The National Weather Service has issued a freezing rain advisory for northern and western New Jersey for Sunday, when icy conditions could develop at the start of what is expected to be a mostly rain storm.

The agency said up to a tenth of an inch of ice could fall between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. before precipitation changes over to all rain.

"It doesn't take much freezing rain to cause problems," said Rob Reale, a meteorologist at WeatherWorks, a forecasting firm based in Hackettstown.

The advisory has been issued for Sussex, Warren, Morris, Mercer, Somerset, Hunterdon and Middlesex counties.

Freezing rain can be deceptive because it appears to the naked eye to be plain rain. However, when it makes contact with the ground, it freezes instantly and can quickly make travel hazardous as black ice forms on untreated roadways.

The coming storm, which isn't expected to cause major problems otherwise, follows a record cold Friday night in New Jersey. Across most of the state, temperatures fell below zero, bottoming out at negative 12 degrees in Walpack and negative 10 in Kingwood, according to data from the state climatologist's office.

Teeth-chattering cold will make its return on Monday as a cold front moves through. Temperatures could drop about 40 degrees to near zero in a matter of hours through the course of the day, forecasts show.
