The Colorado State Patrol is investigating a fatal, head-on collision in Fort Collins Tuesday afternoon.

Trooper Nate Reid, a spokesman for the department, said there was a two-vehicle accident near Terry Lake Road and Country Club Road.

One person was pronounced dead on the scene, he said.

The incident happened when a Kia Sorento was travelling south and lost control of the vehicle sliding off to the right shoulder. The driver tried to correct the vehicle and over-steered into oncoming traffic.

The Kia hit a Ford Contour head-on. The driver of the Contour, identified only as a 56-year-old woman from Fort Collins, was killed. A 42-year old woman who was a passenger in the Contour and the 63-year-old driver of the Kia were transported to area hospitals.

All roads were re-opened by 4:30 p.m.

Reid said it is still unknown what caused the driver of the Kia to lose control of the vehicle.
