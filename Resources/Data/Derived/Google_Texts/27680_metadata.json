The National Women's Law Center applauded the president's plan, with the non-profit's Fatima Goss Graves saying Obama's actions would bolster enforcement of labor laws.\n\nWorkers' sharing details about how much they make is commonly prohibited or discouraged by employers. A 2011 survey by the Institute for Women's Policy Research found that \"Almost half of all workers (48.4 percent) responded that they were either prohibited or strongly discouraged from discussing their earnings with colleagues.\"\n\n\"Gag rules that require employees to keep their pay secret perpetuate this inequity,\" she said Sunday. \"These new rules will make it harder for employers to hide pay discrimination.\"\n\nLast June brought the 50th anniversary of the federal Equal Pay Act; that led NPR's Yuki Noguchi to examine the wage gap, which she called \"most prominent when a woman enters her childbearing years.\"\n\nYuki also noted that in 1963, President Kennedy had called the Equal Pay Act a \"first step\" that should be followed by tax breaks and funded daycare centers.\n\nThe AP sums up some of the circumstances around the White House moves:\n\n\"Lacking congressional backing to raise wages or end gender pay disparities, President Barack Obama is imposing his policies directly on federal contractors, following a long-established tradition of presidents exerting their powers on a fraction of the economy directly under their control.\"\n\nThere's also a political backstory, as Politico reports that the president's actions herald \"Democrats' first large-scale coordinated message effort ahead of this year's midterms.\" The White House actions are expected to come as the Senate's Democratic leadership plans an upcoming vote on the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n\nThat legislation isn't expected to pass. A similar measure failed on a 52-47 vote in 2012, \"after Democrats made a tightly coordinated media blitz to call for the bill's passage,\" as The Hill reported.\n\nOn Saturday, the Republican National Committee released a statement about what it calls the \"misleadingly named\" Paycheck Fairness Act, which the GOP says will \"reduce flexibility in the workplace, and make it far easier to file frivolous lawsuits that line the pockets of trial lawyers.\"\n\nRepublicans are also accusing Democrats of seeking to change the subject, rather than talking about the Affordable Care Act and lingering questions over the new health care system.\n\nIn February, President Obama signed an executive order setting a new hourly minimum wage of $10.10, effective at the start of 2015. The White House has argued that raising the minimum wage \"could close about 5 percent of the gender wage gap,\" as Huffington Post reported last month.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Seeking to advance the cause of equal pay for women, President Obama plans to sign am executive order Tuesday barring federal contractors from retaliating against employees who compare salaries.", "og": {"site_name": "NPR.org", "description": "Seeking to advance the cause of equal pay for women, President Obama plans to sign am executive order Tuesday barring federal contractors from retaliating against employees who compare salaries.", "title": "Obama Is Poised To Sign Executive Order On Equal Pay And Contractors", "url": "http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/04/06/299908189/obama-is-poised-to-sign-executive-order-on-equal-pay-and-contractors", "image": "https://media.npr.org/include/images/facebook-default.jpg?s=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "npr.org", "site": "@NPR", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noarchive,index,follow", "fb": {"app_id": 138837436154588, "pages": 10643211755}, "date": "2014-04-06", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb469\"", "article_summary": "Obama Is Poised To Sign Executive Order On Equal Pay And ContractorsSeeking to advance the cause of equal pay for women, President Obama plans to sign an executive order Tuesday barring federal contractors from retaliating against employees who discuss their salaries with each other.\nIn February, President Obama signed an executive order setting a new hourly minimum wage of $10.10, effective at the start of 2015.\nYuki also noted that in 1963, President Kennedy had called the Equal Pay Act a \"first step\" that should be followed by tax breaks and funded daycare centers.\nLast June brought the 50th anniversary of the federal Equal Pay Act; that led NPR's Yuki Noguchi to examine the wage gap, which she called \"most prominent when a woman enters her childbearing years.\"\n\"Gag rules that require employees to keep their pay secret perpetuate this inequity,\" she said Sunday."}
