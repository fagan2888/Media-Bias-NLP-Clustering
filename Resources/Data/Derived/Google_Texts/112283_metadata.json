She apologized for not telling parents in advance about the assignment, but didn\u2019t specifically say the assignment itself was a mistake.\n\nThe school district suspended Ms. Zuniga, a first-year teacher, with pay after she had the children send get-well cards to Abu-Jamal, who was recovering in prison from diabetes complications. The assignment caused a furor in the community.\n\nMs. Zuniga said that in February, she assigned her class to write about this Abu-Jamal quote: \u201cSo long as one just person is silenced, there is no justice.\u201d\n\nIn April, she said, she \u201cmentioned\u201d to her students that Abu-Jamal was ill. She said the children wanted to write cards to him.\n\n\u201cI was very proud of my students work and I shared this on social media,\u201d the teacher said. \u201cI do apologize to parents, students and community members for having done that.\u201d\n\nThe cards were delivered to Abu-Jamal, who was said to have been \u201ctouched\u201d by their correspondence. A high school class in Philadelphia also sent notes to him.\n\nAbu-Jamal originally was sentenced to death for the 1981 murder of Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner. After years of appeals, his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment.\n\nThe school board could decide Ms. Zuniga\u2019s fate at its next meeting on May 12.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A suspended New Jersey teacher has apologized for instructing her third-graders to write get-well cards to former Black Panther and convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal in prison.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A suspended New Jersey teacher has apologized for instructing her third-graders to write get-well cards to former Black Panther and convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal in prison.", "title": "Marylin Zuniga apologizes for students\u2019 get-well cards to Mumia Abu-Jamal", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/16/teacher-apologizes-students-get-well-cards-mumia-a/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/10/Abu_Jamal-Teacher_Suspended.JPEG-07eee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/10/Abu_Jamal-Teacher_Suspended.JPEG-07eee.jpg", "description": "A suspended New Jersey teacher has apologized for instructing her third-graders to write get-well cards to former Black Panther and convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal in prison.", "card": "summary", "title": "Marylin Zuniga apologizes for students\u2019 get-well cards to Mumia"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Education, Marylin Zuniga, Mumia Abu Jamal, Board Of Education"}, "article_summary": "Marylin Zuniga told the school board in Orange that she doesn\u2019t believe the episode justifies her termination.\nThe school board could decide Ms. Zuniga\u2019s fate at its next meeting on May 12.\nA suspended New Jersey teacher has apologized for instructing her third-graders to write get-well cards to former Black Panther and convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal in prison.\nThe school district suspended Ms. Zuniga, a first-year teacher, with pay after she had the children send get-well cards to Abu-Jamal, who was recovering in prison from diabetes complications.\n\u201cI do apologize to parents, students and community members for having done that.\u201dThe cards were delivered to Abu-Jamal, who was said to have been \u201ctouched\u201d by their correspondence."}
