× DeflateGate will follow Patriots’ Tom Brady to New Orleans this weekend

NEW ORLEANS (WGNO) — When Patriots quarterback Tom Brady enters the Mercedes Benz Superdome this weekend, he probably won’t escape his off season controversy.

DeflateGateHats.com will bring its company president to New Orleans for the game. According to the website, its deflated football hats made their debut just days ago when Brady appeared in court to fight his four game suspension in the controversy. The company also sells DeflateGate t-shirts.

According to the company, football fans will not forget the Patriots use of under inflated footballs in the AFC championship game last winter. It claims that football fans will also remember the tuck rule and spygate controversies surround the team.
