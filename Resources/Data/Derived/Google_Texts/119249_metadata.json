Still to come are votes on a $281 billion highway funding deal, a bill to rewrite the No Child Left Behind education law and a spending bill to fund the government in fiscal year 2016.\n\nAlso on the to-do list is approval of certain tax breaks known as \u201cextenders\u201d and the renewal of health care programs for workers who responded to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThe Senate could vote on repealing Obamacare as early as Thursday. Republican leaders introduced language Tuesday that overcomes some procedural hiccups and papers over internal feuds.\n\nWith those hurdles behind them, Republican leaders say they are confident they can muster the 51 votes needed to pass the bill under fast-track budget rules. It will go back to the House for final approval before heading to Mr. Obama \u2014 the first repeal to make it to the president\u2019s desk.\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s got to give,\u201d said Sen. John Thune, South Dakota Republican. \u201cWe need a better approach.\u201d\n\nWith so much to do, Democrats fumed over Republican efforts to gut Obamacare and to defund Planned Parenthood in retaliation for videos that showed organization officials haggling over fees for body parts from aborted fetuses.\n\nThe practice is legal as long as it\u2019s not for profit, though Planned Parenthood has since said it will no longer accept even the handling fees that were being negotiated. Republicans have said the organization should forfeit the approximately $500 million a year it takes in taxpayer funding.\n\nDemocrats said the debate over stripping funding from Planned Parenthood was particularly ill-timed after a gunman killed three people at one of the organization\u2019s clinics in Colorado last week.\n\nThey also said it was the wrong time to abandon Obamacare.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows this bill won\u2019t become law,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat. He added that Obamacare has cut the uninsured rate, particularly in Mr. McConnell\u2019s home state.\n\nThe Obamacare feuding contrasts with bipartisan agreements on other issues, such as the education bill Monday and the transportation bill Tuesday.\n\nLeaders on either side of the Capitol said they are confident the parties can agree on a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending deal to fund basic government options for a year rather than careen into a second government shutdown in three years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a lot further along than most people realize,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, Oklahoma Republican.\n\nThe sticking point to the spending bill is a set of policy add-ons, or \u201criders,\u201d that both sides want to attach to the sprawling bill. Dozens of Republicans, for instance, want to block Mr. Obama\u2019s plans to accept 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next year.\n\n\u201cWe obviously have difference of opinions on all of these big issues. Those negotiations are ongoing right now,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican.\n\nThe House has passed its version of the Obamacare repeal but will have to revisit the legislation after the Senate votes.\n\nThat\u2019s because the Senate is adding language that phases out the law\u2019s expansion of Medicaid in select states, smoothing the way for Republicans to offer a full Obamacare replacement in 2017. The move is an attempt to win over a trio of Republican lawmakers who said the initial House bill hadn\u2019t gone far enough.\n\nRepublicans are using a process known as \u201cbudget reconciliation,\u201d which allows them to pass the bill with a simple majority so long as it meets arcane Senate rules.\n\nRepublicans see it as a test run for 2017, when they could scrap the law for good with a Republican president and a slim Senate majority.\n\nMr. Obama has vowed a veto this year, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said it\u2019s worth making him go through the process because the president will have to grapple with the way the law is performing. Mr. McConnell cited rising premiums and Americans who lost their doctors or preferred health care plans because of the 2010 overhaul.\n\n\u201cWhen the president picks up his pen, he\u2019ll have a real choice to make,\u201d Mr. McConnell said. \u201cHe may well decide to stick to his rhetoric that the law is working better than even he intended and veto the bill. But he should instead decide to finally stand with a middle class that\u2019s suffered enough from this failed law and sign it. We\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThe bill repeals Obamacare\u2019s mandates, including the one requiring most Americans to hold insurance, and its taxes on medical device sales and generous employer-sponsored plans.\n\nIt also defunds Planned Parenthood in response to outrage over undercover videos about its abortion practices.\n\nRepublican leaders kept the defunding measure in the bill despite reservations from some centrists, who say the group offers an array of women\u2019s health care services besides abortion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working very closely to try to come up with a consensus piece of legislation,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn, Texas Republican. \u201cI believe we have, and I believe it can pass with at least 51 votes, but hopefully more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Republicans put themselves on track to pass a long-sought bill this week to dismantle Obamacare and strip funding from Planned Parenthood for one year, finalizing a measure Tuesday that will put a major repeal of the Affordable Care Act on President Obama's desk for the first time.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/1/mitch-mcconnell-obamacare-repeal-bill-near/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Senate Republicans put themselves on track to pass a long-sought bill this week to dismantle Obamacare and strip funding from Planned Parenthood for one year, finalizing a measure Tuesday that will put a major repeal of the Affordable Care Act on President Obama\u2019s desk for the first time.", "title": "Mitch McConnell: Obamacare repeal bill is near"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Senate Republicans put themselves on track to pass a long-sought bill this week to dismantle Obamacare and strip funding from Planned Parenthood for one year, finalizing a measure Tuesday that will pu", "card": "summary", "title": "Mitch McConnell: Obamacare repeal bill is near"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Senate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd385d\"", "article_summary": "The repeal bill is part of a flurry of year-end activity as Congress tries to clear the decks.\nThe House has passed its version of the Obamacare repeal but will have to revisit the legislation after the Senate votes.\nThe Obamacare feuding contrasts with bipartisan agreements on other issues, such as the education bill Monday and the transportation bill Tuesday.\nIt also defunds Planned Parenthood in response to outrage over undercover videos about its abortion practices.\nDemocrats said the debate over stripping funding from Planned Parenthood was particularly ill-timed after a gunman killed three people at one of the organization\u2019s clinics in Colorado last week."}
