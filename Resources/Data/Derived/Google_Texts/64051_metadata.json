It certainly is in New York City. With federal dollars, the budget is $60 billion for Medicaid alone. In terms of the state budget, it\u2019s roughly equal to the $25 billion spent on school aid. It\u2019s a huge part of the state budget. And the state is probably more responsible for health care than any other sector. It creates health care policy and is the purchaser of health care, through Medicaid, for one out of four New Yorkers.\n\nHealth care has so many sectors, among them hospitals, providers, insurers, Medicaid and social services. Is one on your economic watch list for 2016?\n\nWe\u2019re in a period of tremendous disruption in health care. We are moving from a hospital-centric model to providing care in the community and coordinating care among providers. Because we are in a time of transition, the state is providing money to a number of hospitals.\n\nLet's take insurers. What are the touch points in 2016?\n\nHealth Republic\u2019s failure really was a wake-up call. Thirteen of 23 co-ops created under the Affordable Care Act failed. We want to make sure we understand why.\n\nWhat will be the lingering impact of Health Republic's failure\u2014both \u00adfinancially and from a policy perspective\u2014in 2016?\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell what the financial impact of Health Republic will be. From a policy perspective, we will really examine what \u00addecisions were made by the management of Health Republic and what we can learn.\n\nDoes consolidation\u2014both among insurers and hospitals\u2014worry you?\n\nIt\u2019s something we really have to watch.\n\nPAUL FRANCIS WHO HE IS New York state\u2019s deputy secretary\n\nfor health and human services\n\nAGE 61\n\nBORN Santa Monica, Calif.; raised in Chappaqua, N.Y.\n\nEDUCATION Yale College; J.D., New York University School of Law\n\nBONA FIDES A former CFO of Ann Taylor and Priceline.com, Francis served as director of state operations under Gov. David Paterson and director of agency redesign under Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\n\nThe five big national insurers are merging to three. New York is fortunate that it has a more robust nonprofit sector than most markets. But there also is consolidation in the hospital industry. We have to balance the positive effects; it can reduce costs if it is done well. At the same time, it can create risk if there is too much consolidation.\n\nUnder the pressure of several trends, hospitals are closing, but they are, of course, big economic drivers. Will we see closures next year?\n\nI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see any closures next year. There is $700 million in funding for a transition. We\u2019ll see over a multiyear period. There will be some transition, but not hospitals disappearing in 2016.\n\nBrooklyn's health care market is a trouble spot that will take lots of money and politics to fix. What's ahead there next year?\n\nYou will begin to see the direction of the transformation and concrete progress. Something as big as the transition of health care for 3 million people won\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nWhat's your worst fear about 2016?\n\nA great question. To a surprising degree, there\u2019s consensus on how to improve health care based on empirical evidence. That\u2019s very different from income inequality or education. I really do believe health care is an area where we will show a lot of positive changes.\n\nThat didn't answer the question.\n\nRight. When in doubt, say \u201ccybersecurity.\u201d\n\nSign Up for Health Pulse Brought to you by Crain's New York Business, Health Pulse is a subscription-only website focused on the business of health care.
