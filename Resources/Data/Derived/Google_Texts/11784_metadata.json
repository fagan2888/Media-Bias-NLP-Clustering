Because of that, there\u2019s often some unsettling cognitive dissonance \u2014 \u201cThat\u2019s not how I envisioned the Hab!\u201d (the astronauts\u2019 dwelling on Mars). But the movie smartly hewed closely to the book, and was \u2014 trust me, I did the math \u2014 89 percent as good.\n\nIt\u2019s the story of Mark Watney, abandoned on Mars after his crew members mistakenly conclude that he died during a violent storm that forced them to cancel their exploratory mission and leave the planet (this much is in the trailer; I\u2019m no spoiler). It has thus been called \u201cRobinson Crusoe on Mars,\u201d but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s such an apt comparison.\n\nUnlike Crusoe, Watney is the only person on the planet on which he finds himself. (Crusoe remains on Earth, where he eventually befriends an escaped captive, whom he calls \u201cFriday.\u201d) In this sense, Weir sets himself a huge storytelling challenge: how to engage readers when there\u2019s literally no one for Watney to fall in love with or fight against. The usual sources of conflict and character development are 35 million miles away (and that\u2019s when Mars and Earth are closest to each other).\n\nTrue, folks back on Earth are trying to help him get home and the rest of his crew plays an important part in the action, but the core of the movie is Watney alone on the planet.\n\n[Author of \u2018The Martian': There could be life on Mars. Of course we should go look for it.]\n\nWhat makes the book and movie so uniquely interesting is how the story meets that literary challenge. In fact, there\u2019s an extremely compelling relationship at the heart of the story: the one between Watney and survival.\n\nWatney\u2019s relationship with survival completely absorbs him (as well as us), tapping his deep knowledge as a scientist, astronaut and botanist (\u201cthe greatest botanist on this planet!\u201d as he tells himself). His challenge is existential, sure, but it\u2019s mainly practical. How do you grow plants on Mars with lame soil and no water? How do you adapt machinery to do stuff it wasn\u2019t intended for? How do you communicate with Earth?\n\nMost importantly, how do you not look out at the barren planet on which you\u2019re the only living thing and not go crazy and give up? The answer, which I found to be Zen, is that you recognize that it is the path that matters. You cannot control your ultimate fate. You often don\u2019t get to choose your path (or, in Zen, your \u201ckarma\u201d). All you can do is put your best effort into solving the problems life throws your way. That is a good day\u2019s work; perhaps, it\u2019s the only really good day\u2019s work.\n\nFor most of us, getting left behind on Mars won\u2019t be our challenge. But many face challenges much more existential because they\u2019re real: keeping your children alive when bombs are hitting hospitals, murderous gang members are lurking in housing projects, seriously disturbed, dangerous individuals are able to purchase arsenals of weapons, the climate is warming because of carbon emissions.\n\n\"The Martian\" is about an astronaut who gets stranded on Mars and has to figure out how to survive before NASA can rescue him. How realistic is the movie's depiction of what life would be like on Mars? The Post's Rachel Feltman fact-checks the movie trailer. (Rachel Feltman and Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)\n\nI know, movies like this are a healthy bit of escapism from all that depressing stuff, and I apologize for the buzzkill. But I go there only because there\u2019s an important message in \u201cThe Martian\u201d that we need to apply to our politics: You can\u2019t solve problems without facts.\n\nIf Watney survived (you\u2019ll have to find out for yourself), he did so by applying scientific knowledge about how things work. The analogy for public policy is that denying climate change or trying 50-plus times to repeal Obamacare or refusing to take any action on gun control are not just the actions of dysfunctional ideologues or bought-and-paid-for politicians. They are existential threats, just as dangerous to us as not applying hard science to his problem would have been for Watney.\n\nUnlike Watney, we don\u2019t always see that, because the result of our dysfunction and fact denial is a slow burn while he\u2019s racing against a clock. (If he runs out of food before he can get out of there, he\u2019s dead.) But look around. Read Peter Wehner\u2019s analysis of the impossibility of repealing Obamacare and the \u201cfury\u201d that has resulted among the hard right, which views Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a possible savior. (\u201cMaybe this loudmouthed boor can actually accomplish something.\u201d) Listen to President Obama finally putting aside \u201cour thoughts and prayers\u201d on gun violence and turning it back to the rest of us to do something about it by holding do-nothing politicians accountable. Note the inequality-induced persistent and growing gap between productivity growth and median pay.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s harder to solve income inequality and gun violence than to make water on Mars by burning hydrazine to separate hydrogen and oxygen (which, to be fair, isn\u2019t easy either). And yes, reality will always be way more complicated than movies. But all I\u2019m saying is this:\n\nThere\u2019s an uplifting feeling throughout \u201cThe Martian\u201d that\u2019s too often absent in the rest of public life, and it\u2019s not just because Matt Damon is so appealing. It\u2019s because we are wired to recognize the truth of what I\u2019m trying to say here: Using our minds to solve problems is how we survive and prosper.\n\nWhile a minority of Americans \u2014 often those who make money off it \u2014 applauds dysfunction, climate denial, the lack of common-sense gun legislation, government shutdowns, the threat to default on the debt, and so on, most of us are discomforted by it. For most, that takes the shape of an eye roll or head shake \u2014 \u201cthere they go again.\u201d\n\nOne lesson of \u201cThe Martian\u201d is that we should respect, nurture and stoke that discontent. It is the natural, rational reaction to bad logic and the elevation of falsehood. And at the end of the \u201csol\u201d (that\u2019s a day on Mars), like that of Mark Watney, our survival depends on it.\n\nUpdate: I fixed an inappropriate, factually-inaccurate, and sweeping reference to mental illness and violence.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yes, the new movie \"The Martian\" is plenty entertaining.
