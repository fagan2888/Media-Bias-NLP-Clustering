BACK STORY

Photo

Do you know what country is bordered by Thailand and Cambodia? How about where Caribbean Hindustani is spoken?

Or which nation Hiva Oa, one of the main islands in the Marquesas Islands, belongs to?

Those were some of the recent questions in the National Geographic Bee.

The annual competition for fourth to eighth graders, which tests their knowledge of the globe, begins its national finals and championship round today in Washington.

It continues for three days, and will be televised Friday on the National Geographic Channel.

First prize is a $50,000 college scholarship, a lifetime membership in the National Geographic Society and a trip to the Galápagos Islands. (Do you know where they are?)

The bee began in 1989, after a Gallup survey in 1988 found that 20 percent of 18- to 24-years-olds in the U.S. could not find their own country on a map unless it was labeled.

It’s not as old or as famous as the Scripps National Spelling Bee, which started in 1925.

That’s probably O.K. These geography whiz kids have the whole world to worry about, after all.

(Answers: Laos; Trinidad and Tobago; and France. The Galápagos are off the northwest coast of South America, and belong to Ecuador.)
