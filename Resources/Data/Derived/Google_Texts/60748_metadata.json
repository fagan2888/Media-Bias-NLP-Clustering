Biggest ever. World record.\n\nThese were the terms used by Sotheby\u2019s to describe the results of its Magnificent Jewels and Jadeite auction in Hong Kong on Monday, part of a five-day autumn sale marking the firm\u2019s 40 years of operation in Asia.\n\nThe jewelry auction\u2019s top lot was a large oval diamond that generated 238.7 million Hong Kong dollars (US$30.8 million), a new price record for a white diamond at auction. The figure fell within its pre-sale estimate of HK$220 million to HK$280 million.\n\nWeighing more than 118 carats, the flawless D-color stone was sold to an Asian private buyer. According to the auction house, it is the largest diamond ever to have been sold at auction.\n\nIn China, investors prefer diamonds that are perfect \u2014 that is, D-flawless \u2014 at the expense of size, Sotheby\u2019s specialist Lisa Hubbard told the Journal earlier this year. By contrast, buyers in other countries will accept slightly flawed stones, favoring size over perfection.\n\nSotheby\u2019s jewelry sale realized a total of HK$744.7 million (more than US$95 million), the highest takings for an auction of jewelry in the region. Of the 331 lots offered, 247 were sold, while 84 were bought in.\n\nAlso on Monday, the auction house held a robust sale of Chinese fine paintings, realizing HK$406 million, more than twice the high estimate of HK$170 million. While the sale set no new records, it saw most of its 359 lots sold, with 17 items bought in. The top lot: Zhang Daqian\u2019s \u201cSpring Dawns Upon the Colorful Hills,\u201d which fetched HK$34.9 million, far above its high estimate of HK$5 million.\n\nSotheby\u2019s autumn sales conclude today.\n\nFollow WSJ Asia on Twitter @WSJAsia.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Sotheby's on Monday sold a 118-carat oval diamond to an Asian private buyer for $30.8 million, a new price record for a white diamond at auction.", "title": "118-Carat Diamond Fetches Record $30.8 Million", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2013/10/08/118-carat-diamond-fetches-30-8-million-at-sothebys/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZD039_1001CS_G_20131002025735.jpg"}, "site": "WSJAsia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Life and Style", "article.headline": "118-Carat Diamond Fetches Record $30.8 Million", "description": "Sotheby's on Monday sold a 118-carat oval diamond to an Asian private buyer for $30.8 million, a new price record for a white diamond at auction.", "article_section": "Life and Style", "author": "Lara Day", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Scene Asia Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Scene Asia", "article.summary": "Sotheby's on Monday sold a 118-carat oval diamond to an Asian private buyer for $30.8 million, a new price record for a white diamond at auction.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-08T10:01:41-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2013/10/08/118-carat-diamond-fetches-30-8-million-at-sothebys/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SJB-12462", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Life and Style", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Sotheby's on Monday sold a 118-carat oval diamond to an Asian private buyer for $30.8 million, a new price record for a white diamond at auction.", "title": "118-Carat Diamond Fetches Record $30.8 Million", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2013/10/08/118-carat-diamond-fetches-30-8-million-at-sothebys/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-ZD039_1001CS_G_20131002025735.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Scene Asia", "article.id": "BL-SJB-12462", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-08T11:15:20-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8f0\"", "article_summary": "Sotheby\u2019s Sotheby\u2019s sold a 118-carat oval diamond to an Asian private buyer for $30.8 million, a new price record for a white diamond at auction.\nThe jewelry auction\u2019s top lot was a large oval diamond that generated 238.7 million Hong Kong dollars (US$30.8 million), a new price record for a white diamond at auction.\nSotheby\u2019s jewelry sale realized a total of HK$744.7 million (more than US$95 million), the highest takings for an auction of jewelry in the region.\nIn China, investors prefer diamonds that are perfect \u2014 that is, D-flawless \u2014 at the expense of size, Sotheby\u2019s specialist Lisa Hubbard told the Journal earlier this year.\nThe figure fell within its pre-sale estimate of HK$220 million to HK$280 million."}
