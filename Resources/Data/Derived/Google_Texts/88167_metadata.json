But how do you perceive race if you can\u2019t actually see it? In an attempt to answer this thought-provoking question, a recent study found that for those who can\u2019t see, race plays a much less important role in their impression of others.\n\nFor the study, presented at the 110th Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association (ASA), Asia Friedman, a sociologist at the University of Delaware, interviewed 25 blind individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds on their perceptions of race. The interviews were either done face-to-face or over the phone, and took place in a location of the respondent\u2019s choice, most often their home or office. Respondents were categorized into two subgroups: those who had been blind since birth or early childhood (age 7 or earlier) and those who became blind as adults. Half of the respondents identified as white, half as black, one identified as Asian, and one as multiracial (black and white).\n\nAll of the respondents, regardless of when they became blind, reported using non-visual cues to help them group others into racial categories. Voice and name were reported as the most common non-visual racial cues, and a few of them reported using other senses, such as smell, to inform their categorization.\n\nUnbiased First Impressions\n\nEarly on in the investigation, Friedman learned that without any interaction, blind individuals have absolutely no idea about the race of other people. Even when interacting, it takes time for the blind to determine the race of another person; 10 of the 25 respondents indicated that most of the time they are unable to attribute any race to new individuals. For the blind, \u201cnot knowing\u201d the race of the people around them is an expected and normal part of life. Many of the respondents expressed that their delayed conceptualization of other people's race helped them to make unbiased first impressions.\n\n\u201cI think because I can\u2019t see what that person is, until I know what they have done and how they have treated me and how they behave, then I have the ability to base my thoughts and actions and perceptions of them on something other than skin color,\u201d explained Anna, a study participant who was white and had been blind since birth.\n\nAlthough race was largely unknown during first encounters, many respondents expressed desires to know and assign a race to others after repeated interactions. This would suggest that, even without sight, race played an important role in understanding who a person was. Results showed that many of the respondents who became blind in adulthood could still visualize other people\u2019s races in their minds.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been this way all my life so I\u2019ve known. \u2026 I grew up, I could see, and I still picture it, so it\u2019s a visual thing, it\u2019s always a visual thing in my mind\u2019s eye,\u201d explained Abigail, a black woman who lost her sight as an adult.\n\nStereotypes Still Exist\n\nAlthough the blind-from-birth respondents understood the concept of race, they did not experience it visually in any way. Rather, for these individuals, race seemed to be more ambiguous. One white respondent who had been blind from birth explained how, as a child, she purposely touched the arm of a camp counselor to see if it felt any different, only to find that it \u201cfelt like anybody else\u2019s skin.\u201d However, as Friedman noted, although the respondent could not see racial features, her use of the word \u201cdifferent\u201d to mean \u201cblack\u201d indicated that to her, whiteness is \u201cfunctioning as an unmarked norm\u201d or default category. These subconscious racial biases were mentioned in various interviews with blind-from-birth respondents.\n\n\u201cI would say it depends. I mean, for me I might not even know,\u201d Natalie, a white woman who had been blind from birth explained in her interview. \u201cI might not even know and it could be that the person who\u2019s \u2018black\u2019 and went to Harvard might sound \u2018white\u2019 and the person with a 10th grade education who\u2019s \u2018white\u2019 might sound \u2018black.\u201d\n\nWhat We Learned\n\nThe study\u2019s results could have important implications for how we think about the social constructions of race in our everyday life, Friedman wrote. For example, nearly all of the blind respondents commented on the ambiguity of race and explained they were rarely certain about a person's race. Although being blind does not completely erase racial constructs, it does make them unclear, and most blind individuals have to actively work to decipher the race of others. This highlights how the idea of race is almost entirely based on visual perceptions. Take away the eyes and race becomes vague, abstract, and difficult to determine, suggesting that ultimately race is more closely tied to how we look than any other characteristic.\n\nThe fact that blind-from-birth respondents still made racially biased comments also shows that racism, or the idea that individuals possess superior or inferior characteristics specific to their race, is far less based on what we see and more closely based on what we learn from others.\n\nSource: A Friedman.There are two people at work that I\u2019m fairly certain are black: Insights from blind race attribution.
