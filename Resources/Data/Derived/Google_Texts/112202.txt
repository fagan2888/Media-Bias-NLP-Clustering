From the "not-the-kind-of-coverage-you-want" files:

CNN provided heavy coverage last week of the troubled introduction of the website tied to the Affordable Care Act. The result was the lowest weekly ratings for CNN in more than a year.

The cable news network suffered its lowest Monday-Friday primetime average in over a year for the week of Oct. 28 to Nov. 1. Averaging just 385,000 viewers and 95,000 adults 25-54, both key measurements marked CNN's worst showings since the 20-year record lows last August when the network suffered particularly against coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.

It was CNN's lowest ratings in primetime since August 6, 2012, before Jeff Zucker took over the network...although CNN topped MSNBC for the second quarter of this year, the network has struggled of late, finishing third in both primetime and total day for October.

If CNN can't win the ratings during a breaking crisis, it really is in trouble.
