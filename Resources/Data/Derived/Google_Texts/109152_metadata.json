Keith English (District 68), Ben Harris (District 118), and Zech Hockersmith (District 120). No federal endorsements for Democratic candidates were made. Senate District 10 and House District 41 are the only races to have endorsements for both candidates.\n\nOther than encouraging their members to support the endorsed candidates at the polls, the group has several fall events, including a Forty Days for Life rally and vigil in Columbia on Tuesday, a pro-life forum at Missouri Western State University on Thursday, and the 27th National Life Chain in October\u2013 which organizes people standing beside main streets.\n\nThe group is also messaging aggressively against Obamacare, releasing information about a recent GAO report confirming abortion coverage in the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. \u2013 Missouri Right to Life Political Action Committee released their endorsements for the general election this weekend, less than 10 days after pro-life group\u2019s victories at veto session to triple the mandatory waiting period for abortions to 72 hours and to increase tax credits for pregnancy resource centers.
