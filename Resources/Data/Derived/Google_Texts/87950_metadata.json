Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative stopped selling a popular plan. And Network Health, in which Froedtert Health has a 50% stake, began selling plans in the Milwaukee area.\n\nAs a result, customers often must move to new plans each year.\n\nAll this had to be done between Nov. 1 and Dec. 15 for people to have coverage on Jan. 1.\n\n\"The time frame is too limited,\" Catlin said.\n\nMcArdle also said the open-enrollment period is too tight, particularly given that the rates are not public and set until Nov. 1.\n\nThe brokers also reported problems with some UnitedHealthcare customers' getting their insurance cards.\n\n\"We have people who bought plans in December who still have not received ID cards,\" McArdle said. \"It's very frustrating.\"\n\nFor a company that normally does so many things right, he said, the effort to limit the sale of individual policies has been poorly handled.\n\n\"It left a lot of individuals in a lurch,\" McArdle said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "UnitedHealthcare puts up obstacles to sale of some Obamacare policies", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/unitedhealthcare-puts-up-obstacles-to-sale-of-some-obamacare-policies-b99656305z1-366125291.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Brokers say health insurer takes steps to limit number of health plans sold on federal marketplace.", "title": "Insurer puts up obstacles to sale of some Obamacare policies"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "Brokers say health insurer takes steps to limit number of health plans sold on federal marketplace.", "card": "summary", "title": "UnitedHealthcare puts up obstacles to sale of some Obamacare policies"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "UnitedHealthcare, which began selling health plans for 2015 on the marketplaces in Wisconsin, had committed to selling plans for 2016 and could not pull out of the market.\nThe potential move applied only to health plans sold to individuals and their families.\n\"It added complications that nobody needed during a compressed enrollment period,\" McArdle said.\nPeople also have the option of buying plans sold off the marketplace.\nAnd Network Health, in which Froedtert Health has a 50% stake, began selling plans in the Milwaukee area."}
