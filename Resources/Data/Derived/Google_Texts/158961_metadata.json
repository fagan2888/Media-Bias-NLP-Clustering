They all sought to overcome an injustice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we, too,\u201d he claimed, \u201care seeking to right injustices that are holding our country back.\u201d\n\nThe Koch network\u2019s \u201caim,\u201d the billionaire libertarian claimed, is \u201cto remove the shackles preventing all Americans, especially the disadvantaged, from pursuing their dreams\u201d and to create a \u201ctruly free society.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we can just change the trajectory of this country from where it is headed \u2014 one of control, dependency, hopelessness and poverty \u2014 to one that moves toward this free society, the innovation, the improvement in the standard of living, the helping of the poor uplift themselves will be staggering,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cHistory demonstrates that when the American people get motivated by an issue of justice, that they believe is just, extraordinary things can be accomplished, and that\u2019s the message for all of us,\u201d Koch argued, imploring the wealthy donors to \u201cstand with us to help save our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we cannot unite the majority of Americans behind the vision, then we\u2019re done for,\u201d he explained further. \u201cSo that to me has to be our number one objective. But to do so, we\u2019ve got to do a much better job of understanding what matters most to people, and then to demonstrate that a free society gives them the best opportunity of achieving that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP megadonor says the conservative movement is in \"a life-or-death struggle for our country\"", "title": "Charles Koch\u2019s Messianic delusions: Industrialist says only conservative billionaires can save us", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The GOP megadonor says the conservative movement is in \"a life-or-death struggle for our country\"", "title": "Charles Koch\u2019s Messianic delusions: Industrialist says only conservative billionaires can save us", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/08/03/charles_kochs_messianic_delusions_industrialist_says_only_conservative_billionaires_can_save_us/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/gop-2016-koch-brothers.jpeg-e1438621825249.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The GOP megadonor says the conservative movement is in \"a life-or-death struggle for our country\"", "title": "Charles Koch\u2019s Messianic delusions: Industrialist says only conservative billionaires can save us", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/gop-2016-koch-brothers.jpeg-e1438621825249.jpg", "creator": "@@SophiaTesfaye", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sophia Tesfaye", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Campaign Finance, Charles Koch, GOP, Koch Brothers, Koch network, Super PACs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But to do so, we\u2019ve got to do a much better job of understanding what matters most to people, and then to demonstrate that a free society gives them the best opportunity of achieving that.\u201d\n\u201cAll of these struck a moral chord with the American people.\n\u201cSo that to me has to be our number one objective.\nIn particular, Koch cited his network\u2019s fight for criminal-justice reform as an issue that has gained traction amongst mainstream Republicans because it \u201cstrikes the same chord as past successful freedom movements.\u201d\u201cLook at the American revolution, the anti-slavery movement, the women\u2019s suffrage movement, the civil rights movement,\u201d Koch instructed the gathered conservatives.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, Campaign Finance, Charles Koch, GOP, Koch Brothers, Koch network, Super PACs, Elections News, News, Politics NewsBillionaire Charles Koch argued that conservatives are part of a \u201ca life-or-death struggle for our country,\u201d and that if the political network spearheaded by himself and his brother David fails to convince a \u201cmajority of Americans behind the vision, then we\u2019re done for,\u201d the Associated Press reports."}
