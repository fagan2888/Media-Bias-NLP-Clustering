Putting aside the question of Santa, Sullivan focuses his attention on the Jesus question, for which their are \u201cverifiable facts\u201d to review as Kelly suggested. He writes:\n\nNow it\u2019s clear this was an ad lib, not really thought through, so we should cut Kelly some slack. But she\u2019s wrong on two levels \u2013 wrong because Jesus was not a Northern European white person, but a Middle Eastern Jew. And as a Middle Eastern Jew under the Roman empire, Jesus was at the bottom of the heap in the power-structure of his time. And that\u2019s the point. The Messiah came from the lowest rung, not the highest. The comfort that white people feel when they are a majority in a democratic society is about as far away from Jesus\u2019 experience of the world as it is possible to get.\n\nAfter explaining that Kelly\u2019s also \u201cwrong in even considering the color of Jesus\u2019 skin\u201d because of the Gospels\u2019 tenet that \u201cyou are all one in Christ Jesus,\u201d he lays down the hammer on the entire Fox operation:\n\nWhen you absorb the constant racial undertones on Fox, and its constant worship of the god of money, when you absorb their long list of fears about the \u201cother\u201d, whether immigrants or gays or the poor, when you recall their glee at the torture of human beings, or their passion for the death penalty, you can\u2019t help but wonder if they are not one of the most powerful forces against Christianity in our culture. They have competitors out there, but Roger Ailes is never satisfied with being Number Two, is he?\n\nWith his pair of columns on Limbaugh and Fox, Sullivan has asserted himself as a strong voice against the type of Christian conservative indignation that created the War on Christmas in the first place.\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last week, The Dish's Andrew Sullivan wrote that Rush Limbaugh \"knows nothing about Christianity.\" Now, in a new column, he's leveled an ever harsher judgement", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AS.jpg", "title": "Andrew Sullivan Calls Fox \u2018One of the Most Powerful Forces Against Christianity\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "Last week, The Dish's Andrew Sullivan wrote that Rush Limbaugh \"knows nothing about Christianity.\" Now, in a new column, he's leveled an ever harsher judgement against Fox News, calling the network \"anti-Christian.\"", "title": "Andrew Sullivan Calls Fox 'One of the Most Powerful Forces Against Christianity'", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/AS.jpg", "creator": "@themattwilstein", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2013-12-13T13:57:42+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9df9\"", "article_summary": "Putting aside the question of Santa, Sullivan focuses his attention on the Jesus question, for which their are \u201cverifiable facts\u201d to review as Kelly suggested.\nWith his pair of columns on Limbaugh and Fox, Sullivan has asserted himself as a strong voice against the type of Christian conservative indignation that created the War on Christmas in the first place.\nBut she\u2019s wrong on two levels \u2013 wrong because Jesus was not a Northern European white person, but a Middle Eastern Jew.\nHe writes:Now it\u2019s clear this was an ad lib, not really thought through, so we should cut Kelly some slack.\nAnd as a Middle Eastern Jew under the Roman empire, Jesus was at the bottom of the heap in the power-structure of his time."}
