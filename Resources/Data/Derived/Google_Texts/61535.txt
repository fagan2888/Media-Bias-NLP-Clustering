With a high-level new appointment, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has gone “all in” on efforts to legitimize anti-LGBT discrimination under the guise of religious freedom, according to LGBT advocacy group Equality Texas.

Paxton’s office announced Jeff Mateer’s new role as first assistant attorney general on Wednesday. Mateer comes from Plano’s First Liberty (previously the Liberty Institute), where he spent six years as general counsel. First Liberty bills itself as the nation’s largest legal organization dedicated to protecting religious freedom. Mateer will replace Chip Roy, who has joined a Super PAC supporting the presidential campaign of his former boss, Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

First Liberty frequently represents individuals and businesses accused of anti-LGBT discrimination in high-profile cases, including an Oregon bakery that was fined by the state for refusing to provide a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.
