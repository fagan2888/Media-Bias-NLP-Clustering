I crossed my fingers, and got through the hiatus without a scratch. That was in 2012.\n\nThis coverage, through the California Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan at $265 a month, took me through June 2013. Then it expired, and I had to switch to yet another temporary program, the federally run Pre-Existing Condition Plan, at $287 a month.\n\nAnd finally, it was Jan. 2014, and I could find a health plan through Covered California, the state\u2019s online insurance marketplace.\n\nAfter signing up for a Blue Shield of California plan, I received a letter the other day telling me that I could have extended the federally run Pre-Existing Condition Plan through January \u201cto prevent a lapse in coverage.\u201d Too late: I was already covered and therefore ineligible for an extension.\n\nI could have saved $143 by sticking with the federal plan for another month instead of joining Blue Shield. But I might as well get used to it. Yes, I\u2019m now paying $430 a month instead of the $265 or $287 I paid in 2012 and 2013, but it still beats the days of paltry coverage for a premium with a price tag in the $700s.\n\nThe transition has not been entirely smooth, though. For instance, after I used the California exchange to enroll in my new plan, I worried over the non-arrival of a bill from Blue Shield that would acknowledge my coverage and provide my policy number. It finally came at nearly the last minute, urging me to pay pronto and mentioning a previous bill that had never arrived.\n\nI\u2019m definitely insured now, though. My payment, which I made online, went through, and my insurance ID card showed up in my mailbox. It was two weeks late, since my coverage began on Jan. 1. But it\u2019s here, I\u2019m covered, and I\u2019m glad.\n\nThis story was published jointly with Kaiser Health News. Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
