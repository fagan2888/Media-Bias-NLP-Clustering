(WIVB) \u2014 The Office of the Attorney General wants to know if three local health insurance companies are violating the Affordable Care Act. Most women with private health insurance can get birth control for free. But some companies are still charging their members.\n\nMany women don\u2019t know, you are not supposed to pay any out-of-pocket costs for birth control. The Attorneys General is sending letters to three companies in our area to find out if they are violating these rules.\n\nHealth plans are required to provide a full range of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This should come at no charge to their members. But New York\u2019s Attorney General is sending letters to HealthNow New York in Buffalo, Independent Health in Amherst, Univera Healthcare in Amherst and seven other insurers.\n\nWe reached out to the three local companies: Julie Snyder from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western New York says, \u201cBluecross Blueshield of Western New York is in receipt of yesterday\u2019s correspondence from the New York State Attorney General and as always, we will respond to this inquiry in a timely manner as requested. However, until we have adequately reviewed this inquiry, we cannot comment on the specifics of the inquiry.\u201d\n\nPeter Kates from Univera tells us, \u201cWe have received the letter. We follow the laws- we will comply with the questionnaire in a timely fashion requested by the attorney general.\u201d\n\nFrank Sava from Independent Health says, \u201cWe did receive the notification from the State Attorney General\u2019s Office and we will certainly cooperate with the request for information. We believe we are in full accordance with the women\u2019s preventive services benefit in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe letters ask for responses from the companies about their practices. The responses are due by the end of May.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most women with private health insurance can get birth control for free.
