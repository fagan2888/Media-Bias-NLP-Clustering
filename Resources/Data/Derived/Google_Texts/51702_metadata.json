You might have missed it since Gore no longer has a cable network to show his Jerry Lewis-style telethon for the climate-alarmist set, but instead had to broadcast the whole thing online. Come to think of it, you probably also missed all the other \u201c24 Hours of Reality\u201d programs on his old, low-rated, bore of a network, Current TV.\n\nIn the middle of his latest presentation, Gore mentioned The Heartland Institute and how our research ended up in a draft of some K-12 textbooks the Texas School Board is reviewing. Gore managed to pack in no fewer than 11 errors/lies/falsehoods about Heartland and the Texas School Board\u2019s review of text books in just 35 seconds. Watch it for yourself (and read the breakdown of Gore\u2019s dissembling and ignorance below).\n\n\u2026 the state of Texas has just ordered all of their children to read science text books partly written by a climate denier organization, The Heartland Institute \u2026\n\nThe good news \u2026 is that no one really listens to Al Gore anymore. But we did, and here are his errors/lies/falsehoods, 1-11.\n\n(1) Texas has \u201cordered\u201d nothing. The Texas School Board is merely in the process of reviewing proposed text books, which (2) would not be for all children, but kids in grades 5 and 6 in public schools.\n\n(3) The few passages in these proposed text books that depart from alarmist ideology were not \u201cpartially written\u201d by Heartland. We only found out Heartland was mentioned in the text books after the left-wing activist group the National Center for Science Education (NCSE) raised a stink about it. (Come to think of it, that should be even more troubling to Al Gore and his fellow fear mongers. Heartland didn\u2019t lobby to get a mention in these text books, but was cited organically. Uh oh.)\n\n(4) The text books that caused this \u201ccontroversy\u201d are social studies text books, not science text books.\n\n(5) Heartland is not a \u201cdenier\u201d organization. We have hosted nine International Conferences on Climate Change, at which no one has ever denied the climate is changing. Many scientists, however, question the extent of man\u2019s influence on global temperatures \u2014 and, lately, if we are now about to enter a cooling trend after 18 consecutive years of no atmospheric global warming.\n\n\u2026 so that they will get instruction about falsehoods \u2014 being told what this carbon-polluter-funded denier organization says and it\u2019s just a propaganda exercise.\n\n(6) It is not a \u201cfalsehood\u201d to present the idea that the science is not settled on the causes and effects of climate change. See thousands of citations from the peer-reviewed literature in the NIPCC reports at the Climate Change Reconsidered website.\n\n(7) Heartland is not funded by \u201ccarbon polluters.\u201d We get such a tiny percentage of our overall $6 million annual budget from energy companies it\u2019s hardly worth mentioning \u2026 except to thank them for their support, of course.\n\n(8) The CO2 emissions from power plants and automobiles is not \u201cpollution,\u201d let alone \u201ccarbon pollution,\u201d whatever that is.\n\n(9) Heartland is not a \u201cdenier organization.\u201d See #4.\n\n(10) Informing school-aged children in social studies class that many esteemed scientists disagree with global warming alarmism \u2014 Richard Lindzen, Judith Curry, Alan Carlin, Patrick Michaels, Roy Spencer, and many more \u2014 is not \u201cpropaganda.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so terrible that school children are exposed to that. But here\u2019s the good news that I started to get at \u2026\n\n(11) It is actually excellent that school children might be exposed to the truth about the scientific climate debate \u2014 these books have not yet been approved \u2014 which is vigorous among real scientists who are interested in getting to the truth, not advancing an agenda.\n\nThat\u2019s an impressive streak of misinformation, ignorance, and lies \u2014 even for an ex-politician.\n\nNOTE: Read more about Al Gore and other \u201cMerchants of Smear\u201d in this new Heartland Policy Brief by Russell Cook.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/09/al-gore-mentions-heartland-tells-11-falsehoods-in-just-35-seconds/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Al-Gore-Heartland.png", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Al Gore Mentions Heartland, Tells 11 Falsehoods in Just 35 Seconds"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc15d\"", "article_summary": "(4) The text books that caused this \u201ccontroversy\u201d are social studies text books, not science text books.\nGore managed to pack in no fewer than 11 errors/lies/falsehoods about Heartland and the Texas School Board\u2019s review of text books in just 35 seconds.\n(3) The few passages in these proposed text books that depart from alarmist ideology were not \u201cpartially written\u201d by Heartland.\nNOTE: Read more about Al Gore and other \u201cMerchants of Smear\u201d in this new Heartland Policy Brief by Russell Cook.\nHeartland didn\u2019t lobby to get a mention in these text books, but was cited organically."}
