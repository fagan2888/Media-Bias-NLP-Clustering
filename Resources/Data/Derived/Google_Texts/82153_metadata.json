State Senator Wendy Davis (D) is using that attention to raise millions of dollars for her gubernatorial campaign. As Republicans scramble to avoid a competitive race in a usually deep-red state, a group of conservative activists just launched RedState Women, a political action committee meant to prove \u201cDemocrats don\u2019t corner the market on women.\u201d But the PAC\u2019s plan to win over women closely mirrors the failed strategy used by Mitt Romney and Congressional Republicans in the 2012 election: pretend women don\u2019t care about reproductive rights.\n\nThe group\u2019s first press release says its goal is \u201crevolutionizing the way the Republican Party communicates with women.\u201d To do this, Cari Christman, the new PAC\u2019s executive director, told Politico, they\u2019ll show that the GOP is not just about abortion rights: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more than that. Women have a wide range of interests. We want to make sure we reach them.\u201d\n\nPAC supporter Texas Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick (R) made the same point to Politico: \u201cI respect Wendy Davis, but the Republican Party is not a one-issue party \u2026 for me, being a fiscal conservative, running a household, having to meet a budget, are very important.\u201d Craddick, who accepted a $10,000 contribution in 2012 from notorious rape-defender Clayton Williams Jr., says in the PAC\u2019s first video, \u201cI think women want to vote for women and realize we understand our issues,\u201d because men\u2019s \u201cegos get in the way sometimes.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, RedState Women\u2019s task is ambitious. Republicans all over the country are struggling to dispel their anti-woman image. The GOP is even training candidates how to avoid sexist, offensive language like the infamous \u201clegitimate rape\u201d comments that sank former Rep. Todd Akin\u2019s (R-MO) Senate campaign. In Texas, this challenge is even more pronounced. The Republican-dominated state government in Austin has a reputation for being an old boys\u2019 club, in which female lawmakers are regularly demeaned and marginalized. The state legislature\u2019s passage of a bill to criminalize abortions after 20 weeks and impose harsh regulations on abortion providers further alienated women and catapulted Davis to national prominence. Polling showed that most Texans opposed the measure.\n\nYet instead of address these specific concerns, RedState Women is falling back on a familiar line from the 2012 elections, another time Republicans claimed they were reforming their pitch to female voters.\n\nFacing a significant national gender gap, 24 Republican Congressswoman had launched a GOP Women\u2019s Policy Committee in 2012. Then-Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle (R-NY) explained: \u201cIn homes across the country, women work, raise their children, pay the bills, take care of their homes, pay taxes and contribute in countless ways to the well-being of their communities.\u201d November. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) wrote on a conservative blog, \u201cWe are mothers and grandmothers who want to eliminate the debt burden for the next generation. We are wives who run the family budgets, fill up the gas tanks, and make our families\u2019 health care decisions. \u201d\n\nWeeks later, Romney launched a \u201cWomen for Mitt\u201d coalition. In the announcement press release, Romney supporter and former The Real World: San Francisco cast-member Rachel Campos-Duffy explained, \u201cAs a mother of six, I\u2019m proud to stand with Mitt in his efforts to restore common sense and fiscal responsibility in Washington.\u201d Rep. McMorris Rodgers added that, \u201cSince President Obama can\u2019t run on his record, he\u2019s resorted to scare tactics to distract and divide women \u2013 namely, the so-called \u2018War on Women,\u2019 which is a total myth.\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric did not win over women, who overwhelmingly voted for Democrats in the November 2012 elections. President Obama beat Romney 56 to 44 among women \u2014 a record gender-gap, according to Gallup. Women favored Democratic House and Senate candidates nationally by a similar margins.\n\nDespite this failure, the Republican National Committee\u2019s post-election autopsy report endorsed a similar strategy for future GOP candidates: \u201cFemale voters want to hear the facts; many of them run the economies of their homes and understand economics better than the men in their families. But they are also the caregivers for their families. Women need to hear what our motive is \u2014 why it is that we want to create a better future for our families and how our policies will affect the lives of their loved ones.\u201d\n\nJust last month, Katie Packer Gage, a former Romney strategist who is now advising Republican candidates on outreach to women, told the New York Times, \u201cI\u2019m more than just a set of reproductive organs and I\u2019d like someone to talk to me about how they\u2019ll help my pocketbook and keep my health care plan that I like, and Democrats don\u2019t have a good response to that.\u201d\n\nBut telling women to simply overlook reproductive rights issues in Texas, where women\u2019s options are shrinking rapidly, isn\u2019t likely to fly. Women in Texas are more likely to vote for a Democratic candidate than their male counterparts, and polling suggests many are steadily losing interest in the Republican Party. That\u2019s bad news for the GOP, as women also cast the majority of votes, according to Southern Methodist University political science Professor Cal Jillson. While there was no exit polling in the less-than-competitive Lone Star State 2012 election, Obama did noticeably better among women then men in the 2008 election.\n\nDavis\u2019 opponent, Attorney General Greg Abbott (R), may also be a hard sell for RedState Women. Abbott\u2019s record on women\u2019s issues includes comparing Planned Parenthood to a terrorist organization, challenging the Affordable Care Act\u2019s provisions requiring birth control access, refusal to state a position on equal pay legislation, and thanking a supporter on Twitter who called Davis \u201cretard Barbie.\u201d The a recent PPP poll found that while 54 percent of Texas men had a favorable view of Abbott, just 39 percent of women did.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "RedState Women is a new political action committee aimed at getting women to vote for Republicans in Texas and opposing Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "RedState Women is a new political action committee aimed at getting women to vote for Republicans in Texas and opposing Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis.", "title": "Texas GOP\u2019s New Strategy To Win Over Female Voters Is The Same As The Old One", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/03/12/3395531/texas-republican-women-pac/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RSW-e1394638071867.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "RedState Women is a new political action committee aimed at getting women to vote for Republicans in Texas and opposing Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis.", "title": "Texas GOP\u2019s New Strategy To Win Over Female Voters Is The Same As The Old One", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RSW-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@jeisrael", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RSW-e1394638071867.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/RSW-e1394638071867.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-12T13:21:32+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joshisraelinvestigates"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfec3\"", "article_summary": "Davis\u2019 opponent, Attorney General Greg Abbott (R), may also be a hard sell for RedState Women.\nPolitics Texas GOP\u2019s New Strategy To Win Over Female Voters Is The Same As The Old One CREDIT: From RedStateWomen.comTexas\u2019 recent efforts to radically curtail women\u2019s health has turned the state into a prime battleground for women\u2019s rights.\nFacing a significant national gender gap, 24 Republican Congressswoman had launched a GOP Women\u2019s Policy Committee in 2012.\nYet instead of address these specific concerns, RedState Women is falling back on a familiar line from the 2012 elections, another time Republicans claimed they were reforming their pitch to female voters.\nThe Republican-dominated state government in Austin has a reputation for being an old boys\u2019 club, in which female lawmakers are regularly demeaned and marginalized."}
