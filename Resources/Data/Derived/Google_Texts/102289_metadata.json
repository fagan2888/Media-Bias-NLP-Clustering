Sadly for the Kochs, poor people in Montana will now get medical care.\n\nMontana is the only state where the Kochs got beaten down like this. What is to be learned from this episode?\n\n1. Rural America isn\u2019t New York. The right-wingers the Koch brothers rub elbows with are the kind that go to Lincoln Center. The ones in Montana are a different breed, something the Kochs may not have fully understood. Their group Americans for Prosperity has cycled through five different leaders in Montana the last few years. The first guy they hired showed up at a committee hearing at the Capitol dressed in leather, like a biker, wearing an American flag bandanna on his head. After that, they tried two different former state legislators, one of whom has publicly campaigned to revive sodomy laws. Next they brought in a man who was once part of a religious cult whose members all descended into a bunker on March 15, 1990, believing that the world would end that very day.\n\nFor the Medicaid battle the Kochs tried a new strategy, one that never works in the West. They flew in a bunch of high-priced young politicos from Washington to get the job done. These held \u201ctown meetings\u201d in rural communities at which they showed up in slim-fit suits and pointy shoes, looking like they were heading to a nightclub, lecturing farmers and ranches on politics and the dangers of \u201cmore Obamacare\u201d and publicly threatening moderate Republicans. It didn\u2019t take long for them to get booed off the stage by their own partisans.\n\n2. Progressives are smarter and savvier. Now let\u2019s look at the winning army, a group of young activists with far fewer resources than the Koch team but with an advantage we\u2019ve seen pay dividends time and again: They understand spreadsheets, data and grass-roots organizing, and are smart; unlike most Tea Partyers who don\u2019t, and who are not. They teamed up with hospital executives, doctors and business leaders. These are Republican-leaning types who wanted Medicaid expansion in 2013 but were let down by their own high-priced conservative lobbyists who failed to deliver Republican votes. This time, the progressives took care of business and pressured one in five Republicans to vote for it. Kim Abbott of Montana Human Rights Network, who coordinated the effort, says they banked a record 10,000 calls to legislators. They found citizens with life-ending illnesses who could not afford treatment, who are not eligible for Medicaid nor an ACA-subsidized plan, and paired them with hospital leaders for media appearances and to testify at hearings at the Capitol. The Kochs\u2019 crew, meanwhile, testified at the same hearings that Americans \u201cwill no longer have an incentive to work hard\u201d if Medicaid is expanded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans for Prosperity spent a bundle to defeat Medicaid expansion in Montana.
