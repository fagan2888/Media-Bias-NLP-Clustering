John Kasich in Pelham, N.H. (Steven Senne/AP)\n\nPLAISTOW, N.H. \u2014 Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s bid to break out of a bunched-up pack of candidates who trail Donald Trump in the New Hampshire Republican presidential primary has drawn a last-minute attack from former Florida governor Jeb Bush.\n\nIn a Web-only video called \u201cNo Comparison,\u201d Kasich is contrasted unfavorably to Bush for his stand on everything from guns to Medicaid.\n\nKasich on Sunday had urged his opponents to take down negative ads. The posting of the Bush video not only shows that Kasich\u2019s plea was ignored, but that he is now increasingly viewed as a threat.\n\n[Kasich lays off attack politics, lays it all on the line in New Hampshire]\n\nKasich has gained in some polls, potentially at Bush\u2019s expense. A strong showing by Kasich here could give him momentum and hurt Bush\u2019s chances in South Carolina, which holds its primary on Feb. 20.\n\nKasich strategist John Weaver, who worked in the 2000 presidential primary campaign for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), said the strategy reminded him of the way George W. Bush went after the Arizona senator as they headed to the South Carolina primary.\n\n\u201cI told the governor, having been through this with the Bushes before, once we land in Charleston, presuming Bush survives this, it will be hand-to-hand combat,\u201d Weaver said in an interview after Kasich spoke here.\n\n[Nasty feud between Trump and Bush escalates ahead of N.H. primary]\n\nIn the video, news reports show Kasich being asked about his decision to accept federal funds to expand Medicaid, as allowed under President Obama\u2019s health-care plan. The video cuts off before Kasich explains his decision, instead segueing to Bush talking about it. \u201cI think that was wrong,\u201d Bush says of expanding Medicaid.\n\nKasich has said it made sense to accept the federal funds \u2014 even as he opposed \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 because it helped poor people in his state receive health-care benefits.\n\nKasich, as has been his style, has declined to attack his opponents. At a number of town hall meetings during the last week, Kasich\u2019s vow to remain positive has been one of his biggest applause lines. Standing before a giant placard that said, \u201cAmerica Never Gives Up,\u201d Kasich used his last full day of campaigning to urge voters to give him a chance to move on in the primaries.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get it done,\u201d Kasich told voters, speaking here at his 103rd town hall meeting. \u201cI have no doubt we\u2019re going to get it done, but we have to get through New Hampshire. \u2026 I want to take this to the whole country. So if I don\u2019t do it, it\u2019s your fault.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a Web-only video called \u201cNo Comparison,\u201d Kasich is contrasted unfavorably to Bush for his stand on everything from guns to Medicaid.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "In a Web-only video called \u201cNo Comparison,\u201d Kasich is contrasted unfavorably to Bush for his stand on everything from guns to Medicaid.", "title": "Bush targets Kasich as they compete for strong showing in New Hampshire", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/08/bush-targets-kasich-as-they-compete-for-strong-showing-in-new-hampshire/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/04/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Kasich-01e7a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PostKranish"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/08/bush-targets-kasich-as-they-compete-for-strong-showing-in-new-hampshire/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "bush kasich, election 2016, new hampshire 2016", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "bush kasich, election 2016, new hampshire 2016"}, "article_summary": "John Kasich in Pelham, N.H.
