The show, \u201cJonah From Tonga,\u201d which debuted several months ago in Australia, presents Lilley \u2014 a white man \u2014 in brownface as a Tongan boy with behavioral problems, a penchant for dick jokes, and a massive crush on his cousin Melody. (I believe you can already see what the issues with this show are.)\n\nLilley\u2019s fans are already familiar with Jonah Takalua, first seen in critically acclaimed mockumentary \u201cSummer Heights High,\u201d picked up by HBO from Australian TV in 2008 (another character spinoff, starring haughty teen girl Ja\u2019mie, aired on HBO in 2013). His comedies have been influential in Australia and beyond, injecting slang like \u201cPuck you, miss,\u201d \u201cquiche\u201d and \u201cranga\u201d into Australian lexicon. But even in \u201cSummer Heights High,\u201d the character of Jonah perpetuated stereotypes: writer Morgan Godfery, who has criticized \u201cJonah\u201d as minstrelsy, recalled in the Guardian that after the popularity of \u201cSummer Heights High,\u201d \u201cSuddenly, it was acceptable for white Kiwi kids to start fetishising Polynesians.\u201d\n\nSo what, exactly, is \u201cJonah From Tonga,\u201d supposedly a satire, trying to say? HBO\u2019s press release says that the show takes \u201ca humorous and brutally honest look at life in an average Australian public school,\u201d but it\u2019s clear both from the title and the show that race is a core part of this \u201chumorous and brutally honest look.\u201d The social circles in Jonah\u2019s high school are defined by race; Jonah describes the various female cliques as \u201cChick fobs, Chick wogs, chick filos, chick curries, chick africans, chick rangos, and \u2026 ching-chongs.\u201d And some portion of Jonah\u2019s antics stem from feeling discriminated against: \u201cTeachers at this school are so racist,\u201d he declares in the season opener, and in a later episode, tells one of the rich white students, \u201cJust cause you\u2019ve got different colored hair than us doesn\u2019t mean you own us.\u201d Another teacher characterizes Pacific Islanders as \u201ctricky kids\u201d who are \u201chard to control,\u201d confirming Jonah\u2019s own feelings.\n\nAlmost universally, no one likes Jonah: He is described by his peers, his family and his teachers as \u201ca fucking idiot,\u201d \u201ca very bully person,\u201d who \u201cthinks he\u2019s 21, thinks he\u2019s a gangster\u201d who is \u201cvirtually illiterate.\u201d His only friends are the so-called Fobba-liscious crew, a group of Tongan teenagers who enjoy singing, dancing and defying authority. Whatever meaningful observations on race this is meant to convey are lost when you remember (and it\u2019s hard to forget) that we\u2019re experiencing this not through the lens of a Tongan, but of a white guy pretending to be marginalized. And, if one can somehow detach the racism from \u201cJonah From Tonga\u201d (one cannot), there is still the other glaring issue with the six-episode season: The incessant stream of dick jokes and exclamations of \u201chomo!\u201d are about as funny as watching a guy run into a wall repeatedly for 37 minutes. After about 10 minutes, you wonder why you\u2019re still watching. (The show was a flop in Australia).\n\nIn an interview with Splitsider promoting \u201cJonah\u201d this week, Lilley (who declined an interview with Salon) showed remarkably little insight into the racial boundaries he supposedly wants to push: \u201cA lot of Pacific Islander kids are in prison in Australia for some reason, I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s a problem so I thought it would be cool to explore that idea that he was probably going to end up going to jail. And it seems extreme, the mentality, but it\u2019s how it is in a lot of prisons in Australia with a lot of Pacific Islanders.\u201d\n\nLilley doesn\u2019t seek deeper understanding about the population he\u2019s trying to portray, and yet he seems to believe he is accurately portraying them. Part of this \u201caccuracy\u201d includes hiring Tongans, some with almost no acting experience, to play characters in the show \u2014 but what does it mean that the principal Tongan, the one telling us his story, is actually white? He also told Splitsider, \u201cI try to make my shows really accurate. I\u2019ve always been interested in that part of the culture in Australia. I know a lot of people that have been to Tonga \u2026 I get to know the families and I think if they watch it and see how accurate it is, then it\u2019s going to be funny for everyone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chris Lilley's \"Jonah From Tonga\" is a satire, but it's hard to figure out what exactly it's trying to say", "author": "Prachi Gupta", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Chris Lilley's \"Jonah From Tonga\" is a satire, but it's hard to figure out what exactly it's trying to say", "title": "\u201cJonah from Tonga\u201d: HBO forgets the first rule of brownface", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/08/hbo_debuts_jonah_from_tonga_despite_use_of_brownface/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/jonah_from_tonga.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chris Lilley's \"Jonah From Tonga\" is a satire, but it's hard to figure out what exactly it's trying to say", "creator": "@prachigu", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/jonah_from_tonga.jpg", "title": "\u201cJonah from Tonga\u201d: HBO forgets the first rule of brownface", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cJonah from Tonga\u201d: HBO forgets the first rule of brownface", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, blackface, brownface, chris lilley, diversity, HBO, jonah from tonga, Racism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31fe\"", "article_summary": "Topics: blackface, brownface, chris lilley, diversity, HBO, jonah from tonga, Racism, Entertainment NewsDespite protests, HBO is moving ahead with a show by controversial Australian comedian Chris Lilley, who, at 39, is the unlikely star of a mockumentary about a troubled 14-year-old boy from the Kingdom of Tonga named Jonah.\nThe show, \u201cJonah From Tonga,\u201d which debuted several months ago in Australia, presents Lilley \u2014 a white man \u2014 in brownface as a Tongan boy with behavioral problems, a penchant for dick jokes, and a massive crush on his cousin Melody.\nHis comedies have been influential in Australia and beyond, injecting slang like \u201cPuck you, miss,\u201d \u201cquiche\u201d and \u201cranga\u201d into Australian lexicon.\nLilley\u2019s fans are already familiar with Jonah Takalua, first seen in critically acclaimed mockumentary \u201cSummer Heights High,\u201d picked up by HBO from Australian TV in 2008 (another character spinoff, starring haughty teen girl Ja\u2019mie, aired on HBO in 2013).\n(I believe you can already see what the issues with this show are.)"}
