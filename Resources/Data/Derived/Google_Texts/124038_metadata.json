Gupta respects Oz and says, \u201cIt might have gone over the line, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s irresponsible. Ninety-nine percent of his messages are completely accurate and really important.\u201d\n\nHe calls Obamacare good but flawed, and had some kind words for Hillary Clinton. Gupta admitted he\u2019s biased, but talks up her record on issues like health care and foreign policy. As for his personal politics, though\u2026\n\nI\u2019m a pretty liberal guy. Being journalists, we work our whole careers predicated on freedom of speech. I value humanitarian causes that are liberal, so I probably lean more liberal, though not as liberal as all my colleagues within CNN.\n\nAlso, because this is Playboy, he got a masturbation question.
