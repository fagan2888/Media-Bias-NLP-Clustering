Tom Cotton (R-AR) way ahead in the Arkansas US Senate contest appears to be an outlier. Two new polls show the race easily within the toss-up category. The CBS/NYT/YouGov survey gives Cotton a five point advantage (47/42) whereas NBC News/ Marist\u2019s offering shows the Republican barely ahead (45/43).\n\nFor the sake of brevity, let\u2019s look only at the latter (and closer) poll:\n\n(1) Voter breakdown: Both candidates have seemingly locked up their hardcore supporters. But Cotton leads among men (51/36) and Pryor among women (49/38). Significantly, however, Cotton has a modest lead among non-party aligned voters (43/37). This latter voting bloc will likely determine the outcome of the race.\n\n(2) Approval ratings: Quoth the poll\u2019s director Dr. Lee M. Miringham: [P]ryor has higher negatives than Cotton. In fact, Pryor\u2019s rating, unlike Cotton\u2019s, is upside down.\u201d\n\nThe actual approval/disapproval figures: Cotton: 46/43; Pryor: 41/49.\n\n(3) The Obama effect: The president\u2019s approval rating is underwater by 16 percentage points (31/57). This isn\u2019t an all-time low, but 93 percent of Republicans -- and 25 percent of Democrats -- give him unfavorable marks.\n\nIn other news, as Guy informed us yesterday, pro-Pryor partisans have injected some nasty campaign tactics into the mix to help their candidate. Read the literature for yourselves. The mindset seems to be if Democrats can scare enough African-Americans into voting against Cotton, Pryor might just carry the day. It\u2019s a cynical and cheap tactic \u2013 but much like the not-so-subtle charge that Republican policies actually harm women, it has its advantages.\n\nI\u2019ll leave you with this Team Cotton, \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d-themed campaign ad/documentary. If you don\u2019t have time to watch the whole thing, at least watch the first few minutes, which explains why Cotton ultimately decided to join the US Army:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Toss-up. .05/27/2016 4:27:21AM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Toss-up.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - AR Polls: Race Tightens, But Cotton Ahead", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/10/28/ar-polls-race-tightens-but-cotton-ahead-n1910961", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/10/28/2.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Toss-up.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - AR Polls: Race Tightens, But Cotton Ahead", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2014/10/28/ar-polls-race-tightens-but-cotton-ahead-n1910961", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/10/28/2.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "AR Polls: Race Tightens, But Cotton Ahead, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The mindset seems to be if Democrats can scare enough African-Americans into voting against Cotton, Pryor might just carry the day.\nThe CBS/NYT/YouGov survey gives Cotton a five point advantage (47/42) whereas NBC News/ Marist\u2019s offering shows the Republican barely ahead (45/43).\n(2) Approval ratings: Quoth the poll\u2019s director Dr. Lee M.
