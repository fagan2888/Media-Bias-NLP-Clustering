(AP) - Prohibitions against considering taxes in the current legislative session haven\u2019t slowed all efforts to raise revenue to patch together next year\u2019s budget.\n\nStatewide elected officials, state boards and agencies that have taken - or are threatened with - cuts are seeking to boost user fees, increase penalties for regulatory violations or levy new charges on people and businesses who use services or require oversight.\n\nThe dozens of proposals add up to millions of dollars.\n\nThat money could fill at least some gaps in next year\u2019s budget, which is estimated to be short $750 million to continue all services and programs in the year that begins July 1.\n\nHouse Speaker Taylor Barras, R-New Iberia, is sponsoring a House-approved bill to establish a new fee on ground ambulance providers that could generate $4 million a year in new federal financing for the state health department.\n\nAgriculture Commissioner Mike Strain is pushing a bill that would give his department a 7 percent cut of the revenue from sales of medical marijuana, when the one state-sanctioned grower, yet to be chosen, starts selling medicinal pot - plus licensing and inspection fees. Applicants for pharmacies to dispense medical marijuana are proposed for a different $5,000 fee, paid to the Louisiana Board of Pharmacy.\n\nInspection and supervision fees for towing companies and public utilities are proposed to grow larger. Pipeline safety inspection fees would be bumped up under another bill. A fee hike is sought on prepaid cell phone services for access to 911 systems.\n\nThe health department is seeking more than $6 million annually in new and increased fees for food and beverage vendors at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, for sewer systems, for retail food permits, for its drinking water inspection program and more.\n\nEven burials at state veterans cemeteries are included in the fee hike frenzy. The Department of Veterans Affairs would be able to charge $745 each for the burials, with waivers for financial hardship, under a bill awaiting debate on the House floor.\n\nAgencies say the fees they\u2019re seeking to charge or boost higher only cover the costs of providing the service - and often not fully.\n\nWhen he faced pushback on the medical marijuana fees, Strain said he can\u2019t afford to do the required inspections, lab testing and oversight without new money. He estimates the work will cost his agency between $500,000 and $750,000 a year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to make a cash cow of this,\u201d Strain told lawmakers.\n\nDuring discussion of a list of public health fee hikes, Rep. Rogers Pope, R-Denham Springs, raised concerns.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to impact a lot of people in this state with additional costs. Call it tax, fee, I don\u2019t care, the people are going to pay this additional cost.\u201d\n\nRep. Julie Stokes, R-Kenner, sponsor of the health department bill, defended the charges.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of these still do not cover the costs of providing the service,\u201d she told the House health committee, which backed the fee hikes.\n\nDepartment of Environmental Quality officials had similar arguments as they pushed a bill to increase their fees for ground water, hazardous waste, solid waste and underground storage tank regulation. The agency estimated the measure would raise more than $9 million a year.\n\nRep. Jack Montoucet, D-Crowley, worried the fee increases when coupled with regulatory charges from the fire marshal, the health department and local inspectors could harm mom-and-pop businesses.\n\n\u201cYou stack \u2018em one on top the other and you keep on going,\u201d Montoucet said. \u201cIn many of the towns, our shoe stores, our clothing stores, our drugs stores, they\u2019re all shutting down. We\u2019ve got to be careful about continuing to add fees to these people because before we know it we\u2019re going to only have the Wal-Marts.\u201d\n\nThat fee bill, too, advanced to the full House for consideration.\n\nRep. Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, isn\u2019t banking on the millions from the fee bills to arrive just yet, however.\n\n\u201cYou can only count on those once the bills are passed and are signed into law,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: Melinda Deslatte covers Louisiana politics for The Associated Press.
