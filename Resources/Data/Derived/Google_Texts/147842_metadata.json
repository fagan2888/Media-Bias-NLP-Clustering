A new study from Baylor University has found that our smartphone obsessions are contributing to relationship woes \u2014 and leading to depression.\n\nResearchers James A. Roberts and Meredith David conducted two separate studies that involved 453 U.S. adults to understand the extent that what they call \u201cPphubbing\u201d \u2014 partner phone snubbing, or the extent to which people use, or are distracted by, their phone while with their significant other \u2014 causes relationship issues.\n\nRelated: Why Your Next Phone Could Be Powered By Seawater\n\nIn the first study, participants created a nine-item scale of common smartphone behaviors that they perceived as a form of snubbing, such as \u201cmy partner places his or her cell phone where they can see it when we are together\u201d and \u201cmy partner uses his or her cell phone when we are out together.\u201d Sound familiar?\n\nThe second study asked participants to respond to the Pphubbing scale based on their own relationship. Nearly half of respondents reported being Pphubbed and more than one in five claimed this behavior led to rifts or discord in their relationship. The increased conflict results in people being less satisfied with their relationships.\n\nRelated: Why \u2018In a Relationship\u2019 on Facebook Means More Than You Think\n\n\u201cIn everyday interactions with significant others, people often assume that momentary distractions by their cell phones are not a big deal,\u201d David said. \u201cHowever, our findings suggest that the more often a couple\u2019s time spent together is interrupted by one individual attending to his/her cellphone, the less likely it is that the other individual is satisfied in the overall relationship.\u201d\n\nPphubbing also has an indirect effect on personal wellbeing. Reduced satisfaction with a relationship leads people to feel less satisfied with their lives overall, ultimately resulting in higher levels of depression, the researchers say. More than one third of the participants in the studies reported feeling depressed at least some of the time.\n\nSo the next time you\u2019re with your significant other, you have a choice to make \u2014 though for at least some people, the choice is less than obvious. A recent survey by Motorola found that 15 percent of people would rather forego seeing their significant other than give up their phone for a weekend.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you\u2019re wondering why you\u2019ve been having relationship problems, the answer may be in", "title": "How Your Smartphone Is Sabotaging Your Relationship", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/02/How-Your-Smartphone-Sabotaging-Your-Relationship", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09112013_iPhone_5C.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/02/How-Your-Smartphone-Sabotaging-Your-Relationship", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09112013_iPhone_5C.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If you\u2019re wondering why you\u2019ve been having relationship problems, the answer may be in", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A new study from Baylor University has found that our smartphone obsessions are contributing to relationship woes \u2014 and leading to depression.\nIf you\u2019re wondering why you\u2019ve been having relationship problems, the answer may be in the palm of your hand.\nThe second study asked participants to respond to the Pphubbing scale based on their own relationship.\nReduced satisfaction with a relationship leads people to feel less satisfied with their lives overall, ultimately resulting in higher levels of depression, the researchers say.\nNearly half of respondents reported being Pphubbed and more than one in five claimed this behavior led to rifts or discord in their relationship."}
