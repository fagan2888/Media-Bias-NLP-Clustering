Comedian Steven Crowder masqueraded as former ‘N Sync singer Lance Bass during an interview with TheBlaze TV’s Dana Loesch Friday, explaining why he recently visited the White House in an effort to promote Obamacare.

And the parody seemingly received a stamp of approval by Bass himself, who tweeted from his verified Twitter account: “lololol! Love this!”

Bass was on the receiving end of quite a few jokes earlier this week after promoting “healthcare.org,” instead of the correct and occasionally functional website, “healthcare.gov.”

Bass later corrected himself:

“Maybe the fierceness of his formerly frosted locks will cause Americans to forget how screwed we all are when the president finally implements Obamacare,” Loesch speculated, introducing her guest. “Maybe Bass was there to distract the country from HHS’ quiet maneuver to extend the deadline for the personal mandate out to 2016…”

That’s when “Bass” (Crowder) appeared in the “Oval Office,” saying he’s been counseling the Obama administration on healthcare.

“That ain’t no lie!” he dramatically sang at the end of his explanation, referencing the hit “Bye Bye Bye.”

Shortly after promoting “healthgov.care” and “govhealth.care,” boasting that he has “total clearance” to the White House, “Bass” was approached by a menacing Secret Service agent who thought otherwise.

“Promise me you won’t touch the face!” he pleaded before running away.

The real Lance Bass responded to the video shortly after it was posted, making it clear there were no hard feelings.
