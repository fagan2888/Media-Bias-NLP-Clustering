Incredibly, the investigation into her death drags on, ostensibly while the police await data to be extracted from the Taser, a process that would seem more likely to take minutes than months.\n\nUnder pressure from public opinion, Fairfax County Sheriff Stacey A. Kincaid, whose office runs the jail, announced in April that she had temporarily suspended use of Tasers in the facility. Now Ms. Kincaid needs to go further, and ban them altogether.\n\nThe rationale for such a move is provided by a report commissioned last year by the county police and submitted this month by the Police Executive Research Forum . The report was not written with the sheriff\u2019s office in mind; it\u2019s targeted to cops, not jail guards. But its recommendations on the use of force generally, and the deployment of Tasers in particular, are germane \u2014 particularly in light of Ms. McKenna\u2019s unjustified death.\n\nThe authors urge that the police rework their use-of-force policy to explicitly emphasize de-escalation in the event of confrontations. Many law enforcement officers do a good job of that, and their training often stresses it. Unfortunately, the team of sheriff\u2019s deputies who extracted Ms. McKenna from her cell on Feb. 3 did almost exactly the opposite. That suggests there is room for improvement not only in policy but also in training for jail guards.\n\nThe police report also specifies that in the event that police do deploy Tasers, they are not to be used on subjects who are handcuffed. Ms. McKenna, who was African American, had been handcuffed before she was shot the first time by the jail guard, who then saw fit to shoot her three more times.\n\nIn addition, the report recommends that police department policy emphasize the risk involved in repeatedly shooting subjects with Tasers \u2014 a risk the Taser company\u2019s own user\u2019s manual also makes clear. If the six jail guards who tried to subdue Ms. McKenna were aware of that risk, they disregarded it in trying to extract her from her cell.\n\nFinally, the report says that police should not use the Taser gun\u2019s \u201cdrive stun\u201d mode \u2014 in which the weapon is pressed against a person\u2019s flesh, rather than fired from a distance \u2014 as a technique of achieving compliance through pain. As it happens, that was precisely how the guard who wielded the Taser used it on Ms. McKenna; three of the four 50,000-volt jolts she was administered were from the Taser\u2019s drive-stun mode.\n\nSince Ms. McKenna\u2019s death, Ms. Kincaid has pledged herself to openness while doing quite the opposite. The identities of the six jail guards involved in the incident have not been made public; nor have their races; nor has a video of the incident that was recorded by jail personnel.\n\nIn a similar vein, it\u2019s unclear whether the sheriff\u2019s office has undertaken any meaningful review or reform on use of force in the jail, on policies regulating the deployment of Tasers, or on other training for guards. Even though the police report was aimed at a different agency, the Sheriff\u2019s Office could profit by taking its recommendations to heart.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five months after Natasha McKenna\u2019s death, a road map for reform.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Five months after Natasha McKenna\u2019s death, a road map for reform.", "title": "Waiting for the sheriff to act", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/waiting-for-the-sheriff/2015/06/28/4738c4fc-1c39-11e5-ab92-c75ae6ab94b5_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/23/Interactivity/Images/crop_freeGraduation%20photo1428607030.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "postopinions"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/waiting-for-the-sheriff/2015/06/28/4738c4fc-1c39-11e5-ab92-c75ae6ab94b5_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "natasha mckenna, fairfax jail, taser, stacy kincaid", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions"}, "eomportal-uuid": "4738c4fc-1c39-11e5-ab92-c75ae6ab94b5", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "natasha mckenna, fairfax jail, taser, stacy kincaid"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18a2\"", "article_summary": "The report was not written with the sheriff\u2019s office in mind; it\u2019s targeted to cops, not jail guards.\nThat suggests there is room for improvement not only in policy but also in training for jail guards.\nEven though the police report was aimed at a different agency, the Sheriff\u2019s Office could profit by taking its recommendations to heart.\nUnfortunately, the team of sheriff\u2019s deputies who extracted Ms. McKenna from her cell on Feb. 3 did almost exactly the opposite.\nIf the six jail guards who tried to subdue Ms. McKenna were aware of that risk, they disregarded it in trying to extract her from her cell."}
