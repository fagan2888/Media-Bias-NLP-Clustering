He\u2019s scheduled an organizing meeting in January in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\n\u201cGovernment is not going to save America. Wall Street is not going to save America. The Republican party is not going to save America. If America is going to be saved it will be done by Christian men and women restoring a Judeo-Christian culture to the country,\u201d Mr. Lane said in an interview with The Washington Times.\n\nMr. Lane said he was inspired by his own pastor Rob McCoy, who ran for the state assembly in California. Mr. McCoy was narrowly defeated by the Democratic candidate who spent $6 million against him.\n\n\u201cAfter I watched that happen the reason I emailed pastors asking them to pray for 30 days is that if they do half as good as my pastor did, if 1,000 pastors in 2016 felt like the Lord was calling them to run for office, and they each had 300 volunteers, then that\u2019s 300,000 people on the grass-roots level,\u201d Mr. Lane said.\n\nBy engaging pastors and church communities, Mr. Lane hopes ultimately that more Christians will head to the polls.\n\n\u201cWe have a Christian responsibility to engage people and get out the vote,\u201d Mr. Lane said adding that the pastors \u201cmight decide that the Lord doesn\u2019t want them to run for office, but they may have someone in their church who is very talented and can encourage them to.\u201d\n\nHe argued that America was established as a Judeo-Christian nation and that separation of church and state was never meant to keep religion out of politics.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no truth to that, the Constitution says the state is to keep out of the church, it doesn\u2019t say the church is to keep out of the state,\u201d Mr. Lane said, adding that secularism is another religion that\u2019s being imposed on Americans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of somebody\u2019s values are going to reign supreme,\u201d Mr. Lane said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little minority imposing their values. It\u2019s part of a spiritual battle. If we are going to survive as a nation, we have to have a spiritual resurrection.\u201d\n\nMr. Lane plans to bring the 1,000 pastors together Jan. 23 at an American Renewal Project conference in Baton Rouge, led by Gov. Bobby Jindal, Louisiana Republican.\n\n\u201cThere are 65 to 80 million evangelical Christians in America, we are going to bring them into the marketplace and into the public square,\u201d Mr. Lane said. \u201cChristians are going to participate in the public square, that\u2019s what we\u2019re called to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A prominent evangelical Christian leader has launched an effort to recruit 1,000 pastors willing to run for political office, hoping to inject issues and candidates of faith into the 2016 election.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A prominent evangelical Christian leader has launched an effort to recruit 1,000 pastors willing to run for political office, hoping to inject issues and candidates of faith into the 2016 election.", "title": "Evangelical David Lane begins effort to recruit pastors to run for political office", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/23/evangelical-david-lane-begins-effort-recruit-pasto/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/15/bible-wiki.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/15/bible-wiki.jpg", "description": "A prominent evangelical Christian leader has launched an effort to recruit 1,000 pastors willing to run for political office, hoping to inject issues and candidates of faith into the 2016 election.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Evangelical David Lane begins effort to recruit pastors to run for pol"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Politics, David Lane, Renewal Project, Baton Rouge"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf48\"", "article_summary": "By engaging pastors and church communities, Mr. Lane hopes ultimately that more Christians will head to the polls.\nMr. Lane said he was inspired by his own pastor Rob McCoy, who ran for the state assembly in California.\nA prominent evangelical Christian leader has launched an effort to recruit 1,000 pastors willing to run for political office, hoping to inject religious issues and candidates into the 2016 election.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of somebody\u2019s values are going to reign supreme,\u201d Mr. Lane said.\n\u201cGovernment is not going to save America."}
