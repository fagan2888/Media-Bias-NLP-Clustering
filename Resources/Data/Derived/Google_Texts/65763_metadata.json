Coffman allegedly believed the undercover agent was a fellow ISIS sympathizer and offered to put him in touch with her contacts, according to an affidavit filed by the agent.\n\nShe was charged on Wednesday with \u201cmaking a materially false statement about an offense involving terrorism,\u201d per the Associated Press.\n\nABC News cited charging documents that accuse Coffman, who is married and has a 7-year-old daughter, of \u201cconspiring and attempting to provide material support\u201d to the terrorist organization.\n\nAccording to CNN, she attracted the suspicion of the FBI through her social media activity. In addition to an account under her own name, she had several Facebook accounts under aliases such as \u201cHeather Obeida La\u2019ahad\u201d and \u201cUbeida Ametova.\u201d\n\nUS World and News Report writes that these accounts \u201creportedly ranged in their extremist support, but included pictures of armed militants, the Islamic State group\u2019s iconic black flag and correspondence sympathetic to the militant group targeted in Iraq and Syria by the U.S. military and a host of international allies.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, when was asked by a Facebook friend why she posted pro-ISIS images, Coffman replied, \u201cI love ISIS!\u201d The AP also reports that one of her accounts listed her job as \u201cjihad for Allah\u2019s sake,\u201d and expressed her desire to become a \u201cshaheed,\u201d or martyr.\n\nHer defense attorney, Mark Henry Schmidt, told the Washington Post:\n\nAs far as I know, she hasn\u2019t traveled anywhere. Her connections with the outside world would be on the Internet. I imagine you can get into trouble on the Internet, but I imagine you can also think a lot more\u2019s going on than really is. If nothing else, this is certainly a cautionary tale about the Internet.\n\nJim Carafano, the vice president of Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation, said, \u201cISIS is pure evil. Supplying material support to these terrorists in my mind is about as despicable an act as I can imagine.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Virginia woman has been arrested for allegedly attempting to provide material support to the terrorist group ISIS.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Virginia woman has been arrested for allegedly attempting to provide material support to the terrorist group ISIS.", "title": "\u2018I Love ISIS!\u2019 Was This Virginia Mom Helping Terrorists?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaglobal333109.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-19T19:40:17+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1uKdArM"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A Virginia woman has been arrested for allegedly attempting to provide material support to the terrorist group ISIS.", "title": "\u2018I Love ISIS!\u2019 Was This Virginia Mom Helping Terrorists?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaglobal333109.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2014-11-19T15:16:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-19T19:40:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ISIS, terrorism, Islamic State, Virginia, homeland, security, FBI"}, "article_summary": "A Virginia woman has been arrested for allegedly attempting to provide material support to the terrorist group ISIS.\nSupplying material support to these terrorists in my mind is about as despicable an act as I can imagine.\u201d\nJim Carafano, the vice president of Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation, said, \u201cISIS is pure evil.\nABC News cited charging documents that accuse Coffman, who is married and has a 7-year-old daughter, of \u201cconspiring and attempting to provide material support\u201d to the terrorist organization.\nCoffman allegedly believed the undercover agent was a fellow ISIS sympathizer and offered to put him in touch with her contacts, according to an affidavit filed by the agent."}
