Boys' Basketball: Titles and more at stake for the holidays\n\n\n\nIn a time of year defined by traditions, the New Hampshire boys\u2019 hoop ranks will follow one of its own with annual holiday tournaments on tap for the days between Christmas and the start of the New Year.\n\n..\n\nThe majority of teams from each of the NHIAA\u2019s four divisions will participate in a tournament with different goals in mind.\n\n\n\nFor Merrimack, which is off to a strong regular-season start at 2-0, the game plan for tournament play has several layers.\n\n..\n\n\u201cKids only have so many opportunities to win so many championships,\u201d Tomahawks coach Tim Goodridge said. \u201cIf you have an opportunity to win a tournament, then we are going to try and win it. If we don\u2019t, then you want to get kids playing time and look at different things for what comes next.\u201d\n\n..\n\nIt will be a season of change for Merrimack\u2019s holiday slate, as Goodridge opted to move to the Chick-Fil-A Holiday Basketball Tournament, which runs Dec. 28-30 at Nashua South, after a long, successful run at the Queen City Basketball Invitational in Manchester.\n\n..\n\n\u201cWe participated in the Manchester tourney for about 19 or 20 years and it was a great tournament,\u201d Goodridge said. \u201cThe only thing was we always found ourselves playing the same teams. We would\u2019ve played Bedford (which Merrimack played Tuesday) again the day after Christmas and then get Dover or Exeter regardless if we win or lose.\u201d\n\n..\n\nMerrimack will jump into a tournament pool in Nashua that features Nashua South, Nashua North, Alvirne, Milford, Souhegan, Goffstown and Thornton Academy of Maine.\n\n\n\nGoodridge said the potential of playing some top Division II teams, including the Grizzlies and new head coach Mike Gasper, Goodridge\u2019s former assistant, might serve the Tomahawks well in the future, with Merrimack\u2019s dwindling enrollment putting it on the cusp of dropping to D-II.\n\n..\n\nSeveral tournaments bunch up local teams, regardless of their division, to not only keep teams from traveling long distances, but to create further incentive beyond getting extra game repetitions.\n\n\n\nThe Lakes Region Holiday Tournament at Gilford could be one of those battles for supremacy. The tournament, which runs Dec. 28-30, features host Gilford, Laconia, Winnisquam of Tilton, Newfound of Bristol, Kingswood of Wolfeboro, Belmont, Moultonborough and Prospect Mountain of Alton.\n\n..\n\nGilford coach Chip Veazey said there are no fierce rivalries present among the lakes schools at this time, but Laconia coach Steve McDonough believes there is still incentive to be on top.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the things you use to get the kids up to play over the vacation,\u201d said McDonough of playing regional schools. \u201cKids might want to be in bed or playing Xbox during those first-round games at 11 a.m., so it helps make the energy great and makes me love this time of year.\u201d\n\n..\n\nAnother regional battle will go down in Concord, where the NHTI Capitol Area Holiday Tournament will bring together some of the area\u2019s best Dec. 26-28. Concord and Pembroke are the only Division I teams in the eight-team field, but the talent is still there with reigning Division II champion Bishop Brady of Concord, undefeated Hopkinton, Kearsarge, Bow, John Stark of Weare and Merrimack Valley of Penacook all in the mix.\n\n..\n\nOne of the more intriguing fields will take place at the Keene State College Boys\u2019 High School Basketball Tournament Dec. 26-28. The tournament has two brackets, one featuring respective Division III and Division IV powers Conant of Jaffrey and Epping, and the other with Division IV defending state champion Wilton-Lyndeborough.\n\n..\n\nThe Blue Devils and Orioles have a chance to meet in the finals of the \u201cA\u201d bracket, but will need to navigate through the likes of Keene, Coe-Brown Northwood Academy, Smithfield, R.I., and Mamaroneck of Long Island, N.Y. Epping, which lost to champion Smithfield in the opening round of last year\u2019s tournament, committed to returning to the tournament this year before leaving last year\u2019s tournament, understanding the competition and atmosphere will help build the team up for a similar look come tournament time in March.\n\n..\n\n\u201cThis is exactly where we wanted to be,\u201d Epping coach Sean Young said. \u201cWe\u2019re just stoked to play these types of teams. It\u2019s a tremendous opportunity for a small school like us to even be a part of something like this.\u201d\n\n..\n\nThe tournament slate also includes the Oyster River Holiday Tournament at Oyster River High in Durham and the Mike Lee Holiday Bash at Farmington High. Both tournaments run Dec. 26-28 and feature diverse and competitive fields. There will be just six teams at Oyster River, but the Bobcats, Spaulding of Rochester, Winnacunnet of Hampton, Timberlane of Plaistow, Somersworth and Raymond will create some interesting inter-league matchups.\n\n..\n\nThe Mike Lee Holiday Bash has variety with at least one team each from Division II, III and IV. The favorites include unbeaten Portsmouth Christian of Dover and Newmarket from D-IV, Sanborn from D-III, and Kennett from D-II.\n\n..\n\njduball@unionleader.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a time of year defined by traditions, the New Hampshire boys' hoop ranks will follow one of its own with annual holiday tournaments on tap for the days between Christmas and the start of the New Year.", "title": "H.S.
