Here is what she said:\n\nBILL MOYERS: What do you think will come from the court\u2019s junking of the 35-foot buffer zone? CECILE RICHARDS: Well, we\u2019re already seeing in Massachusetts that absolutely, immediately after that decision eliminating the buffer zone we had record numbers of protesters outside of the following women all the way up to the door of our health center in Massachusetts. These are not all kindly, elderly ladies simply whispering in the ears. And even if they were, it is the right of women in this country to be able to access healthcare that they need without harassment and without the advice of dozens of people outside their health center. I mean, can you imagine if, you know, if men in this country, before going into their doctor had to walk through a gauntlet of protesters telling them, you know, whether it\u2019s not to get a colonoscopy or just go down the list? It\u2019s incredible.\n\nImagine those signs \u2013 \u201cColonoscopies Exploit Men!\u201d or \u201cAbolish Colonoscopies\u201d or \u201cPro-Men, Anti-Colonoscopy\u201d.\n\nAs uncomfortable as a colonoscopy may be, it is a valid medical procedure that saves lives (as opposed to ending them) and is a necessary and actual medical process, something that is considered \u201chealthcare\u201d by the general public and medical field. On the other hand abortion takes life and is not considered healthcare \u2013 abortion hasn\u2019t been subsidized by the government since 1976 through the Hyde Amendment until Obamacare came around.\n\nThis is a tactic that Planned Parenthood and the abortion lobby need to employ to get the public on their side. But it isn\u2019t working. In fact, the New York Times reports today that abortion advocates are pulling away from the term \u201cpro-choice\u201d because it doesn\u2019t mean anything. Why? Maybe because an actual pro-choice person would want women to see ultrasounds before they decide to have an abortion or to have access to all the information they could on what abortion is, how it affects the women on a physical, mental and spiritual level. Logically, the term pro-choice just doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nThe abortion lobby wants to use terms like \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d instead to promote abortion. But women\u2019s health isn\u2019t about abortion. Please. Any woman is going to see through that fa\u00e7ade.\n\nWomen\u2019s health isn\u2019t about abortion \u2013 it\u2019s about mammograms (which Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t do), well visits, making sure women are eating healthy and taking care of themselves so they can take care of their families, mental well-being, work-life balance, and other things that yes, deal with reproduction, but also deal with the impressive body and inner workings of being a woman. The \u201cright\u201d to end the life of her child doesn\u2019t encompass \u201cwomen\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood and their allies are losing. They are struggling to figure out how to articulate their position of wanting to perform as many abortions as possible in order to increase their bottom line. They are trying to message around the fact that they exploit women and their preborn babies every day for profit. No wonder they are on the losing end", "article_metadata": {"description": "Losing the Abortion Debate, Planned Parenthood is Abandoning the Term \"Pro-Choice\"", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "title": "Losing the Abortion Debate, Planned Parenthood is Abandoning the Term \u201cPro-Choice\u201d", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/07/29/losing-the-abortion-debate-planned-parenthood-is-abandoning-the-term-pro-choice/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/proabortion13.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "losing the abortion debate,planned parenthood is abandoning the term \"pro-choice\",planned parenthood is abandoning the term pro-choice", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This is a tactic that Planned Parenthood and the abortion lobby need to employ to get the public on their side.\nThe abortion lobby wants to use terms like \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d instead to promote abortion.\nThe \u201cright\u201d to end the life of her child doesn\u2019t encompass \u201cwomen\u2019s health.\u201dPlanned Parenthood and their allies are losing.\nIn fact, the New York Times reports today that abortion advocates are pulling away from the term \u201cpro-choice\u201d because it doesn\u2019t mean anything.\nBut women\u2019s health isn\u2019t about abortion."}
