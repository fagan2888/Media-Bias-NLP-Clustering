But let's all be honest about health care insurance. Most of those of us who have insurance are \"dependent\" on our employer's contribution for it. And we get that employer contribution tax free. A Families USA study estimates there are 185,000 working Alabamians who can't get health insurance through their employers and can't qualify for the Affordable Care Act subsidies. Some of these workers are: 26,000 fast food/restaurant; 26,000 construction; 25,000 sales/retail; and 20,000 cleaning/maintenance workers, etc.\n\nThese are hardworking people who, when they get sick, are paying cash for health care. They are one serious illness away from losing everything from a major medical bill.\n\nWhile we're on the topic, let's clarify a few more misconceptions.\n\n-- The money from this program does not go to people; it goes directly to support health care providers in Alabama \u2013 doctors, nurses, pharmacists, our hospitals, ambulance drivers, and our universities. Alabama has lost 10 hospitals over the past few years and there are many rural hospitals losing money and near closing.\n\n-- Alabama is turning down $1.4 billion per year each year that we are not in this program. That is $1.4 billion that would be used to hire more doctors and nurses and provide real jobs in hospitals or people working in drug stores. It would help businesses that make medical supplies.\n\n-- Another excuse I've heard is that we don't have enough doctors to see all these patients. Well, how about adding $1.4 billion to our healthcare economy to pay more doctors? This problem will solve itself as more insured patients enter the market.\n\n-- The above economic activity would generate tax revenue for Alabama to pay our teachers, build roads, and support our police and firefighters. University of Alabama at Birmingham economists Becker and Morrisey estimated it will generate $935 million more in tax revenue through this program than what we have to lay out to implement it.\n\n-- There is concern that the feds will reduce its financial commitment. However a review of the federal commitment to this program showed that in over 50 years only once in 1981 under President Reagan was the money reduced. And then it was temporary and the difference made up.\n\n-- Alabamians are already paying for this program. We are writing a check for insurance for working people in other states. We are literally blowing off Medicaid expansion and blowing our money to other states.\n\n-- Other conservative states have figured out the economic benefit and have accepted the reality of the new healthcare economy. Why have conservative states like Arizona, Arkansas, North Dakota, West Virginia and Kentucky (all of which voted for Mitt Romney by wide margins) accepted the money? Republican governors of Pennsylvania and Tennessee are now moving forward with expansion. It makes too much sense from both business and moral perspectives.\n\nDoug Hoffman is a retired Manager of Decision Support at Children's Hospital in Alabama.
