UC agreed to yearly raises and improved healthcare benefits for all postdocs as well as expanded rights for international postdoctoral researchers. More than 6,000 postdocs throughout the 10 UC campuses will have the chance to vote from Oct. 19 to 27 on whether to approve or reject the contract.\n\nIf approved, the agreement would also require the University to form a new Family-Friendly Committee to explore how to reimburse postdocs for childcare.\n\nUnion president and former UC Davis postdoc Anke Schennink said the union was able to remove any salary reductions from the agreement in the last hour of negotiations.\n\n\u201cThe University had proposed a number of different wage cuts, and they would basically lower the take-home pay for postdocs,\u201d Schennink said. \u201cThat was definitely a point that was talked about until the last moment.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, postdocs will receive yearly raises based on the National Institute of Health\u2019s inflation index.\n\nThe amount of University assistance offered to international postdocs had also been a sticking point in previous negotiations, but Schennink said the contract\u2019s new terms on international postdocs is one of the \u201cimportant improvements\u201d over the previous contract.\n\n\u201cFor example, in case of the termination of a postdoc, the University will assist in helping the postdoc to get a travel visa to come back for a hearing if a postdoc has to leave the country because of this,\u201d Schennink said.\n\nAccording to Schennink, the contract also expands postdocs\u2019 healthcare coverage.\n\n\u201cThe plans will be at the same cost or slightly cheaper, but the new healthcare plan will be in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, which is important basically for the reason that preventative care and contraception will be available with no co-pay,\u201d Schennink said.\n\nSchennink said she thought the threat of postdocs authorizing a strike coerced the University to make some concessions.\n\n\u201cI definitely think [the strike] has been important and that resulted in the improvements that we have now, but the University will not talk about that,\u201d Schennink said.\n\nSchennink said in a previous Daily Nexus article titled \u201cPostdoc Student Union Makes Case for Fair Pay, Job Security\u201d that members of UC\u2019s negotiating team \u201cdon\u2019t respect postdocs.\u201d\n\nUCSB\u2019s materials department postdoc and Santa Barbara unit chair for the union Patrick Callahan said postdocs do \u201call kinds of things,\u201d including guiding graduate students through school and doing in-depth research.\n\n\u201cObviously, UCSB is a research university and postdocs are pretty important to getting high-level research done,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cThey\u2019re people who already have PhDs, so they are highly trained.\u201d\n\nPostdoctoral researchers often work under the direction of a professor while training for a faculty position, according to analyst Billy Ko, who works in UCSB\u2019s academic personnel department.\n\n\u201cPostdocs typically spend five years getting training and mentorship with a faculty member,\u201d Ko said.\n\nCallahan said because the terms included many improvements that he and other postdocs were pushing for, he expected a majority of postdocs to approve the contract.\n\n\u201cEveryone I\u2019ve talked to is happy that we\u2019ve reached a tentative agreement \u2026 So I would imagine it\u2019s going to be exactly the same, where the majority of the postdocs support the agreement that the bargaining team got for us,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cI have to imagine that a majority of postdocs will be voting to ratify the agreement.\u201d\n\nSchennink said although the union accomplished many of its goals, members still have issues to address during next year\u2019s negotiations.\n\n\u201cWe would definitely like to make further improvements in family-friendly benefits and gender equity in the University,\u201d Schennink said. \u201cThere can be a lot of improvements there. That\u2019s definitely something that will stay on the agenda for next year.\u201d\n\nIf the new agreement is ratified, it will be effective until Sept. 30, 2016.\n\nA version of this story appeared on p. 7 of the Oct. 15, 2015 edition of the Daily Nexus.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Nexus", "description": "Related", "title": "UC Postdocs Negotiate for Better Benefits, Rights", "url": "http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/uc-postdocs-negotiate-for-better-benefits-rights/", "image": "http://dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Related", "title": "UC Postdocs Negotiate for Better Benefits, Rights", "url": "http://dailynexus.com/2015-10-15/uc-postdocs-negotiate-for-better-benefits-rights/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.jpg?fit=512%2C512", "site": "@dailynexus", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Just before their previous contract expired in October, University of California and the UC postdoctoral union (UAW 5810) reached a one-year agreement that", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i0.wp.com/dailynexus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-new-logo.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ffa\"", "article_summary": "UC agreed to yearly raises and improved healthcare benefits for all postdocs as well as expanded rights for international postdoctoral researchers.\n\u201cThe University had proposed a number of different wage cuts, and they would basically lower the take-home pay for postdocs,\u201d Schennink said.\n\u201cWe would definitely like to make further improvements in family-friendly benefits and gender equity in the University,\u201d Schennink said.\n\u201cThat was definitely a point that was talked about until the last moment.\u201dUnder the terms of the agreement, postdocs will receive yearly raises based on the National Institute of Health\u2019s inflation index.\n\u201cObviously, UCSB is a research university and postdocs are pretty important to getting high-level research done,\u201d Callahan said."}
