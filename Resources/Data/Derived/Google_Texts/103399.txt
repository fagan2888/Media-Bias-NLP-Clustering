In Bill Maher's latest "New Rules" segment on Friday night, the phrase "penis pump" came up more times than we thought possible as he mocked the disparity in government spending on senior citizens vs. children.

In the video above (about 2:30 in), Maher proposes that the real "battle of government giveaways" isn't between the classes or the races, but between the young and the old, "and the old are winning."

Not only are more senior citizens having more unprotected sex than young people, but Medicare spent $172 million of taxpayer money on "penis pumps" between 2006 and 2011.

Meanwhile, Head Start, nutrition assistance and welfare for children is only getting a fraction of the yearly budget.

"These days, when Grandpa finds a quarter behind your ear, he keeps it!" Maher lamented, but don't get him wrong: he understands that seniors have it rough. "Dying is hard, and I wanna do it on drugs," he admitted.

Maher also knows that seniors, some of whom oppose the Affordable Care Act and also receive Medicare, are voters and therefore have more clout than children.

"When seniors say jump, Uncle Sam says, 'How about a free penis pump?'" Maher joked. And don't worry, that wasn't the only cringeworthy image he brought to mind: "These days, when Grandma yells, 'Bingo!,' it's because an old vet just found her G-spot!". Oof.

Watch the full clip above. "Real Time With Bill Maher" airs Fridays at 10:00 p.m. EST on HBO.
