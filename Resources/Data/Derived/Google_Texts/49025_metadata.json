For previous U.S. presidents, this has been a time to sure up their legacy. With the public distracted by the electoral circus, lame ducks have little else to do than organize their papers, plan their presidential libraries and make a case to often apathetic audiences for their many and varied accomplishments.\n\nPresident Obama clearly had this task in mind last Tuesday, when he delivered his final State of the Union address. Eschewing the usual laundry list of policy proposals, Obama reminded Americans of some of his signature accomplishments, including the Affordable Care Act, normalized relations with Cuba and a historic nuclear arms deal with Iran.\n\n\n\nObama would do well to remember, however, that what history remembers about a presidency is often unpredictable \u2014 and almost certainly beyond his control.\n\nJust ask Andrew Johnson, America\u2019s first post-Civil War president and, as the first President to be impeached, almost certainly one of its worst. His legacy, in recent years, has unexpectedly come to include his pet mice. The subject of a growing body of commentary, Johnson\u2019s relationship with White House rodents \u2014 whom he wooed with flour and water during the dark days of his impeachment \u2014 is now part of his presidential lore. One writer has even suggested, no doubt tongue-in-cheek, that the president\u2019s pet mice might figure prominently in an Andrew Johnson animated biopic.\n\nIn some ways, this development in unsurprising. Americans venerate the office of the presidency, even if they often despise its current inhabitant. But many are eager to consume stories that redeem and humanize the men who occupied the White House. Was Andrew Johnson a thoroughgoing white supremacist, even by the daunting standards of his day? Yes. Did he work tirelessly to restore ex-Confederates to political power after the Civil War? Absolutely. But he also did quirky, human stuff like befriending mice in an hour of loneliness, so \u2014 according to some \u2014 he must be relatable after all.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\nIn other respects, however, the emergence of Johnson\u2019s mice as part of his presidential legacy couldn\u2019t be stranger. Mentioned fleetingly in the diaries of William G. Moore, Johnson\u2019s personal secretary, the president\u2019s mice were unknown to contemporaries, who were more concerned with Johnson\u2019s impeachment proceedings and his obsessive efforts to bar African Americans from the merest semblance of civil and political rights.\n\nIn fact, it would take more than a century before Johnson\u2019s mice entered public consciousness. This occurred in 1989. In March of that year, the Washington Post\u2019s Roxanne Roberts mentioned Johnson\u2019s mice in a piece on presidential pooch Millie Bush. And in July, historian Hans Trefousse published a definitive biography of Johnson \u2013 complete with a single, sentence-long reference to his rodent friends. Since then, the story has continued to appear and reappear \u2013 in the nation\u2019s leading newspapers, in books of presidential trivia and minutiae, and on dozens of sites across the internet.\n\nWhat does this story tell us? About Andrew Johnson, it says little. History is littered with dreadful people who were kind to animals. That Johnson refused to kill White House pests was surely scant consolation to the thousands of African-Americans who were butchered by white vigilante groups like the Ku Klux Klan during Johnson\u2019s disastrous presidency.\n\nWith respect to presidential legacies, however, Johnson\u2019s mice tell us a great deal. On leaving office, Johnson no doubt wished to be remembered as a staunch defender of states\u2019 rights, white supremacy and the U.S. Constitution. His opponents, meanwhile, expected the outgoing president to be remembered as a stubborn, obstructionist bigot who squandered an opportunity to remake the South.\n\nThe wishes of both parties, in due time, would be granted. At the height of Jim Crow in the early 20th century, Johnson would be celebrated as a savior of the white South. And more recently, he has been excoriated as an enemy of black freedom. But he has also come to be remembered as something else entirely: a presidential curiosity.\n\nA foe to so many of his fellow humans, this new Andrew Johnson lives on as a friend to mice. It\u2019s an unlikely legacy, to say the least \u2014 one that America\u2019s 17th president scarcely could have seen coming. But such is often the case with presidential legacies. No matter what a president does while in office, a legacy is crafted by those who come after.\n\nHistorians explain how the past informs the present\n\nSean Trainor has a Ph.D. in History & Women\u2019s Studies from Penn State University.
