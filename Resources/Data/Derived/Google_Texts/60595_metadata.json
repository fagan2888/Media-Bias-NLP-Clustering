Diane Black (R-Tenn.) on Monday proposed legislation aimed at ensuring companies aren\u2019t forced to routinely report confidential health insurance information on their employees to the IRS.\n\nBlack\u2019s bill is a reaction to language in Obamacare that requires companies to send data to the IRS each month beginning next year, information that could include people\u2019s Social Security number and dates of birth. Republicans have questioned whether the IRS can be trusted to safeguard this information, as well as whether the new reporting requirements will be another onerous regulatory burden for companies.\n\n\u201cThese burdensome reporting requirements take time, money, and resources away from the daily operations of running a business,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also put sensitive personal information at risk as it is transmitted to the IRS, where it is then stored.\u201d\n\nBlack\u2019s bill, the Streamlining Verification for Americans Act, would eliminate this requirement and let companies voluntarily report their workers\u2019 health insurance status once per year, without including any confidential data.\n\nBlack\u2019s bill would also prohibit people from receiving insurance subsidies under Obamacare until the government verifies their eligibility. Some reports have indicated that subsidies are being paid out before it\u2019s verified that the recipients\u2019 incomes are low enough to qualify for subsidies.\n\nRepublicans have said the government\u2019s failure to verify eligibility first means millions of dollars will likely be wasted.\n\n\u201cThat is what was originally required by the law and it is unacceptable that this administration has doled out billions of taxpayer dollars without first checking to make sure those receiving subsidies are truly eligible,\u201d Black said.\n\nBlack\u2019s bill and others like it could test the extent to which President Barack Obama is willing to consider changes to the controversial health care law. Two years ago, Obama said people with ideas to fix the law should present them, but the Democratic Senate has shut down any real chance of debating ways to alter the law.\n\nThe GOP-led Senate that convenes next year is almost certain to raise the many Obamacare fixes that House Republicans have raised, and may also call a vote on a full repeal bill.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Rep.
