Comments have been edited for grammar and spelling.\n\nJoin the conversation by \u201cliking\u201d The Jackson Sun\u2019s Facebook page at facebook.com/JacksonSun.\n\nSunny Brooks: He broke his pledge that they all said Trump would break. Time to vote all new people in!\n\nBen Wilford: I don\u2019t like Trump, but I will take him any day over a dishonest, lying, socialist like Hillary. Jeb and all the others need to get over this ... or they are guaranteeing that Hillary will win.\n\nJason Vales: The best thing the Bush family can do is enjoy retirement, because they will not be elected into any high office again. Trump 2016!\n\nGay Arnold Gregson: The establishment politicians are so scared of being found out by Trump that they would rather have Hillary win. The country can go to hell in a hand basket as far as they care, as long as they can keep their power.\n\nLarry Shackleford: Gay, you\u2019re right. If he won\u2019t vote for Trump, that means he will support Hillary.\n\nBonnie Coble: With these people like this is why Trump is so popular. But to say you\u2019ll not vote - have you forgotten the men and women who died for this right and privilege?\n\nJohn Walker: Idiot politicians acting like this are the reason Trump is winning. Spineless, worthless, entitled RINOs.\n\nJames Boyd: He pledged to support the Republican nominee. Glad Bush didn\u2019t make it if he could lie about something so simple. I voted for his brother, but Jeb has lost my respect and is a sore loser.\n\nSpencer David Guth: The man already sabotaged American democracy by handing his brother the election in 2000, leading to a thoroughly ruinous eight years. I don\u2019t much care what he thinks.\n\nJudy Boldan: Smartest thing I have ever heard a Bush say.\n\nMike Moorman: And all the previous candidates pretty much demanded that Trump put his vote to he GOP candidate. What a sore stack of losers.\n\nBeverly D. McVay: Bush is a calmer person. Yes, Trump overpowered him with his mouth. The same mouth I\u2019m afraid will lead us in to huge trouble if he is elected. Hate me if you want. Trump is like a child running loose with a gun. He really scares me.\n\nLarry Shackleford: Beverly, yes, Trump does worry me with his mouth, but I can assure you he will tone it down when elected. Talk softly and carry a big stick is my way. I hope his cabinet will tell him about this, and he will make adjustments.\n\nBenjamin Tournier: That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t get even close to a nomination. We all knew he would never follow through with anything.\n\nTed Smith: Jeb Bush is a traitor to the Republican Party.\n\nCathy Baird Wheeler: So he isn\u2019t going to vote. I guess he is just going to pout. Well, he can\u2019t fuss with the ways things go if he doesn\u2019t vote.\n\nRicky Lightcap: It was only a pledge until it didn\u2019t work out. Two Bushes were enough for this country and only one Clinton.\n\nKris Yager: Jeb is the president-elect of the Sore Losers Club. Does anyone care who he votes for? I know I don\u2019t.\n\nJerry Durham: So he straddles the fence again.\n\nChristie Stone Smythe: Not voting is voting for Hillary Clinton.\n\nJeff Shepard: Guess that whole pledge thing was just a big fat lie! There was a reason we didn\u2019t want this guy!\n\nRoger Malone: And here I thought it was a civic responsibility to vote. Must be my old fashioned values.\n\nTENNCARE MISERY METER\n\nLt. Gov. Ron Ramsey\u2019s, House Speaker Beth Harwell\u2019s and the Tennessee General Assembly\u2019s lack of leadership and urgency and failure to expand TennCare under the Affordable Care Act are bringing misery to an estimated 280,000 Tennesseans who could have received health insurance, including an estimated 30,000 veterans. Meanwhile, the financial stability of hospitals is at risk, and workers could lose their jobs. It is costing Tennesseans an estimated $2.5 million per day. The loss to date is:\n\n$2,650,00,000\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/opinion/2016/05/09/readers-react-jeb-bush-vote-donald-trump/84149386/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Facebook comments about Jeb Bush\u2019s statement that he will not vote for Donald Trump.", "og": {"site_name": "The Jackson Sun", "description": "Facebook comments about Jeb Bush\u2019s statement that he will not vote for Donald Trump.", "title": "Readers react: Jeb Bush won\u2019t vote for Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.jacksonsun.com/story/opinion/2016/05/09/readers-react-jeb-bush-vote-donald-trump/84149386/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/jacksonsun.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Facebook comments about Jeb Bush\u2019s statement that he will not vote for Donald Trump.", "title": "Readers react: Jeb Bush won\u2019t vote for Donald Trump", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d30f760c22e68bc1889a7853d8b55c6374f5715c/c=404-0-1098-694&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/09/JacksonTN/B9322093192Z.1_20160509153501_000_GSFEAPL62.1-0.png", "creator": "@JSunNews", "site": "@JSunNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=893610877", "fb": {"app_id": 174739675893665}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Selected comments from a Facebook post by The Jackson Sun about Jeb Bush\u2019s statement that he will not vote for Donald Trump.\nTed Smith: Jeb Bush is a traitor to the Republican Party.\nGlad Bush didn\u2019t make it if he could lie about something so simple.\nIf he won\u2019t vote for Trump, that means he will support Hillary.\nMike Moorman: And all the previous candidates pretty much demanded that Trump put his vote to he GOP candidate."}
