A fire at a Tulsa apartment complex was contained quickly, resulting in little damage, the Tulsa Fire Department says.



District Fire Chief John Steiner said the tenant at the River Chase Apartments was not home on Sunday night when a fire began, likely in the water heater closet.



There were no injuries, TFD said.

The fire was contained to the one unit, but the tenant below will be relocated to another apartment while cleanup takes place, Steiner said.
