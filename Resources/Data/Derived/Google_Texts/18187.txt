WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) â€” A man is in the hospital after being hit by a car on Market Street last night.

Corporal Leslie Irving with the Wilmington Police Department said it happened when an intoxicated man walked out in front of a vehicle.

She said the pedestrian was transported to New Hanover Regional Medical Center with serious injuries where he remains for ongoing care.

The driver will not be charged, because Irving said the pedestrian is at fault for failing to yield the right way to the vehicle.
