As these reports are made public, they are reviewed and considered for incorporation into the guideline recommendations,\u201d guidelines panelist Susanna Naggie, MD, associate professor of medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, told Medical Economics. \u201cReal-world clinical experience over the past year has provided overwhelming evidence of the safety and effectiveness of these regimens. For nearly all patients, the risk of treatment is vastly outweighed by the benefit.\u201d\n\nRelated: Liver damage underestimated in hepatitis C patients\n\nNew data suggest successful hepatitis C treatment that results in sustained virologic response benefits patients with mild liver disease. Previously, the guidelines had prioritized treatment with the direct-acting anti-viral agents for those with the greatest need, particularly those with severe liver disease.\n\nPatients with short life expectancies unrelated to HCV infection are not recommended for treatment with these newer therapies, according to the updated guidelines.\n\nThere may still be a need to prioritize patients for treatment based on the cost of the new drugs and regional availability of the appropriate healthcare provider.\n\n\u201cAs CDC-recommended screening for HCV is better incorporated into clinical practices across the country, we will need to find ways to expand HCV therapy access beyond subspecialty clinics and tertiary care referral centers,\u201d says Naggie. \u201cExpanding treatment into primary care clinics will significantly improve access, especially for patients in more rural areas. Complex patient populations, including those with severe liver disease and/or hepatic decompensation, chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease, and direct-acting antiviral failures requiring retreatment, are best referred for subspecialty care.\u201d\n\nShe notes that patients without severe liver disease or other complicating co-morbidities can receive therapy for HCV in their communities. \u201cThe primary limitation is ensuring primary care providers have adequate training on HCV natural history, liver disease staging, and treatment decision making,\u201d Naggie says. \u201cAlso, ensuring that primary care providers have access to an expert when complications arise is critical to ensure long-term success and safety for patients.\u201d\n\nEven with the high cost of newer HCV treatments, \u201ccost-effectiveness studies of direct-acting antiviral agent combination regimens have generally shown incremental cost-effectiveness ratios within the range of other accepted medical practices,\u201d Naggie says.\n\nMany insurance companies have placed restrictions on access to direct-acting antiviral agents, which amounts to a hurdle for clinicians to get access to the drugs for their patients. Most pharmaceutical companies offer copay assistance for patients, so the majority of HCV patients pay no more than $5 per prescription, if their insurer agrees to cover the medication, she notes.", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "Nearly all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections should receive direct-acting anti-viral agents, according to updated guidelines by the American Association for the Study for Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.", "Description": "Nearly all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections should receive direct-acting anti-viral agents, according to updated guidelines by the American Association for the Study for Liver Diseases and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.", "og": {"url": "http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/new-hep-c-guidelines-endorse-direct-acting-anti-viral-agents", "site_name": "Medical Economics", "description": "Nearly all patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections should receive direct-acting anti-viral agents, according to updated guidelines by the American Association for the Study for Live", "title": "New hep C guidelines endorse direct-acting anti-viral agents"}, "DC.identifier": "http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/node/414129", "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "DC.date": "2015-11-19", "last-modified": "Thu, 19 November 2015 20:12:20 GMT", "DC.creator": "Mark L.
