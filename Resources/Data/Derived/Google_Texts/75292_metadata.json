She said the problem is worldwide and not specific to any particular country, citizenship document, or visa category.\n\n\"We apologize to applicants and recognize this may cause hardship to applicants waiting on visas and passports. We are working to correct the issue as quickly as possible,\" she said.\n\nHarf said the problems with the database have resulted in an \"extensive backlog\" of applications, which has, in turn, hampered efforts to get the system fully back on line.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many people are affected, but two U.S. officials familiar with the situation said some 50,000 applicants were hit in one country alone. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly or identify the country.\n\nThe database is the State Department's system of record and is used to approve, record and print visas and other documents to ensure that national security checks are conducted on applicants.\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Matthew Lee)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "US, computers, glitch, Passports, delay", "pubdate": "2014-07-23T21:56:45", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "The State Department's global database for issuing travel documents has crashed, resulting in major delays for potentially millions of people around the world waiting for U.S. passports and visas, officials said Wednesday.Unspecified glitches in the department's Consular...", "title": "Computer Crash Causes Major Delays in US Passport and Visa Operations", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/US-computers-glitch-Passports/2014/07/23/id/584562/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/US-computers-glitch-Passports/2014/07/23/id/584562/", "description": "The State Department's global database for issuing travel documents has crashed, resulting in major delays for potentially millions of people around the world waiting for U.S. passports and visas, officials said Wednesday.Unspecified glitches in the department's Consular...", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Computer Crash Causes Major Delays in US Passport and Visa Operations"}, "epoch": 1406152605, "keywords": "US, computers, glitch, Passports, delay", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2014-07-23T21:56:45"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/US-computers-glitch-Passports/2014/07/23/id/584562/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The State Department's global database for issuing travel documents has crashed, resulting in major delays for potentially millions of people around the world waiting for U.S. passports and visas, officials said Wednesday.Unspecified glitches in the department's Consular..."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5ba8\"", "article_summary": "\"We apologize to applicants and recognize this may cause hardship to applicants waiting on visas and passports.\nThe State Department's global database for issuing travel documents has crashed, resulting in major delays for potentially millions of people around the world waiting for U.S. passports and visas, officials said Wednesday.\nShe said the problem is worldwide and not specific to any particular country, citizenship document, or visa category.\nThe database is the State Department's system of record and is used to approve, record and print visas and other documents to ensure that national security checks are conducted on applicants.\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly or identify the country."}
