Maryland Hospital Association, $665,000\n\n2. National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, $459,000\n\n3. Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce, $459,000 (See comment at bottom for clarification.)\n\n\n\n4. Maryland Retailers Association, $448,000\n\n5. CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield, $405,000\n\n6. Maryland Bankers Association, $386,000\n\n7. Comcast, $363,000\n\n8. Johns Hopkins Institutions, $353,000\n\n9. Maryland State Education Association, $351,000\n\n10. Baltimore Jewish Council, $342,000\n\nAnother 22 employers spent more than $200,000 for the year from Nov. 1, 2012 to Oct. 31, 2013, and 74 employers spent more than $100,000, according to the Common Cause analysis.\n\nThe total compensation paid to the 148 lobbyists listed in the report was over $37 million. Almost $2 million was spent by these lobbyists on dinners, receptions and other events for legislators. Lobbyists are not allowed to take individual legislators out to dinner, but they may invite whole committees, delegations or the entire legislature.\n\nThe 10 highest grossing lobbyists were:\n\n1. Timothy Perry, $1,531,107\n\n2. Gerard Evans, $1,392,500\n\n3. Robin Shaivitz, $1,390,165\n\n4. Joel Rozner, $1,293,263\n\n5. Gregory S. Proctor, $1,176,456\n\n6. Michael Johansen, $1,025,011\n\n7. Robert Enten, $1,002,266\n\n8. Nicholas Manis, $964,350\n\n9. Lisa Harris Jones, $934,625\n\n10. John Stierhoff, $920,294\n\nThese numbers reflect gross billing by lobbyists, and include the money they spend on associates, support staff, offices and other expenses.\n\n\u201cWhile lobbyists have a role to play, with these top lobbyists reporting over $37 million in income \u2013 and a growing cadre of former elected officials and upper level staff joining the ranks of the lobbying corps \u2013 we are concerned that the voice of special interests is growing louder than the voice of constituents,\u201d said Jennifer Bevan-Dangel, executive director of Common Cause Maryland. \u201cWe support legislation to strengthen training and reporting requirements for lobbyists and to slow down the revolving door from public servant to private lobbyist.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over $32 million was spent last year lobbying state government, and the health care industry was the top spender at $7.1 million, according to State Ethics Commission reports.
