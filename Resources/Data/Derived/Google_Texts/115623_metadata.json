Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., has introduced the Tax Code Termination Act (HR 27), which would do exactly that.\n\n\u201cEven though tax reform has been discussed for many years, we have yet to see any major actions to simplify the tax code,\u201d Goodlatte said in a press release.\n\n\u201cWe must force Congress to tackle tax reform head on. The best way forward is to scrap the current tax code and start fresh. This legislation would allow us, as a nation, to collectively decide what the new tax system should look like. There are many competing alternatives, but having a set date to end the current tax code will force the issue and the debate to the top of the national agenda.\u201d\n\nColin Hanna, president of Let Freedom Ring, a conservative organization that supports the proposal, said the sunset date was chosen so the question of whether to scrap the system and start over could be part of the 2016 presidential campaign but the debate over what comes next would not occur until after the election.\n\nThis way, he said, those on the right who want a simpler, flatter code and those on the left who want to make it more progressive both could find a way to support Goodlatte\u2019s legislation, which has 78 co-sponsors.\n\n\u201cWe are very carefully not pushing any particular replacement plan,\u201d Hanna told The Daily Signal. \u201cOur goal is to achieve unity from all proponents of fundamental tax reform.\u201d\n\nHanna said if Democrats come to see they have a good chance to retake the Senate in 2016 they may welcome an opportunity to rewrite the code from scratch. \u201cSome progressives might well see sun-setting the current code as the best first step on the way to greater progressivity in the tax code,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they come to that conclusion, I would welcome it as serendipity.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, he has reached out to the two declared Republican presidential contenders\u2014Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, who both favor replacing the current tax system with a simpler tax code. He intends to reach out to candidates in both major parties.\n\n\u201cI see real opportunity to impact the presidential race and to start a national conversation, and I think we set the right date,\u201d Hanna said. \u201cIf we push it too far out, it doesn\u2019t create a sense of urgency, but if we were to set it too soon then it might create uncertainty and instability in the financial markets.\u201d\n\nBut Curtis Dubay, a tax and economic policy analyst with The Heritage Foundation, was less certain of the strategy. Although he \u201csees no harm,\u201d in getting members of Congress on record who support reform, he would prefer to see elected officials follow through with an alternative to the current tax code.\n\n\u201cIf they are going to go through the energy of sunsetting the tax code, why not reform the tax code?\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be two congresses between now and 2019, so what happens in the current Congress is not binding on the next. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\nBut Hanna insisted \u201cstarting over from scratch\u201d is the way to go.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of proposal that can prompt some introspective thought on the part of those who are serious about reform,\u201d Hanna said. \u201cThose who have particular target dates in mind for more incremental reforms, and those who favor a flat tax or other alternative, will conclude that starting from a blank slate is a whole lot easier than beginning with a 4 million-word tax code that\u2019s longer than the Bible. First, sunset the current system. Then, the rest can follow.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supporters hope legislation in the House that would sunset the tax code at the end of 2019 can garner support on both sides of the political aisle.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Supporters hope legislation in the House that would sunset the tax code at the end of 2019 can garner support on both sides of the political aisle.", "title": "Should We Start From Scratch on Taxes?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SunsetTaxFeat.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-09T15:10:02+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OemHsj"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Supporters hope legislation in the House that would sunset the tax code at the end of 2019 can garner support on both sides of the political aisle.", "title": "Should We Start From Scratch on Taxes?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SunsetTaxFeat.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2015-04-09T13:49:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-09T15:10:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bob Goodlatte, Colin Hanna, Let Freedom Ring, Curtis Dubay, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, tax reform,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbebb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf they are going to go through the energy of sunsetting the tax code, why not reform the tax code?\u201d he said.\nFew people in either party in Washington are happy with the current tax code, so what if we simply started over?\nThe best way forward is to scrap the current tax code and start fresh.\nRand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, who both favor replacing the current tax system with a simpler tax code.\nRep.
