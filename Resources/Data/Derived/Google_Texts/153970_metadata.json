It\u2019s a job that she likes and she\u2019s grateful for, but she\u2019s wondering whether she can do better for herself.\n\nA1 Diner employee Jessica Barker has been a waitress in Gardiner for about 10 years, but she is considering other options to ensure a more secure financial future. Jessica Lowell/Kennebec Journal Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nOne national evaluation suggests that Maine is a good place for Barker and women like her to live and work.\n\nWalletHub, a source of personal finance tools and information for consumers and business people developed by Evolution Finance, issued its 2016 Best and Worst States for Women at the start of this month. The timing is no coincidence. Every March \u2013 Women\u2019s History Month \u2013 ushers in a spate of lists, reports and studies that offer looks into the lives of women.\n\nIn WalletHub\u2019s evaluation, Maine ranks fourth in the nation overall, thanks to the state\u2019s results for Women\u2019s Economic and Social Well-Being rank (6) and the Women\u2019s Healthcare and Safety rank (10).\n\nWalletHub applied different weights to 15 metrics, such as median earnings for female workers, women\u2019s preventive health care and women living in poverty, to come up with Maine\u2019s snapshot.\n\nSomewhere in all that data is the experience of women such as Barker and Eryne Thibeau, a former co-worker of Barker\u2019s who now runs her own business.\n\nBarker grew up in Bangor and now commutes to Gardiner from Brunswick. She got started in food service by working at Wendy\u2019s at 16. As she looked around the industry, she realized that waitressing is one of the better-paid gigs to have. When the weather is good and the tourists are stopping for meals, it\u2019s very, very good.\n\n\u201cIn the summer, you have to live it up and work hard and save your pennies for winter,\u201d Barker said.\n\nThe path that Thibeau, 34, has taken is not so different. She has delivered pizzas, waited on tables and worked in retail. Five years ago, she started her own business, Quality Green Cleaning, in Gardiner.\n\nBarker said she knows it\u2019s time for a change, and she\u2019s taking steps to make one. She plans to take a class in radiology. Her hope is to go to school for two years and get a job where there is a retirement package, health care and paid days off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful for my job, but it\u2019s kind of a job for a younger lady,\u201d she said.\n\nEliza Townsend, executive director at the Maine Women\u2019s Lobby \u2013 a membership organization that promotes the well-being of Maine women \u2013 takes a deeper dive into the data like that considered by WalletHub, and she sees areas where Maine needs work.\n\n\u201cMaine has traditionally been a leader in setting policies that benefit women and families. We had a family leave act five years before it was passed by Congress,\u201d Townsend said. Maine has also adopted a number of policies that address domestic violence, among other things.\n\n\u201cMaine is one of the states that has not accepted federal funds that would allow us to insure 70,000 more people under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen who lack health insurance are far less likely to get the preventive care they need,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Maine, she said, women make up the majority of people over 65, and the poverty rate for people older than 65 is 40 percent.\n\n\u201cCertainly, people don\u2019t live in poverty in their old age out of choice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an accumulation of policies, including education, earning capacity and whether women stepped out of the workplace to care for family members, either children or parents.\u201d\n\nThese are things that both Barker and Thibeau think about.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see women be able to take time off when they have a baby,\u201d Barker said. She\u2019d also like to see paid sick leave; without it, workers like her have to stay home and forgo pay or go to work and risk spreading germs.\n\nIf Barker pursues radiology, it\u2019s likely she will have paid time off and the ability to save for retirement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to wait tables until I am 80,\u201d Barker said. \u201cThere was a lady here working who was in her 80s.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "But the executive director of the Maine Women's Lobby sees areas where the state needs work.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "But the executive director of the Maine Women's Lobby sees areas where the state needs work.", "title": "WalletHub website rates Maine 4th best for women - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/813779_313832-Jessica-Barker.jpg", "height": 832}, "updated_time": "2016-03-05T20:52:37-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/03/05/site-rates-maine-4th-best-for-women/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "But the executive director of the Maine Women's Lobby sees areas where the state needs work.", "title": "WalletHub website rates Maine 4th best for women - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/813779_313832-Jessica-Barker.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2016-03-05T20:26:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-05T20:52:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Eliza Townsend, executive director at the Maine Women\u2019s Lobby \u2013 a membership organization that promotes the well-being of Maine women \u2013 takes a deeper dive into the data like that considered by WalletHub, and she sees areas where Maine needs work.\nIt\u2019s a job that she likes and she\u2019s grateful for, but she\u2019s wondering whether she can do better for herself.\nJessica Lowell/Kennebec Journal Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192One national evaluation suggests that Maine is a good place for Barker and women like her to live and work.\nIn Maine, she said, women make up the majority of people over 65, and the poverty rate for people older than 65 is 40 percent.\n\u201cMaine has traditionally been a leader in setting policies that benefit women and families."}
