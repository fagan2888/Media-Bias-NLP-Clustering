"Star Wars: The Force Awakens" has marched confidently into the new year, raking in an additional $88.3 million and topping the box office for a third week, according to studio estimates Sunday.

In the first weekend of 2016, the record-busting film blew past the domestic grosses of both "Jurassic World" and "Titanic" to become the second-highest earner of all time with $740.3 million in just 19 days of release. The top domestic film is still "Avatar" with a $760.5 million lifetime domestic gross.

The Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell comedy "Daddy's Home" came in second with an estimated $29 million, bringing its total to $93.7 million. Quentin Tarantino's bloody Western "The Hateful Eight" took third with $16.2 million in its first weekend in wide release.
