His latest book is: \u201c The Power of RELENTLESS! \u201d Dubbed by the media as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist,\u201d Wayne is a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, international business speaker, serial entrepreneur and conservative media personality \u2013 appearing on over 5,000 interviews in the past five years. Wayne\u2019s web site: ROOTforAmerica.com .\n\nMy new book, \u201cThe Murder of the Middle Class\u201d paints a picture of economic devastation throughout America.\n\nBecause of big government overreach, onerous taxes, debt, regulations, lawsuits and increased Internal Revenue Service attacks on business, the odds of starting a new business and succeeding have been badly damaged. This is precisely why there is a severe shortage of new full-time, middle class jobs.\n\nSmall business traditionally created a majority of new jobs, yet small business is under withering attack by the Obama administration, the judicial system, and our political class.\n\nI can quote hundreds of factual statistics proving the American economy is in severe decline.\n\nRecently, we learned American household wealth has declined by over one-third in only 10 years. Over the same time electricity, water, fuel, food and tax costs have soared by as much as over 100 percent.\n\nBut why deal with sterile statistics? Let\u2019s go right to the source. Let\u2019s hear the reason for the decline of American business direct from a mega successful businessman who has \u201cboots on the ground.\u201d\n\nWayne Gorsek is the quintessential American entrepreneur. He has lived the American Dream.\n\nRaised and adopted by his grandparents (who lived in a 14-foot by 70-foot single-wide mobile home), Gorsek started a tiny vitamin company in Springfield, Illinois out of a basement in 1994. He grew his small company into the most successful online vitamin retailer in the world. His company became one of the few in history to earn \u201cINC 500 Hall of Fame\u201d status. For 15 years, Gorsek\u2019s company grew at a remarkable 50 percent a year pace, and by thousands of percent over 15 years.\n\nGorsek was living the American Dream. He took his company public on NASDAQ in 2009 for a $320 million valuation. Along the way he gave well over 1,000 Americans a full-time job with good middle class wages and benefits. Many of his employees and investors made a fortune when his company went public, the average return to investors was measured in the thousands of percent. Gorsek retired at the age of 42 and bought not one, but two new private jets and earned two single pilot jet ratings.\n\nHis story is a living, breathing example of how capitalism, combined with hard and smart work can produce extreme success for everyone involved.\n\nBut today, Gorsek has a new story and a message every American needs to hear. Unfortunately, his updated story is proof positive that no recovery is coming, no middle class jobs rebound is possible.\n\nHere is the eye-opening Part II of this story. Gorsek was bored by retirement and decided to get back in the game. He took about $26 million of his own money and started two new vitamin companies called Dr. Vita and Nature\u2019s Lab (you\u2019ve seen the brand at Costco). His company also manufactures Martha Stewart\u2019s new vitamin brand sold at Walgreens.\n\nThat\u2019s where the story gets interesting.\n\nGorsek describes how things have changed the second time around:\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that there are 92 million working-age Americans no longer working and even worse 108 million are now on one or multiple forms of welfare. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that for the first time in history more businesses are failing each day than starting. I\u2019ve now seen the reasons for the murder of the middle class up close and personal.\u201d\n\nGorsek says things have changed dramatically since he started his first company in 1994 and not for the better:\n\n\u201cI have found it three times more expensive and far more stressful and difficult compared to 20 years ago. The differences are stunning. I did not have to risk $26 million of my own money to build a state-of-the-art vitamin manufacturing facility in Las Vegas. I didn\u2019t have to\u2026 but I wanted to. I did it to create jobs; to lower vitamin prices and significantly improve the formulations with MADE IN USA vitamins for consumers; and to help turnaround the economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget my timing,\u201d he said, \u201cI made the decision to invest $26 million during the worst economy since the Great Depression. Shouldn\u2019t entrepreneurs and financial risk-takers like me be thanked and rewarded? Instead I feel demonized, denigrated, targeted and punished. Fear and uncertainty of the government is reason number one why there is a lack of quality full time jobs.\u201d\n\nBut Gorsek sees many more problems:\n\n\u201cA trillion a year in welfare spending incentivizing people not to work has made it hard to find quality employees. Why work when you can stay home, sleep late and collect dozens of different welfare checks, free food, free cell phones, free health care and many other freebies from government? Then there are the much higher income taxes and capital gain taxes; employment taxes, hundreds of thousands of pages of onerous regulations, fees and fines; plus the lawyer and accounting costs to comply with a maze of city, county, state and federal laws\u2026 Now add in Obamacare, the biggest job killer ever. Because of the massive costs of Obamacare, many employers have no choice but to layoff employees, or create only part-time low wage jobs. When I started my prior company in the 1990s health care costs were $1 trillion per year, they are now at nearly triple that insane level to $2.8 trillion per year. Lastly, the ease for employees to file frivolous lawsuits is truly a disgrace. Lawyers are job killers, but guess who runs government and makes the laws? Lawyers. It just doesn\u2019t pay to risk your money to start a business anymore when the chance of failure is now near 100 percent and the government has monopolized the wealth and power to the Fortune 1,000 companies (because they are the only ones that can afford to \u2018pay to play\u2019).\u201d\n\nGorsek\u2019s advice is simple, if only our political leaders would listen:\n\n\u201cIf Americans fail to elect politicians that will actually reduce taxes and regulations, and make it harder to file frivolous lawsuits (with loser pay laws), as well as reduce the size and spending of government, while providing incentives for businesses creating the jobs, you will see the continued decline of the U.S. economy, the death of good jobs and the murder of the middle class. We\u2019re staring at the end of the American Dream.\u201d\n\nPriceless, common-sense advice from a proven business builder and job creator who has tried it twice, and who sees the stark differences in America today.\n\nGorsek\u2019s conclusion is simple: Because of these changes, the second time around is much more difficult, if not impossible. At this moment in time, the American dream, small business and the middle class are being murdered.\n\nWayne Gorsek wanted me to end this story by reminding everyone to only buy \u201cMade in USA\u201d brands whenever possible to support those companies creating jobs in the USA.\n\nWayne\u2019s latest book is: \u201cThe Murder of the Middle Class\u201d.
