Moses, president of the Center for Long-Term Care Reform in Seattle. Moses is skeptical that the IRS would even consider long-term care costs as a hardship withdrawal, because the government agency has not historically looked favorably upon long-term care insurance.\n\n\n\nRead More: Men Pay 15% Less than Women for Long-Term Care Insurance\n\n\n\n\u201cLong-term care insurers are struggling,\u201d Moses said. \u201cThey have had to raise premiums, and they\u2019ve gotten criticized for that but private industry insurance companies are doing what they can to pay an increasing number of claims.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmerican Association for Long-Term Care Insurance (AALTCI) Executive Director Jesse Slome notes that any incentives to support long-term care planning would come by way of addressing the looming Medicare/Medicaid shortfall. \"Adding any tax incentives will generate heightened interest in long-term care insurance, but because of the need to offset lost tax revenues, they are hard to come by in today's environment,\" Slome said.\n\n\n\nUnder current 401(k) plan hardship withdrawal rules, significant medical expenses are covered, but unlike loans, hardship distributions are not repaid to the plan. Instead, a hardship distribution permanently reduces the employee's account balance under the plan.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that the conversation between healthcare spends and retirement spends are intersecting,\u201d said Harry Dalessio, senior vice president of sales and strategic relationships with Prudential. \u201cRegulators and legislators will ultimately determine what 401(k) accounts will be used for, but it\u2019s important for people to save regardless if it\u2019s used for retirement, education expenses, long-term care costs or medical expenses.\u201d\n\n\n\nA full retirement snapshot created by most financial advisors includes health care expenses and increasingly long-term care costs, but plan sponsors compartmentalize long-term care expenses and retirement planning separately.\n\n\n\n\u201cLong-term care planning is an important piece of retirement, but I wouldn\u2019t tie the two together as a plan sponsor,\u201d said Jamie Greenleaf, principal with Cafaro Greenleaf in Red Bank, N.J. \u201cBoth are expensive. Retirement can be a bit easier to budget for and long term care is a variable.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead More: Genetics Could Spike the Cost of Long-Term Care Insurance\n\n\n\nInsurers are also increasingly concerned about paying more long-term care claims to women policy holders than men. \u201cWe have to worry more about the women than the men because women outlive men,\u201d said Kelley Greene, head of retirement content strategy with BlackRock. Women accounted for two-thirds of the $6.6 billion in long-term claims paid by insurers in 2013, according to AALTCI data, and more than 60% of adults have a negative emotion associated with discussing their long-term care plans and aging needs.\n\n\n\n\u2014Written for MainStreet by Juliette Fairley", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "401(k) plan hardship rules could include tax-free withdrawals for long-term care expenses.", "author": "Juliette Fairley", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "401(k) plan hardship rules could include tax-free withdrawals for long-term care expenses.", "title": "401(k) Withdrawals Could Keep Tax-Free Status When Used to Pay Long-Term Care", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/401k-withdrawals-could-keep-tax-free-status-when-used-to-pay-long-term-care", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/longtermcareinsurance-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/longtermcareinsurance-mslarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "long term care insurance, 401k plan, retirement, single premium annuities, withdrawal rules, tax free, distribution", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "distribution", "published_time": "2014-12-01T08:16Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1598405"}, "date": "2014-12-01T08:16Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 12968602, "twitter": {"description": "401(k) plan hardship rules could include tax-free withdrawals for long-term care expenses.", "title": "401(k) Withdrawals Could Keep Tax-Free Status When Used to Pay Long-Term Care", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/401k-withdrawals-could-keep-tax-free-status-when-used-to-pay-long-term-care", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/longtermcareinsurance-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/longtermcareinsurance-mslarge.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "long term care insurance, 401k plan, retirement, single premium annuities, withdrawal rules, tax free, distribution"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4c92\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTNEW YORK (MainStreet) \u2014 If long-term care insurers have their way, 401(k) withdrawals would maintain their tax-free status when money is used to pay the monthly cost of long-term care insurance or to purchase single premium annuities.\nMoses is skeptical that the IRS would even consider long-term care costs as a hardship withdrawal, because the government agency has not historically looked favorably upon long-term care insurance.\nRead More: Men Pay 15% Less than Women for Long-Term Care Insurance\u201cLong-term care insurers are struggling,\u201d Moses said.\nUnder current 401(k) plan hardship withdrawal rules, significant medical expenses are covered, but unlike loans, hardship distributions are not repaid to the plan.\n\"Adding any tax incentives will generate heightened interest in long-term care insurance, but because of the need to offset lost tax revenues, they are hard to come by in today's environment,\" Slome said."}
