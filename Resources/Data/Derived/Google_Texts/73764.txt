After closing the Jungle, the nationâ€™s largest homeless camp, officials in San Jose, Calif., are aggressively cleaning out other encampments before they grow. The San Jose Mercury News reported that more than 200 homeless sites have been counted in San Jose over the last 12 months. Last weekend, workers cleared out 15 to 20 people who had set up a makeshift tent city on a lot beneath a downtown overpass. Starting in early November, homeless people set up tents, started fires for cooking and warmth, and left mounds of trash in the area. Now the fence surrounding the lot has been repaired and reinforced with razor wire. In early December, officials cleared out the last of roughly 200 people who had been living in the Jungle, a 68-acre encampment in central San Jose. Some of those people were moved into subsidized housing and others have been given rental subsidy vouchers. The city also is close to housing some homeless people in motels. Last week, the county Board of Supervisors asked the city to research ways to expand shelter space as well as possibly buying prebuilt mini-homes, something that has been tried in other cities as an alternative to shelter beds.
