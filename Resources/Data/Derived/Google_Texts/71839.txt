Jimmy Fallon spotlights the many facial expressions of President Obama on ‘The Tonight Show’

Jimmy Fallon certainly has a knack for capturing the many faces of President Obama.

During a recent episode of “The Tonight Show, Fallon unveiled a segment that showcased Obama’s best and lesser known facial expressions.

“Obviously, the president is very busy and he’s been all over the news lately,” began the “Tonight Show” host. “So, there’s tons of photos of him and the one thing I’ve noticed is that he has a very expressive face. It’s like he has thousands of different facial expressions, one for every occasion.”

Instead of spotlighting Obama’s “classic” expressions — like one Fallon labeled “the determined yet hopeful” — the comedian zeroed in on some new unique facial contortions that the president has been sporting as of late.

Here, you will find the President of the United States in all his facially expressive glory:

The “Sup, playa?”:

The “I’m not drunk, yer the one who’s drunk!”:

The “Nom nom nom nom nom”:

The “You read ’50 Shades of Grey’ how many times? Girl, you nasty!”:

The “Heeeeey!”:

The “Alright, buddy, calm down — it wasn’t that funny”:

The “Whoop, definitely wasn’t about to take a smoke break”:

The “Hello my baby, hello my honey, hello my ragtime gal!”:

If anything can disprove President Obama’s statement that he doesn’t like photo ops, this is it. Watch the clip from “The Tonight Show” below.
