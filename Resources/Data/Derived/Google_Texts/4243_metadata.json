Burwell was very different than what we saw two years ago on Hobby Lobby. The focus was almost entirely on whether the \u201caccommodation\u201d offered to religious nonprofits constitutes a substantial burden on those employers\u2019 religious free exercise. Indeed, much of the argument involved a dispute over how exactly the \u201caccommodation\u201d works and whom it burdens \u2013 not simply whether adequate alternatives were available.\n\nBut getting past these technicalities of instance regulations, the result looks to be the same as what we saw regarding for-profit corporations: the progressive justices are in lockstep for the government, the conservatives support the religious-liberty claimants, and Justice Kennedy is in the middle but almost certainly leaning towards the conservatives. Of course, after Justice Scalia\u2019s passing, that suggests that the vote will be 4-4 \u2013 meaning an affirmance of conflicting lower-court rulings and a Schroedinger\u2019s mandate that lives on in some of the country but not the rest.\n\nThe Court could avoid this untenable result \u2013 as well as the messy casuistry and the culture-war battle \u2013 by following the administrative-law line suggested by Cato in our amicus brief. We argued that the Department of Health & Human Services simply lacked the authority to create law in this sensitive area. As Josh Blackman and I write in the current issue of The Weekly Standard:\n\nConveniently, there\u2019s an alternate argument, based on the Hobby Lobby and King rulings, that could command a majority opinion: The agencies lack both the expertise and power to exempt some religious groups while forcing others\u2014deemed \u201cless\u201d religious\u2014to be complicit in what they consider sin. By rejecting this bureaucratic assertion of executive authority, Zubik can thus be resolved without further politically fraught haggling over RFRA.\n\nIn other words, if Congress had imposed this regime, that would\u2019ve been one thing, but we cannot assume that the Congress that passed Obamacare \u2013 including especially the pro-life Democrats whose votes were essential \u2013 delegated such awesome power to administrative agencies without saying so explicitly.\n\nAlas, the Court didn\u2019t seem at all interested in that nifty solution, and so, rather than releasing that impossible tie, what we\u2019re likely to see is a setting of Zubik for reargument at a time when the Court gets its ninth justice. That means we\u2019ll be doing this all again next year, when it really will be deja vu all over again.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "Today's argument in Zubik v.
