First came an ad boasting a candidate’s ability to castrate hogs; then, an ad featuring the destruction of the Affordable Care Act by gunfire followed. But J.D. Winteregg may have just taken home the prize for strangest campaign ad this year.

Winteregg, a tea party-backed candidate who is challenging House Speaker John Boehner in next month’s Ohio primary, released an ad on Sunday that parodies an erectile dysfunction medication commercial.

The ad opens with videos of happy couples riding bikes and grooming a horse. “You make a great team, it’s been that way since the day you met,” a voiceover says. “But your electile dysfunction? It could be a question of blood flow.”

The remedy to “electile dysfunction”? According to Winteregg, it’s him: “Used on a daily basis, Winteregg in Congress will help you every time the moment is right to have your voice heard at the federal level. When using Winteregg, it’s important to note that the borders will be secured, Second Amendment rights protected, Obamacare and Planned Parenthood will be defunded, and common sense will be used in solving the nation’s problems.”

The ad also features shots of Boehner smiling and golfing alongside President Obama, while the voiceover criticizes the House speaker for being unable to “maintain a spine in the face of liberal opposition.” Winteregg ends the ad by noting that he himself does not golf.

The May 6 Ohio primary is expected to draw about 85,000 Republican voters, according to the Daily Caller, who interviewed Winteregg about his new ad. “The intent is to nationalize this thing,” Winteregg said. “[Boehner’s] everyone’s speaker. He’s my representative, yeah, but he’s America’s speaker. We want to get my name out there and tell people there’s an alternative.”
