Oates will handle the forwards and Stevens will oversee the defense, Lamoriello said at a news conference before Saturday\u2019s morning skate.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go on the bench to make sure it works for now,\u201d Lamoriello said. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique way of approaching things.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere will be no official head coach for the rest of the season. Lamoriello plans to remain on the bench \u201cuntil I feel comfortable with the situation.\u201d\n\n\n\nDeBoer was fired Friday with the Devils languishing nine points out of the last playoff spot in the Eastern Conference at 12-17-7. The three-headed coaching staff debuts Saturday night at the New York Rangers.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to feed off each other,\u201d Oates said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t work together. Everything happened pretty quickly. But when Lou calls, the answer is always \u2018Yes.\u2019 It didn\u2019t matter what my responsibility would be.\u201d\n\n\n\nOates went 68-47-17 in two seasons with the Capitals and spent two years with the Devils as an assistant coach, helping them reach the Stanley Cup finals in 2012. He played 19 years in the NHL, including a stint with the St. Louis Blues, when he was teammates with Stevens. Oates had 341 goals and 1,079 assists in his career and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have tremendous respect for each other,\u201d Oates said. \u201cWe worked together here. We both played here and coached here, so it\u2019s an easy transition for us. It\u2019s kind of a collaboration right now. It\u2019s a team effort and we\u2019re all on the same page.\u201d\n\n\n\nStevens spent 13 seasons with the Devils, much of it as captain. He had 196 goals and 712 assists during his career, leading the Devils to Stanley Cup championships in 1995, 2000 and 2003. He was an assistant coach with the team until the start of this season, when he had philosophical differences with DeBoer.\n\n\n\n\u201cAdam and I are going to try to get this righted,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe have to get the Devil identity back. I\u2019ll make sure to work with the defense and Adam will work with the forwards. He\u2019s already been a head coach, so it will be a good transition. In my opinion, it will be a great challenge, but we both love great challenges.\u201d\n\n\n\nLamoriello made his league-record 14th coaching change.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never easy in this league,\u201d Lamoriello said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long 48 hours, but you have to do what you feel is right.\u201d\n\n\n\nLamoriello said that it wasn\u2019t fair to ask another coach to take over a floundering team midway through a season.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we didn\u2019t even consider anyone else,\u201d Lamoriello said.\n\n\n\n\u201dBoth of these individuals know our players, know the philosophy that we want,\u201d he added. \u201cIt makes sense. I know it\u2019s unique and different, but right now, it\u2019s our way of moving forward. I\u2019m totally confident with the setup.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oates, fired by the Capitals in April after two seasons with the team, will be part of a unique situation in New Jersey, where he will coach the team's forwards.", "Author": "Jim Hague", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Oates, fired by the Capitals in April after two seasons with the team, will be part of a unique situation in New Jersey, where he will coach the team\u2019s forwards.", "title": "Former Capitals coach Adam Oates hired by Devils to serve as co-coach", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/27/former-capitals-coach-adam-oates-hired-devils-serv/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/13/f12fce2726fa580a4e0f6a7067009ac5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/13/f12fce2726fa580a4e0f6a7067009ac5.jpg", "title": "Former Capitals coach Adam Oates hired by Devils to serve as co-coach", "description": "Oates, fired by the Capitals in April after two seasons with the team, will be part of a unique situation in New Jersey, where he will coach the team's forwards.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Lou Lamoriello, Scott Stevens, New Jersey Devils, Pete Deboer"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf077\"", "article_summary": "Former Washington Capitals coach Adam Oates, ex-Devils assistant and star defenseman Scott Stevens and general manager Lou Lamoriello will split duties on the bench.\nOates will handle the forwards and Stevens will oversee the defense, Lamoriello said at a news conference before Saturday\u2019s morning skate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a unique way of approaching things.\u201dThere will be no official head coach for the rest of the season.\nHe was an assistant coach with the team until the start of this season, when he had philosophical differences with DeBoer.\nNEWARK, N.J. \u2014 The New Jersey Devils are replacing the fired Pete DeBoer with a three-headed coaching staff."}
