Several F1 teams are struggling financially.\n\nHaas is the founder of the Stewart-Haas NASCAR team based in North Carolina. He also operates one of the world\u2019s most sophisticated wind tunnels for the testing of car aerodynamics, which would aid any new F1 entry.\n\nHe\u2019s the owner of Haas Automation, which is one of the largest machine tool builders in the world. Haas said his company currently does $1 billion in annual sales, and he believes entering Formula One could help him double that number.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re trying to individually sell machines. We\u2019re trying to make people aware of Haas Automation as a company,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to bring our awareness up and Formula One is even more important because half our sales are outside the country. So we think Formula One would be a really great way of bringing us awareness and increasing our sales.\u201d\n\nBut Haas said he\u2019s running out of time to get a team ready for the 2015 season.\n\n\u201cWe needed to know about two months ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Mr. Ecclestone says that we\u2019re accepted and the FIA issues us some kind of notice in the next few weeks, then we can entertain 2015. But if we lose another month, I don\u2019t think we could do it.\u201d\n\nHis team would be based in North Carolina, next to the existing NASCAR shop. A possible barrier to Haas\u2018 involvement in F1 could be a set of standards FIA applies to those involved at high levels of ownership and management. Haas has a conviction for tax evasion and related charges.\n\nA U.S. team was initially admitted to F1 in 2010 but lacked the funding and development to join.\n\n___\n\nAP Auto Racing Writer Jenna Fryer contributed to this report from Fort Worth, Texas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone says a U.S.-backed team led by NASCAR's Gene Haas is among two new teams likely to join the series next season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone says a U.S.-backed team led by NASCAR\u2019s Gene Haas is among two new teams likely to join the series next season.", "title": "US team among 2 new entrants set for F1 in 2015", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/6/us-team-among-2-new-teams-set-for-f1-in-2015/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/06/d584f3ec86ff920d500f6a706700fa85.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/06/d584f3ec86ff920d500f6a706700fa85.jpg", "description": "Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone says a U.S.-backed team led by NASCAR's Gene Haas is among two new teams likely to join the series next season.", "card": "summary", "title": "US team among 2 new entrants set for F1 in 2015"}, "Author": "CHRIS LINES", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Bernie Ecclestone, Gene Haas, Haas Automation, Formula One, Nascar"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4350\"", "article_summary": "Several F1 teams are struggling financially.\nA U.S. team was initially admitted to F1 in 2010 but lacked the funding and development to join.\nHaas is the founder of the Stewart-Haas NASCAR team based in North Carolina.\nA possible barrier to Haas\u2018 involvement in F1 could be a set of standards FIA applies to those involved at high levels of ownership and management.\nAt the NASCAR race in Fort Worth, Texas, Haas said he had not heard from Ecclestone or the governing body."}
