ESTIMATING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF SANDERS PROGRAMS:\n\nAlan Harvey, IDEAeconomics, Standard Fare or Fantasy Economics? An excellent and vigorous defense of the plausibility of Friedman\u2019s growth projections and a useful summary of the debate, including Christina and David Romer\u2019s intervention into it. Among the telling points he makes in support of the plausibility 5+% growth rates with the kinds of big, big programs Sanders is suggesting: the fact that \u201cthe average growth rate under Democratic presidents prior to Barack Obama was 4.2 percent.\u201d Gee, Friedman estimates a few years of growth 1.1 percentage points higher than the average growth rate under pre-Great Recession Democratic presidents, and suddenly puppies are flying?\n\nHere are some of Harvey\u2019s useful points about the Romers\u2019 critique:\n\n\u201cRomer criticized Friedman for confusing stocks and flows, suggesting \u2013 as I understand it \u2013 that the Friedman analysis projected multipliers too far into the future. The multiplier is the increment of new activity produced by an investment or government spending program. The stimulus money spent is income to workers and businesses, who each save some, but spend most,\n\nwhich becomes income to other workers and businesses and results in further spending. \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cChristina Romer is uniquely qualified to discuss overreach in projections, since she was chair of the CEA during the Obama stimulus period and famously forecast an immediate reduction in unemployment that did not materialize. [Ouch!] This failure was seized upon by Republicans to discredit government stimulus entirely. We can, of course, look back and see the economic effects, which were substantial. But because they did not match the projection, the theory of the projectors suffered. \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cRomer appears to suggest in the Wolfers piece that multipliers act only during the period of stimulus spending, and she faults Friedman for misunderstanding stocks and flows. It should be obvious, however, that a measure which provokes additional private investment can claim credit for economic activity induced by that additional investment. If Ms. Romer is suggesting otherwise, she is wrong.\u201d\n\nIn a nice turn of phrase, Harvey suggests that, contra Larry Summers\u2019 mantra, in the midst of the debates about the appropriate level of stimulus, that stimulus should be \u201ctimely, targeted and temporary,\u201d Sanders\u2019 proposed stimulus is (as it should be) \u201csubstantial, strategic and sustained.\u201d\n\nJames K. Galbraith, Boston Globe, The kerfuffle over Sanders\u2019 economic plan. A summary similar to his other pieces, but in a forum that will have reached a much broader audience.\n\nJames K. Galbraith, interviewed on the Real News Network, Attacks on Sanders Economic Plan By Former CEA Chairs Are Irresponsible. Some nice detail in this interview, conducted by TRNN\u2019s Sharmini Peries, that hasn\u2019t appeared in his earlier written statements. The summary: \u201cSo what we had here was a, what was essentially an academic exercise that produced a result that was highly favorable to the Sanders position, and showed that if you did an ambitious program you would get a strong growth response. It\u2019s reasonable, certainly, for the first three or four years that that would transpire in practice. And what happened was that people who didn\u2019t like that result politically jumped on it in a way which was, frankly speaking, professionally irresponsible, in my view. It was designed to convey the impression, which it succeeded in doing for a brief while through the broad media, that this was not a reputable exercise, and that there were responsible people on one side of the debate, and irresponsible people on the other.And that was, again, something that\u2013an impression that could be conveyed through the mass media, but would not withstand scrutiny, and didn\u2019t withstand scrutiny, once a few of us stood up and started saying, okay, where\u2019s your evidence, on what are you basing this argument? And revealed the point, which the Romers implicitly conceded, and I give them credit for that, that in order to criticize a fellow economist you need to do some work.\u201d\n\nMichael S. Gordon, Boston Globe, Socialists, look to economists at UMass Amherst for support. In light of the huge uptick in the number of people in the U.S. who call themselves \u201csocialists\u201d (see below), this headline isn\u2019t as snide or marginalizing as it might have seemed a couple of years ago. Look for an uptick in applications to the UMass-Amherst econ department from all those millennial Berniegals and -bros.\n\nAnnie Lowrey, New York magazine, Who\u2019s Winning the Great Bernie Magic-Math Battle? Follow up to an earlier piece (something of a hit piece) by Lowrey, Bernie Sanders Has Started Thinking Like a Republican (where Bernie is \u201cthinking like a Republican\u201d because \u201cHe has no interest in garnering respectability and credibility among Establishment Democrats,\u201d with the suggestion that he is willing to make unrealistic promises). Despite her continued use of the derogatory and tendentious term \u201cmagic math,\u201d the more recent piece is more favorable to Friedman:\n\n\u201cThe truth is that it seems impossible for Sanders\u2019s economic plans to do what Friedman thinks they would. But the whole debate has underscored that our current growth rates are as much a function of policy as they are of anything else, and that we need not resign ourselves to growing at 2 percent a year, year after year. Maybe the technocrat wonks are right. But maybe Hillary Clinton should be promising to try for 5 percent growth herself. Smarter policies \u2014infrastructure investment, early childhood education, making work pay, rebuilding the safety net, declining to raise interest rates and choke off a recovery \u2014 would all help bolster the economy. Five percent growth over a decade might be fantastical, but 5 percent in a few years might not be.\u201d\n\nTwo pieces I had missed on the keruffle:\n\nMark Thoma, The Fiscal Times (Feb. 23), Here\u2019s Why Bernie Sanders\u2019 5% Growth Plan Isn\u2019t Crazy After All. Another prominent left-leaning economist weighing in on Friedman\u2019s side. Thoma quotes former Minneapolis Fed chair (whose blog posts I linked to in my last post):\n\n\u201cNarayana Kocherlakota argues \u2018that there are good reasons to believe that, with appropriate stimulus, it would be possible to achieve growth outcomes of around 5-6 percent per year for the next four years.\u2019 But we won\u2019t know unless we try. The inflation risk is minimal, and we owe the households who have struggled so much during the recession and the long, drawn out recovery the best possible chance we can give them of finding a decent job.\u201d\n\nGreg Ip, Wall Street Journal (Feb. 19), To Match Lofty Growth Goals, Presidential Candidates Need Better Plans. Discussion of what Ip views as overly optimistic growth promises from both Sanders and Republicans; an early criticism of Friedman\u2019s report, but he appears to have actually read it: \u201cMr. Friedman claims a big deficit-financed stimulus, increased entitlements and redistribution would achieve this. That seems implausible; Barack Obama, after all, did all three (though by less than Mr. Sanders would), and labor-force participation and productivity growth have trended down. Indeed, in theory, increased social transfers and marginal tax rates tend to reduce labor-force participation, and increased regulation hurts productivity growth.\u201d He concludes: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with outside-the-box thinking. That\u2019s what got the U.S. out of the Great Depression. But so far, what the candidates have offered doesn\u2019t measure up. Either more realistic goals or far more unorthodox thinking is in order.\u201d Sounds good\u2013let\u2019s go for much bigger stimulus and government intervention than Sanders is calling for!\n\nRelated Items on Candidates\u2019 Health Care Proposals (or Lack Thereof):\n\nBeverly Mann, Angry Bear, Clinton Announces When She Will Disclose Her Healthcare Insurance Improvement Plan: She\u2019ll announce it just as soon as the Republican presidential candidates tell us theirs. (Via Naked Capitalism.) See also Ben Mathis-Lilley, Slate, Hillary Clinton Doesn\u2019t Have a Practical Plan, or Any Plan, for Universal Health Care Coverage. So much for \u201cpragmatism.\u201d As David Sirota pointed out on Twitter, in its efforts to hitch Clinton to Obama\u2019s parade, the Clinton campaign sometimes overstates Obama\u2019s achievements, including on health care: \u201cSee this quote from Clinton campaign, then note that 30+ million don\u2019t have health insurance:\u201d\n\nFind this statement on Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign site, here. So maybe the reason Clinton doesn\u2019t seem to have a plan to make health care universal is that she believes her own false claim that it is already universal (and affordable\u2013which Obamacare isn\u2019t either).\n\nIs Clinton much better than Trump on this score? See Roy Poses, Health Care Renewal blog, It Has Come to This? \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cTruly Absurd,\u201d \u201cWord Salad,\u201d \u201cGibberish\u201d Health Care Policy. (This also via Naked Capitalism.) This piece makes fun of the \u201cword salad\u201d and \u201cgibberish\u201d in Trumps debate answers about health care, mostly endless repeating that he will \u201cget rid of the lines between states.\u201d More recently, though, Trump has gone beyond revisionist cartography by posting more details about his health care reform ideas on his website. Besides repeal of Obamacare and \u201c[m]odify[ing] existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines,\u201d the reform plans include allowing taxpayers to deduct premium payments, plus health savings account. Standard \u201cfree-market\u201d fare, but trust him, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be great.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders\u2019 plan has gotten more scrutiny than Clinton\u2019s and Trump\u2019s non-plans. In an earlier post I mentioned the piece from WashPo Wonkblog, Study: Bernie Sanders\u2019s health plan is actually kind of a train wreck for the poor. This is the one that only cited Kenneth Thorpe\u2019s study, and not the critiques of it by Friedman and by Woolhandler/Himmelstein. Where\u2019s the scrutiny for Clinton\u2019s failure to explain how she\u2019s going make Obamacare truly universal?\n\nOur current issue, which just went out to e-subscribers and is being mailed soon to print subscribers, includes a column by Gerald Friedman on Sanders\u2019 health care proposals. I\u2019ll post that to the website soon\u2013probably next week.\n\nSeveral pieces about the leftward shift in U.S. politics (without a corresponding leftward shift among establishment elites):\n\nGertrude Schaffner Goldberg and Sheila D. Collins, HuffPo, Diminishing Expectations: For Whom? Great piece by two friends of D&S (see Trudy Goldberg\u2019s Jan/Feb 2015 cover story, Where Are Today\u2019s Left Movements?: What we can learn from the millions who demonstrated for jobs, government relief, and collective bargaining rights in the 1930s). The first paragraph gives the lie to Clinton\u2019s claim to be the best candidate for people of color: \u201cIn a debate with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Senator Sanders referred to the achievements of the Nordic countries in providing such things as universal health care and free higher education as models for the United States. Secretary Clinton responded by saying, \u2018I love Denmark, but the United States is not Denmark.\u2019 What does that mean? The allusion is not to insufficient economic resources but to unrealistic political expectations. Sometimes the excuse or barrier is our \u2018diversity.\u2019 In the final analysis, one might infer from that explanation that we would extend these benefits if it didn\u2019t mean that they would be provided to persons of color, immigrants or other groups somehow regarded as alien and undeserving.\u201d (Clinton\u2019s remark about Denmark is another example of how easily she picks up right-wing talking points against social-democratic goals; this is on par with her criticisms of Sanders for promising \u201cfree stuff\u201d and her promise not to raise taxes on the middle class (which would make it hard to replace premium-supported Obamacare with a tax-funded single-payer system).)\n\nThis piece reads well alongside Doug Henwood\u2019s Post-Hope Democrats, which I linked to in an earlier post.\n\nHarold Myerson, The Guardian, Why are there suddenly millions of socialists in America? \u201cIt used to be a dirty word. Bernie Sanders helped remove the stigma \u2013 but it\u2019s the spectacular failure of capitalism that has really changed people\u2019s minds.\u201d An excerpt:\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign has made clear that many Democrats are inclined to vote for a candidate who proclaims himself a democratic socialist, but even more dramatic and consequential are the many Democrats who say they\u2019re socialists themselves. In a poll on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, more than 40% of likely Democratic caucus attendees said they were socialists. In a Boston Globe poll on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, 31% of New Hampshire Democratic voters called themselves socialists; among voters under 35, just over half did. And in late February, a Bloomberg poll of likely voters in the Democratic primary in South Carolina \u2013 South Carolina! \u2013 showed that 39% described themselves as socialists.\n\n\u201cFavorable views of socialism aren\u2019t limited to Sanders supporters. The 39% of South Carolina Democrats who call themselves socialists exceeded by 13 percentage points the number who actually voted for Sanders. In a New York Times poll last November 56% of Democrats \u2013 including 52% of Hillary Clinton supporters \u2013 said they held a favorable view of socialism. Nor was this sway toward socialism triggered by Sanders\u2019s candidacy: as far back as 2011, a Pew poll revealed, fully 49% of Americans (not just Democrats) under 30 had a positive view of socialism, while just 47% had a favorable opinion of capitalism.\u201d\n\nSee also: Peter Beinart, The Atlantic, Why America Is Moving Left. An interesting piece, but hard to follow because of the author\u2019s use of the term \u201cliberalism\u201d to mean \u201cleft,\u201d and the author\u2019s suggestion that Obama is liberal/left, as in this thesis statement: \u201cThere is a backlash against the liberalism of the Obama era. But it is louder than it is strong. Instead of turning right, the country as a whole is still moving to the left.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t he instead say that there is simultaneously a left-wing backlash against neoliberal Obama, and a right-wing reaction against that backlash (and against whatever socially liberal elements or imagined \u201cleft\u201d or \u201csocialist\u201d elements there are in the Obama administration)?\n\nEthan Young, Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung, A Political Revolution for the U.S. Left. Much better piece. \u201cThe U.S. Left is in the process of emerging from decades of decline. It entered the Obama years in terrible shape: politically incoherent, cut off from its historical continuity, and organizationally and socially fragmented. Yet in the last years there have been signs of awakening, and in the past few months a new progressive insurgency has appeared, piercing public consciousness in a way not seen in generations.\n\n\u201cThe most distinctive form this insurgency takes is the Bernie Sanders campaign for the Democratic Party nomination for president in 2016. Sanders is the first self-proclaimed socialist to win a national audience since Eugene V. Debs ran as the Socialist Party\u2019s presidential candidate in the early 20th century, and the size of his base is arguably greater than that of any socialist leader in U.S. history.\u201d\n\nTwo pieces on the Democratic primaries:\n\nJim Naureckas, FAIR/Extra! blog, NYT Works Hard to Present Primary Race as More Boring Than It Is. This is a searing critique of the NYT\u2019s post-Super Tuesday piece that originally bore the headline \u201cWins for Sanders in Liberal Strongholds,\u201d but eventually read Minority Voters Push Hillary Clinton to Victories. As Naureckas rightly points out, it\u2019s ridiculous to call Oklahoma and Colorado \u201cliberal strongholds.\u201d\n\nCorey Robin, from his blog, Super Tuesday: March Theses. Republished at the Jacobin website as The Primary Isn\u2019t Over (whose title I would have edited to \u201cThe Primaries Are Not Over\u201d). Excellent points about how the Super Tuesday results are not as good for Clinton as many have suggested. After Super Tuesday, Clinton has ten states and Sanders has five, but: \u201c[t]he elections in Nevada, Iowa, and Massachusetts were either close or extraordinarily close. A little bit more time here, a little bit more organizing there, and they could easily have tipped his way. In other words, Sanders could very easily have seven states now to Clinton\u2019s eight. He doesn\u2019t, and coulda shoulda woulda is just that. But what this does mean, going forward, is that we have the opportunity to turn potential into actual. We\u2019ve got time, we\u2019ve got organizing, we\u2019ve got money: let\u2019s make use of it all.\u201d Others have pointed out that Clinton\u2019s wins on Tuesday were in the south, states which (with the exception of Virginia) neither Democrat would be likely to win in the general election. So Sanders\u2019 wins in Oklahoma and Colorado may be more significant. What\u2019s more, in the 2008 Democratic primaries, Clinton won CA, NY, NJ, MA, FL, CA, PA, TX, and a bunch of smaller states, and still lost to Obama, as this map shows:\n\n(*Remember that the delegates assigned from the MI and FL primaries were disqualified, because those states held their primaries earlier than the DNC allowed. Still, the rest of the states I listed are big states.) This surely had to do partly with the (small) margins by which she won those big states and the (large) margins by which she lost the less populous states that Obama won. But all this is to say that it is far from clear that Clinton will inevitably win the primaries. As Robin says, \u201cClinton\u2019s strongest weapon is the aura of inevitability that she and her supporters and the media have concocted around her.\u201d I would add that one of her weaknesses may be a sense of complacency among her supporters about the upcoming primaries; Sanders supporters can take advantage of that by heeding Robin\u2019s advice to make use of the time, money, and organizing that we have on our side. (I myself canvassed in NH and MA and will make phone calls to likely Democratic voters in upcoming primary states. Maybe you should too.)\n\nShare this: Email\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The D&S Blog", "description": "More posts related to the kerfuffle over our columnist Gerald Friedman's report\u00a0WHAT WOULD SANDERS DO?
