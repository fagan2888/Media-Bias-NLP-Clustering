An Alabama man filed a lawsuit against a hospital this week after he said he went to the medical facility for a routine circumcision and awoke to learn that his penis had been amputated instead.

The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in Jefferson County Circuit Court, according to AL.com. The Urology Centers of Alabama, the Simon-Williamson Clinic and two doctors are listed as defendants.

“When the plaintiff … awoke from his aforesaid surgical procedure, his penis was amputated,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that the man “never gave consent for the complete or partial amputation of (his) penis.”

The procedure was performed in June, according to the lawsuit, but an exact date was not specified.

It noted that the man was never told why his penis was amputated nor advised beforehand that the procedure presented such risks.

The lawsuit also claims the man has suffered greatly because of the mistake. It additionally notes that his wife has grown more distant from her husband as a result.

According to AL.com, the lawsuit did not specify an exact amount in damages being sought. The Alabama publication added that requests for comment to the medical facilities were not successful.
