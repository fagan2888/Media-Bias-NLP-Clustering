Literary executor Bill Hamilton has likened the corporate giant to the Ministry of Truth, the oppressive organization responsible for creating propaganda in Orwell\u2019s classic dystopian novel \u201c1984.\u201d\n\nThe slam is a response to Amazon\u2019s invocation of Orwell\u2019s 1936 essay \u201cReview of Penguin Books,\u201d which Amazon referenced in a letter to readers to defend their tactics. The retailer wrote: \u201cThe famous author George Orwell came out publicly and said about the new paperback format, if \u2018publishers had any sense, they would combine against them and suppress them.\u2019 Yes, George Orwell was suggesting collusion.\u201d The letter then analogized Orwell\u2019s argument to e-books, saying, \u201cWell\u2026 history doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.\u201d\n\nHowever, as the New York Times, the New Yorker, Tech Crunch, the Guardian and others have noted, Amazon mischaracterized Orwell\u2019s quote and missed the irony of his words. The novelist wrote the opposite: he supported paperbacks.\n\n\u201cThe Penguin Books are splendid value for sixpence, so splendid that if the other publishers had any sense they would combine against them and suppress them. It is, of course, a great mistake to imagine that cheap books are good for the book trade,\u201d he wrote. With cheaper books, \u201cProbably you will buy three sixpenny books and spend the rest of your five shillings on seats at the \u2018movies\u2019,\u201d he suggested, explaining, \u201cHence the cheaper the books become, the less money is spent on books. This is an advantage from the reader\u2019s point of view and doesn\u2019t hurt trade as a whole, but for the publisher, the compositor, the author and the bookseller it is a disaster.\u201d\n\nGeorge Packer wrote in The New Yorker, \u201cAmazon\u2019s broader argument is disingenuous. Hardly anyone\u2014certainly not the big publishers\u2014is saying that e-books should be suppressed,\u201d instead, the current dispute is over how \u201cthe market and profits should be divided.\u201d\n\nWhile Packer was hesitant to call Amazon\u2019s actions outright Orwellian, writing that the \u201cpoor, much-abused term should be reserved for special occasions, like North Korea,\u201d Orwell Estate literary executor Bill Hamilton had no qualms with characterizing Amazon as Orwellian. In a letter to the New York Times published today, Hamilton wrote of Amazon\u2019s campaign: \u201cThis is about as close as one can get to the Ministry of Truth and its doublespeak: turning the facts inside out to get a piece of propaganda across.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amazon misquoted the \"1984\" novelist in a letter to its readers.
