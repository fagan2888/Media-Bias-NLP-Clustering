The Macedonia Primitive Baptist Church hosted members of the National Primitive Baptist Convention Sunday night.

Harold Batts, chairman of the Publishing Board, says it's now time for the Publishing Board meeting, but since not everyone can attend, many members met in Birmingham, got on a bus and drove to Meridian for a special service. He says it's the first time they've done this, but they were excited for the invitation to fellowship.

"It's outreach and building that relationship and camaraderie with members of the same faith. We haven't had the opportunity to come where we are or come to national meetings, so we brought a portion of the national meeting here."

The Board of Director's meeting goes on in Birmingham through this Wednesday.
