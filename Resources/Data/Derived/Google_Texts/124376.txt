Every Christmas season the Bay County Sheriff's Office helps provide gifts for children in need through Project 25. This weekend Harley Davidson is hosting an event that will benefit this cause.

Project 25 has been providing toys to children for 34 years. They accept new, unwrapped toys or monetary donations to provide toys for kids in need.

Closer to Christmas BCSO goes to Wal-Mart and uses the funds collected to go shopping for toys to give to underpriveleged children for Christmas.

The Sheriff's Office has teamed up with Harley Davidson to host a car show in which those entering in the car show donate a new, unwrapped toy as their entrey fee. It will be held at Harley Davidson's Back Beach Road location this Saturday, November 29th.

If you would like aid from Project 25 in providing Christmas for your family call the bay County Sheriff's Office at 747-4700.
