Protesters blocked one of Wichita's busiest intersection tonight as they marched in support of Michael Brown. Earlier this week, a grand jury did not induct a Ferguson, Missouri police officer for shooting and killing Brown. This sparked violence in the town near St. Louis.

Tonight people with signs lined Rock Road this evening with the hope of bringing awareness to fix racial profiling within Wichita.

"we just want to continue to do things like this, kind of in a flash motion so we can make sure that we continue to get our voices heard and try to get some of the things that a promised to us set in motion," Community activist A.J. Bohannon said.

At one point in the evening, protesters even blocked the intersection of Kellogg and Rock Road. Police were on scene requesting they follow the traffic rules. Many other there say these protests are all about peace and awareness.

"being peaceful just shows that look we want to get our point across but we are going to be professional about it and we're going to control ourselves," protester Auriel Brown said.

At the end of the day, many of these demonstrators say they're proud to stand up for their beliefs.

"I'm not afraid to go to the jail for what I believe in. I will be on the right side of history," protester Micaela Keys said.
