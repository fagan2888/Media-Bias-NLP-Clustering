Our work also suggests a real opportunity to equalize these racial differences.\u201d\n\nComparing massive amounts of data\n\nEvidenced-based treatment guidelines for most cancers have been developed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Recent studies suggest that minorities tend to receive cancer care from hospitals that adhere to the network\u2019s guidelines at lower rates. Other studies show a clear relationship among the location of care, cancer deaths and racial disparities in survival. However, many cancer registries have no details about the types of treatment a patient receives. Rhoads and her fellow researchers combined cancer registry data, California hospital characteristics and patient-discharge data to compare details about patients\u2019 cancer and survival rates with the hospitals\u2019 financial and structural characteristics and details about the treatments the patient received.\n\n\u201cThere was a unique opportunity to link data sets in such a way that you can look at this problem in a really different way,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author, Laura Schmidt, PhD, MPH, professor of health policy at the University of California-San Francisco.\n\nThe study compared colon cancer treatment and outcomes across races for patients receiving care within integrated and nonintegrated health-care systems. The study considered 33,593 white, black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific islander patients who, between 2001 and 2006, were diagnosed with colon cancer and began treatment at any of 348 California hospitals. The researchers followed the patients\u2019 progress for five years. For example, patients diagnosed in 2003 were followed until 2008. Among the hospitals included in the study, 35 percent were part of an integrated system and treated 19 percent of the patients.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a smoking gun.\n\nThe study relied on a combination of databases. The first was the California Cancer Registry, which includes information on all California patients diagnosed with all cancers, except for non-melanoma skin cancers. This database provided the patients\u2019 demographic data and their treatment history, including surgeries and chemotherapy; the number of lymph nodes examined after surgery; and how long they lived after being diagnosed. The data allowed the researchers to track whether patients received care recommended by the NCCN's Clnical Practice Guidelines in Oncology.\n\nThe other data was from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. It contained discharge information, including patients\u2019 additional medical problems and treatments received while in the hospital. The office also provides information about all California hospitals, including details about their location, size and other characteristics. This allowed the researchers to identify whether a patient was treated in an integrated or a nonintegrated organization.\n\nTreatment and outcome differences\n\nThe researchers directly compared similar groups treated in an integrated system with those treated in a nonintegrated system. Each patient received a propensity score that included their age, gender, race, cancer stage, socioeconomic status and presence of other diseases, called co-morbidities, that might affect their survival. The researchers matched patients with the same propensity scores across the two systems so that the only differences between them were where they were treated and the type of treatment they received.\n\n\u201cWe spend a lot of time in medicine framing the question as: What\u2019s wrong with the patient? Is the patient poor? Is the patient uninsured or presenting with more advanced disease?\u201d said Rhoads, who is also director of the Stanford Cancer Institute\u2019s Community Partnerships Program, which coordinates outreach for minority communities in the Bay Area. \u201cThis is an opportunity for health-care systems to look at themselves and ask: How can we impact disparities? What can we do differently to close the gap?\u201d\n\nThe study found that, in general, minorities treated in integrated systems received higher rates of evidence-based care for colon cancer than those minorities treated in nonintegrated systems. It also found that all patients in integrated systems survived at higher rates overall, and that there were no racial disparities in survival rates within the system.\n\nThis is an opportunity for health-care systems to look at themselves and ask: How can we impact disparities?\n\n\u201cIn integrated systems, there\u2019s already a big push to thinking about following evidence-based guidelines, so everyone within that system is in the same mindset,\u201d said co-author Manali Patel, MD, MPH, instructor of medicine in Stanford\u2019s Division of Oncology. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to do the right thing when you have the system-level support to do so.\u201d\n\nIntegrated health-care systems are well-suited for coordinating care among several specialists, which is another advantage for colon cancer patients because the treatment of the disease requires different types of therapies and different types of specialists, the study said. The majority of colon cancers will require surgery and, depending on the stage of disease, the patient may also require chemotherapy, which involves an additional doctor, a medical oncologist.\n\n\u201cOutside an integrated system, where the health care is fragmented, a patient must become his or her own advocate to piece together appropriate treatment,\u201d Rhoads said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about access to high-quality care\u2019\n\n\u201cThe paper\u2019s findings go a long way in reinforcing the notion that it\u2019s not just about access to care, but it\u2019s about access to high-quality care. And for colon cancer care, one of the tenets for high-quality care would be well-coordinated care,\u201d said Sandra Wong, MD, associate professor of surgery at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the study. \u201cWe know it\u2019s not just about getting insurance coverage, but actually getting people into health-care systems that coordinate cancer care well.\u201d\n\nThe researchers\u2019 next step is to compare outcomes for patients with other types of cancer, such as breast and lung cancer, across races. The findings of the colon cancer study are likely to be consistent across other cancer types, said Rhoads. While the racial disparities may not be completely eliminated, the study\u2019s findings suggest that equitable care delivery reduces the differences. The results also support policies that drive the development of integrated health-care models as envisioned by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWith health-care reform, millions more patients are coming into the system, and we\u2019re going to need to become more integrated in order to meet the demand. We\u2019re going to need to work more closely together, decrease variations in care and standardize what we do,\u201d Rhoads said. \u201cIn this paper, we have a model that shows that when you do this, you get better colon cancer outcomes for everyone.\u201d\n\nStanford biostatistician Yifei Ma is the other co-author of the paper.\n\nThe study was funded by the National Cancer Institute (grant 1R21CA161786) and a Harold Amos Medical Faculty Development award from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nInformation about Stanford\u2019s Department of Surgery, which also supported the work, is available at surgery.stanford.edu.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2015/01/evidence-based-care-eliminates-racial-disparity-in-colon-cancer.html", "image": "http://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm-news/images/2015/01/cancer-men.jpg", "site_name": "News Center", "description": "A new study finds that equitable delivery of evidence-based care eliminates the racial disparity in colon-cancer survival rates.", "title": "Evidence-based care eliminates racial disparity in colon cancer survival rates, study finds"}, "description": "A new study finds that equitable delivery of evidence-based care eliminates the racial disparity in colon-cancer survival rates.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce717\"", "article_summary": "The findings of the colon cancer study are likely to be consistent across other cancer types, said Rhoads.\nOther studies show a clear relationship among the location of care, cancer deaths and racial disparities in survival.\nThe study compared colon cancer treatment and outcomes across races for patients receiving care within integrated and nonintegrated health-care systems.\nRecent studies suggest that minorities tend to receive cancer care from hospitals that adhere to the network\u2019s guidelines at lower rates.\nIt also found that all patients in integrated systems survived at higher rates overall, and that there were no racial disparities in survival rates within the system."}
