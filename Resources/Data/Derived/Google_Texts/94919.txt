It’s only Sunday night and we already have a solid contender for the dopiest right-wing column of the week.

John Fund, formerly the useful idiot at the Wall Street Journal who now fills that role at National Review, has a new column tonight which suggests Donald Trump is a double agent of the left, out to show how silly conservatives are. Or something like that!

In a piece that reads as paranoid and bizarre as it accuses Trump of being, Fund argues that:

Just maybe Trump is a double agent for the Left. He is nearly a cartoon version of what a comedian such as Stephen Colbert considers a conservative — the kind of conservative Colbert played on Comedy Central until this year. He reinforces all the Left’s negative stereotypes of conservatives as ignorant blowhards.

We’d say that the right’s clown car of presidential candidates — oh, and National Review — did a pretty good job of that before Trump came along.
