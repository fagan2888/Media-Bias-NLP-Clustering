Sebelius: I 'made some mistakes'\n\nFormer Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius acknowledged Friday that she made mistakes leading up to the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, worrying too much about whether there\u2019d be a market for Obamacare and spending \u201ctoo little time clearly on the technology side.\u201d\n\n\u201cI sure made some mistakes along the way in terms of focusing on some things and not on others,\u201d she said at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Instead of confirming what she was being told about HealthCare.gov\u2019s readiness \u201cwas actually accurate and getting enough eyes and ears on that,\u201d she said she concentrated on the insurers, consumers and regulators who needed to come together in the health exchanges.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSebelius addressed several issues surrounding the health care law during the \u201cconversation\u201d she had publicly with Aspen Institute CEO Walter Isaacson. And she adamantly rejected the possibility that she\u2019d make another run for elective office back in Kansas, where she served more than a decade as a state lawmaker and then governor.\n\n( QUIZ: Do you know Kathleen Sebelius?)\n\n\u201cNot a chance,\u201d she said.\n\nSebelius compared the future of state-run health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion. It\u2019s unclear whether more states will create their own exchanges since the funding required is \u201cpretty daunting.\u201d But, she added, \u201cat this point, it really doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nMedicaid expansion, on the other hand, does matter quite a bit, she said, predicting that the financial case for expansion will ultimately overwhelm the politics for opposing it.\n\n( PHOTOS: Sebelius testifies on Obamacare rollout)\n\nAs for the overall structure of Obamacare marketplaces, Sebelius said insurers are fairly pleased and report surpassing their enrollment targets across age groups. Preliminary data on next year\u2019s premiums reveals increases that in many cases are well under the double-digit hikes critics projected \u2014 with some premiums actually decreasing.\n\nStill, HHS needs to carefully monitor parts of the country where the marketplaces aren\u2019t very robust and make sure that companies aren\u2019t driven out because of poor enrollment or older and sicker enrollees, she stressed. \u201cIt\u2019s important in states where the take-up has been relatively low \u2026 to prop up those companies so that you can wait a year or two and get the enrollment higher so that the market actually works.\u201d\n\nSebelius said she thought the political debate over the ACA would wind down after the law was passed, then after the Supreme Court upheld it and then again after President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection, but that \u201cnever happened.\u201d Republicans\u2019 continued opposition, and even resistance to making the law work is \u201cmost disturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve really never seen anything like this in my life,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd she skirted a question about whether the ACA will help or hurt vulnerable Democrats like Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu as they run in the midterm elections. But she said a debate about whether the government should provide health insurance to every American is \u201cwell worth having.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s widely derided remarks on Obamacare \u2014 that he\u2019d still repeal it but keep Kynect, the Kentucky health insurance exchange \u2014 offer \u201cthe best political insight\u201d on the law in recent months, Sebelius said. Bashing Obamacare in a state where 450,000 people have benefited is a \u201cdangerous\u201d approach, she said.\n\nSince stepping down from HHS in early June, life has been \u201cso far, so good,\u201d Sebelius allowed.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;I sure made some mistakes along the way,&quot; she says at the Aspen Ideas Festival.", "title": "Sebelius: I 'made some mistakes'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/kathleen-sebelius-obamacare-mistakes-future-108396.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/22/131022_kathleen_sebelius_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Kathleen Sebelius,Health Care,Aspen Ideas Festival,HealthCare.Gov", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "&quot;I sure made some mistakes along the way,&quot; she says at the Aspen Ideas Festival.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18cc\"", "article_summary": "( PHOTOS: Sebelius testifies on Obamacare rollout)As for the overall structure of Obamacare marketplaces, Sebelius said insurers are fairly pleased and report surpassing their enrollment targets across age groups.\nSebelius said she thought political debate over Obamacare would die down.\nSebelius compared the future of state-run health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion.\nSince stepping down from HHS in early June, life has been \u201cso far, so good,\u201d Sebelius allowed.\nSebelius: I 'made some mistakes'Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius acknowledged Friday that she made mistakes leading up to the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, worrying too much about whether there\u2019d be a market for Obamacare and spending \u201ctoo little time clearly on the technology side.\u201d\u201cI sure made some mistakes along the way in terms of focusing on some things and not on others,\u201d she said at the Aspen Ideas Festival."}
