But biologics can be made similar,\u201d said Rosenstock.\u201cIn the US, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, establishing an abbreviated pathway for FDA licensure of biological products demonstrated to be biosimilar to an FDA-licensed reference drug,\u201d he said.Rosenstock differentiated application of the term \u201cbiosimilar\u201d to LY IGlar within the US versus the rest of world, noting that because IGlar was approved as a drug by the US FDA through an NDA pathway (505), LY is required to go through a variant of NDA pathway 505 that also includes preclinical and clinical trials. \u201cFor this reason, LY in the US will not be designated by FDA as a biosimilar, although in most other geographies, it can be referred to as a biosimilar,\u201d he said.Rosenstock presented evidence from ELEMENT-2, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study comparing the safety and efficacy of LY IGlar to that of IGlar. Participants with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who had been inadequately controlled on two or more oral antihyperglycemic medications (OAMs) were enrolled in the trial, and received either LY IGlar or IGlar, with a total of 756 patients completing the study. Insulin-na\u00efve patients beginning the study had HbA1c levels \u22657.0% to \u226411.0%; those previously on IGlar had HbA1c \u226411.0%.The primary objectiveof the trial was to evaluate at 24 weeks whether LY IGlar was non-inferior to currently-marketed IGlar in reducing average blood sugar levels (HbA1c) from baseline. The designated criteria establishing non-inferiority was set to <0.4%. In a secondary efficacy objective, anti-insulin glargine antibodies were measured to establish an immunogenicity profile for LY IGlar.Both drugs delivered statistically significant (p", "article_metadata": {"description": "Study results presented at ADA 2014 show Eli Lilly's investigational long-acting basal insulin analog to have similar clinical efficacy in reducing HbA1c levels as a currently approved injectable insulin glargine product, with a comparable side effect profile.", "og": {"site_name": "MD Magazine", "description": "Study results presented at ADA 2014 show Eli Lilly's investigational long-acting basal insulin analog to have similar clinical efficacy in reducing HbA1c levels as a currently approved injectable insulin glargine product, with a comparable side effect profile.", "title": "Basal Insulin Therapy with Glargine Biosimilar Meets Non-Inferiority Criteria", "url": "http://www.hcplive.com/conference-coverage/2014-ada/basal-insulin-therapy-with-glargine-biosimilar-meets-non-inferiority-criteria", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v1_media/_upload_image/_thumbnails/diabetesinjection_large.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v2_media/_core/favi/ms-icon-144x144.png", "keywords": "ADA 2014, endocrinology, primary care, internal medicine, family practice, hospital medicine, diabetes, type 2 diabetes, insulin, insulin glargine, Lantus, HbA1c, biosimilar, hypoglycemia, pharmacy, basal insulin,clinical", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbea8\"", "article_summary": "In a secondary efficacy objective, anti-insulin glargine antibodies were measured to establish an immunogenicity profile for LY IGlar.Both drugs delivered statistically significant (p\nThe designated criteria establishing non-inferiority was set to <0.4%.\nParticipants with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who had been inadequately controlled on two or more oral antihyperglycemic medications (OAMs) were enrolled in the trial, and received either LY IGlar or IGlar, with a total of 756 patients completing the study.\nInsulin-na\u00efve patients beginning the study had HbA1c levels \u22657.0% to \u226411.0%; those previously on IGlar had HbA1c \u226411.0%.The primary objectiveof the trial was to evaluate at 24 weeks whether LY IGlar was non-inferior to currently-marketed IGlar in reducing average blood sugar levels (HbA1c) from baseline.\n\u201cFor this reason, LY in the US will not be designated by FDA as a biosimilar, although in most other geographies, it can be referred to as a biosimilar,\u201d he said.Rosenstock presented evidence from ELEMENT-2, a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind study comparing the safety and efficacy of LY IGlar to that of IGlar."}
