She said she\u2019s hearing reports of entire villages being destroyed in more remote areas.\n\nShe said there is no power or running water in the capital and that communication remains unreliable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still really quite dangerous outside. Most people are still hunkering down,\u201d she said. \u201cThe damage is quite extensive in Port Vila but there are so many more vulnerable islands. I can\u2019t even imagine what it\u2019s like in those vulnerable communities.\u201d\n\nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the impact and scope of the disaster caused by Cyclone Pam wasn\u2019t yet clear, but he feared the damage and destruction could be widespread.\n\n\u201cWe hope the loss of life will be minimal,\u201d he said during a World Conference on Disaster Risk and Reduction in Japan. The U.N. said it was preparing to deploy emergency rapid response units.\n\nThe president of Vanuatu, Baldwin Lonsdale, who was attending the conference, told participants: \u201cI do not really know what impact the cyclone has had on Vanuatu.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am speaking to you today with a heart that is so heavy,\u201d he said. \u201cI stand to appeal on behalf of the government and the people to give a helping hand in this disaster.\u201d\n\nMorrison said the winds seemed to peak between midnight and 1 a.m. Saturday. She said she was in a fully boarded-up cyclone-proof house but still spent a frightening night as a tree and a tin roof from a nearby home hit her house.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cyclone Pam leaves trail of destruction in Pacific\u2019s Vanuatu", "title": "Cyclone Pam leaves trail of destruction in Pacific\u2019s Vanuatu", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Cyclone Pam leaves trail of destruction in Pacific\u2019s Vanuatu", "title": "Cyclone Pam leaves trail of destruction in Pacific\u2019s Vanuatu", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/14/cyclone_pam_leaves_trail_of_destruction_in_pacifics_vanuatu/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/vanuatu-cyclone-pam.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cyclone Pam leaves trail of destruction in Pacific\u2019s Vanuatu", "title": "Cyclone Pam leaves trail of destruction in Pacific\u2019s Vanuatu", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/vanuatu-cyclone-pam.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nick Perry", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s still really quite dangerous outside.\n\u201cThe damage is quite extensive in Port Vila but there are so many more vulnerable islands.\n\u201cWe hope the loss of life will be minimal,\u201d he said during a World Conference on Disaster Risk and Reduction in Japan.\nShe said there is no power or running water in the capital and that communication remains unreliable.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 Winds from an extremely powerful cyclone that blew through the Pacific\u2019s Vanuatu archipelago were beginning to subside Saturday, revealing widespread destruction and unconfirmed reports of dozens of deaths as relief workers rushed to assess the damage."}
