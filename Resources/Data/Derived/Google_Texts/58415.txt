Cops Seize “Obamacare” Heroin Bundles In Massachusetts

News, GALLERY

Police in Massachusetts made an unusual bust last Friday (December 20), this after a routine traffic stop landed them well over 1,000 bags of heroin. What made the massive haul stand out most of all was that the bundles were wrapped and stamped with “Obamacare” labels.

A Massachusetts state trooper pulled over a car early last Friday after noticing the vehicle had several violations. After an investigation during the traffic stop, police uncovered 1,250 bags of the drugs with the “Obamacare” stamp as reported on the Massachusetts State Police Facebook page.

The car’s driver Tyler Robenstein, 23, of Colchester, Vt., was nabbed on a variety of charges including trafficking in heroin, conspiracy to violate the drugs laws, possession to distribute a Class A substance, speeding, unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle and failure to change lanes for an emergency vehicle.

Passengers Marquese Jones, 22, and Sherod Green, 24, both of Newark, N.J., and Ashley Beaulieu, 21, of Colchester, Vt. were all charged with trafficking in heroin, conspiracy to violate the drugs laws and possession to distribute a Class A substance.

Drugs bearing odd nicknames isn’t a new trend, as dealers use the tags to mark where the product hails from and its supposed quality. There’s also a heroin brand nicknamed after late Nirvana singer, Kurt Cobain.

The four men are currently being held and are awaiting a future court date to face sentencing.
