The topic never seems to lose its appeal for economists, consultants, academics, and journalists\u2014each trying to crack the code on the cryptic industry. The findings are typically the same: employees are overpaid, labor unions obstinate, airplanes expensive, fuel costs volatile, economies unpredictable, and regulations restrictive; weather, recession, travel scares, and war hurt business; and competition is high because internet websites allow passengers to lock in the cheapest possible airfares. However interesting this perennial debate is, it misses a key point: some people are making big money working for US airlines, just not employees.\n\nThe evidence indicates that while US air carriers may have floundered in the immediate post-9/11 period, airline executives managed to maximize their own profits without much trouble. As it turns out, putting in a few years as an airline CEO is an excellent ticket punch on the way up the corporate ladder. And, just like Wall Street bankers, airline executives seem to believe that as long as they lock in their own take, the market will sort out the rest. Meanwhile, at the same time that airline executives furloughed employees, eliminated pensions, and cut workers\u2019 wages and benefits, they authorized costly expenditures such as $200 million for legal advice and consulting fees during bankruptcy and merger, and $20 million for Business Education Training to acculturate employees. Even post-merger paint schemes came with a high price tag. At about $30,000 an airplane, most major airlines spent around $200 million stripping and repainting their fleet in the post-9/11 period.\n\nAlthough awareness of the details of these fiscal magic tricks may still be emerging for the general public, the high costs were not overlooked by airline employees. Ralph, a senior captain and former military pilot hired in the mid-1980s, noted how much has changed in the airline business during his tenure:\n\nThe business model was so badly broken after 1978, it probably took twenty years just to rationalize what kind of business this business wanted to be, and I think they\u2019re still doing it. But it has certainly become all about the MBAs and their management techniques. . . . We used to have people in this industry who loved this industry, who loved aviation, who wanted to build great companies. . . . And they have been supplanted by MBAs and professional managers\u2014we\u2019ve had seven CEOs at [my airline] since I\u2019ve been here. . . . We\u2019ve become just like every other business in America where the management teams and the board of directors float in and out and try to maximize \u201cshareholder value\u201d\u2014although it seems they shrink shareholder value as much as they maximize it. They certainly maximize their own value. That seems to be the only common theme.\n\nCaptain Jasper has thirty-five years of aviation experience and a valuable insider\u2019s perspective on industry developments and their cause, and he spoke similarly:\n\nDeregulation was a horrible mistake. . . . If you value commercial aviation as something that deserves the public trust, you\u2019ve got to regulate it. The only way to make it stable and sustainable is to regulate it. To make sure that greed doesn\u2019t drive where the industry\u2019s going. Unfortunately, for the last twenty years, that\u2019s all it\u2019s been: greed has driven where the industry has gone.\n\nCould things get even worse in the US airline industry if we don\u2019t change course soon? A look across the Atlantic at the Irish low-frills airline Ryanair gives us a glimpse into the possible future for US airlines.\n\nIn 2013, Ryanair Pilot Group, the pilots\u2019 union, developed a safety petition expressing concern about airline working conditions and air safety to be submitted to the Irish Aviation Authority. Rather than proactively addressing these deficiencies, Ryanair management instead warned pilots if they signed the document they risked dismissal. At most airlines this warning might have been discounted, however Ryanair pilots were fearful because they had recently been recategorized as \u201cself-employed\u201d subcontractors\u2014not airline employees. Thus, pilots were not provided a guaranteed salary, pension, or medical insurance and were required to pay for all their own business expenses from uniforms and ID cards to ground transport and hotel accommodations costs typically covered by airlines directly. Could employee subcontracting be the next cost-cutting strategy for US airlines too? Many US air carriers already employ the tactic for mechanics, caterers, and aircraft cleaners. Why not pilots?\n\nAs long as airlines appear safe on paper and airfares remain cheap online, no one seems to care much about employees\u2019 concerns. Seventy percent of pilots interviewed believe it is likely that a major airline accident will occur in the coming years due to post-9/11 airline cost cutting, and 24% think an airline crash is very likely. One captain I interviewed summed up the situation:\n\n[Airlines today aren\u2019t] doing things the right way. They are doing things that are economically expedient for them because they are foolish about safety. . . . We haven\u2019t had any [major airline] accidents. . . . But, I still say I think it\u2019s going to happen sometime. . . . Nobody would be surprised. We would all go back and look at the data and say, \u201cYeah, of course.\u201d\n\nJust like Wall Street before the 2008 financial industry implosion, risks have been escalating in the US aviation industry, and airline employees today are primed for the next crash. However, general awareness of this growing problem has been spreading only gradually. Most of us now recognize that 9/11 did not create this airline industry instability\u2014weak regulatory oversight, ineffective managerial strategies, and self-serving executives did. It is time to stop allowing profit seeking to trump safety concerns and to reconceptualize the idea of air safety before it is too late. So what should be done to address this problem now?\n\nMajor US airlines need a new business paradigm. In the current environment, any air carrier that does not follow the crowd into downsizing, cost cutting, and merger will be annihilated by the others, particularly air carriers allowed to operate for years under bankruptcy protection. What seemed to be economies of scale provided by these large airlines and their vast networks have become burdens of size in the new flexible economy.\n\nAlthough not a new theoretical construct, per se, conscious capitalism has made a resurgence in the literature over the past decade, with American business scholars calling for improved ethics, sustainability, servant leadership, and value-driven decision making. The underlying argument is that companies can do well financially while also behaving ethically, creating sustainability in their market. By subscribing to five characteristics, companies can be purpose driven and create benefit not only for shareholders but for employees, customers, the community, and the environment.\n\nFirst, companies need a higher purpose. Company profitability needs to be directed toward a greater end than making CEOs wealthy, as was the case with early airline pioneers who tried to create a safe and reliable aviation industry for America. Second, airlines must commit to meeting the needs of all stakeholders, including employees and customers, not just investors. Any passenger who has flown commercially over the last decade knows what a frustrating and dismal experience air travel has become. Third, executives must integrate ethics, social responsibility, and sustainability into their core business strategies. Fourth, airlines must foster a healthy organizational culture through a strong sense of community. And fifth, CEOs and senior managers must become \u201cservant-leaders,\u201d committed to the long-term health of the company, not celebrity names passing through on the way to their next impressive title and seven figure paycheck.\n\nSouthwest Airlines has been touted as a good example of conscious capitalism, and it is a great airline. However, for several reasons, Southwest\u2019s low-frills model will never work for major US air carriers and, after chasing after this image since airline deregulation in 1978, it is time for government policymakers to face this fact. For example, Southwest keeps training, maintenance, and other overhead costs down by flying one type of aircraft on largely short-haul point-to-point routes to airports in cheaper cities on the outskirts of major metropolitan areas. In contrast, major airlines fly a variety of domestic and international routes, which requires a range of airplane sizes to meet different operational needs. It cannot be done with just one type of airplane.\n\nLarger aircraft require a different infrastructure than Southwest\u2019s planes do, such as longer runways capable of supporting more weight, ground obstacles to clear wider wingspans, terminal jetways to meet higher airplane doors, and refueling capabilities to meet high international fuel loads. Many smaller airports cannot accommodate this, so major airlines must land at bigger airports with higher landing fees. In addition, flying a variety of aircraft requires different training protocols and larger stockpiles of spare parts. The list of expensive challenges goes on. However, these are unavoidable costs for major air carriers. Southwest\u2019s 737s are never going to fly from the United States to Europe, Asia, or the many other international destinations passengers demand.\n\nYet, that does not mean that major airlines cannot follow Southwest Airline\u2019s example of conscious capitalism. It would be to their benefit. A 2009 book about US air carriers after 9/11 found that the managers who paid attention to the connection between relational reserves and financial reserves before and during the crisis best contributed to organizational resilience after the crisis. More specifically, this book explained why Southwest\u2014an air carrier that has never furloughed employees\u2014recovered the fastest of all US airlines after 9/11, while United and US Airways\u2014air carriers that laid off the most employees\u2014recovered the slowest. By 2005, Southwest\u2019s stock traded at 92 percent of its pre-9/11 level, while United and US Airways stock remained at 12 percent and 23 percent, respectively.\n\nA key difference during the post-9/11 period was Southwest\u2019s \u201cemployees first\u201d philosophy. As CEO Jim Parker observed, \u201cWe are willing to suffer some damage, even to our stock price, to protect the jobs of our people.\u201d This prioritization of employees\u2019 rights over shareholder interests is obviously in opposition to many managerial strategies and economists\u2019 opinions. However, Southwest\u2019s founder Herb Kelleher explained it this way: \u201cNothing kills your company\u2019s culture like layoffs. [It is] shortsighted.\u201d In contrast, refraining from furloughing, particularly when times are tough, \u201cbreeds loyalty,\u201d \u201ca sense of security,\u201d and \u201ctrust.\u201d As a manager, he said, \u201cyou want to show your people that you value them and you\u2019re not going to hurt them just to get a little more money in the short term.\u201d\n\nIn order for major airlines to accomplish this shift to conscious capitalism, there are three major areas warranting immediate attention: government, regulators, and the flying public.\n\nGovernment\n\nThe US government has had a love-hate relationship with aviation from the beginning. While foreign countries were eager to invest in and develop their commercial airlines, the United States was dragged reluctantly into supporting the fledgling industry through airmail and other subsidies. This ambiguous beginning in some ways colors government\u2019s engagement even today. Nevertheless, a country of the size and wealth of the United States needs a strong and vibrant commercial air transportation infrastructure to support interstate commerce and the travel needs of its citizens, as well as for national defense in wartime. To support this safe and vibrant industry, America needs a national aviation policy that addresses all its needs\u2014not a one-size-fits-all business model. It\u2019s time to recognize that Alfred Kahn\u2019s deregulation experiment has run its course and that the federal government should at least partially re-regulate the airline industry. It is in every American\u2019s best interest to increase safety and decrease risk, and government action is required because, just like Wall Street, airline executives have shown they can\u2019t\u2014or won\u2019t\u2014control themselves.
