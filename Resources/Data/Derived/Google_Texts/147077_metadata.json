Dr. Britton Trabert, a researcher at the NCI\u2019s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics who led the investigation together with Dr. Nicolas Wentzensen, said that the findings add to the growing list of benefits associated with the over-the-counter drug. \u201cOur study suggests that aspirin regimens, proven to protect against heart attack, may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer as well,\u201d she explained.\n\nPrevious studies have noted a possible relationship between chronic or persistent inflammation and carcinogenesis, the initiation of cancer growth. In theory, this would mean that anti-inflammatory medication like aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) would help fend off the development of the disease. However, results have typically been inconclusive.\n\nThe new study, which is published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, sought to clarify this by looking at a large sample including 8,000 women diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 12,000 without the disease. The team found that women who reported daily aspirin use had a 20 percent lower risk of ovarian cancer compared to women who said they used the analgesic less than once a week. Moreover, women who took aspirin only once a week had a 10 percent lower risk of the disease compared to women who took it less frequently.\n\nDaily Aspirin and Side Effects\n\nDespite numerous benefits, it is important to remember that a daily aspirin carries potential consequences as well. An example is a University College London study published last year, in which researchers show that taking the daily maximum dose of analgesics like aspirin may make you exceed your daily recommended sodium intake. Over time, this may raise your risk of stroke by as much as 16 percent.\n\nFor this reason, the NCI is refraining from issuing public health recommendations, even though effective preventive strategies against ovarian cancer are becoming more and more important. Trabert and colleagues caution that, until more detailed results can be obtained, women should always consult with their doctors before undertaking a daily aspirin regimen. \u201cHowever intriguing our results are, they should not influence current clinical practice,\u201d they wrote. \u201cAdditional studies are needed to explore the delicate balance of risk-benefit for this potential chemopreventive agent, as well as studies to identify the mechanism by which aspirin may reduce ovarian cancer risk.\u201d\n\nSource: Trabert B, Wentzensen N, et al.
