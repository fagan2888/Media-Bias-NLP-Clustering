In a draft-day, in-house video about what it was like for GM David Poile on the floor of the Wells Fargo Center, Poile is shown discussing a trade that eventually happened with the Pittsburgh Penguins \u2013 James Neal to the Preds and Patric Hornqvist and Nick Spaling to the Pens.\n\nThe interesting part for Avs fans: Penguins GM Jim Rutherford is shown telling Poile that he \u201chas a deal for No. 23\u201d in his back pocket already, but that he might re-arrange things if the deal with Nashville goes through. The holder of the No. 23 pick at the draft? That would be the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nSo, it\u2019s clear that the Avs were talking trade with the Penguins at the draft before the Avs wound up keeping the No. 23 pick and the Preds did their deal with Rutherford.\n\nWhat was the trade the Avs had with Pittsburgh? That\u2019s not clear at this point. It may never be known. It might have just been a swapping of the 23 pick for the Penguins\u2019 22 pick. Very possible, although good point here by one of my Tweeps:\n\n@adater They talk about the Pens having both 22 and 23 and moving them for 11. So it doesn't sound like Avs were trying to move up 1 spot. \u2014 Aman (@Sidhu6_) July 4, 2014\n\nI know that the Avs were concerned that Conner Bleackley might not be available at 23, so this might have been a chance at moving up a notch, and maybe the Avs would have thrown in something else to get Rutherford to do it. Or it might have been something bigger. There were rumors the Avs were interested in Neal, so that could have been it. P.A. Parenteau might have been part of that deal obviously, but he went to Montreal later.\n\nIf I find out exactly what the potential deal would have been, I\u2019ll pass it along. Until then, it is an interesting near-development.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Conner Bleackley,David Poile,P.A.
