He did not explain his decision to get out beyond saying that he was \u201cworking all the time.\u201d\n\nColorado GOP Chair Ryan Call said party officials have begun organizing a vacancy committee, hopefully to meet July 2, to appoint a Republican candidate to face Rep. Tracy Kraft-Tharp in November in the district covering portions of Westminster and Arvada.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the pleasure of talking to one of two candidates who are inspiring,\u201d Call said. \u201cWe have every confidence that Republicans will be able to field a credible candidate in the general election.\u201d\n\nRamirez served in the House for one term before Kraft-Tharp handily defeated him in 2012.\n\nSeveral races in Jefferson County, which is evenly split politically, have been targeted by the GOP for victory.\n\nRamirez\u2019s decision comes during the same week Liz Geisleman, former treasurer of the Jefferson County Democratic Party, filed a campaign finance complaint against Ramirez alleging that he failed to file 12 legally required campaign finance disclosure reports.\n\nGeisleman\u2019s complaint claims that Ramirez hasn\u2019t submitted a single report since filing his candidate affidavit in March. With the Secretary of State\u2019s Office levying fines of $50 a day for the violations, she alleges that Ramirez\u2019s campaign owes $12,300 in penalties.\n\nRamirez wouldn\u2019t comment on the complaint beyond saying he had asked the Secretary of State\u2019s Office for a waiver in the matter.\n\nJohn Aguilar: 303-954-1695, jaguilar@denverpost.com or twitter.com/abuvthefold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "GOP candidate Robert Ramirez abandons race for House District 29", "title": "GOP candidate Robert Ramirez abandons race for House District 29", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/19/gop-candidate-robert-ramirez-abandons-race-for-house-district-29/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140619__20120711__20120712_A5_CD11PELXHD29p2_200p1.jpg", "height": 300}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140619__20120711__20120712_A5_CD11PELXHD29p2_200p1.jpg?w=1400", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-19T16:06:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:41:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe080a\"", "article_summary": "The Republican candidate for Colorado House District 29, Robert Ramirez, notified the Secretary of State\u2019s Office this week that he is no longer a candidate to represent the north Jefferson County district.\nSeveral races in Jefferson County, which is evenly split politically, have been targeted by the GOP for victory.\nRamirez wouldn\u2019t comment on the complaint beyond saying he had asked the Secretary of State\u2019s Office for a waiver in the matter.\nRamirez told The Denver Post on Thursday that he submitted a withdrawal letter with state elections officials on Wednesday.\nWith the Secretary of State\u2019s Office levying fines of $50 a day for the violations, she alleges that Ramirez\u2019s campaign owes $12,300 in penalties."}
