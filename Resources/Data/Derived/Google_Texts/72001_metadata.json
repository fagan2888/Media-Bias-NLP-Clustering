I was like, \u2018When are you coming home?\u2019 \u201d she recalls asking Carney, \u201cAnd he\u2019s like, \u2018Well, you might want to turn on the television.\u2019 And I was really annoyed.\u201d\n\nCarney isn\u2019t the only one who kept the big news from a spouse. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonTea Party group \u2018endorses\u2019 Wasserman Schultz Woman who accused Bill Clinton of rape 'not unhappy' to be in new Trump ad Wasserman Schultz's primary rival: She can\u2019t count on Clinton fans MORE didn\u2019t inform former President Clinton of the raid in Pakistan.\n\nShipman, who now serves as an ABC correspondent and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d contributor, covered politics for years before Carney became press secretary. She says her husband\u2019s job, on the whole, has been \u201cfantastic\u201d for her and her kids. \u201cI kind of have a behind-the-scenes view of what goes on on the other side.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s also managed to author her second book with Katty Kay, The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance \u2014 What Women Should Know.\n\nThe book, says Kay, the anchor of BBC World News America, \u201chas really hit a nerve.\u201d So far, more than 50,000 people have taken an online confidence code assessment, which will be used as part of a research project.\n\nShipman faced her own test of confidence while penning the book, saying, \u201cI felt really daunted sometimes by the sheer amount of science and research.\u201d\n\nBut Kay says she learned through writing the book that having nerves and finding tasks daunting doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to a lack of confidence: \u201cThe trick is not to let those nerves stop you from taking action. I am nervous; it is difficult; there are hurdles \u2014 but I\u2019m still going to do it.\u201d\n\nThe pair has also learned not to sweat the small stuff \u2014 such as holiday decorations that might be well past their expiration date.\n\nIn addition to a well-manicured front lawn and a pair of majestic trees, guests at Shipman\u2019s suburban Washington home are greeted by a giant, maniacal ghoul with red eyes and a complementary flame-hued scarf.\n\n\u201cThe monster?\u201d the ABC News journalist says with a laugh when we inquire about the fiendish one-time Halloween d\u00e9cor, \u201cI liked it on the tree. I was reluctant to take it down. And then Christmas came around \u2026 and I thought, OK, we\u2019re just going to start decorating it because I haven\u2019t taken it down.\u201d\n\nKay, chimes in between sips of coffee, \u201cIt\u2019s been there about four years. It hasn\u2019t moved. And it just gets redecorated for every season.\u201d\n\nThe two chuckle in unison in Shipman\u2019s bright kitchen, before Shipman adds, \u201cPeople in the neighborhood kind of love it or hate it.\n\nThey say, \u2018You\u2019re insane, and you\u2019re scaring our children.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThese days, what\u2019s critical for the two co-authors, who are both moms to young kids, is learning to manage the daily juggle.\n\n\u201cThe only real thing that has helped me is that I have given up, really given up, on doing it all, and I\u2018ve completely embraced that every day, there will be some disaster. I will mess something up, things will not get done,\u201d exclaims Shipman.\n\nA few months ago, Shipman says it was dinnertime and her son asked what the family would be having. \u201cI said, \u2018You know what? Dinner is overrated. We really do not have to have dinner every night,\u2019 \u201d she recalls with a grin. \u201c \u2018I\u2019m tired of the tyranny,\u2019 \u201d she says she told her son, \u201c \u2018Just have a banana.\u2019 He looked at me like, \u2018Have you lost your mind?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to embrace that attitude because it\u2019s a struggle for women because we are able to keep so much in our heads, and we\u2019re also able to keep in our heads this vision of everything that is possible,\u201d Shipman tells ITK.\n\nAnother potential struggle for women in which they could use a confidence boost: politics.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one place where you\u2019re really exposed,\u201d says Shipman.\n\n\u201cSen. [Kirsten Gillibrand Kirsten GillibrandOvernight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo Dems discuss dropping Wasserman Schultz Defense bill renews fight over military sexual assault MORE] talked to us about this. It\u2019s very hard for women to want something to be all about them and to put themselves out there.\u201d Shipman says the New York Democrat explains to potential female candidates, \u201cThis isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s about what you\u2019ll do for other people. That is critical for women.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if having a behind-the-scenes vantage point because of Carney\u2019s job has made her more sympathetic to political machines, Shipman nods before noting, \u201cAlthough I will say that I think I\u2019ve always had a certain amount of sympathy. I really do believe that people in politics \u2014 Republicans, Democrats, whomever \u2014 come here to try to make a difference and to do good things. I don\u2019t subscribe to sort of one side\u2019s evil and one side has Machiavellian plans. I think actually people want to get things done.\u201d\n\nAnd contrary to what shows such as \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d depict is happening in Washington, Shipman says, \u201cMost certainly what I see, for the most part, nobody working in the White House has the time to be plotting out vast conspiracy theories. They\u2019re just sort of managing day to day and barely getting by.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "She has a ringside seat to what\u2019s going on inside the White House thanks to her husband, but even Claire Shipman found out the news of Osama bin Laden\u2019s death along with the rest of the world.", "description": "She has a ringside seat to what\u2019s going on inside the White House thanks to her husband, but even Claire Shipman found out the news of Osama bin Laden\u2019s death along with the rest of the world.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "In The Know"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "She has a ringside seat to what\u2019s going on inside the White House thanks to her husband, but even Claire Shipman found out the news of Osama bin Laden\u2019s death along with the rest of the world.", "title": "ABC\u2019s Claire Shipman: My husband kept me in the dark on bin Laden", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/206036-abcs-claire-shipman-my-husband-kept-me-in-the-dark-on-bin-laden", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/kattykay_shipmanclaire_creditmarissarauchap.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/206036-abcs-claire-shipman-my-husband-kept-me-in-the-dark-on-bin-laden", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-05-14T12:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Katie Dvorak", "author": "Judy Kurtz", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-14T12:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:39:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Kirsten Gillibrand, Hillary Clinton,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/206036-abcs-claire-shipman-my-husband-kept-me-in-the-dark-on-bin-laden", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "She has a ringside seat to what\u2019s going on inside the White House thanks to her husband, but even Claire Shipman found out the news of Osama bin Laden\u2019s death along with the rest of the world.", "card": "summary", "title": "ABC\u2019s Claire Shipman: My husband kept me in the dark on bin Laden"}, "dcterms.title": "ABC\u2019s Claire Shipman: My husband kept me in the dark on bin Laden"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1e4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI was kept in the dark about the Osama bin Laden raid \u2014 annoyingly,\u201d the ABC News journalist, who\u2019s married to White House press secretary Jay Carney, says with a playful groan.\nShe has a ringside seat to what\u2019s going on inside the White House thanks to her husband, but even Claire Shipman found out the news of Osama bin Laden\u2019s death along with the rest of the world.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one place where you\u2019re really exposed,\u201d says Shipman.\nShipman, who now serves as an ABC correspondent and \u201cGood Morning America\u201d contributor, covered politics for years before Carney became press secretary.\nA few months ago, Shipman says it was dinnertime and her son asked what the family would be having."}
