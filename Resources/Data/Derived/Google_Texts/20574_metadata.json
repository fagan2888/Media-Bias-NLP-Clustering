Governor of the state was appointed to the U.S. Senate when incumbent Max Baucus \u2014 famous for referring to Obamacare as a huge train wreck even though he helped pass it \u2014 resigned to become ambassador to China, while even admitting that he was no expert on China.\n\nA New York Times investigation revealed Walsh\u2019s apparent academic plagiarism:\n\nAn examination of the final paper required for Mr. Walsh\u2019s master\u2019s degree from the United States Army War College indicates the senator appropriated at least a quarter of his thesis on American Middle East policy from other authors\u2019 works, with no attribution\u2026 Most strikingly, each of the six recommendations Mr. Walsh laid out at the conclusion of his 14-page paper, titled \u2018The Case for Democracy as a Long Term National Strategy,\u2019 is taken nearly word-for-word without attribution from a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace document on the same topic.\u201d\n\nWalsh is running in the November election for a full term, and Republicans were already favored in the matchup. This scandal increases their chances of winning the seat. His GOP opponent is Congressman Steve Daines.\n\nThe master\u2019s thesis was supposed to be an additional resume enhancer for Walsh, according to The Daily Caller: \u201cHis War College degree was used to support his competency to serve as the head of the Montana National Guard, which in turn boosted his resume when he ran for office. The War College manual explicitly warns against plagiarism and demands its students to not engage in it.\u201d The Times added that \u201cone of the highest-profile credentials of Mr. Walsh\u2019s 33-year military career appears to have been improperly attained.\u201d\n\nWalsh insisted that \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong here,\u201d when confronted by the Times.\n\nHe subsequently told the AP that his treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder may have played a role: \u201cI don\u2019t want to blame my mistake on PTSD, but I do want to say it may have been a factor. My head was not in a place very conducive to a classroom and an academic environment.\u201d Walsh added that \u201cI admit that I made a mistake. My record will be defined by [service in] the National Guard, not by a few citations that were unintentionally left out in a term paper.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon notes that \u201cWalsh had hoped to turn his military career into an asset on the campaign trail, but that career has been plagued by scandal. In 2010, the Army\u2019s inspector general officially reprimanded Walsh, then Montana\u2019s lieutenant governor, for illicit advocacy activity using state resources on behalf of a private organization representing members of the state\u2019s National Guard.\u201d\n\nWhat do you find more surprising \u2014 a U.S. Senator who obtained an academic degree under sketchy circumstances or the fact that the master\u2019s thesis in question was apparently only 14 pages long? In the John Walsh plagiarism scandal, should PTSD be taken into consideration by Montana voters in the upcoming election?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Montana Democrat John Walsh has apparently been busted for plagiarism.
