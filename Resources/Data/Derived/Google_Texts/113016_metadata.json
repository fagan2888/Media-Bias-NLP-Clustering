Roof remains at the Charleston County jail, where he\u2019s expected to stay until he\u2019s tried on nine murder charges and possibly federal hate crimes in the June 17 massacre at Emanuel AME Church.\n\nOn the night he joined a dozen black churchgoers for a Bible study, people close to Dylann Roof think the hatred quietly brewing inside him reached a cataclysm.\n\nOld friends who renewed ties with Roof in the weeks before that evening had noticed signs of odd behavior and possibly violent tendencies. He was still the shy, soft-spoken, distant guy they remembered from his middle school days, but something about him was different.\n\nMuch of the change in Roof\u2019s life had unfolded after he flunked out of ninth grade in Lexington County and moved, parting with his childhood friends. He split his time between a dad accused of abusing his stepmother and a mom who left his father before he was born.\n\nSince then, an apparent racist hatred roiled in him, but he constantly exposed himself to black culture \u2014 what he viewed as the source of his feelings. Interviews with his acquaintances and with authorities, along with details gleaned from court documents and online postings, portray his aloof, insular existence leading up to that deadly night at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston. Officials confirmed last week that they had started a criminal probe into exactly how much some of his acquaintances knew about his hatching scheme.\n\nOnly now do the peculiarities of Roof\u2019s behavior stand out to his friends, they said. They sometimes found him sitting alone, watching reruns of Oprah Winfrey\u2019s talk show. They knew he traveled to Charleston and took pictures of important sites from Confederate history and the slavery era. They also saw him hang out with black people, treating them the same as his white friends.\n\nStill other experiences that might have fueled his thoughts unfolded beyond their view: He took cues from \u201cAmerican History X,\u201d a film that delves into beliefs of white supremacy, and he stored photographs of himself waving the Confederate battle flag and burning the U.S. banner.\n\nThe trouble percolating in his mind became most apparent during a bout of drinking with friends in early June, when he spoke of carrying out mass violence that would bring attention to his beloved South Carolina. They didn\u2019t take his scheme seriously.\n\nA little more than a week later, he immersed himself in an experience that he could have used to again study the targets of his hatred. He is white, but the 12 other people in the room at Emanuel AME Church were black.\n\nAccording to the thoughts he apparently expressed in an online manifesto, what he did that night was his destiny. He felt obliged to act out a belief that black people were to blame for the nation\u2019s ills \u2014 from its struggles with crime to its shortcomings in education. Police said he listened to Bible verses and pastors\u2019 teachings, then stood and killed all but three of the people in the room before he walked out the door and disappeared into the night.\n\nThe next day, Kim Konzny saw surveillance images of Roof in the shirt and boots he often wore at her Lexington County home, where he had been staying lately.\n\nNot Dylann, she thought; not the little boy who pushed a skateboard around her old neighborhood and struck up a friendship with her son.\n\nBut it was Dylann. It was the young man Konzny once knew as a good boy, albeit a loner. She wept.\n\n\u201cIt breaks my heart that a sweet kid could do something like this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt must have been hidden in himself.\u201d\n\n\u2018Just lost touch\u2019\n\nRoof\u2019s father, Franklin, and his mother, Amy, married in 1988. He was a carpenter and an attorney\u2019s son. She was a bartender.\n\nHis sister, Amber, was born four months later.\n\nTrouble stirred in the marriage years before Roof was born. His parents separated in 1990. Citing \u201cmarital difficulties\u201d in court paperwork, they divorced the next year.\n\nRoof was born in April 1994 during a brief period of reconciliation between the couple, the Associated Press has reported.\n\nBut the pair remained divorced, and they shared custody of their two children.\n\nFranklin Roof \u2014 most know him as Ben \u2014 got married again in 1998. His new bride, Paige, loved his children \u201cunconditionally as her own,\u201d her mother, Patricia Hastings of Chapin, wrote in court documents.\n\nRoof\u2019s stepmother often picked him up at school and shuttled him between his father\u2019s house in Columbia and his mother\u2019s place. She also had a biological daughter of her own: Morgan.\n\n\u201cShe always put (the children\u2019s) needs before her own and was most supportive of school, extracurricular and church activities,\u201d a friend of hers, Carol Elliott of Columbia, wrote in the court papers.\n\nMoney got tight. Roof\u2019s stepmother landed a part-time job at Sears. She worked for four years until 2005, but her husband wanted her to stay home to care for the children, cook and clean.\n\nHer husband started making enough money from his business, Bennett Construction Co., to support the family alone. He eventually hauled in a six-figure income.\n\nBut their relationship crumbled. He belittled his wife and faulted her cleaning skills, she wrote. Her mother called it a \u201cpattern of control and mental manipulation.\u201d After she reluctantly moved with Roof\u2019s father to Key West, Fla., she accused him of pushing her down during an argument. She hit her head and was left with bruises.\n\n\u201cMy whole life fell apart,\u201d Roof\u2019s stepmother said in an affidavit. \u201cI was so scared of him that I knew I had to get out.\u201d\n\nShe filed for divorce in 2008, and it lingered in court for three years.\n\nDuring much of that time, Roof stayed with his mother on Smokey Joe Court near the Red Bank community. Ridgewood, their well-kept subdivision of middle-class families, is just south of Lexington.\n\nJoey Meek, another middle-schooler around Roof\u2019s age, lived on an adjacent street. They struck up a friendship. They went skateboarding and hung out with other neighborhood children, many of whom were black.\n\nRoof was quiet, but polite. He would thank Meek\u2019s mother, Konzny, when he stayed for dinner.\n\n\u201cI remember his mom thanking me for giving him a friend, or else he\u2019d be stuck in the house all the time,\u201d Konzny, 41, said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have many friends. ... I never saw him with anybody else.\u201d\n\nHe and Meek seldom made mischief. They once got caught with marijuana, but police didn\u2019t get involved, Konzny said.\n\nAt White Knoll High School, Roof started failing classes. The ninth-grader told Konzny that his advanced coursework bored him.\n\nWhen he flunked out in 2010, Roof moved to Rosewood, a community 25 miles away in Columbia. He stayed in touch with Meek through Facebook messages, but the contact waned. Soon, it faded out entirely.\n\n\u201cThey just lost touch,\u201d Konzny said.\n\nA \u2018drastic action\u2019\n\nWithin the next few years, Roof would move with his mother to an area outside Eastover, where her family had a wooden cabin on the main street, Garners Ferry Road.\n\nThe rural town is surrounded by cornfields and abandoned farms with rusty silos ensnared in vines. Many residents are black.\n\nFrom his nearby house, 70-year-old widower James Dunlap sometimes saw members of Roof\u2019s family outside, working on potted plants in the yard or near a backyard barn. He never talked to them. A chain stretched across the driveway, halting most visitors.\n\nDunlap had seen Roof at Mr. Bunky\u2019s Meat Market and Restaurant, a town gathering place across the street that offers quail dinners for $10. He never heard him speak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quiet out here,\u201d Dunlap said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we like it.\u201d\n\nAround the same time as Roof\u2019s move, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was killed in Sanford, Fla. The February 2012 shooting of Martin, who was black, by a Hispanic man, George Zimmerman, raised Roof\u2019s interest. Whether Martin\u2019s race prompted Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, to confront him was a key question.\n\nThe manifesto that Roof is thought to have penned portrayed how the case sparked his racism.\n\nRoof took to his computer. He typed \u201cblack on white crime\u201d into Google, and \u201cI have never been the same since that day,\u201d the manifesto stated.\n\nAs his research deepened, the more impassioned he became. He saw segregation as a necessary defensive measure to keep society orderly, and he wished more people were proud descendants of slave owners. He thought about how he would take his fight against minorities to \u201cthe real world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is far from being too late for America or Europe,\u201d the manifesto stated. \u201cWe could take it back completely. But by no means should we wait any longer to take drastic action.\u201d\n\nIn February, the website LastRhodesian.net was created. It would house the diatribe and photographs of Roof\u2019s travels to the Lowcountry. He had started amassing the photos as early as last summer, when he was pictured with slave mannequins at Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant.\n\nHints of a sinister plan taking shape showed up that same month. He was wearing all black clothes on Feb. 28 at Columbiana Centre mall when he asked questions of workers at The Shoe Department and Bath & Body Works: How many people work here? What time do you close?\n\nConcerned, mall security guards called Columbia police. He slowly and nervously answered investigators\u2019 questions. After prescription drugs were found in his pocket, he was arrested and banned from the mall for a year.\n\nThe next month, on March 13, a Columbia officer confronted Roof at Earlewood Park, where he had been lingering in his car. The site is within walking distance of his father\u2019s house.\n\nThe officer searched his black 2000 Hyundai Elantra and found the forearm to an AR-15 \u2014 the military-style rifle used in the 2012 slayings of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn. \u2014 and six magazines that could hold 40 .223-caliber rounds each \u2014 240 in all. Roof told the officer that he didn\u2019t have enough money for the entire rifle that he wanted to use for target practice.\n\nHe had committed no crime that day and was allowed to drive off.\n\nHis travels resumed. Photography on the website documented them.\n\nOn March 25, he visited a section for Confederate soldiers in Columbia\u2019s Elmwood Cemetery. Four days after his 21st birthday on April 3, he clutched a .45-caliber Glock 41, a $600 pistol that news media said he bought with cash he got as a gift.\n\nA week after that, he went back to Boone Hall Plantation and walked under the Avenue of Oaks. He strolled past slave cabins at James Island\u2019s McLeod Plantation on April 23. He stood at Charleston\u2019s Waterfront Park and looked across the harbor at Fort Sumter, where the Civil War started in 1861.\n\nHis friends said they knew of his trips to Charleston, where he had relatives. His uncle, Paul Roof, works as a College of Charleston sociology professor and is best known for his beard, which appeared on a beer can.\n\nAt some point, according to federal authorities who spoke with The New York Times, he also contacted hate groups online. But how much those sects knew of his burgeoning plot wasn\u2019t known.\n\nHe returned to the Columbia mall on April 26, only to be caught again in the parking lot by a police officer. He was arrested for trespassing, and the ban against him was extended to three years.\n\nThe next day, he started posing for pictures with his Glock and a Confederate battle flag. On May 11, he burned a small American flag. In his tan boots, he crouched on another U.S. flag and spat on it.\n\n\u2018Thought it was gibberish\u2019\n\nTwo months ago, amid his old friend\u2019s visits to historic sites, Meek checked Facebook and found a familiar name in his inbox.\n\nDylann Roof. He wanted to hang out and catch up.\n\nMeek gave him a new address in a mobile home park not far from where they had spent part of their childhoods.\n\nKonzny returned from work one day and found Roof there with her three sons. He wasn\u2019t as thin as she remembered him. He still had a wiry 5-foot-9 frame and the same blond hair fashioned into a bowl cut, though it was shorter than she recalled.\n\nHe was still quiet, but Meek, 20, noticed that something was troubling him. Meek\u2019s two younger brothers, 15-year-old Jacob and 17-year-old Justin, also caught on.\n\nHe once asked Justin Meek to take a picture of him burning the American flag. He had a Zippo lighter and some fuel.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Hell no,\u2019 \u201d Justin Meek said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that, and I asked why. He said he had his reasons.\u201d\n\nKonzny\u2019s sons often found him watching \u201cTitanic\u201d and \u201cStand By Me,\u201d a coming-of-age tale based on a Stephen King novel about boys setting out to find a missing child\u2019s body. The manifesto, though, alluded to his favorite film: \u201cHimizu,\u201d a Japanese crime drama in which the protagonist embarks on a murder spree to kill evil people.\n\nHe played video games like \u201cCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare\u201d on the family\u2019s Xbox 360. He surfed the Internet on his phone. He often ignored questions people asked, speaking only when he needed to. But he once mentioned to Jacob Meek that he wanted to bring more attention to the Palmetto State.\n\n\u201cHe wanted South Carolina to be worldwide,\u201d Jacob Meek said. \u201cHe said South Carolina is usually never on the news. ... Something really big had to happen to make it worldwide.\u201d\n\nHe also talked about starting a race war. As he drank one night in early June \u2014 he liked Taaka vodka \u2014 Roof talked about doing something crazy, like \u201cshooting up the College of Charleston,\u201d the Meek brothers said. A black neighbor, 22-year-old Christon Scriven, was drinking with the group.\n\nMore concerned with what he would do that night, Joey Meek fetched the Glock from Roof\u2019s trunk and stashed it under an air vent in his home. When Roof sobered up in the morning, Meek returned the gun.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t take him seriously,\u201d Konzny said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t think anything of it. They thought it was gibberish.\u201d\n\nFor the three or four times a week that Roof stayed overnight, he slept on top of some couch cushions arranged on the floor. But when the family woke June 17, he wasn\u2019t there. He had arrived late the night before and slept in his car outside because he didn\u2019t want to bother anyone.\n\nThe Meek brothers hitched a ride with him for a day at Lake Murray. Roof chose not to stay, instead telling them that he would catch a matinee of \u201cJurassic World\u201d for $5.03 at the local AMC Theatre.\n\n\u201cHe said he would be back that night or the next morning, but he never showed,\u201d Jacob Meek said. \u201cThere was no word from him whatsoever after that.\u201d\n\nKonzny and her sons saw him the next morning in surveillance images taken outside Emanuel AME Church. He was wearing an outfit they often saw him in: dark pants rolled up above his Timberland boots and a gray shirt with stains on a sleeve that Roof said were caused by spilled battery acid.\n\nThey had heard about the attack the night before: Someone walked into a Bible study and fatally shot nine people, prompting a massive hunt for the gunman. They hoped it wasn\u2019t Roof, but when they saw the surveillance, Joey Meek called the police.\n\nFour unmarked vehicles soon showed up at the family\u2019s mobile home, and FBI agents got out. They took everything he had left there: some empty vodka bottles, the lighter fluid he used to burn the American flag and two T-shirts, one featuring \u201cThe Incredible Hulk\u201d and another emblazoned with \u201cMyrtle Beach.\u201d\n\nRoof, meanwhile, drove northward in his Hyundai as authorities distributed his photo nationwide. A motorist in Shelby, N.C., recognized him and dialed 911. Police officers stopped his car about three miles from the home of his sister\u2019s fiance, Michael Tyo. Amber Roof and Tyo, a soldier, were set to be married in Columbia three days later.\n\nRoof didn\u2019t put up a fight. The officers searched his car and found his Glock under a pillow in the backseat.\n\n\u2018Wanted to kill\u2019\n\nThe shooting brought the media attention to South Carolina that the Meek brothers said Roof sought.\n\nJournalists descended on the towns where he had lived, trying to answer the question so many people were asking: Why? Some were willing to spend money for the answer.\n\nThe Meeks said a network television crew took them to dinner at Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House before they portrayed their side of Roof. One of Roof\u2019s black friends asked reporters for cash to tell his story. \u201cIf y\u2019all not paying no money, then no,\u201d he said.\n\nRoof\u2019s relatives shooed away the reporters who showed up at their homes, where they had tacked up \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs. His father, a heavily tattooed motorcycle rider, came to the door with a Rottweiler by his side. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking,\u201d the man said.\n\nRoof sits at the Charleston County jail, where he\u2019s expected to stay until he\u2019s tried on nine murder charges and possibly federal hate crimes. His family, in a statement through his attorney, has expressed disbelief of the events that put him there.\n\nMore of the experiences that led Roof down a path that ended in the church on Calhoun Street could be revealed when he\u2019s prosecuted. But the FBI\u2019s Brian Womble, supervisory resident agent for the area, said Charleston was fortunate to have an incredible collaboration of law agencies on hand to make sure that trail stretched no farther.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a really bad person,\u201d Womble said, \u201cwho wanted to kill a lot of people.\u201d\n\nReach Andrew Knapp at 937-5414 or twitter.com/offlede.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "In Dylann Roof, a silently brewing fury that burst out in a violent way, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsChurch shooting, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Dylann Roof,Emanuel AME Church,shootings", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "On the night he joined a dozen black churchgoers for a Bible study, people close to Dylann Roof think the hatred quietly brewing inside him reached a cataclysm.", "title": "In Dylann Roof, a silently brewing fury that burst out in a violent way", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150704/150709847/in-dylann-roof-a-silently-brewing-fury-that-burst-out-in-a-violent-way", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150704/PC16/150709847/AR/0/AR-150709847.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150704/PC16/150709847/AR/0/AR-150709847.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On the night he joined a dozen black churchgoers for a Bible study, people close to Dylann Roof think the hatred quietly brewing inside him reached a cataclysm.", "title": "In Dylann Roof, a silently brewing fury that burst out in a violent way", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150704/PC16/150709847/AR/0/AR-150709847.jpg?201507050928", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150709847}}, "keywords": "In Dylann Roof, a silently brewing fury that burst out in a violent way , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsChurch shooting, \r\nMetro, \r\nMetro, Dylann Roof,Emanuel AME Church,shootings", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-04T22:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-07-05T09:28:00Z", "author": "Andrew Knapp"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "On the night he joined a dozen black churchgoers for a Bible study, people close to Dylann Roof think the hatred quietly brewing inside him reached a cataclysm."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe171f\"", "article_summary": "One of Roof\u2019s black friends asked reporters for cash to tell his story.\nRoof didn\u2019t put up a fight.\nThe next day, Kim Konzny saw surveillance images of Roof in the shirt and boots he often wore at her Lexington County home, where he had been staying lately.\nOld friends who renewed ties with Roof in the weeks before that evening had noticed signs of odd behavior and possibly violent tendencies.\nRoof was born in April 1994 during a brief period of reconciliation between the couple, the Associated Press has reported."}
