The program is offered in about seven regions each year.\n\nDogs big and small ran around the cafeteria sniffing inside paint cans, hoping to recognize a smell for the small prize of a treat or a tennis ball in exchange for a brief squat.\n\nWhile the two-year national certification isn\u2019t mandatory for law enforcement canines, it\u2019s highly regarded.\n\n\u201cThere are no days off for our dogs,\u201d said Rennie Mora, who runs the canine program for the bureau\u2019s Denver field division.\n\nMora and his canine often work calls with Denver police and played a role last fall in the response to the Arapahoe High School shooting. Other dogs that completed the program have worked in war zones.\n\nJohn Gulley, of the Salt Lake City-based Unified Fire Command, traveled to the Denver area for his first run at the certification. He called the experience nerve-racking, although he said he trains his canine daily, sometimes for up to five hours.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to prevent something from happening,\u201d Gulley said. \u201cIt would just be the one time that we need (the canines) that makes it worth it.\u201d\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jesseapaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dogs sniff their way through ATF bomb-detection test in Arvada", "title": "Dogs sniff their way through ATF bomb-detection test in Arvada", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/08/dogs-sniff-their-way-through-atf-bomb-detection-test-in-arvada/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140708__CD09BOMBDOG__CHM9371p1.jpg", "height": 352}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140708__CD09BOMBDOG__CHM9371p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-08T15:52:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:07:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcda2b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere are no days off for our dogs,\u201d said Rennie Mora, who runs the canine program for the bureau\u2019s Denver field division.\n\u201cThey are used to detect explosive devices all over the place,\u201d said Raphael Martinez, the Virginia-based branch chief of the bureau\u2019s national canine division.\nARVADA \u2014 Wagging tails, chew toys and lots and lots of bombs.\nJohn Gulley, of the Salt Lake City-based Unified Fire Command, traveled to the Denver area for his first run at the certification.\nMora and his canine often work calls with Denver police and played a role last fall in the response to the Arapahoe High School shooting."}
