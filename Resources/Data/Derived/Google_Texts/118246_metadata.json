The Clippers have lost five of their past seven games, but Paul is averaging 20.1 points, 9.7 assists and 4.7 rebounds in that stretch. He is one of just four Clippers averaging double- figure scoring over the past seven games.\n\nNUGS VS. CLIPS NOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets:\n\nTheir bench played a lead role in the 116-105 victory over the Lakers at the Staples Center on Friday, contributing 71 points. Coach Michael Malone liked what he was seeing from the backups, so he played them nearly the entire fourth quarter. Gary Harris was the only starter who played in the fourth quarter, and that was only about two minutes. Denver\u2019s bench will have to play well again Sunday for the Nuggets to beat the Clippers at the Staples Center. Kenneth Faried will be available if Malone chooses to play him. Faried was in uniform Friday after missing four games because of a sore back. He is averaging 12.9 points and 8.8 rebounds.\n\nClippers:\n\nThey won their most recent game, Thursday at home against Portland, but it was just the second victory in seven games for a 44-27 team that has had a relatively rough March, going 5-7. Spotty defense has been the problem \u2014 even with DeAndre Jordan, one of the NBA\u2019s premier shot blockers, protecting the rim. Opponents are averaging 105.6 points and shooting 45.7 percent from the field. \u2026 Blake Griffin remains out with a fractured hand.\n\nChristopher Dempsey, The Denver Post\n\nNBA Spotlight on:\n\n\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns, C, Minnesota\n\nWhen: This week\u2019s Post player of the week takes us to uncharted waters \u2014 to a rookie. Minnesota\u2019s Karl-Anthony Towns rose to the top and takes home the award for the evaluation period of March 19-25.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In three games, Towns averaged 25.7 points, 10.7 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.7 blocks per game. He shot 59.6 percent from the field and was dominant all week, leading the Timberwolves to wins in two of the three games.\n\nBackground: The only thing more impressive than the numbers themselves was the consistency at which he arrived at them. Towns scored 24, 26 and 27 points in the three games. He grabbed 11, 11 and 10 rebounds in the three contests. He shot 57 percent from the field twice and 64.7 percent in the other contest. There haven\u2019t been wild swings in his play all season long as he has done nothing but validate over and over again why he was the No. 1 overall pick in last year\u2019s NBA draft.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: With all due respect to those sifting through numbers to make the rookie of the year race somewhat close, it isn\u2019t. Towns is the runaway leader and essentially has been from Day One. We just all needed to see him blossom to etch it in stone. Towns has dazzled this season, and there\u2019s no reason to think that he won\u2019t follow up this season\u2019s rookie of the year award with All-NBA teams and maybe even a league MVP in future seasons. He\u2019s that good. And he\u2019s only getting better.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Nuggets at Los Angeles Clippers: How to watch on TV, preview and more", "title": "Denver Nuggets at Los Angeles Clippers: How to watch on TV, preview and more", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/26/denver-nuggets-at-los-angeles-clippers-how-to-watch-on-tv-preview-and-more/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-26T18:00:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-26T18:00:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb9c2\"", "article_summary": "He is one of just four Clippers averaging double- figure scoring over the past seven games.\nWhat\u2019s up: In three games, Towns averaged 25.7 points, 10.7 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.7 blocks per game.\nChristopher Dempsey, The Denver PostNBA Spotlight on:Karl-Anthony Towns, C, MinnesotaWhen: This week\u2019s Post player of the week takes us to uncharted waters \u2014 to a rookie.\nThe Clippers have lost five of their past seven games, but Paul is averaging 20.1 points, 9.7 assists and 4.7 rebounds in that stretch.\nClippers:They won their most recent game, Thursday at home against Portland, but it was just the second victory in seven games for a 44-27 team that has had a relatively rough March, going 5-7."}
