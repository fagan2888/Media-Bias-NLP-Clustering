Photo by Erica Zeitlin, AFSCME communications officer.\n\nBet Tzedek, a nonprofit that provides free legal services for poor people, is locked in a dispute with the union that represents most of its workers, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (or AFSCME). At issue is the amount of money employees contribute toward the cost of health care for themselves and their families. Bet Tzedek currently pays for nearly 99 percent of those costs \u2014 costs they say have tripled in the last five years.\n\n\u201cThat is not sustainable,\u201d Bet Tzedek president Sandy Samuels said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to have a more realistic arrangement with our employees.\u201d\n\nThe union has made counteroffers on a new one-year contract, but none of them addresses the health care issue. Although both sides say they are determined to resolve the impasse, AFSCME has already staged two protests outside the Wilshire Boulevard offices of Bet Tzedek.\n\nThe disagreement has left some wondering: What exactly is a public-employee union, known for representing municipal workers, doing representing workers at a Jewish non-profit?\n\nAFSCME is among the most powerful unions in the country. In the 2012 election cycle, it spent $64.7 million on political campaigns \u2014 more than any other union, corporation or individual, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nAFSCME\u2019s Southern California locals, organized under AFSCME Council 36, represent, almost exclusively, public sector employees. The apparent outliers are Jewish nonprofit professionals, including both Bet Tzedek and workers at The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, represented by Locals 946 and 800, respectively.\n\nThe Council\u2019s spokesperson, Erica Zeitlin, called this \u201ccoincidental.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was nothing deliberate about the fact that we represent these Jewish nonprofits,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nOf course, it is any union\u2019s role, at times, to challenge an employer trying to balance the needs and costs of its employees with the level of service its donors and clients expect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s challenging to have a union in a nonprofit organization,\u201d said Jay Sanderson, president of the Federation, who said that most nonprofits are not unionized. \u201cUnions were created to take care of employees, like those in the garment industry, where the hours were inhumane and pay was low, and management took advantage. That\u2019s not the case in the nonprofit community.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cOftentimes, it becomes an adversarial relationship.\u201d\n\nJudaism has long been a champion of organized labor. The Talmud takes care to place protections on laborers (even as it condones slavery), and commands collective bargaining, binding mediation and even strikes.\n\nSo it\u2019s hardly a surprise that Jews have played an important role in union organizing in the United States.\n\n\u201cIn the early part of the 20th century, you\u2019d find Jews active in forming unions,\u201d said Steven F. Windmueller, Rabbi Alfred Gottschalk Emeritus Professor of Jewish Communal Service at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion in Los Angeles. Later in the century, and especially in Los Angeles, \u201cYou had a unionization of the Jewish professional community.\u201d\n\nFederation\u2019s employees, for example, became organized in the 1960s.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure when it started, it started with good intentions,\u201d Sanderson said.\n\nBut some at Federation suggested that work rules set up by union-negotiated contracts have, perhaps inadvertently, made for an environment where excellence cannot be rewarded, because, as one employee who asked to remain unnamed claimed, \u201cThere\u2019s no separate pot of money for merit increases, or increasing efficiency or effectiveness. It\u2019s a matter of checking off what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\n\nAFSCME Local 800 also represents seven other Jewish nonprofits, including Jewish Big Brothers Big Sisters, the Silver Lake JCC and Jewish Vocational Services (JVS), whose CEO, Vivian Seigel, said her organization has a good relationship with its union.\n\n\u201cJVS has always been a partner with labor,\u201d Seigel said. \u201cWe want what\u2019s best for our employees.\u201d Although, she added, \u201cIt does make it a challenge, because our dollars are limited.\u201d\n\nBet Tzedek\u2019s employees were represented by AFSCME Local 800 until the 1990s, when they voted to break away and form their own independent union. In November 2012, they voted to rejoin AFSCME and its international federation, the AFL-CIO.\n\n\u201cAfter 20 years, we wanted to be part of the mainstream labor movement,\u201d said Marc Bender, a lawyer for Bet Tzedek who serves as president of AFSCME Local 946. \u201cWe wanted to come in from the cold and get institutional support and solidarity from a big union.\u201d Bender\u2019s wife, Leslie Simon, was, at the time, the organizational director of AFSCME Council 36 (she\u2019s since moved over to the entertainment union IATSE). Bender denies that his wife\u2019s involvement has anything to do with the Bet Tzedek independent union\u2019s return to the AFSCME fold.\n\nFor the last 20 years or so, Bet Tzedek employees, though working for reduced wages as compared to for-profit law-office workers, have received a notably generous benefits package that includes coverage for dental, vision, a pension and life insurance, as well as an HMO health care plan that covers the employees\u2019 entire family for which they have paid nothing, or very little.\n\nBet Tzedek\u2019s total bill for that health care, according to its president, Samuels, has tripled over the last five years, and now the nonprofit pays almost $900,000 annually for its employees\u2019 medical care \u2014 a very large bill for an organization whose overall annual budget is between $7 million and $8 million.\n\nBet Tzedek management said its revenue has failed to keep up with inflation as well as the skyrocketing health care costs, in large part due to the recession in recent years.\n\nLow interest rates have also hit Bet Tzedek\u2019s bank account. Every state in the United States has what\u2019s called an Interest on Lawyer Trust Account (or IOLTA). Lawyers are required to temporarily keep money from settlements in these trust accounts. The interest on the accounts is then collected by the state bar and distributed to various nonprofits, including Legal Aid and Bet Tzedek, which receives one of the highest allocations in California. Low interest rates in recent years have decimated the IOLTA fund \u2014 whereas in 2007 it doled out about $22 million, distributions have fallen to less than $5 million in 2013. That has cost Bet Tzedek hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\n\nBender, however, puts the blame on Bet Tzedek\u2019s management for its financial woes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Bet Tzedek has done a very good job managing all these grants coming in,\u201d he said. \u201cThey continue to expand without being able to maintain decent salary and health benefits for staff.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 1, the much-anticipated health insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA, also known as Obamacare) are set to begin enrollment. One of the intended purposes of the law is to slow the precipitous rise in health care costs in this country, and to require health insurance for all Americans, or make them pay a penalty for not being covered, thereby increasing the number of healthy insured and lowering the overall cost to consumers. It\u2019s unclear what effect the ACA will have on small businesses like Bet Tzedek that already provide health care plans for employees.\n\nBut given the recent rise in health care costs and uncertainty about the future, Bet Tzedek\u2019s union is reluctant even to talk about giving up members\u2019 virtually free coverage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still hopeful that we can get them to save money in other ways that do not involve these prohibitive health care raises,\u201d Bender said.\n\nAccording to Bender, Bet Tzedek\u2019s initial offer was to raise health care contributions for an individual from zero to $208 a month; for an employee with one dependent, the proposed increase was from $20 to $486 a month; and for entire families, the proposed increase was from $30 to $635 a month. If that had been agreed upon, employees with families would have paid an added $7,260 per year for coverage.\n\n\u201cI want Bet Tzedek to be a strong agency, an agency that does a lot of good in the world,\u201d said Rabbi Jonathan Klein, executive director of CLUE-LA (Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice), who took part in the protests. \u201cBut in order for it to do good outside, it has to treat its own house well.\u201d\n\nBet Tzedek has come back with three subsequent proposals, the most recent of which, according to Bender, amounts to $128 per month for an individual, $318 per month for an employee plus one dependent, and $468 per month for an employee and his or her family. (Bet Tzedek\u2019s General Counsel, Elissa Barrett, said the offer was more complex than Bender made it out to be).\n\n\u201cThey have made some movement, and we appreciate that,\u201d Bender said. His union has made a counteroffer: Cut worker salaries by 1 to 2 percent, and cut management salaries by 3 to 5 percent. But for Bet Tzedek, this doesn\u2019t deal with the crux of the issue: skyrocketing health care costs.\n\nIt\u2019s a showdown not dissimilar to ones faced by AFSCME\u2019s other members \u2014 public employees all over the country: What happens when powerful unions make demands that employers say they simply cannot afford?\n\nBarrett put it this way: \u201cThe union leadership has told us that they would rather Bet Tzedek cut services than address the health care issue.\u201d\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nView our privacy policy and terms of service.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/a_unions_jewish_connection", "site_name": "Jewish Journal", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/featured/com_bet-tzedek-protest_574.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "A union\u2019s Jewish connection | Los Angeles"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 23102350, "title": "A union\u2019s Jewish connection | Los Angeles", "url": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/los_angeles/article/a_unions_jewish_connection", "image": "http://www.jewishjournal.com/images/featured/com_bet-tzedek-protest_574.jpg", "site": "@jewishjournal", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Jewish Journal, news, jewish, israel, los angeles, Tribe Media Corp, Hollywood, Israel, jewish, judaism, world, nation", "fb": {"app_id": 216180581861512}, "msvalidate.01": "1439B350A4269424970C93B18CEAF6FB", "verify-v1": "5CqSOVc2kyARWwZMAxu3QCpMoZGbB5Nu6xIPWK5MXvQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9878\"", "article_summary": "The apparent outliers are Jewish nonprofit professionals, including both Bet Tzedek and workers at The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, represented by Locals 946 and 800, respectively.\nBet Tzedek currently pays for nearly 99 percent of those costs \u2014 costs they say have tripled in the last five years.\nBender denies that his wife\u2019s involvement has anything to do with the Bet Tzedek independent union\u2019s return to the AFSCME fold.\nOn Sept. 11, Bet Tzedek employees protested against potential increases to their health care costs.\n(Bet Tzedek\u2019s General Counsel, Elissa Barrett, said the offer was more complex than Bender made it out to be)."}
