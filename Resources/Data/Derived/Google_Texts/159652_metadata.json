The three-member PUC oversees Black Hills and Xcel Energy\u2019s local franchises.\n\nPuebloans in 2010 gave Black Hills their vote of confidence, approving a 20-year franchise agreement by a 2-1 margin. Five years earlier in 2005, local voters rejected a municipalization proposal by a margin of 74 percent to 26 percent.\n\nThe new focus on municipalization stems in part from talks between Pueblo County Commissioner Terry Hart, Pueblo City Council member Chris Nicoll and Pueblo state Rep. Leroy Garcia, who are participants in the Pueblo Re-volt group that has spoken out against Black Hills.\n\nOthers in the group include Sister Nancy Crafton of El Centro De Los Pobres, Posada Director Anne Stattelman, solar advocate Paul Huber and Sierra Club representative Ross Vincent.\n\nHart said he has consulted with Severance about Black Hills and the task force\u2019s work but that he was unaware of the White Paper\u2019s existence until a couple of weeks ago.\n\nHart said he does not support the municipalization proposal without further study,\n\nIn the task force meetings, \u201cthe \u2018m\u2019 word (\u2018m\u2019 for municipalization) has been used a few times but it\u2019s one of those things none of us really understand,\u201d Hart said. It could turn out that the move could hike customer costs, he said.\n\nNicoll said he\u2019s far from ready to support municipalization.\n\n\u201cI think there is a lot of information we have to research to make that statement,\u201d Nicoll said.\n\nOne early idea floated by some Black Hills critics is for the city to help finance any purchase by tapping the city\u2019s $40 million in half-cent fund reserves, an idea he does not support, Nicoll said. The idea was not included in the White Paper.\n\nIn 2005, a consultant hired by the city estimated the value of the Pueblo franchise \u2014 then operated by Aquila and void of many of today\u2019s improvements \u2014 at $140 million or more. Others termed the estimate too low.\n\nThe franchise also serves Canon City, Rocky Ford and several other cities. Leaders of those communities spoke out against the 2005 municipalization proposal.\n\nNext month, the Re-volt group is set to travel to Boulder to learn more about that city\u2019s efforts to purchase its Xcel Energy electricity franchise, Hart said. Boulder wants the franchise because it wants more green energy and it is willing to pay additional costs, if necessary\n\nEarlier this summer, Pueblo state Sen. George Rivera, a Republican, accused Democrats of criticizing Black Hills as an election-year move to divert attention from their support of the anti-coal and renewable energy push started under former Gov. Bill Ritter, a Democrat.\n\nThe chain of events that followed led to today\u2019s higher bills, Rivera said. Xcel stopped supplying power to Pueblo in part to save its coal plants for its customers. To fill the void, the state ordered the building of the Black Hills plant.\n\nAn additional rate hike looms as Black Hills seeks to recover costs of a wind farm in Huerfano County, Rivera said.\n\nOther elected leaders critical of Black Hills but not part of the task force are Pueblo County Commissioner Liane \u201cBuffie\u201d McFadyen and former Pueblo City Council member Chris Kaufman, who has talked about possible municipalization.\n\nNicoll, who has criticized Kaufman for alleged secret talks with other council members on some of the half-cent fund changes proposed in the White Paper, said he is not aware of any secret talks or any open meetings violations surrounding the Black Hills proposal.\n\nIn the 2010 vote on the Black Hills franchise, Puebloans went into the election aware of the need for rate hikes to build the new power plant and add renewable energy power sources.\n\nThe power plant project was announced in 2008.\n\nRenewal energy standards were approved by Colorado voters in 2004 by a 53 percent to 47 percent margin. Pueblo County voters opposed the standards by a 57 percent to 43 percent margin.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chieftain.com/news/politics/2809290-120/black-hills-pueblo-energy", "site_name": "http://www.chieftain.com", "image": "http://forms.chieftain.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/pueblo-chieftain-1200x630.png", "type": "article", "title": "Black Hills rips White Paper plan"}, "fb": {"admins": 166812535600, "app_id": 323205824384149}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Chieftain.com"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFrom our perspective, municipalization is likely to be very expensive and complex and time consuming,\u201d Black Hills spokesman Bret Jones said when asked about the White Paper proposal.\nPuebloans in 2010 gave Black Hills their vote of confidence, approving a 20-year franchise agreement by a 2-1 margin.\nTo fill the void, the state ordered the building of the Black Hills plant.\nAn additional rate hike looms as Black Hills seeks to recover costs of a wind farm in Huerfano County, Rivera said.\nThe three-member PUC oversees Black Hills and Xcel Energy\u2019s local franchises."}
