It\u2019s a jarring statistic, and one that has gone viral in the wake of this week\u2019s massacre in San Bernardino, California.\n\nBut there are two problems with the number: It doesn\u2019t actually provide a clear estimate of how often the country has seen shooting rampages like the one in San Bernardino. And it obscures the broader reality of gun violence in America.\n\nCounting \u201cmass shootings\u201d is notoriously complicated and contested , since there is no standard definition of what they are. Is it best to count shootings that injure or kill a certain number of people? Or should the definition focus more narrowly on attacks in which the motivation of the shooter \u201c appears to be indiscriminate killing \u201d?\n\nMother Jones, which has been tracking mass shootings since 2012, has counted just four mass shootings this year, and a total of 73 since 1982, as Mother Jones editor Mark Follman has noted in The New York Times.\n\nIn 2014, the FBI released its own count of \u201cactive shooter\u201d incidents, focusing on events where law enforcement and citizens may have the chance to intervene and change the outcome of the ongoing shooting. It tallied a total of 160 of these events from 2000 to 2013\u2013including high-profile shootings at Virginia Tech, Fort Hood, and Sandy Hook Elementary School\u2013 with an average of 11 per year.\n\nThe \u201c355 mass shootings this year\u201d that has been rocketing around the Internet comes from a crowdsourced Reddit initiative that gathers media reports of shootings in which four or more people were shot.\n\nThe Reddit count includes many incidents that Mother Jones, the FBI, and others leave out: for instance, a home robbery, a drive-by shooting, and a gang fight.\n\nThe Reddit project\u2019s organizers suggest this broader approach does a better job of capturing the burden of gun violence\u2013including the suffering and costs of treating people who are shot and survive.\n\n\u201cThe most obscene incidents of gun violence usually do not make the mainstream news at all,\u201d the project\u2019s introduction says, citing a nightclub shooting in Tennessee in which 18 people were shot and only one person killed. \u201cWe believe the media does a disservice to mass shooting victims by virtually ignoring them unless large numbers are killed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Debates over massacres like San Bernardino, Colorado Springs obscure who's really being victimized by lax gun laws", "title": "We have gun violence all wrong: Mass shootings only tell a fraction of the story", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Debates over massacres like San Bernardino, Colorado Springs obscure who's really being victimized by lax gun laws", "title": "We have gun violence all wrong: Mass shootings only tell a fraction of the story", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/20/we_have_gun_violence_all_wrong_mass_shootings_only_tell_a_fraction_of_the_story_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/wayne_lapierre_guns.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Debates over massacres like San Bernardino, Colorado Springs obscure who's really being victimized by lax gun laws", "title": "We have gun violence all wrong: Mass shootings only tell a fraction of the story", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/wayne_lapierre_guns.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lois Beckett", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, FBI, Gun Violence, mass shootings, ProPublica, san bernardino", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2373\"", "article_summary": "Mother Jones, which has been tracking mass shootings since 2012, has counted just four mass shootings this year, and a total of 73 since 1982, as Mother Jones editor Mark Follman has noted in The New York Times.\nCounting \u201cmass shootings\u201d is notoriously complicated and contested , since there is no standard definition of what they are.\n\u201cWe believe the media does a disservice to mass shooting victims by virtually ignoring them unless large numbers are killed.\u201d\nAnd it obscures the broader reality of gun violence in America.\nTopics: FBI, Gun Violence, mass shootings, ProPublica, san bernardino, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on ProPublicaAccording to articles this week across the Internet, there has been an average of one mass shooting every day in the United States: 355 so far this year."}
