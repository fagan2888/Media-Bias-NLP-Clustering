Create jobs, get the economy growing, help with energy development, actually deal with ISIS instead of turn an eye to the threat that's happening in the middle east,\" said Stewart.\n\n\n\nStewart expects the next congress to approve the Keystone Pipeline, the REIGNS Act, to limit power of regulatory agencies and repeal the Medical Device Tax in the Affordable Care Act among other things.\n\n\n\nThat doesn't mean an instant path to becoming law.\n\n\n\nThe Executive Branch, controlled by democrats must still sign off.\n\n\n\n\"I think he is going to sign some of them, maybe many of them. We'll see, but we are excited to see what happens in the next few months,\" says Stewart.\n\n\n\nStewart says the Keystone Pipeline would create 40,000 jobs and economic development in states that really need it.\n\n\n\nHe says it would likely be vetoed by the president, but thinks there just may be enough support from both parties to produce a veto proof majority.\n\n\n\nCopyright 2016 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
