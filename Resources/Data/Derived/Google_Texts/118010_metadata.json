Working alongside her mother and older sister, Mathis is currently unable to afford medical treatment for a brain tumor \u2013 the same condition that unexpectedly proved fatal for her father in 2000, KHOU-TV reports.\n\n\u201cI have my good days and my bad,\u201d Mathis told KHOU. \u201cI went to the hospital and found out it was my blood clotting. So, they wanted to keep me and do CAT scans and MRIs and the next day they came in and told me I had a tumor.\u201d\n\nMathis doesn\u2019t have insurance. Meanwhile, her diagnosis and treatment procedures have come to a halt as massive medical bills have continued to pile up.\n\nHowever, Kaiserhof owner Michael De Beyer has stepped in to help the Mathis family.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t be standing by and doing nothing,\u201d De Beyer told KHOU. \u201cI have to try something because it\u2019s not right. Here\u2019s a family, they really work hard they have a lot of stuff against them in the past and they are not holding their hand open they didn\u2019t even ask anybody for help.\u201d\n\nDe Beyer, who has owned the restaurant for nearly two decades, says the 6,000-foot restaurant may be worth as much as $2 million, and profits can help the mass of medical bills amassing for the Mathis family. In addition to Mathis\u2019 medical bills, De Beyer said he wants to spend more time with his own wife and two children.\n\nMathis\u2019 mother, Barbara, said that the sudden death of her husband from a brain tumor rupture in 2000 is very similar to her daughter\u2019s condition today.\n\n\u201cI guess sort of the same thing Brittany is going through,\u201d she told KHOU. \u201cI just want her to get help.\u201d\n\nBut right now, the Mathis\u2019 are feeling blessed for De Beyer\u2019s good will.\n\n\u201cI really think it\u2019s an amazing blessing and can\u2019t thank him enough and his family,\u201d Brittany Mathis said. \u201cNever thought that anybody would do that and he did and it makes me feel really good.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The owner of a large, authentic German restaurant is selling his business of 17 years with the hope of providing a young employee with a brain tumor enough money to pay her growing medical bills.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://houston.cbslocal.com/2014/01/07/owner-sells-restaurant-to-help-save-employee-with-brain-tumor/", "image": {"width": 594, "secure_url": "https://cbshouston.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/56498743.jpg?w=594", "identifier": "https://cbshouston.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/56498743.jpg?w=594", "height": 547}, "type": "article", "description": "The owner of a large, authentic German restaurant is selling his business of 17 years with the hope of providing a young employee with a brain tumor enough money to pay her growing medical bills.", "title": "Owner Sells Restaurant To Help Save Employee With Brain Tumor"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbshouston.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/56498743.jpg?w=594", "description": "The owner of a large, authentic German restaurant is selling his business of 17 years with the hope of providing a young employee with a brain tumor enough money to pay her growing medical bills.", "site": "/sportsradio610", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Owner Sells Restaurant To Help Save Employee With Brain Tumor"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best Of Houston", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Houston", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/SportsRadio-610/104032468352?ref=tn_tnmn", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/SportsRadio-610/104032468352?ref=tn_tnmn"}, "keywords": "news, affordable care act, authentic german restaurant, barbara mathis, brain tumor, brittany mathis, highway 10, kaiserhof restaurant and wunderbar, khou-tv, medical bills, michael de beyer, montgomery, selling restaurant, texas", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://houston.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0cfb6508d7061918922ef03d191d5848?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, authentic german restaurant, barbara mathis, brain tumor, brittany mathis, highway 10, kaiserhof restaurant and wunderbar, khou-tv, medical bills, michael de beyer, montgomery, selling restaurant, texas"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3621\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNever thought that anybody would do that and he did and it makes me feel really good.\u201d\n\u201cI just can\u2019t be standing by and doing nothing,\u201d De Beyer told KHOU.\nHowever, Kaiserhof owner Michael De Beyer has stepped in to help the Mathis family.\n\u201cI have my good days and my bad,\u201d Mathis told KHOU.\n\u201cI guess sort of the same thing Brittany is going through,\u201d she told KHOU."}
