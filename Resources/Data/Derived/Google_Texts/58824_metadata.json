And the latest poll shows Mr. Biden slightly ahead of Bernie Sanders.\n\nVice President Joe Biden delivers remarks at the Strategic and Economic Dialogue at the State Department in Washington, June 23, 2015. An independent effort called Draft Biden 2016 is picking up steam.\n\nVice President Joe Biden has long harbored dreams of being president. He\u2019s run twice before, clearly relishes political life, and has yet to rule out a third try \u2013 even as Hillary Clinton dominates in fundraising and in polls of Democrats.\n\nAfter the death on May 30 of Mr. Biden\u2019s beloved elder son, Beau, such talk was put on hold. But in recent days, speculation has begun to soar. New York businessman Jon Cooper, a former Obama fundraising bundler now working on a draft effort to get Biden into the race, told the Monitor Thursday that he puts the probability of Biden running at 80 percent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m as convinced as I can be that Joe Biden will be entering the presidential race,\u201d said Mr. Cooper, who bases his assessment on signals from Biden\u2019s inner circle, though he can't name names.\n\nRecommended: Beyond Hillary Clinton: 7 other Democrats possibly (or definitely) running for president\n\nCooper has been sounding out potential donors, and already has commitments from five Obama contributors. On Thursday, Cooper signed on as national finance chair for an independent effort called Draft Biden 2016. Launched in March, the Chicago-based group has collected more than 100,000 signatures, and now has staff on the ground in early nominating states \u2013 Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. The group has also hired a national fundraising firm.\n\nBiden could also find encouragement in a new CNN/ORC national poll released Wednesday. Without lifting a finger, he is running second in the Democratic field, at 16 percent. Though Biden is well behind former Secretary Clinton (57 percent), he\u2019s in a statistical tie with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) of Vermont (14 percent), who has been campaigning hard and drawing crowds numbering in the thousands. Perhaps more important, Biden is national Democrats' second-choice candidate, with 35 percent saying he's their second choice and 14 percent choosing Sanders. If Clinton were to falter seriously, Democrats' second-choice candidate could be the biggest beneficiary.\n\nEarlier this week, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted Biden friends by name saying that before his death, Beau Biden had encouraged his dad to run, as has Biden\u2019s other son, Hunter.\n\nBiden will reportedly state his intentions, either way, by early August. When reached by telephone, former Sen. Ted Kaufman (D) of Delaware, a close friend of Biden\u2019s, declined to comment on the vice president\u2019s thinking. Biden's office also won't comment.\n\nPerhaps the biggest clue that Biden might run is that he and his inner circle have done nothing to stop the draft effort, say draft organizers.\n\n\u201cWe have had no communications from anyone in the Biden camp saying, \u2018Stop what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 \u201d William Pierce, executive director of Draft Biden 2016, said in an interview. \u201cDelaware\u2019s a small state, and we talk to the same people, and all we\u2019ve heard is a lot of encouraging communication from people who are close to the vice president.\u201d\n\nPierce\u2019s group has been holding events in Iowa and other states, and brings a life-size cutout of Biden, called \u201cCardboard Joe,\u201d to liven things up. At the group\u2019s website, DraftBiden2016.com, merchandise is for sale with the logo \u201cI\u2019m ridin' with Biden,\u201d featuring the veep driving a convertible and wearing his signature aviator sunglasses.\n\nPundits are skeptical Biden will run and suggest that the media are inflating the possibility to add interest to the Democratic race. If Biden were to run, they doubt he could beat Clinton for the nomination. On Wednesday, Clinton announced a fundraising haul of $45 million for the first three months of her candidacy, a record for a presidential candidate\u2019s first-quarter fundraising.\n\n\u201cIt would be a hard catch-up for Biden. He doesn\u2019t have the infrastructure. Who does he go to?\u201d says veteran Democratic strategist Peter Fenn. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Fenn gets why Biden has kept his options open. Since Harry Truman assumed the presidency after the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945, most vice presidents have run for the top job, and a few have reached it. Biden, a senator for 36 years before attaining the vice presidency, has long had that presidential gleam in his eye. He first ran in 1988, then again in 2008.\n\n\u201cI can die a happy man never having been president of the United States of America,\u201d Biden told GQ magazine in July 2013. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean I won\u2019t run.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoe\u2019s a thoroughbred,\u201d says Fenn. \u201cHe loves this. He sees the gate filling up with other horses, and it\u2019s hard for him not to head for it.\u201d\n\nWhat about the age issue? Already in his early 70s, Biden would be the oldest person to assume the presidency. But he\u2019s not that much older than Clinton, and he's younger than Senator Sanders. Biden supporters say what matters isn\u2019t age, it\u2019s energy and enthusiasm.\n\nAnd Biden is nothing if not enthusiastic \u2013 sometimes to his embarrassment. Who can forget his hot-mike comment in 2010 as Mr. Obama was about to sign the Affordable Care Act: \u201cThis is a big [expletive] deal.\u201d At a campaign appearance in southern Virginia in 2012, Biden again raised eyebrows when he told a predominantly black audience that Republicans are \u201cgoing to put y'all back in chains.\"\n\nBiden gaffes are many, but they\u2019re part of what gives him authenticity in a world of overly scripted candidates, analysts say. His life experiences, including a political career bookended by personal tragedy, give him plenty to go on in connecting with voters. Unlike Clinton, Biden is not wealthy, and he doesn\u2019t face the challenge on trustworthiness that she does, amid questions over her private e-mails and Clinton Foundation fundraising.\n\nBut by getting into the race relatively late, isn\u2019t there a big chance that Biden would end up only damaging Clinton, the eventual nominee? Fenn, the Democratic strategist, doesn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cDemocrats don\u2019t like coronations,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t like this notion that someone should be given the nomination without having to work hard and go through their paces. So my sense of this is that at the end, it would be good for Hillary to go through this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "2a76c39ea8112323851e944d9c5f5bda", "sailthru.author": "Linda Feldmann", "description": "A former Obama fundraiser, now finance chair for Draft Biden 2016, puts the probability that Vice President Joe Biden will run at 80 percent.
