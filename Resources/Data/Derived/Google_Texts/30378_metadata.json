Chris Christie, who said President Barack Obama\u2019s response to the recent influx of illegal immigration in Texas is \u201can indication of his unwillingness to lead.\u201d He noted Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson\u2019s efforts to break up smuggling networks that are bringing droves of young illegal immigrants into the U.S., but he blamed the president for not going to the border himself.\n\n\u201cHe wants us all to step up to the plate, right?\u201d Christie asked a crowd of about 800 at Greenwald Pavilion. \u201cThe president\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nChristie \u2014 who appeared with Gov. Sam Brownback, of Kansas; Gov. Nikki Haley, of South Carolina; Gov. Rick Scott, of Florida; and Gov. Scott Walker, of Wisconsin \u2014 said that during a recent meeting, he learned how the Department of Health and Human Services is handling the situation.\n\nAccording to Christie \u2014 and his takeaway from the meeting with Sec. Sylvia Mathews Burwell \u2014 about 90 percent of these children have a contact, and potential guardian, within the U.S. When these children are handed over to the guardian, documentation for the guardian is not verified, Christie said.\n\n\u201cOne of the two main jobs of this guardian is to make sure that this child goes to their immigration hearing, yet you\u2019re giving them potentially, and almost probably, to people who are not documented?\u201d Christie asked. \u201cSo the undocumented people, who haven\u2019t gone through the immigration system, are going to be the ones who go to the immigration office?\u201d\n\nAspen Institute President and CEO Walter Isaacson, who moderated the discussion, did not ask Christie about the George Washington Bridge scandal or his relationship with New York GOP gubernatorial hopeful Rob Astorino, whom Christie is not supporting in his race for governor.\n\nAccording to NJ.com, Astorino met briefly with Christie in Aspen on Thursday and confirmed that the New Jersey governor will not be lending his support, though other Republican governors have voiced theirs. According to the website, Christie said, \u201cWe don\u2019t invest in lost causes,\u201d adding that if the race becomes competitive, he\u2019ll consider campaigning.\n\nDuring Thursday\u2019s talk, each of the five governors explained why Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act needs to be repealed. A young Aspen resident from the audience asked if it really needs to be repealed or if it should be reformed and turned into successful legislation.\n\n\u201cI agree Obamacare is a complete disaster,\u201d the audience member said, \u201cbut when (President Franklin D. Roosevelt) instituted Social Security, it was a disaster until it started to grow.\u201d\n\nScott responded that the goal should be affordable and accessible health care, adding that government health care \u201chas never worked anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernment health care says, \u2018I\u2019m going to do everything,\u2019 they promptly run out of money, and then they say, \u2018We\u2019re going to keep doing everything. We\u2019re just not going to pay people to do it,\u2019\u201d Scott said. \u201cLook at the (Veterans Affairs) facilities.\u201d\n\nNear the beginning of the meeting, Walker broke down what he sees as one of the biggest differences between the GOP and Democrats, saying \u201cthe president and his allies\u201d measure success by how many people are dependent on government, between unemployment compensation, food stamps and Medicaid. He said success in government should instead be measured by how many people are no longer dependent.\n\n\u201cNobody grows up in America saying, \u2018I want to be dependent on government.\u2019 That\u2019s not the American dream. At least it wasn\u2019t when I grew up,\u201d he said.\n\nOn education, Haley said it\u2019s not rocket science and the U.S. needs to go back to basics. South Carolina, she said, has rolled back Common Core standards. Whether it\u2019s health care, education or regulation, everything should be state-run, she said. She added that South Carolina is focused on science, technology, engineering and math because \u201cwe build planes; we build tires; we\u2019re heavy manufacturing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what South Carolina kids need to get those South Carolina jobs,\u201d she said.\n\nIsaacson asked whether the U.S. needs some sort of standard so companies and parents can measure by state.\n\n\u201cIf we did not have high standards in South Carolina, we would not be building Boeing airplanes,\u201d Haley said, noting the presence of BMW, Bridgestone, Michelin and Continental in her state, as well. \u201cAt what point are the national, D.C. people best-suited to tell us what we need in South Carolina when we\u2019re recruiting these jobs every day?\u201d\n\nBrownback agreed with Haley that education starts with the basics, particularly reading at early ages. He added that when kids are in their junior and senior years of high school, some are not engaged.\n\n\u201cGive them some technical-school options,\u201d he said. \u201cGive them some college options.\u201d\n\nAnother area addressed Thursday was the criminal-justice system. Christie said there are too many people sitting in American prisons for petty, nonviolent drug offenses. In New Jersey, he said nonviolent, first-time offenders are sent to inpatient drug treatment rather than prison.\n\nAccording to him, in New Jersey it costs $49,000 a year to house someone in state prison. Inpatient treatment costs $24,000 per person, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pro-life,\u201d Christie explained. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re pro-life, you have to be pro-life when they get out of the womb also, and that gets messy sometimes. ... You\u2019ve got to be pro-life for the person who\u2019s sitting at the bottom of the jail cell, drug addicted, feeling like their life is over.\u201d\n\nherk@aspentimes.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Five Republican governors joined together Thursday at the Aspen Institute in slamming the Obama administration for its handling of education, immigration and health care while also laying out their", "og": {"url": "http://www.aspentimes.com/news/12338315-113/christie-care-carolina-health", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.aspentimes.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=f3Mz8CfZdHMQz3t925ZVHs$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYsQ_IQ2vLRW0HXQhfHyKCegWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "site_name": "The Aspen Times", "description": "Five Republican governors joined together Thursday at the Aspen Institute in slamming the Obama administration for its handling of education, immigration and health care while also laying out their", "title": "Schools, border, health care highlight GOP talk in Aspen | AspenTimes.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheAspenTimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 506229726080011}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 12338315}}, "keywords": "ASPEN, CARE, CAROLINA, CHRISTIE, GOV, GOVERNMENT, HEALTH, IMMIGRATION, PRESIDENT, SOUTH", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb86d\"", "article_summary": "She added that South Carolina is focused on science, technology, engineering and math because \u201cwe build planes; we build tires; we\u2019re heavy manufacturing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s what South Carolina kids need to get those South Carolina jobs,\u201d she said.\nWhether it\u2019s health care, education or regulation, everything should be state-run, she said.\nNikki Haley, of South Carolina; Gov.\nFive Republican governors joined together Thursday at the Aspen Institute in slamming the Obama administration for its handling of education, immigration and health care while also laying out their own solutions.\n\u201cI\u2019m pro-life,\u201d Christie explained."}
