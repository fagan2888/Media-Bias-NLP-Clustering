(Courtesy Whitman-Walker)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 At the height of the AIDS epidemic, Whitman-Walker was a clinic scarred by death. Today, it\u2019s reborn as a place that celebrates life and light.\n\nFor Whitman-Walker, it\u2019s been a long and intense journey down 14th Street. The original clinic was a cramped, dark building that primarily served D.C.\u2019s HIV/AIDS population. Now, it\u2019s evolved into a new state-of-the-art health center that services the whole community.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have more polar opposites,\u201d says Justin Goforth, director of community relations at Whitman-Walker.\n\nGoforth first came to the clinic as an HIV-positive patient, and eventually made it the place of his career.\n\nHe stands in the empty street-level pharmacy, just days before the shelves are filled and the first patients arrive.\n\n\u201cCompare where we are in this space to where we were in the late \u201880s, early \u201890s, where it was nothing but sick care and death and dying,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThis is about vitality, health and wellness,\u201d he adds, watching the sunlight pour through the front windows.\n\nGoforth says the new health center is the first in the area to be built specifically to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. It places an emphasis on preventive and wellness care and utilizes high-tech electronic medical records.\n\nThe building is white and airy, with colored tiles made out of recycled plastic bottles used to differentiate the various medical teams at work in the five-floor, 42,000 square foot structure.\n\n\u201cI think it is really going to change some lives,\u201d Goforth says. \u201cI just want to stand and see the looks on the patients\u2019 faces when they experience this place.\u201d\n\nIt was a jaw-dropping event for one patient who had a sneak peek of the clinic.\n\n\u201cI am in awe!\u201d says Michael Jones, who was diagnosed with the HIV at Whitman-Walker in 1992. He slowly walks past the last bits of construction rubble, and reflects on the changes he has seen in the last two decades.\n\n\u201cWhitman-Walker has definitely saved my life,\u201d he says.\n\nJones says he has learned how to live \u2014 and even thrive \u2014 with the AIDS virus, and that its diagnosis no longer a death sentence.\n\nIt is this shift \u2014 from dying with AIDS to living with HIV \u2014 that has enabled Whitman-Walker to evolve from a crisis model to a full-service health care provider.\n\nThe new health center, located at 1525 14th Street NW, will have twice as many exam rooms as the old clinic, and three times the number of dental chairs. It will also offer wellness services, such as acupuncture and nutritional counseling.\n\nOver the years, as HIV became treatable, Whitman-Walker\u2019s patients got healthier and so did it\u2019s bottom line. After years of scraping by, it\u2019s now making a bit of a profit \u2014 enough to put a big chunk toward the $9.8 million cost of the new building.\n\nThat\u2019s because today, almost all of the patients who come to Whitman-Walker have private insurance, Medicaid or Medicare; only 2 to 3 percent are uninsured, which is a big shift from the early days.\n\nIn the past six years, the clinic\u2019s patient base has nearly doubled, and the center expects that base to continue to grow as more patients access care through health care reform.\n\nCurrently, most of the clinic\u2019s patients are HIV-free, which is another major change from previous decades.\n\nWhitman-Walker\u2019s focus remains on treating Washington\u2019s LGBT community, although the center is open to all.\n\nGoforth says anyone who walks through the doors of the new building will get the same individualized care. That\u2019s something that has not changed since the earliest days of the AIDS epidemic, when patients came to Whitman-Walker and found the care and compassion that they couldn\u2019t find elsewhere.\n\nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook.\n\n\u00a9 2015 WTOP.
