The 5.4 percent cost increase in 2014 was the smallest in the history of the MMI, but 2015 represents a larger percentage increase (6.3 percent). Since the initial reading in 2001, the MMI index has shown an almost tripling of costs.\n\nThis year, prescription drug costs are leading the charge. Pharmaceutical costs grew by 13.6 percent over the previous year, considerably higher than the 6.8 percent average growth over the last five years.\n\nThanks to this increase, 15.9 percent of the total healthcare spending for the hypothetical family of four is now taken up by prescription drug costs.\n\nAll costs are increasing, but the employee\u2019s portion of the cost is increasing at a higher rate. Defined as the total of payroll deduction and out-of-pocket costs, over the last five years, the employee\u2019s cost burden has increased by almost 43 percent compared to 32 percent for employer\u2019s costs. For 2015, employer contributions covered 58 percent of the costs ($14,198) while employee costs of $10,473 were split between $6,408 in employee contributions (26 percent of the total) and $4,065 in out-of-pocket costs (16 percent of the total).\n\nBroken down into the components of spending, the largest components are inpatient facility care and professional services (physicians and other support personnel). Both take up 31 percent of the cost. Outpatient care takes up 19 percent of the costs; pharmacy charges are 16 percent of the costs; and the remaining 9 percent covers miscellaneous costs \u2014 things such as medical equipment, home health care, and ambulance transport.\n\nPrescription drug costs account for most of the increase, but professional services costs rose by only 3.6 percent \u2014 the lowest rate in the history of the MMI. Physicians bear little of the load for the 2015 increases.\n\nWhy have drug costs spiked? According to the Milliman report, the combination of expensive new specialty drugs and a price increase for both brand name and generic drugs contributed to \u201cthe perfect pharmaceutical storm.\u201d Adding to this perfect storm is the rise of the use of compounded drugs (along with a rise in their price) and the \u201cpatent cliff\u201d of expiring patent protection for well-known drugs like Lipitor and Nexium. The shift to generic is an initial improvement for consumers, but once generic alternatives are established, the more popular drugs raise the generic price component.\n\nThe reforms of the Affordable Care Act do not affect the MMI much, since the index is focused on employer-based group health plans and the ACA is aimed at individuals and smaller employers. However, Milliman suggests that continuing trends will eventually trigger the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d (an excise tax on higher-cost, higher-benefit plans) for the MMI average family. Milliman estimates that smaller employers may cross the excise tax line as early as 2018.\n\nIndirect costs from the ACA may also affect the MMI family, as lower income from the individual market may shift costs toward the employer market to make up the difference.\n\nThe bottom line of the Milliman report: health insurance costs are going up yet again. Future MMI reports are likely to reach the same conclusion. The only real question is how much the costs will rise, and whether the cost increases are broad or concentrated in one particular area.\n\nMore from moneytips:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly 16 percent of the total healthcare spending for a family of four is now taken up by prescription drug costs, according to this report.
