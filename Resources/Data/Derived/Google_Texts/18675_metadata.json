After six years of Republican talking heads deciding there are a number of smaller offenses that could lead to impeachment, what does Charles Krauthammer think will finally be the big move? The Republican writer and frequent Fox News guest believes that if President Obama issues an executive order that has to do with immigration, it will be unconstitutional.\n\nAppearing on Fox News yet again, Charles Krauthammer said he believed that if the Obama administration follows through with its threats to change immigration policy through an executive order, it would be a \u201cflagrant assault on the Constitution.\u201d While most Republicans in Washington have been claiming that they will not seek impeachment, and that Democrats bring it up more than they do, that move appears to be back on the table.\n\nThe November 4 elections shifted the balance of power in Washington, with the right wing taking back the U.S. Senate. Since that upheaval, there have been louder rumblings about potential impeachment hearings. Charles Krauthammer is apparently fanning those flames these days. The interesting part of Charles Krauthammer\u2019s comments is that they seem to go against what he was saying just this summer, when he called such a move \u201cpolitical suicide.\u201d It\u2019s possible that there is less a worry about that kind of suicide since they did indeed take quite a bit of power from the Democrats already.\n\nOf course, Charles Krauthammer also believes all this talk about moving unilaterally on immigration could be a trap. Charles Krauthammer says that one of the reasons Obama might be doing this is simply because he wants something to have on his resume when his legacy is talked about. As the commentator pointed out, the president\u2019s biggest accomplishment, Obamacare, is now in serious jeopardy thanks to the Republican majority.\n\nCharles Krauthammer also said he believes there\u2019s a chance the immigration move could be one that is being done as an attempt to get Republicans to go into a kind of \u201croad rage.\u201d President Obama might be looking for the Republicans to bring impeachment hearings, or shut down the government. Even with their new power, it appears Charles Krauthammer believes those could both backfire. There is still a presidential election coming in 2016, and Republicans don\u2019t have an obvious candidate, while Hilary Clinton seems like the favorite among dems. Charles Krauthammer pretty clearly feels as though that could still be a problem in the long run.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Charles Krauthammer believes that President Obama might finally be getting ready to do something that would legitimately merit impeachment.
