Their contracts expire May 1.\n\nThe new Norman-based network, Coordinated Care Oklahoma, and MyHealth \u2014 both nonprofit organizations \u2014 will compete for the business of hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices, pharmacies and health-care providers statewide, who, based on the number of providers, pay monthly subscriptions for connectivity, much like Internet companies compete for market share.\n\nFees range from $20 a month for a one-physician practice to hundreds of thousands of dollars annually for large medical systems.\n\nCoordinated Care Oklahoma Chief Administrative Officer Brian Yeaman, whose consulting company manages Coordinated Care Oklahoma, believes two networks will be good for the state, driving competitive pricing and improved service. David Kendrick, chief executive of MyHealth, disagrees.\n\n\u201cThink of the exchange like a public utility,\u201d said Kendrick, who believes one network would lower operating costs. \u201cYou don\u2019t need two exchanges any more than you need two water supply companies.\u201d\n\nWhat Yeaman and Kendrick, who are both physicians, passionately agree upon is the benefit and need to electronically share records. Since 2008, both have helped build Oklahoma\u2019s connectivity, which includes some 70 percent of health-care providers, compared with only 20 percent nationally.\n\nAll providers are required to connect to an exchange by fiscal 2016, or face reduced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nYeaman, a Norman family physician who built and runs the information exchange of Norman Regional Health System, recently saw a patient who had received care at the Oklahoma Heart Hospital a few days prior.\n\n\u201cShe was acting confused, and I asked her if she was sure she didn\u2019t have a stroke,\u201d Yeaman said. \u201cShe said she didn\u2019t think so, but that she was put on three new meds.\u201d\n\nYeaman logged onto SMRTNet to check his patient\u2019s medications, and instantly realized a common side effect of one of the drugs she was prescribed is confusion. He was close to sending her back to the hospital, but instead simply changed her medication, he said.\n\nSimilarly, Kendrick, an internist and pediatrician at the University of Oklahoma\u2019s School of Community Medicine in Tulsa, said the exchange regularly keeps him from sending patients to the emergency room.\n\n\u201cI can check their records and see that their cholesterol is normal, or their EKG (electrocardiogram) hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d he said.\n\nSome not connected\n\n\u201cPatients choose their doctors, not their hospitals, and shouldn\u2019t have to worry that their medical records won\u2019t follow them across the street to different providers,\u201d Kendrick said.\n\nStudies show sharing electronic health records reduces duplicated orders, harmful drug interactions and missed diagnostic opportunities, while boosting better health care, lower health care costs and better health outcomes. But despite the far-reaching benefits, some Oklahoma providers \u2014 including Variety Care \u2014 haven\u2019t yet connected to a health information exchange.\n\nVariety Care Chief Executive Lou Carmichael said her organization, which operates 17 community health centers across Oklahoma County and in three western Oklahoma towns, had been waiting to decide between MyHealth and SMRTNet and, since their pending merger was announced early last year, has been waiting on the merger.\n\n\u201cNow that the Oklahoma City hospitals have determined that they will have their own exchange, we\u2019re back in the same position of trying to decide between two,\u201d said Carmichael, who wishes the state had implemented one network, as the state of Virginia has. \u201cOur patients go to all of these ERs, but we cannot afford to pay the subscription fees to both exchanges.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Duncan Regional Hospital soon plans to migrate from SMRTNet to Coordinated Care Oklahoma because most of its patients traveling outside Stephens County for care go to Oklahoma City or Lawton, Chief Information Officer Roger Neal said. So far, Duncan Regional Hospital, with the help of $3.8 million in federal incentives, has invested $4.2 million in its electronic records infrastructure, Neal said.\n\nBoth Kendrick and Yeaman said they discussed a statewide merger, but couldn\u2019t agree on technology or governance, including board representation.\n\nStill, Yeaman promises seamless, transparent service.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have agreements in place, much like Verizon and AT&T, to ensure sharing of one another\u2019s networks,\u201d he said.\n\nCreating rural connections\n\nAs private competition is heating up, the Oklahoma Health Information Exchange Trust (OHIET) last month spent the last of the $10.6 million in federal stimulus grant money it was given to help providers, especially rural ones, connect to a network.\n\nThe trust used the grant money, matched with some $1 million in in-kind state donations, to help 74 rural hospitals, 27 behavioral health centers, 445 physicians and other providers, and 47 optometrists connect to an exchange, reported trust Chairman Robert Roswell, endocrinologist and OU public health professor, at a recent Crowe & Dunlevy law seminar.\n\nRoswell said the trust also developed an affiliation agreement that ensures information can be shared across state exchanges, and established a certification process for exchanges to ensure secure sharing of patient health information. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, patients at any time may opt out of electronic sharing, he said.\n\nTrustees of the Oklahoma Health Information Exchange Trust continue to meet monthly, Roswell said, though the trust has no funds, for months has operated with five versus seven trustees, and survived an unsuccessful attempt by Rep. Lewis Moore, R-Edmond, to kill it.\n\nSome skeptical\n\nMoore said the trust used federal funds to support a better alignment with the Affordable Care Act, which he strongly opposes.\n\nThe lawmaker said he also worries about the privacy of sharing electronic medical records.\n\n\u201cTruly, is there really any secure information anymore?\u201d Moore said.\n\nKeith Smith, an Oklahoma City anesthesiologist and co-owner of The Surgery Center of Oklahoma, also is more than wary.\n\n\u201cAs the French philosopher Albert Camus once said, \u2018The welfare of the masses is always the alibi of tyrants,\u2019\u201d Smith said. \u201cAn individual\u2019s health information is simply none of anyone else\u2019s business, particularly the government\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u00a92014 The Oklahoman", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "Nonprofit networks will compete for the business of hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices, pharmacies and health-care providers statewide.", "pubDate": "2014-04-14", "og": {"image": "http://media2.govtech.com/images/CoordinatedCareOklahoma.JPG", "title": "IT Landscape Changing for Sharing Oklahoma Patient Medical Records"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/health", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Health and Human Services", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f71\"", "article_summary": "Studies show sharing electronic health records reduces duplicated orders, harmful drug interactions and missed diagnostic opportunities, while boosting better health care, lower health care costs and better health outcomes.\nCoordinated Care Oklahoma Chief Administrative Officer Brian Yeaman, whose consulting company manages Coordinated Care Oklahoma, believes two networks will be good for the state, driving competitive pricing and improved service.\nBut despite the far-reaching benefits, some Oklahoma providers \u2014 including Variety Care \u2014 haven\u2019t yet connected to a health information exchange.\n\u201cAn individual\u2019s health information is simply none of anyone else\u2019s business, particularly the government\u2019s.\u201d\u00a92014 The Oklahoman\nKeith Smith, an Oklahoma City anesthesiologist and co-owner of The Surgery Center of Oklahoma, also is more than wary."}
