Companies focused on the provider side gathered $357 million in 42 deals (compared to $473 million in 41 deals in Q2 2015). Consumer-focused firms raked in $1.2 billion in 106 deals this quarter compared to ($727 million in 98 deals in Q2 2015).\n\n\"Rating, booking and comparison shopping companies had their best fundraising quarter since we began tracking the category,\" said Prabhu: $728 million in 15 deals. Mobile health companies ranked second with $319 million in 59 deals \u2013 apps scored $206 million and wearables got $88 million. Personal health and wellness companies, meanwhile, accounted for $114 million in 17 deals.\n\nOn the provider side, practice management companies attracted $72 million across five deals; telehealth companies raised $65 million in 14 deals, and data analytics firms scored $61 million in 14 deals.\n\nThe top VC deal this quarted looked overseas: $394 million raised by Guahao, an online portal for patients in China to book appointments with physicians. ZocDoc, another online booking platform raised $130 million. Practo, which created a physician search engine to book appointments and rate providers, raised $90 million. Kareo, which develops cloud-based medical office software for small practices, raised $55.4 million. Grand Rounds, which matches patients with specialists and connects them for second opinions on a medical diagnosis, scored $55 million.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\n\"Consumer-focused health IT companies have continued to grab a larger portion of VC funding but have consistently lagged practice-focused companies in M&A activity,\" said Prabhu. \"This quarter, however, M&A activity increased with 18 consumer-focused transactions, the highest number for these companies in a single quarter. It is a very positive trend if it continues because IPOs have not proven to be a sure path to success for the sector.\"\n\nOn the M&A side, IBM's $1 billion acquisition of Merge Healthcare, maker of imaging technology, was far and away the biggest. Emdeon's $910 million acquisition of payment tool developer Altegra Health was next on the list, follwed by Premier's $400 million buy of CECity, which develops a cloud-based data analytics for performance management.\n\nTwitter: @mikemiliardHITN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/health-it-vc-back-track-after-dip", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Wall-Street-sign-feature_0_0.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Venture capital funding for digital health rebounded in the third quarter of 2015, up 32 percent quarter over quarter with $1.6 billion doled out across 148 deals, according to a new report from Mercom Capital Group.", "title": "Venture capital funding for healthcare technology rebounds, investors log $1.6 billion in deals in Q3"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Wall-Street-sign-feature_0_0.gif"}, "description": "Venture capital funding for digital health rebounded in the third quarter of 2015, up 32 percent quarter over quarter with $1.6 billion doled out across 148 deals, according to a new report from Mercom Capital Group.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Venture capital funding for healthcare technology rebounds, investors log $1.6 billion in deals in Q3"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Venture capital funding for digital health rebounded in the third quarter of 2015, up 32 percent quarter over quarter with $1.6 billion doled out across 148 deals, according to a new report from Mercom Capital Group.&#13; VC cash for health IT has hit $3.57 billion in 2015 so far.&#13; \"VC funding into healthcare IT companies bounced back this quarter after a slow start this year,\" said Mercom Capital CEO Raj Prabhu, in a statement.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0bd\"", "article_summary": "Mobile health companies ranked second with $319 million in 59 deals \u2013 apps scored $206 million and wearables got $88 million.\nConsumer-focused firms raked in $1.2 billion in 106 deals this quarter compared to ($727 million in 98 deals in Q2 2015).\nOn the provider side, practice management companies attracted $72 million across five deals; telehealth companies raised $65 million in 14 deals, and data analytics firms scored $61 million in 14 deals.\nThe top VC deal this quarted looked overseas: $394 million raised by Guahao, an online portal for patients in China to book appointments with physicians.\nCompanies focused on the provider side gathered $357 million in 42 deals (compared to $473 million in 41 deals in Q2 2015)."}
