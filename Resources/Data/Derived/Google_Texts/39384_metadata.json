Many uninsured people are expected to transition to Medicaid, and as a result, overall emergency department use may increase because Medicaid patients have higher rates of ER use, as the study found. At the same time, some states are proposing cuts to Medicaid or refusing to expand it, which could exacerbate waiting time in the ER.\n\nThe analysis will be published as a \u201cResearch Letter\u201d on Sept. 18 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).\n\nThe study investigated trends in the association between insurance coverage and usage of emergency departments among adults ages 18 to 64.\n\nIn California, the number of visits to emergency rooms increased 13.2 percent between 2005 and 2010, from 5.4 million to 6.1 million per year, the researchers reported.\n\nRenee Y. Hsia, MD\n\n\u201cWe undertook the study with an eye toward identifying important coming concerns,\u201d said lead author Renee Y. Hsia, MD, an associate professor of emergency medicine at UCSF. She is also an attending physician in the emergency department at the UCSF-affilated San Francisco General Hospital & Trauma Center and a faculty member of the UCSF Institute for Health Policy Studies.\n\n\u201cAll the findings suggest that emergency department use may actually increase with health care reform, instead of decline, if most of the uninsured patients become eligible and enroll in Medicaid,\u201d Hsia said. \u201cThese results should not discourage policymakers from pursuing health care reform. Rather we hope our study will shed some light on issues that need to be addressed as we continue to expand insurance coverage to millions of uninsured patients.\u201d\n\nAffordable Care Act's Impact on ERs\n\nEmergency rooms are deeply affected by insurance patterns over time \u2013 and with the upcoming rollout of the Affordable Care Act, which will expand eligibility for Medicaid among many other significant changes, ERs likely will be impacted even more, according to the researchers.\n\nUnder the new health legislation, many previously uninsured individuals will qualify for Medicaid in states that choose to expand their Medicaid programs. Some states, however, are proposing major cuts to Medicaid programs, which could further limit individual access to primary care.\n\nWhile uninsured patients often have been singled out for inappropriate overuse of the ER, the analysis found that ER usage during the study timeframe actually grew fastest among Medicaid beneficiaries, the federal program for people with low incomes.\n\nAmong Medicaid beneficiaries, the rate increased from 572 to 651 visits per 1000;\n\nAmong the privately insured, the rate rose from 158 to 164 visits per 1000;\n\nAmong the uninsured, the rate rose from 242 to 259 visits per 1000.\n\nOverall emergency department visit rates from 2005-2010 among adults ages 19 to 64, by insurance status.\n\nIn addition, Medicaid patients consistently had the highest rate of visits for potentially preventable conditions, the researchers wrote.\n\nThe study data were derived from the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development\u2019s Emergency Discharge Data and Patient Discharge Data.\n\nUCSF co-authors are Hsia\u2019s research assistants Julia Brownell and Nicole Gordon.\n\nThe study was primarily funded by a grant from the California HealthCare Foundation. Additional financial support was provided by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences; the National Institutes of Health through UCSF Clinical and Translational Science Institute grant (KL2 TR0000143) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Physician Faculty Scholars Program.\n\nUCSF is a leading university dedicated to promoting health worldwide through advanced biomedical research, graduate-level education in the life sciences and health professions, and excellence in patient care.
