No hand-wringing about the state of American politics now that congress has defied the will of the first black president. There will be no scary pieces on how a stubborn minority party is holding up bills that have proven to create jobs \u2013 both here and abroad. There\u2019ll be no passionate speeches about the dangers of big-money interests buying democracy.\n\nRemember these aren\u2019t your parents\u2019 Democrats. And when Democrats rebelled against Obama\u2019s bipartisan trade initiative this week and voted to stop debate on a fast-track bill, we learned that the Senate is now run by Elizabeth Warren, who is not your average liberal.\n\nObama is correct. Warren\u2019s arguments on trade don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny. But they also stand well outside the traditional Democratic Party stance on free trade. According to a recent Wall Street Journal poll (though, admittedly, these polls often have as much to do with who is president as they do with strongly held ideological positions) Democrats are less likely today to be averse to trade than Republicans. Asked whether free trade between the U.S. and foreign countries helped or hurt the country, only 26 percent of Democrats said it has hurt, but 36 percent of Republicans \u2014 and 44 percent of Tea Partiers \u2014 believe trade has hurt the U.S.\n\nSo perhaps our future is anti-trade. But at this point, it\u2019s far-fetched, to say the least, to believe that Warren or Sherrod Brown rallied their party to shut down the TPP because of a profound concern about transparency or executive abuse. When it comes to climate change, for example, the administration functions without any congressional oversight as it implements legislation by fiat\u2013not to mention a possible international deal\u2013yet the duo is not only quiet, but supportive of the effort. When it comes to the Export-Import Bank, cronyism and a lack of transparency don\u2019t stop the duo from supporting it. The reason there is no deal on trade is that Warren, like many progressives, is a protectionist. And now Senate Democrats are also protectionists.\n\nThe White House wants the authority to negotiate with Asia-Pacific nations \u2014 11 of them \u2014 without having to share every detail before a deal is reached. This is how international treaties have been crafted for decades. This is how the Iranian deal, the one that Democrats are so supportive of, is being put together. And though unions and their allies in D.C. continue to make the absurd claim that TPP is being forged in some unprecedented secrecy, the Senate would have 60 days to read the deal (or not read it) and vote up or down after it was finalized. Did Republicans have 60 days to read over Obamacare before the vote?\n\nMitch McConnell, who is always being reminded that he made it his mission to make Obama a one-termer, conceded a separate Trade Adjustment Assistance bill that would subsidize U.S. workers who might be harmed by temporary of loosening of trade barriers. That wasn\u2019t enough. Ron Wyden, who only a day earlier tweeted out his support for the TPP bill, claimed that Obama\u2019s fast-track bill on its own wouldn\u2019t do enough to stop slavery abroad. As my colleague Sean Davis pointed out, where is the similar concern for the downtrodden when it comes to the Iranian nuke deal that Democrats want to fast track?\n\nNo legislation is ever perfect; there has to be compromise. This is what we were incessantly lectured about when the GOP would not submit to supporting legislation that offered them virtually nothing. So who\u2019ll be the first MSNBC host to call Democrats a bunch of nihilists? This trade bill is Obama\u2019s priority, his centerpiece, after all.\n\nAnd the day\u2019s drama culminated with Brown, perhaps the most antagonistic lawmaker on the issue of free trade outside of Warren, accusing the president of sexism, which is more or less how every debate ends these days when one side runs out of arguments.\n\nIt is the Democrats\u2019 prerogative to stop bills through procedural means, just as Republicans did. In some ways, it\u2019s heartening to see them finally standing up to the president. It\u2019s the responsibility of Congress to be a counterbalance to executive power, even, as in this case, if it\u2019s misplaced. Obviously there are layers of complex policy here that are worthy of debate. But today\u2019s events do reconfirm two things: 1) Democrats are no less ideologically driven or stubborn than their counterparts, and 2) Hillary Clinton is going to wait to see which side wins before chiming in.\n\nHarry Reid doesn\u2019t have the will or the charisma to rally grassroots and political support to stop the president.
