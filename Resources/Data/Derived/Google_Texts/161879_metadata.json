And the space between towns is enough to drown a driver in thought.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m on the moon right now,\u201d Rockies outfielder Michael Cuddyer said by phone Friday from Montana\u2019s Highway 200. \u201cI\u2019m somewhere in the fields. And there\u2019s absolutely nobody else on the road. It\u2019s really kind of tranquil.\u201d\n\nCuddyer\u2019s journey from Minnesota Twins mainstay and American League all-star to National League batting champion in Denver was even longer. The 35-year-old is playing out his 14th major-league season.\n\nBut Cuddyer, driving this week between rookie-level Pioneer League towns on an injury rehabilitation stint, may also be between career stops.\n\nIn a contract year \u2014 nearing the end of a three-year, $31.5 million deal with the Rockies \u2014 Cuddyer is not only rehabbing a broken bone in his left shoulder. He\u2019s perhaps auditioning for his future.\n\n\u201cYou never want to go into an offseason weighing on your mind if you\u2019re healthy,\u201d Cuddyer said. \u201cI just want to go out there and know I\u2019m healthy and I\u2019ll be back with five to six weeks left in the season and get back to being me.\u201d\n\nAfter five games with the Grand Junction Rockies \u2014 he went 5-for-7 with three doubles, three RBIs and three runs in his first two rehab starts \u2014 Cuddyer will skip up to Double-A Tulsa on Tuesday for four games with the Drillers. He is looking to have about 40 at-bats to get back into game shape. If all goes well, he should rejoin the Rockies this coming weekend for a series at home against the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nThe Rockies have indicated they want Cuddyer back next season, but it\u2019s not clear at what price.\n\n\u201cI would like to figure out a way to keep him,\u201d club owner Dick Monfort said in July. \u201cHe brings value to this team.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 outfield, if it stays intact, looks crowded in 2015, with all-star Charlie Blackmon in center, Carlos Gonzalez in right and hot-hitting Corey Dickerson (.320 batting average, .381 on-base percentage) bidding to be the full-time left fielder.\n\nCuddyer was hitting .317 through 31 games before breaking his shoulder diving for a groundball at third base, where he was filling in for an injured Nolan Arenado.\n\nFor now, Cuddy is working back to full health. And that means returning to the lower-level leagues.\n\n\u201cFor me, I almost have fonder memories of being in the minor leagues than I do in the first few years of the major leagues,\u201d Cuddyer said.\n\nOn his way up through the Twins\u2019 farm system in the late 1990s, Cuddyer skipped rookie ball and jumped straight to the Single-A Midwest League to play for the Fort Wayne Wizards.\n\n\u201cThe camaraderie is different \u2014 you go through the grind together. Everybody is in the same spot. It\u2019s a lot of fun to see how close they are \u2014 in proximity in the clubhouse and personally.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you form your understanding of baseball.\u201d\n\nCuddyer remembers 16-hour bus rides between Midwest towns, with the only stops at gas stations for dinner.\n\n\u201cThere were many, many times when my dinner was tuna fish out of a can on crackers,\u201d he said.\n\nCuddyer could have rehabbed with batting practice and groundball work at Coors Field. But he chose to get back by joining the bus leagues.\n\n\u201cI chose to go play games for the reason of getting my legs back in shape,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no substitute for running out a double or going from first to third on a hit or advancing on passed balls. You can train or take BP all you want. But there\u2019s no substitute for games.\u201d\n\nCuddyer said he feels no pressure to prove himself down the stretch, either for free-agent suitors or Rockies management. While he\u2019s rehabbing, he wants to make an impact on the teenagers learning the game in Colorado\u2019s farm system.\n\nForrest Wall, the Rockies\u2019 18-year-old first-round draft pick (35th overall) in June from Maitland, Fla., who now is playing second base for Grand Junction, took his tips after Cuddyer skipped a pregame prep to join the team\u2019s hitters\u2019 meeting.\n\n\u201cBeing a first-year guy, to have Michael Cuddyer, batting champ, around for advice is really special,\u201d Wall said. \u201cI talked to him about approach. He\u2019s big on preparation, what he does before a game. Then once it\u2019s game time, just have fun.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Michael Cuddyer at Rockies career crossroads in old minors territory", "title": "Michael Cuddyer at Rockies career crossroads in old minors territory", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/09/michael-cuddyer-at-rockies-career-crossroads-in-old-minors-territory/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140809__20140810_C5_SP10BBNROCKIESENTERp1.jpg", "height": 423}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140809__20140810_C5_SP10BBNROCKIESENTERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-09T20:04:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:05:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBeing a first-year guy, to have Michael Cuddyer, batting champ, around for advice is really special,\u201d Wall said.\nIt\u2019s really kind of tranquil.\u201dCuddyer\u2019s journey from Minnesota Twins mainstay and American League all-star to National League batting champion in Denver was even longer.\nBut Cuddyer, driving this week between rookie-level Pioneer League towns on an injury rehabilitation stint, may also be between career stops.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m on the moon right now,\u201d Rockies outfielder Michael Cuddyer said by phone Friday from Montana\u2019s Highway 200.\nIn a contract year \u2014 nearing the end of a three-year, $31.5 million deal with the Rockies \u2014 Cuddyer is not only rehabbing a broken bone in his left shoulder."}
