The urban model world is what I do. The pictures I post, that's my job. See Joey's not just posting butt body parts because he's posting the chicks he's supposedly dating or spending time with that's completely different,\" Tahiry says.\n\n\n\nThings start to take a turn for the worse between the women when Rashidah asks, \"But are you still doing the same thing at 30 plus years old that you did at 20 plus?\"\n\n\n\nTahiry gets instantly offended and starts to defend her career, while Rashidah goes on to state that maybe its her lack of personal and career growth that's causing Joe to act out.\n\n\n\n\"It may not make sense to you but maybe he's doing it to get a reaction out of you,\" Rashidah says. \"Because guess what, I see all the time you post pictures of your a** not in a tasteful sexy way.\"\n\n\n\nTahiry then gets up, deciding to leave the dress fitting, as Rashidah continues to get even more more cut-throat with her friend.\n\n\n\n\"You have attention issues, you have daddy issues and maybe you should pay attention to what I'm saying as a friend!\" Rashidah yells. \"I have a wedding and you haven't even taken five minutes to call your own friend and ask your friend do you nee help with anything!\"\n\n\n\n\"Rashidah has some right to feel the way she does, but she could of picked up the phone and called me and tell me what she needed instead of talkin all this bulls**t,\" Tahiry says to the greenroom cameras.\n\n\n\nTahiry walks out of the house angrily and Rashidah yells out the door that Tahiry is no longer going to be in her wedding anymore.\n\n\n\nWill the friends be able to reconcile before Rashidah's big day? Or have their hurtful words caused too much animosity for the friendship to ever be restored?\n\n\n\nCatch the sneak peek of \"Love and Hip Hop New York\" episode 10 below.
