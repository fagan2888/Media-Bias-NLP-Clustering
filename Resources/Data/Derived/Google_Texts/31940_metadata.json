The most recent Republican candidate announcement came from Detroit-native Ben Carson this past Monday (May 4).\n\nThe extra-blunt orator made a grand entry into the race with his official announcement being accompanied by a gospel choir singing a soulful medley and Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d The retired neurosurgeon is certain that he\u2019s what America needs to get up and hit the ground running again. Carson\u2014who prides himself on not being a politician\u2014may have an upper hand over his competition which includes (second-timers) Rick Santorum and Rick Perry and Ran Paul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m probably never going to be politically correct because I\u2019m not a politician,\u201d Carson said to a crowd of estimated thousands. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a politician. Because politicians do what is politically expedient \u2014 I want to do what\u2019s right.\u201d This same straightforwardness and unfiltered opinion, however, is also a double-edged sword. While many may love and respect honesty from a politician, it also can hinder him from moving forward in the race and teetering the line of being a liability to the GOP.\n\nEven a few conservative Republicans found his comparisons of Obamacare and slavery and the United States to Nazi Germany a little too much. However, the GOP knew to get the minority vote they\u2019ll have to do something drastic and a Black non-politician may be drastic enough.\n\nWe\u2019re curious to see how this race shapes out, but more importantly, if Carson will be taking his choir on his state-to-state tour with him.\n\nBen Carson\u2019s presidential campaign announcement opened with a surprising bit of theatrics \u2014 a gospel choir singing Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d http://cnn.it/1K9Fxhf Posted by CNN Politics on Monday, May 4, 2015\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty Images", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson announced that he's running for President of the United States... to the tune of Eminem's \"Lose Yourself.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Vibe", "description": "Ben Carson announced that he\u2019s running for President of the United States\u2026 to the tune of Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d", "title": "Ben Carson Announced His Presidential Run With A Choir", "url": "http://www.vibe.com/2015/05/ben-carson-presidential-announcement-choir/", "image": {"width": 3000, "identifier": "http://static.vibe.com/files/2015/05/ben-carson-presidential-announcement.jpg", "height": 2000}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ben Carson announced that he\u2019s running for President of the United States\u2026 to the tune of Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 123159412963}, "keywords": "ben carson", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-06T16:47:38Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-06T16:47:38Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3b0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m probably never going to be politically correct because I\u2019m not a politician,\u201d Carson said to a crowd of estimated thousands.\nBen Carson\u2019s presidential campaign announcement opened with a surprising bit of theatrics \u2014 a gospel choir singing Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d http://cnn.it/1K9Fxhf Posted by CNN Politics on Monday, May 4, 2015Photo Credit: Getty Images\nThe most recent Republican candidate announcement came from Detroit-native Ben Carson this past Monday (May 4).\nWe\u2019re curious to see how this race shapes out, but more importantly, if Carson will be taking his choir on his state-to-state tour with him.\nThe 2016 Presidential campaign is getting interesting as more candidates announce their running (and no, we\u2019re not talking about Waka Flocka)."}
