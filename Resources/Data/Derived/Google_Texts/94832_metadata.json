In recent years, however, the law has come under attack as various state legislatures have chipped away at key provisions.\n\n\u201cIn theory, everybody\u2019s in favor of the right to vote,\u201d President Obama said recently. \u201cBut in practice, we have state legislatures that are deliberately trying to make it harder for people to vote.\u201d\n\nThe president is calling on Congress to approve an updated version of the law that would neutralize some of these state efforts. Republicans, for the most part, are not receptive. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell argues that a strengthened law is unnecessary. \u201cAmerica\u2019s come a long way,\u201d he says, \u201cand the Voting Rights Act is intact.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the law was gutted in 2013 when the U.S. Supreme Court wiped out a crucial provision that required states with a history of racial discrimination to obtain advance federal approval before changing their election laws. That element of the law recognized that some states have a well documented history of racial discrimination, and it enabled the federal government to effectively pre-empt any further attempts at limiting the voting rights of minorities.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court struck down that provision of the law, it did so by ruling that it was based on \u201c40-year-old facts having no logical relationship to the present day.\u201d The court, apparently, was under the impression that racial discrimination was a thing of the past.\n\nSo, as it stands now, the Justice Department can take action on voting-rights violations only after the fact. The trouble is, state laws that restrict voting rights are approved by elected officials who, collectively, are more likely to win re-election \u2014 and remain in control of their states\u2019 elections \u2014 as a direct result of the laws\u2019 passage. Rigged elections beget more rigged elections, which is why pre-emptive enforcement was such a valuable component of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nWhile literacy tests are no longer used, voter-identification laws, such as those advocated by Iowa\u2019s former secretary of state, Matt Schultz, have now been enacted in at least 34 states. While the intent isn\u2019t always to discriminate against eligible minority voters, that is the unavoidable outcome.\n\nJust two weeks ago, a panel of federal judges ruled against the voter-ID law in Texas. The three judges upheld an earlier ruling by U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzalez Ramos, who said the 2011 law amounted to \u201can unconstitutional poll tax\u201d and was \u201cimposed with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose\u201d to make it harder for Hispanics and blacks to vote.\n\nIf Congress, or the Supreme Court, needs evidence that racial discrimination at the polls remains a threat even today, they need look no further than Texas.\n\nThe Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2015, sponsored by Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, would restore the federal government\u2019s ability to pre-empt election-law changes in states with 15 or more voting-rights violations over the past 25 years. Currently, 13 states would be subject to this federal oversight, but all would be able to graduate from the group if they incurred no additional violations over the next 10 years.\n\nLeahy\u2019s bill is a common-sense approach to protecting the voting rights of minorities. It deserves the support of everyone in Congress.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1TMxobT", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The intent of voter-ID laws isn\u2019t always to discriminate against minority voters, that is the outcome.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "The intent of voter-ID laws isn\u2019t always to discriminate against minority voters, that is the outcome.", "title": "Editorial: Voting rights enforcement still needed in some states", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/08/17/voting-rights-act-enforcement-needed/31817857/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The intent of voter-ID laws isn\u2019t always to discriminate against minority voters, that is the outcome.", "title": "Editorial: Voting rights enforcement still needed in some states", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a032733674bb3242890ce22812214f6584dfa43c/c=300-0-1140-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/16/DesMoines/B9318456965Z.1_20150816152156_000_GR8BKK1GU.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "title": "Editorial: Voting rights enforcement still needed in some states", "author": "The Register's editorial", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/editorials", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e26cfb82badd8e84cd9db68bc780c54591f1861e/c=405-0-1035-840/local/-/media/2015/08/16/DesMoines/B9318456965Z.1_20150816152156_000_GR8BKK1GU.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dac7d256a59f84940e502b66fdba9c9126e1eda5/c=300-0-1140-840/local/-/media/2015/08/16/DesMoines/B9318456965Z.1_20150816152156_000_GR8BKK1GU.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ea01a6a00dbd2496de65f37025887b7eaa790f77/c=160-0-1280-840/local/-/media/2015/08/16/DesMoines/B9318456965Z.1_20150816152156_000_GR8BKK1GU.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bd64435675ed77d92ee7226039c86a4975acbcd1/c=0-15-1440-825&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/16/DesMoines/B9318456965Z.1_20150816152156_000_GR8BKK1GU.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-16T23:09:10.513000-05:00", "shorthed": "Editorial: Voting rights enforcement still needed in some states", "articleid": 31817857, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf590beeec04e793cbf8e7ec6bbd1a1289afc9ba/c=0-15-1440-825/local/-/media/2015/08/16/DesMoines/B9318456965Z.1_20150816152156_000_GR8BKK1GU.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a7e9250d0c4461d31b889d1561416dbe34fc853/c=484-0-956-840/local/-/media/2015/08/16/DesMoines/B9318456965Z.1_20150816152156_000_GR8BKK1GU.1-0.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcdbb\"", "article_summary": "Rigged elections beget more rigged elections, which is why pre-emptive enforcement was such a valuable component of the Voting Rights Act.\nLeahy\u2019s bill is a common-sense approach to protecting the voting rights of minorities.\nThe trouble is, state laws that restrict voting rights are approved by elected officials who, collectively, are more likely to win re-election \u2014 and remain in control of their states\u2019 elections \u2014 as a direct result of the laws\u2019 passage.\nBuy Photo The Register\u2019s Editorial (Photo: The Register)Buy PhotoWhen the Voting Rights Act was passed by Congress in 1965, it was intended to outlaw poll taxes, literacy tests and other attempts by state governments to discourage minorities from voting.\nThat element of the law recognized that some states have a well documented history of racial discrimination, and it enabled the federal government to effectively pre-empt any further attempts at limiting the voting rights of minorities."}
