(Photo: Daniel Mears / The Detroit News)Buy Photo\n\nThe UAW and the three Detroit automakers must figure out a way to contain health care costs as they continue contract negotiations. Health costs have grown in past decades at a rate neither party can afford, and it needs to be a priority for both the union and automakers.\n\nWith the onset of Obamacare\u2019s Cadillac tax \u2014 a fee employers have to pay on premium health care plans beginning in 2018 \u2014 creative solutions should be found to reduce costs.\n\nHealth care costs for all three companies have increased exponentially since the 2011 talks and combined reach several billions of dollars.\n\nUAW president Dennis Williams has presented the idea to create a co-op pool for all active employees, which would reduce rising costs overall by allowing the union to negotiate with insurers and providers and maintain quality benefits for the future.\n\nWhile it presents significant challenges, the two parties should work toward the co-op, or any other solution that will mitigate future costs.\n\n\u201cCompanies are willing to talk about anything that slows the rate of growth of the health care burden,\u201d said labor expert Kristin Dziczek at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor.\n\nSeeking a carve-out from Obamacare\u2019s onerous tax, however, is one option that should be off the table. The UAW was a vocal supporter of the president as a candidate, as well as of his signature health care law. It should not be spared the consequences of a law it helped enact.\n\nWilliams\u2019 proposal is similar to the Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) established after the 2007 contract talks to manage health care for about 750,000 UAW retirees and their spouses.\n\nThe VEBA \u2014 the biggest private pool of insurance in the U.S. \u2014 has since been a somewhat surprising success, thanks in part to a strong stock market in recent years, but also because of the union\u2019s effective management of the funds.\n\nThe union quickly learned how to contain costs by helping retirees manage chronic conditions. Encouraging them to keep up with prescriptions, schedule regular doctor appointments and avoid catastrophic situations drove down insurance costs for the whole pool.\n\nThe VEBA\u2019s benefits fund went to 97 percent funded in 2013, from 60 or 70 percent in its early years.\n\nIf the UAW could apply the same principles to a co-op for active employees, it might work.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any other way,\u201d Williams told The Detroit News.\n\nThere are several differences, however, in managing active employees versus retirees.\n\nMany in the VEBA are eligible for Medicare, which helps lower costs. VEBA participants also pay high deductibles in retirement they didn\u2019t pay while active. Active workers hired before 2007 don\u2019t pay deductibles now, sure to be a sticking point in the negotiations.\n\nAdditionally, the VEBA received tax-deductible contributions of about $55 billion combined from the Big Three at its inception. Legally, contributions can be made for active employees into a co-op, but they wouldn\u2019t be tax-deductible.\n\nUAW members don\u2019t want to pay any more for health care than they currently do, but they also must realize they enjoy some of the best health care plans in the country at some of the lowest costs.\n\nKeeping that benefit is going to be a challenge. Negotiating costs with insurers and managing employees\u2019 chronic conditions are a good start.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1UOS9Pw", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It\u2019s essential for the union, automakers to embrace creative solutions to keep insurance coverage affordable", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "It\u2019s essential for the union, automakers to embrace creative solutions to keep insurance coverage affordable", "title": "Editorial: UAW contract must contain health costs", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/editorials/2015/09/11/editorial-uaw-health-care/72082240/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s essential for the union, automakers to embrace creative solutions to keep insurance coverage affordable", "title": "Editorial: UAW contract must contain health costs", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/24ca31dc3555fd46bca4b9869f0fd57a2c507e08/c=636-0-3386-2750&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/11/DetroitNews/B99304020Z.1_20150911152846_000_G32J82OP.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "UAW, contract talks, Big Three, Dennis Williams, Obamacare, Cadillac tax"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd381\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Daniel Mears / The Detroit News)Buy PhotoThe UAW and the three Detroit automakers must figure out a way to contain health care costs as they continue contract negotiations.\nHealth care costs for all three companies have increased exponentially since the 2011 talks and combined reach several billions of dollars.\nThe UAW was a vocal supporter of the president as a candidate, as well as of his signature health care law.\nHealth costs have grown in past decades at a rate neither party can afford, and it needs to be a priority for both the union and automakers.\nUAW members don\u2019t want to pay any more for health care than they currently do, but they also must realize they enjoy some of the best health care plans in the country at some of the lowest costs."}
