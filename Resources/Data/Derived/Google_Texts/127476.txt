Unsatisfied with Obamacare, supporters of a single-payer health care system successfully collected enough signatures to put their preferred health care model on the 2016 ballot in the state of Colorado.

Proponents of the single-payer system, called ColoradoCare, say they have over the required 98,492 signatures needed to quality for the ballot.

State Sen. Irene Aguilar (D-Denver) told The Durango Herald:

“The uncertainty that we continue to have in our health-care system … made people hungry for something a little bit different. “The frustration with Congress … provides a good tilling of the soil for the possibility of Colorado designing its own system.”

Obamacare allows the states to obtain waivers to create their own health care systems, if they meet its conditions.

ColoradoCare would eliminate private insurance so the state can cover health expenses by having Colorado residents pay a 10% premium tax; employers pay 6.67% of the 10% from their employees wage and benefit package, and employees are responsible for 3.33%.

This amounts to a $25 billion tax increase, according to The Durango Herald.

Technically, a single-payer health care system is one in which governments, rather than insurers, pay for all health care costs. Canada and Taiwan have this system; Germany has over 150 “sickness funds” citizens can join, or pay for private insurance; the Swiss and Dutch health systems are similar to the ACA’s health-insurance exchanges.

Years before winning the White House, President Obama was a vocal supporter of a single-payer health care system. In 2003, the then-Illinois state Sen. Obama told a union crowd:

“I happen to be a proponent of a single-payer, universal health care plan. … “But as all of you know, we may not get there immediately. Because first we’ve got to take back the White House, we’ve got to take back the Senate, and we’ve got to take back the House.”

And in April 2008, as the White House neared, Obama suggested his health care reforms could be a step to the single-payer system:

“If I were designing a system from scratch, I would probably go ahead with a single-payer system. … “(But) people don’t have time to wait. They need relief now. So my attitude is let’s build up the system we got, let’s make it more efficient, we may be over time — as we make the system more efficient and everybody’s covered — decide that there are other ways for us to provide care more effectively.”

In 2016, Colorado voters will have the chance to decide if they want to take that next step.
