Mike Pylar, a spokesman for the city\u2019s fire department, said no one was injured in the blaze, which happened about 10 a.m. as only mechanics were aboard the Boeing 757 aircraft.\n\nPylar said the fire was in an engine, but the airline says it was not one of the aircraft\u2019s wing-mounted motors.\n\n\u201cThey were attempting to start it,\u201d Pylar said of the mechanics. \u201cWhen they did, it evidently started a fire.\u201d\n\nThe plane was parked at the airport\u2019s B Concourse when the blaze was sparked. Pylar said there was only minor damage to the aircraft.\n\n\u201cThey got it under control pretty quick,\u201d Pylar explained. Airport officials said further inquiries on the incident should be directed to United.\n\nLuke Punzenberger, a spokesman for the airline, called the fire a \u201cmechanical issue.\u201d\n\nThe plane had initially boarded passengers and briefly pushed back from its gate en route to Orlando, Fla., when the pilots discovered a problem. The aircraft returned to the terminal and unloaded before the fire.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver fire: United airplane\u2019s engine catches fire at airport gate", "title": "Denver fire: United airplane\u2019s engine catches fire at airport gate", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/26/denver-fire-united-airplanes-engine-catches-fire-at-airport-gate/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T10:58:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-26T10:58:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Denver International Airport"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd340b\"", "article_summary": "A mechanical issue sparked a fire on a United Airlines jet Saturday morning at a Denver International Airport gate, fire and airline officials said.\nPylar said the fire was in an engine, but the airline says it was not one of the aircraft\u2019s wing-mounted motors.\n\u201cWhen they did, it evidently started a fire.\u201dThe plane was parked at the airport\u2019s B Concourse when the blaze was sparked.\nAirport officials said further inquiries on the incident should be directed to United.\n\u201cThey were attempting to start it,\u201d Pylar said of the mechanics."}
