He died of a pulmonary embolism in April, still uninsured. A letter of acceptance into Medi-Cal came to his home in June, according to the complaint.\n\nBy law, the state\u2019s Department of Health Care Services must make some kind of decision in 45 days after the application has been filed. The lawsuit aims to press the state to follow that regulation.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have a system that discriminates like this ... people are going without care,\u201d said Katie Murphy, an attorney with the Pacoima-based Neighborhood Legal Services, of Los Angeles County, one of the organizations that filed the lawsuit on behalf of Medi-Cal applicants.\n\nEarlier this year, Covered California and DHCS announced that 1.9 million people had enrolled for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid. The number was celebrated as a victorious example of how well Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, had been able to reach so many of the state\u2019s uninsured. It also showed that under the Affordable Care Act, millions of people would be able to have some kind of health care coverage.\n\nBut in May, DHCS reported that 900,000 of those applications had not been processed.\n\nThe cause of the backlog was the result of a surge in enrollment as well as technology problems and communication gaps between the state and county welfare systems.\n\nSome of the issues have so far been remedied, said DHCS spokesman Anthony Cava.\n\n\u201cWe have reduced the total number by more than 250,000 since early July,\u201d Cava said in an e-mail response. \u201cWe will continue our joint work with the counties to process these cases, and we expect more progress in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCava said those who need medical help should go seek care, regardless if they are covered.\n\n\u201cIf they are approved for coverage, Medi-Cal will cover the costs of care that they received while their application was pending,\u201d Cava said.\n\nWhile Murphy acknowledges that the state has worked to reduce the backlog, she said there were many ways the department could have worked faster and better. For example, if there is information missing on an application, but otherwise it appears that the person is eligible, then coverage should be provided in the interim.\n\nShe said the technology and resources need to improve before more people enroll. Although residents can apply for Medi-Cal year around, a surge of new applications will likely come when Covered California\u2019s open enrollment begins in November, Murphy said.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people with good intentions have been working on this,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not acceptable when people need care. These are life and death cases.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Challenging what was trumpeted as a key victory for Obamacare, California residents whose Medi-Cal applications have been stuck in limbo for months have filed a lawsuit against the state, saying", "title": "Medi-Cal Obamacare applicants sue over monthslong delays", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/health/20140918/medi-cal-obamacare-applicants-sue-over-monthslong-delays", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Medi-Cal Obamacare applicants sue over monthslong delays"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "Challenging what was trumpeted as a key victory for Obamacare, California residents whose Medi-Cal applications have been stuck in limbo for months have filed a lawsuit against the state, saying", "title": "Medi-Cal Obamacare applicants sue over monthslong delays", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/health/20140918/medi-cal-obamacare-applicants-sue-over-monthslong-delays", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailynews.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailynews.png?052016"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Medi-Cal,Obamacare, Access to health care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Medi-Cal,Obamacare, Access to health care"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca466\"", "article_summary": "It also showed that under the Affordable Care Act, millions of people would be able to have some kind of health care coverage.\nEarlier this year, Covered California and DHCS announced that 1.9 million people had enrolled for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid.\nThe number was celebrated as a victorious example of how well Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, had been able to reach so many of the state\u2019s uninsured.\nBy law, the state\u2019s Department of Health Care Services must make some kind of decision in 45 days after the application has been filed.\nA letter of acceptance into Medi-Cal came to his home in June, according to the complaint."}
