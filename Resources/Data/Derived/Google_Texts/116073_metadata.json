However, U.S. District Judge Raymond A. Jackson in Norfolk, Va., ruled in favor of the NAACP.\n\nRadiance appealed with the help of an attorney affiliated with the Alliance Defending Freedom, and the appellate panel overturned Judge Jackson\u2019s ruling, saying the NAACP did \u201cnot have actionable claims for trademark infringement.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important not to lose perspective,\u201d Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote for the appellate court in its May 19 ruling.\n\nThe First Amendment protects all kinds of speech, including parody, satire and criticism, the ruling said.
