Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court on Wednesday resurrected a woman's pregnancy discrimination claim against UPS, sending the case back to a lower court.

The ruling is a victory for Peggy Young, a former driver for the company who claimed the package company violated her rights under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) and now will have a chance to prove her case in court.

In the majority opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, five Justices concluded that Young can "create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a significant burden exists by providing evidence that the employer accommodates a large percentage of nonpregnant workers while failing to accommodate a large percentage of pregnant workers." Justice Samuel Alito separately concurred in the 6-3 judgment.

"Although today's ruling is narrow, it's an important victory for pregnant employees like Young," said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at American University and a CNN analyst. "The lower court had made it exceedingly difficult for such plaintiffs to show that their employer had unlawfully refused to make accommodations for them because of their pregnancy, but Justice Breyer's opinion should make it easier at least to present such claims to a juryâ€”if not to prevail on them outright."

When she became pregnant in 2006, Peggy Young's doctor told her not to lift anything heavier than 20 pounds for the first 20 weeks of her pregnancy. But Young's supervisors at UPS denied her request for light duty. She was told that UPS only provided accommodations to three categories of workers: those who had been injured on the job, those who lost their Department of Transportation certification and those who have a disability as defined by the Americans with Disability Act.
