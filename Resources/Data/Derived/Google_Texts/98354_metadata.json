The CalOptima board of directors also is the board for the foundation.\n\nNew foundation activities would include:\n\nAiding developing programs or proposals that \u201caddress unmet community needs\u201d and \u201cincreasing provider capacity.\u201d One example, according to the documents, would be providing recuperative care for homeless CalOptima members when they are discharged from a hospital\n\n\u201cSupporting community programs, such as community health promotion and Medi-Cal outreach and enrollment events.\u201d That would include activities that promote health.\n\nApplying for federal and private foundation grants and \u201cpartnering with community groups on solutions to healthcare gaps.\u201d\n\nBoth the CalOptima Foundation and CalOptima\u2019s existing community relations are directed by Michael Ruane, a longtime county manager and current CalOptima chief of strategy and public affairs.\n\nThe CalOptima Foundation was created in 2010 to obtain a federal grant that allowed it to help train local doctors to use electronic technology in preparation for the Affordable Care Act. That work will continue under the proposed foundation expansion.\n\nJudy Nadler, consultant to the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University, said that because of the foundation\u2019s new size and potential local impact, its goals should be clearly spelled out for the public, and existing nonprofits need to publicly weigh in \u201cbefore they [the CalOptima board] make a decision of this nature.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are the goals?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to know that [and] discuss it in a public session.\u201d\n\nPlease contact Tracy Wood directly at twood@voiceofoc.org and follow her on Twitter: twitter.com/tracyVOC.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://voiceofoc.org/2014/03/caloptima-board-considers-expanding-its-foundation/", "description": "Directors are \u00a0scheduled to vote to transfer $3 million of CalOptima\u2019s reserve in a major policy shift that will expand the foundation\u2019s influence.", "original-source": "http://voiceofoc.org/2014/03/caloptima-board-considers-expanding-its-foundation/", "og": {"site_name": "Voice of OC", "description": "Directors are \u00a0scheduled to vote to transfer $3 million of CalOptima\u2019s reserve in a major policy shift that will expand the foundation\u2019s influence.", "title": "CalOptima Board Considers Expanding Its Foundation", "url": "http://voiceofoc.org/2014/03/caloptima-board-considers-expanding-its-foundation/", "image": "http://voiceofoc.org/files/2014/12/Voice-of-OC-logo-FB1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@VoiceofOC", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://voiceofoc.org/2014/03/caloptima-board-considers-expanding-its-foundation/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "health news, Healthy Communities, top_news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe31\"", "article_summary": "The CalOptima board of directors also is the board for the foundation.\nAccording to documents attached to the agenda, some community work would move to the foundation from the direct control of CalOptima.\nApplying for federal and private foundation grants and \u201cpartnering with community groups on solutions to healthcare gaps.\u201dBoth the CalOptima Foundation and CalOptima\u2019s existing community relations are directed by Michael Ruane, a longtime county manager and current CalOptima chief of strategy and public affairs.\nThe CalOptima Foundation was created in 2010 to obtain a federal grant that allowed it to help train local doctors to use electronic technology in preparation for the Affordable Care Act.\nFunctioning as the county's managed health care plan for the poor and elderly, the $1.5-billion agency serves nearly half a million people."}
