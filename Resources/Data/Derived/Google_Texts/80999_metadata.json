The search giant\u2019s stock soared 16 percent on Friday after beating earnings per share estimates by 4 percent thanks to widening profit margins \u2014 an area of concern for investors recently \u2014 as well as a rise in paid ad clicks. Optimism is also building for results from Apple (AAPL) after the close on Tuesday.\n\nBut beneath the surface, the situation is more vulnerable than it seems: By one measure, the Nasdaq is getting ahead of itself in a way not seen since just days before the dot-com bubble burst.\n\nRelated: Boomers, It's Time to Cash Out of This Bubble\u200b\n\nGreece is \"fixed\" for now, so let's talk about the fundamentals. Earnings expectations overall remain challenging. According to FactSet data, the S&P 500's blended earnings growth rate for the second quarter improved but remains at -3.7 percent vs. -4.4 percent last week and the 4.5 percent decline expected at the end of the quarter.\n\nApple, because of its huge market capitalization and weighting in the major averages, will obviously be the center of attention this week. The company is expected to report earnings of $1.80 per share compared to $1.28 last year. It's also expected to be the largest contributor to earnings growth for the Information Technology sector for the second quarter.\n\nWithout that lift from the team in Cupertino, overall earnings for the sector would decline 6 percent over last year, according to FactSet data. The performance is driven largely by the success of the last two iPhone refreshes \u2014 raising the stakes for the \"iPhone 6S\" lineup later this year.\n\nAn uptick in consumer price inflation on Friday has also increased the odds the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for the first time since 2006 come September. This is likely to impact the stock market by raising the cash discount rate and slowing the flow of debt-funded corporate buyback programs, a major source of buying support for stocks in recent years.\n\nOn Monday, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said there was more than a 50 percent chance of a September rate hike. He added that he is worried investors have been \"reaching for yield\" in this low rate environment \u2014 scrambling for higher returns by making questionable investment decisions.\n\nTechnically, breadth remains a point of concern. The chart above shows how the percentage of S&P 500 stocks in uptrends remains depressed and well off the highs seen as recently as April \u2014 56 percent now vs. 75 percent then \u2014 while stock prices remain largely unaffected. This is a sign of narrow buying interest. And it's a sign of underlying vulnerability.\n\nJason Goepfert at SentimenTrader notes that only a handful of stocks pushed the Nasdaq to its new highs; there were more declining issues than advancing ones on Friday, which is admittedly pretty odd.\n\nOn the Nasdaq 100, this was only the second time that the index was up 1 percent or more to a new 52-week high amid net declining issues. The other day was March 23, 2000, just days after the dot-com bubble peaked.\n\nRelated: Investors\u2019 Cash Holdings Highest Since Lehman\n\nNo wonder then that according to the latest BofA Merrill Lynch Global Fund Manager Survey, cash levels jumped to 5.5 percent, the highest since December 2008 and prior to that, 2001. The investment pros are battening down the hatches.\n\nAnthony Mirhaydari is founder of the Edge and Edge Pro investment advisory newsletters.
