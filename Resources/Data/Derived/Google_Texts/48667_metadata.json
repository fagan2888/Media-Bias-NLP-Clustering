Americans traveling for treatment there for good care at cheaper rates made the out-post so successful it\u2019s been upgraded and expanded to a become a full-size, full-service hospital. No one\u2019s more surprised than Holy Name CEO Michael Maron. NJTV News Anchor Mary Alice Williams recently asked him what caused the shift from medical tourists seeking treatment not approved by the FDA to tourists seeking treatment they could get at home.\n\nWilliams: Thank you for being here.\n\nMaron: Thank you for having me.\n\nWilliams: You know when medical tourism started it was people seeking treatments for things not approved yet by the FDA in America. Now you can get cardiatric, bariatric surgery, whatever over there. What\u2019s propelled that?\n\nMaron: So part of it is the need in Haiti for us. There\u2019s domestic demand that is just off the charts. We\u2019ve been fortunate that we have over 1,000 U.S. volunteers who come down. So if you look at the environment, very inexpensive labor \u2014 inexpensive operating environment if you will. We have U.S. volunteers, some of the best.\n\nWilliams: When you say volunteers are you talking about people serving residencies or are you talking about internships?\n\nMaron: No, no. These are fully licensed, trained physicians, many of them in the twilight of their carrier who\u2019ve decided to give back. They come down and they say, \u201cWe want to give up our time,\u201d and they give us seven days and we\u2019ll bring our own team of nurses, technicians and other physicians and we will help train your Haitian physicians but we\u2019ll also treat the population that\u2019s there. So the care is actually very, very good. What\u2019s happened now is word\u2019s spread and Haitians have called back to their families and said, \u201cYou know you could probably come here and get as good or better\u201d because some of these guys come from all over \u2014 from Florida, Washington D.C., St. Louis, New York metropolitan area, New England, Washington State. So we get some of the best and brightest from across the country and they\u2019re available and the Haitians figured that out and said come on home.\n\nWilliams: And what does this do? How has is changed Holy Name Hospital here?\n\nMaron: Well for us here it\u2019s been amazing. When we got in, it was really just to help stabilize and build a bridge to help train us. We got so involved that we realized we couldn\u2019t extract out. What I didn\u2019t anticipate for our staff \u2014 who are all voluntary, no one in Holy Name is obligated to go to Haiti \u2014 but so many have volunteered they are a hundred times better at what they do here as a result of it. Which is not something we had anticipate, but I now see it. It\u2019s palpable. We witness it every day. This morning I had a meaning with a bunch of our staff.\n\nWilliams: What do you see in the future in terms of medical tourism? Do you see it expanding?\n\nMaron: I do.\n\nWilliams: And other hospitals expanding it as well?\n\nMaron: Yeah, well there are not a lot of hospitals in Haiti. But in other areas, yes I can see that happening.\n\nWilliams: And what is propelling people to seek care overseas?\n\nMaron: Part of it is cost. So there\u2019s a cost driver, there is an innovation driver that other countries do not have. So the ability to sort of pushing the cutting edge of clinical trials and new techniques.\n\nWilliams: So you\u2019re even talking about our doctors going overseas to practice and to try new things?\n\nMaron: Sure, yeah there\u2019s some incredible education that can occur both futuristic but also a return to simplicity. We\u2019ve gotten very technical and very complicated and what a lot of the U.S. volunteers who\u2019ve come to Haiti remark about is that it is a reminder of how you can practice very good, effective medicine without all the imaging, without all the high tech when you\u2019re forced to engage and innovate knowing that you have little resources. In many respects, it\u2019s better medicine.\n\nWilliams: I\u2019m going to go back to tourism. How is it going to affect the insurance companies \u2014 to the extent more and more people seek treatment elsewhere \u2014 how do you think that\u2019s going to affect the insurance companies who are controlling all of health care here?\n\nMaron: Well, it depends. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll ever grow to be such a large segment of the business that it\u2019s going to have an effect on the local insurance companies. Today everybody goes overseas paying out of pocket. But as insurance changes in the U.S. and individual consumers have to pay more out of pocket, they\u2019re going to start shopping and looking for alternatives. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see high deductibles, high copay plans emerging \u2014 and they\u2019re everywhere now becoming more the norm \u2014 people are going to start to ask questions and shop. They\u2019re no longer just going to say, \u201cWell my insurance company\u2019s going to pay for it. I\u2019m just going to go to wherever the local facility is the best.\u201d\n\nWilliams: And then that effect of that would be?\n\nMaron: Big shifts of business both ways if you think about it.\n\nWilliams: Competition will make for better\u2026\n\nMaron: Competition, out migration\u2026 We talk about out migration \u2014 New Jersey to New York, New Jersey to Philadelphia. We\u2019ve never talked about out migration from New Jersey to some other country.\n\nWilliams: But we\u2019re talking about it now.\n\nMaron: Could be a real possibility.\n\nWilliams: Do you think that will make health care \u2014 in the aggregate \u2014 better in the United States?\n\n\n\nMaron: I think it will. To me, as long as it\u2019s done above board. I\u2019m a big advocate for transparency and competitiveness. When that occurs and you measure on the right metrics \u2014 meaning quality and overall cost \u2014 health care gets better. There\u2019s no doubt about it. Physicians, the real innovators in health care, think about how they were educated. They were always competitive in school, right? They want to advance. They\u2019re very proud of their accomplishments are so they\u2019re overachievers. A competitive environment can be very, very healthy when it\u2019s orchestrated the right way. If it\u2019s done wrong, it can be very detrimental.\n\nWilliams: OK, thank you very much for being with us.\n\nMaron: Thank you for having me.\n\nFollow @MaryAliceNJT", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "pubdate": 20160415, "og": {"site_name": "NJTV News", "description": "Holy Name Medical Center has a satellite clinic in Haiti that has become popular with locals and even those in the U.S. seeking cheaper treatment options.
