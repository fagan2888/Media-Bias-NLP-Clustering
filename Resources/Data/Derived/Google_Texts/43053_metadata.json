The storm also caused heavy wind and downed trees in parts of Van Zandt County, Finfrock said.\n\nSome high water rescues have been reported in Terrell where people were trapped in their cars at intersections, he said.\n\nA tornado watch for Dallas County that was set to expire at 6 p.m. has been cancelled, but a flood warning for Dallas County was issued until Tuesday at 9:53 a.m.\n\nThe bad storms are out of Dallas for the night, but there is a chance of thunderstorms and severe weather for Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIf there is severe weather, it likely won\u2019t cover as large of an area as Monday\u2019s storm, but anything that does develop will likely become severe with strong winds and the possibility of large hail, Finfrock said.\n\nIsolated thunderstorms and the possibility of severe weather are also in the forecast for the next two to three days.\n\nUpdate at 4 p.m. by Claire Cardona: A flash flood warning has been issued for Dallas County until 6 p.m.\n\nOncor is reporting a little more than 13,000 customers without power in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Storms are still blowing through the area so that number can rise or fall, said spokesman Justin Ozuna.\n\nThe Trinity River in Dallas was cresting at 38.33 feet at 4 p.m.\n\nA pickup pulling a small trailer for lawn equipment got stuck in the water in the 5800 block of CF Hawn Freeway and Lake June Road. Two people who were in the truck made it out without injuries, Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans said.\n\nThe truck is still in the water.\n\nDallas Fire-Rescue crews also went to the 100 block of Cooke Drive to investigate a 911 caller\u2019s account about \u201cat least three individuals\u201d floating in the water near the Bass Pro Shop at Lake Ray Hubbard.\n\nNo one was found for the incident, but crews did come across a stranded sailboat, which they helped to shore, Evans said.\n\nUpdate at 3:35 p.m.: The storms have passed through Fort Worth, and are making their way through Dallas and Collin counties heading east. For now most of what we\u2019ve seen have been just average springtime thunderstorms \u2014 heavy rain, some lightning and thunder with a few strong gusts of wind. And temperatures falling into the 60s. On May 25.\n\nUpdate at 3:24 p.m.: So far these relatively quick-moving storms haven\u2019t produced large hail or tornadoes \u2014 just gusty winds and heavy rain. So \u2026\n\nUpdate at 3:19 p.m.: Dallas\u2019 severe thunderstorm warning has been extended until 4:15 p.m., and Collin County is also under one until then. Flash flooding is also a concern, again, as some of these storms are dropping rain at a rate of two inches per hour.\n\nUpdate at 3:07 p.m.: From the FAA, there\u2019s a ground stop at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport while these storms pass through.\n\n\u201cAll inbound flights being held at their origin until Monday at 04:00PM CDT due to thunderstorms,\u201d per the alert. Also: Expect \u201cdeparture delays of 1 hours 1 minutes to 1 hours 15 minutes (and increasing) due to thunderstorms.\u201d\n\nUpdate at 2:56 p.m.: Dallas County, which is getting rain from the south ahead of the storms approaching from the west, is under a severe thunderstorm warning until 4 p.m. Tarrant County\u2019s has also been extended to 4.\n\nUpdate at 2:16 p.m.: Parker and Tarrant counties under severe thunderstorm warning until 3 p.m., Denton\u2019s under a severe thunderstorm warning until 3:15 p.m., and Dallas is sure to follow \u2014 \u201clikely within the hour,\u201d says Lamont Bain of the National Weather Service\u2019s Fort Worth office.\n\n\u201cRight now, damaging straight-line winds are the main threat,\u201d he says, with sustained gusts clocked at 60-70 mph. But, he cautions, \u201cthere could be a brief spin-up tornado\u201d embedded in the squall line expected to hit Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport just before 3 p.m. on the storms\u2019 way into Dallas.\n\nMeanwhile, the city of Dallas just sent out this update concerning the Trinity River and other flooding concerns:\n\nThe radar as of 2:16 p.m. For a more up to date version click here.\n\nAt this time, there are no significant issues. The Trinity River crested last night at 8:47 pm at 40.18 feet at the Commerce Street gauge. The river is currently in moderate flooding stage and gradually receding at about 0.12 of a foot every 30 minutes. We are currently pumping with 5 levee pumps. There are four \u201cflooded roadway\u201d active signs in NW Dallas and two in SE Dallas. Our Streets department crews are monitoring high water areas. We expect a few supercell thunderstorms to develop out ahead of a squall line of thunderstorms. The supercell thunderstorms will primarily be capable of tornadoes and very large hail (greater than golf ball size). The squall line of storms will produce mainly damaging winds and heavy rainfall. Since the system responsible for the storms tracks right over North Central Texas, all 46 counties effectively have equal chances of seeing heavy rainfall and/or severe weather today. Levees, floodway, and pumps are fine at this time. We are monitoring and operating pumps as needed. System is functioning as intended.\n\nUpdate at 11:10 a.m.: It\u2019s time to batten down the hatches \u2026again.\n\nMuch of North Texas, including Dallas and Fort Worth, is under a tornado watch until 6 p.m. because of the severe storms heading this way from west. The storms, marching east at 35-40 mph and forming a pretty strong, solid squall line, are due in Dallas-Fort Worth around 2-3 p.m.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately that potential for tornadoes does exist,\u201d says Ted Ryan at the National Weather Service in Fort Worth. \u201cAnd pretty much everything else,\u201d including heavy rain, large hail and strong, damaging winds.\n\nThe storms, which triggered severe thunderstorm warnings in Stephens and Young counties, are packing 70 mph winds.\n\n\u201cUsually when we talk about damaging winds we say it won\u2019t affect everyone, but with this squall line heading in, it looks like it will affect a pretty wide area. It\u2019ll be a good bet a lot of people will see strong winds this afternoon.\u201d\n\nOne day after two tornadoes touched down in Dallas County, there\u2019s yet another decent-sized shot at severe weather \u2014 \u201ca little bit of everything,\u201d in the words of meteorologist Matt Bishop at the Fort Worth office of the National Weather Service.\n\nMeaning: \u201cmore heavy rain, which will only aggravate flooding conditions; more hail; more damaging winds \u2014 not everywhere, but it\u2019s a good possibility \u2014 and even a few tornadoes.\u201d The Storm Prediction Center\u2019s so confident in our chances of big, bad weather this Memorial Day that just before 8 this morning it increased our chances to \u201cmoderate\u201d \u2014 or 4 on the out-of-5 scale where \u201chigh\u201d sits at No. 5. For days we\u2019d been at \u201cslight\u201d to \u201cenhanced\u201d risk for severe storms.\n\n\u201cBut that usually changes as confidence grows\u201d that the storms will become severe, says Bishop. \u201cThis morning they\u2019ll pulled the trigger on moderate risk.\u201d\n\nThe reason: an upper-level disturbance moving now around Midland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just going to keep on moving in this direction and should arrive here during peak heating hours, which should be enough to generate some severe weather,\u201d says Bishop. \u201cWe should start seeing it around 2, but we\u2019ll know better when it gets closer.\u201d Some timelines have the storms arriving earlier, around noon; others, closer to evening. Long story short: Be alert, if you can muster the energy after weeks of flooding rains and four dozen tornadoes battering North Texas.\n\n\u201cEvery day we\u2019re getting slammed with this stuff,\u201d says Bishop. \u201cWe grew accustomed to having quiet, drought conditions for a few years. We\u2019re not used to this.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not going anywhere, with more severe weather in your back-to-work Tuesday forecast.\n\n\u201cIt looks that way,\u201d Bishop says. \u201cWednesday might be kind of quiet, but then we get rain Thursday through the weekend.\u201d\n\nHit it, Stevie.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA1L2Rmdy1hZ2Fpbi1mYWNpbmctbW9kZXJhdGUtY2hhbmNlLW9mLWZsb29kaW5nLXJhaW5zLWRhbWFnaW5nLXdpbmRzLXRvcm5hZG9lcy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Update at 8:45 p.m.: The flood warning issued for Dallas County has been canceled.
