They are liberal editorial journalists,\" said Cruz.\n\nFox News host Chris Wallace cornered Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz on Sunday about his claim that President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform law had cost jobs.\n\n\u201cThe fact checkers say you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Wallace told Cruz. \u201cSince that law went into effect, the unemployment rate fell from 9.9% to 5% as 13 million new jobs were created, and 16.3 million people who were previously uninsured now have coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of problems with Obamacare, but more people have jobs and health insurance,\u201d the Fox News host added.\n\nCruz, however, argued that the fact checkers were wrong because they were biased.\n\n\u201cFact checkers are not fair and impartial,\u201d he stated \u201cThey are liberal editorial journalists. And they have made it their mission to defend Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d Wallace interrupted. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly no question that more people have jobs and more people health insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, there is question,\u201d Cruz insisted \u201cThe fact is from 2008 to today, we\u2019ve seen economic growth of 1.2% on average.\u201d\n\nThe Texas senator became irritated as the Fox News host pressed for an answer to his original question.\n\n\u201cChris, don\u2019t interrupt me,\u201d Cruz snapped.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s changing the subject,\u201d Wallace noted. \u201cThirteen million new jobs have been created.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that is a historically slow rate of job creation,\u201d Cruz replied.\n\nAccording to the GOP hopeful, small business owners told him that they were \u201cpraying\u201d to be saved from Obamacare.\n\nWallace pointed out that the Cruz plan to replace the Affordable Care Act \u2014 by selling insurance across state lines, expanding health savings accounts and making insurance portable between jobs \u2014 \u201cwould have almost no effect in giving people who are not uninsured health coverage.\u201d\n\nCruz said that the conclusions of organizations like that Congressional Budget Office about his plan were \u201csimply not accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis law is a disaster,\u201d Cruz opined. \u201cPeople are hurting.\u201d\n\nWatch the video below from Fox News, broadcast Jan. 31, 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Fact checkers are not fair and impartial.
