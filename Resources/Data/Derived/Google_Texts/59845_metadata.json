The president told the crowd of supporters there that he\u2019s starting to feel like Mark Wahlberg\u2019s character in Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Departed.\n\nObama described the scene in question for anyone who hadn\u2019t seen the Oscar-winning film, in which Wahlberg\u2019s character is on a stakeout with other police officers who end up losing track of the suspect they\u2019re following. When another man asked Wahlberg who he is, he responds, an Obama\u2019s paraphrase, \u201cI\u2019m the guy going my job, you must be the other guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I feel like saying to these guys,\u201d Obama said of Republicans in Congress, \u201cI\u2019m the guy doing my job, you must be the other guy.\u201d Instead of waging a \u201cpolitical stunt\u201d like suing him for taking executive action, Obama had a different challenge for his opposition: \u201cDo something!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is lonely with me just doing stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d love it if the Republicans did stuff too.\u201d\n\nWatch video below, via C-SPAN:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, here\u2019s the NSFW version of the scene Obama referenced from The Departed:\n\n[Photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "During a speech in Austin, Texas on Thursday, President Barack Obama found a new way to express his frustration with Republicans: movie quotes.
