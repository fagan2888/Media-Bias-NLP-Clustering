This could allow physicians to quickly run the tests themselves.\n\n\"The method we have developed allows us to detect targets at levels that are unprecedented,\" John Brennan, director of McMaster University's Biointerfaces Institute, said in a press release. \"The test has the best sensitivity ever reported for a detection system of this kind -- it is as much as 10,000 times more sensitive than other detection systems.\"\n\nThe device is made of DNA that can be switched on by specifically selected molecules, such as those of a virus or bacteria. This causes a reaction indicating the presence of the molecules that is easily detected. This molecular interaction will make it easier to detect superbugs such as hepatitis C, C. difficile and MRSA at lower levels than other tests.\n\nResearchers at McMaster previously developed paper-based tests that can detect infections and contamination. They plan to adapt the new DNA-based testing device to the paper format in order to make the testing method easier to use nearly anywhere, such as physician's offices.\n\n\"This will be the foundation for us to create future diagnostic tests,\" said Yingfu Li, a professor at McMaster University. \"This invention will allow us to detect anything we might be interested in, bacterial contamination or perhaps a protein molecule that is a cancer marker. Our method can sensitively detect all of them, and it can do so in a relatively short period of time.\"\n\nThe study is published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers developed a DNA-based way of testing for pathogens and superbugs thousands of times more powerful than others because it works on a molecular level.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Researchers developed a DNA-based way of testing for pathogens and superbugs thousands of times more powerful than others because it works on a molecular level.", "title": "Unique test can detect slightest traces of superbugs", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/07/06/Unique-test-can-detect-slightest-traces-of-superbugs/1921436203216/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/1921436203216/2015/1/14362068368534/v2.1/Unique-test-can-detect-slightest-traces-of-superbugs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1921436203216/2015/i/14362068368534/v2.1/Unique-test-can-detect-slightest-traces-of-superbugs.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Researchers developed a DNA-based way of testing for pathogens and superbugs thousands of times more powerful than others because it works on a molecular level.", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Unique test can detect slightest traces of superbugs"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health, John Brennan", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health, John Brennan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd1c5\"", "article_summary": "\"This will be the foundation for us to create future diagnostic tests,\" said Yingfu Li, a professor at McMaster University.\nOur method can sensitively detect all of them, and it can do so in a relatively short period of time.\"\nThey plan to adapt the new DNA-based testing device to the paper format in order to make the testing method easier to use nearly anywhere, such as physician's offices.\nResearchers at McMaster previously developed paper-based tests that can detect infections and contamination.\nThis molecular interaction will make it easier to detect superbugs such as hepatitis C, C. difficile and MRSA at lower levels than other tests."}
