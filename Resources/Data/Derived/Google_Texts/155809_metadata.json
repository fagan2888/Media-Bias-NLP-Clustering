They both spoke on national health care policy issues and what Intermountain is doing to meet those challenges now and for the future.Poulsen talked about the challenges the implementation of the Affordable Care Act has brought. \u201cEven former Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who was one of the most influential people regarding health care reform said \u2018The changes (from the Affordable Care Act) will be wrenching to all participants,\u2019\u201d said Poulsen. \u201cBut the healthcare model Intermountain has created is the blueprint the world is looking to model their healthcare after. \u201c Poulsen cited a study that found while the national average healthcare cost per 45 year old is close to six-thousand dollars, the cost for the very same in Utah is only three-thousand. Poulsen says, \u201cI feel that is due to Intermountain\u2019s use of best practices (a method or technique that has consistently shown results superior to those achieved with other means) and the value of providing the highest-quality service at the lowest-appropriate cost.\u201dDr. Sorenson focused on how Intermountain\u2019s use of best practice helps to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients and for the communities that Intermountain serves, at the lowest affordable cost. Sorenson said \u201cLeading change in a complex healthcare environment, at its core, means we put the interests of others first. Virtually everyone I know that goes into healthcare, does so in large measure because they want to be a help in someone else\u2019s life, they want to serve. Intermountain put a high emphasis on patient-centered care, and we can continue to achieve great things by doing so.\u201dDr. Sorenson was recently recognized for the fourth consecutive year as one of Modern Healthcare's \"50 Most Influential Physician Executives in Healthcare\" at number 12 in the 2014 rankings. He was also named as one of the 100 Most Influential People in Healthcare by Becker\u2019s Hospital Review.
