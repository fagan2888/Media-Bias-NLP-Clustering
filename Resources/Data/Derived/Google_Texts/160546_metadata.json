PT1M21S http://www.smh.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-3d1qh 620 349 August 3, 2014\n\nEdwina Bone is daring to dream of Olympic gold after her role in the Hockeyroos\u2019 penalty shootout win over England on Saturday night.\n\nThe former University of Canberra captain described winning Commonwealth Games gold as her greatest moment and expects the squad to stick tight over the next two years in the lead-up to Rio.\n\nAustralia fell behind to England midway through the second half on a sodden evening at the Glasgow National Hockey Centre before Jodie Kenny\u2019s leveller with 11 seconds left on the clock.\n\nAnna Flanagan takes on the England defence in the final.

Flanagan\u2019s initial shot from the last-ditch penalty corner was saved before Kenny\u2019s pressure-laden follow up sizzled into the back of the net.\n\nThe win was a rare triumph at these Games over England, who finished with the most gold medals for the first time since 1986.\n\n\u201cI looked at the [medal] ladder and I was like they don\u2019t need another gold medal, give us one,\u201d Bone said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played England a lot in the last 18 months and we have had it over them. They defended really well they picked off passes that we were trying to get through that we\u2019d normally get through.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get as many penalty corners as we did in the other games.\n\n\u201cThey just played really well, hats off to them. That\u2019s what finals hockey\u2019s all about.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Commonwealth Games News, ACT Sport", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Edwina Bone is daring to dream of Olympic gold after her role in the Hockeyroos&#8217; gold medal win.", "title": "Hockeyroo Edwina Bone daring to dream of Olympic gold after Glasgow win", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-glasgow-2014/commonwealth-games-news/hockeyroo-edwina-bone-daring-to-dream-of-olympic-gold-after-glasgow-win-20140803-zzwzw.html", "image": "http://images.smh.com.au/2014/08/03/5648193/1407056739740.jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "cXenseParse": {"ffx-assettype": "article", "ffx-assetid": 60462284}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msvalidate.01": "3A0F8B0A5D246EFE15A2F9F975D1E623", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Edwina Bone is daring to dream of Olympic gold after her role in the Hockeyroos\u2019 gold medal win."}, "article_summary": "PT1M21S http://www.smh.com.au/action/externalEmbeddedPlayer?id=d-3d1qh 620 349 August 3, 2014Edwina Bone is daring to dream of Olympic gold after her role in the Hockeyroos\u2019 penalty shootout win over England on Saturday night.\n\u201cI looked at the [medal] ladder and I was like they don\u2019t need another gold medal, give us one,\u201d Bone said.\nEdwina Bone and Ashleigh Nelson celebrate winning the gold medal.\nThe former University of Canberra captain described winning Commonwealth Games gold as her greatest moment and expects the squad to stick tight over the next two years in the lead-up to Rio.\nPhoto: Getty ImagesThe Hockeyroos then prevailed 3-1 in an absorbing penalty shootout ensuring Bone and fellow Canberran Anna Flanagan left Glasgow with a gold medal draped around their neck."}
