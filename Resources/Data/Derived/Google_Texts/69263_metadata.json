Despite already being exempted from the requirement to provide employees with contraception coverage, the Little Sisters have argued that signing the form for the exemption \u2014 which would trigger a third-party administrator to provide and pay for the coverage the Little Sisters object to \u2014 is itself a violation of their religious beliefs.\n\nThe second case was brought by Hobby Lobby, a private, for-profit craft company with stores throughout the country. In this case, lawyers for Hobby Lobby have argued \u2014 with some success, so far \u2014 that the contraception mandate violates the religious liberty of the corporation itself. The implications of the Hobby Lobby challenge \u2014 for women\u2019s equal access to healthcare and for corporate personhood \u2014 would be major.\n\nIf you think these cases only matter to women who use birth control, you\u2019re wrong. Here\u2019s why:\n\nContraception is basic healthcare, period.\n\nContraception isn\u2019t a medical luxury, a \u201cspecial\u201d benefit or any of the other things that opponents of the insurance mandate have called it. Women take birth control for all kinds of reasons \u2014 none of which are or should be anyone else\u2019s business.\n\nSo much of the rhetoric against guaranteed coverage of contraception is predicated on the assumption that preventing unwanted pregnancy is somehow unrelated to women\u2019s overall health, but this is just wrong. Controlling one\u2019s own fertility is a perfectly legitimate medical reason \u2014 and the main reason \u2014 that women use birth control. In the United States, 42 percent of women use oral contraceptives exclusively to prevent pregnancy, but a majority of women \u2014 58 percent \u2014 use birth control for this reason and for reasons other than pregnancy prevention. Fourteen percent of women use the pill for purely non-contraceptive reasons, including preventing migraines, regulating periods and treating endometriosis.\n\nNone of these reasons are more valid or medically significant than the others, but they all make access to contraception important. The courts should recognize that allowing employers to decide what is \u201cnecessary\u201d healthcare versus what is not is an incredibly dangerous precedent.\n\nThere is no such thing as \u201cfree\u201d contraception.\n\nAs Jodi Jacobson at RH Reality Check recently noted, much of the coverage of the Affordable Care Act (even progressive coverage, including some of what I\u2019ve written at Salon) says that it guarantees women \u201cno-cost\u201d or \u201cfree\u201d birth control, but this is actually misleading.\n\nIf you have insurance, it\u2019s probably because you pay for it. Overwhelmingly, women either pay for it out of their own pockets on the private insurance market or through their compensation package, which is akin to wages. Any health services rendered through your insurance plan are paid for, in some form, by you. So birth control and other contraception are not \u201cfree\u201d under the new mandate, a point Jacobson makes quite clearly:\n\nNo one can walk into any pharmacy today and get the pill without a prescription, which in any case first entails a visit to a doctor\u2019s office. No one without insurance can walk into a doctor\u2019s office and get an IUD for for free, nor any kind of contraception, unless they pay out of pocket or meet the means test for and are covered by Medicaid, an increasingly difficult enterprise in itself but the subject of a different article. Ten percent of women in the United States who work full time are currently uninsured and without coverage, they do not have access to \u201cfree\u201d birth control. Nor do other women without insurance, or those whose plans are, for logistical reasons or because they were grand-fathered, not yet compliant with the ACA on preventive care. None of these women have \u201cfree\u201d birth control now, and they will not later even if they get insurance. Why? Because if you have insurance, you pay for it, either by virtue of your labor or out of your own pocket, or, depending on the situation, both. And under the ACA, it is now mandated that your insurance plan cover certain benefits without a co-pay. This does not make them \u201cfree.\u201d It means that you are paying for that service as part of your premium. You earned it, you paid for it, it is yours. If you pay for it, you deserve to get it.\n\nAllowing employers to refuse coverage means that women will have to pay extra for healthcare they are already paying for. You don\u2019t have to be a legal expert to realize that is unfair.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ensuring women access to contraception is wildly important, but it's not all that's at stake in pending court cases", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ensuring women access to contraception is wildly important, but it's not all that's at stake in pending court cases", "title": "5 reasons the contraception mandate matters for everyone", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/06/5_reasons_the_contraception_mandate_matters_for_everyone/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/11/birth-control-pills.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ensuring women access to contraception is wildly important, but it's not all that's at stake in pending court cases", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/11/birth-control-pills.jpg", "title": "5 reasons the contraception mandate matters for everyone", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "5 reasons the contraception mandate matters for everyone", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aca, Affordable Care Act, Birth Control, Church and State, contraception mandate, Obamacare, Religion, Religious Freedom, Republicans, Women's Rights", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcee96\"", "article_summary": "Topics: aca, Affordable Care Act, Birth Control, Church and State, contraception mandate, Obamacare, Religion, Religious Freedom, Republicans, Women's Rights, Life News, NewsTwo major legal challenges currently threaten the contraception mandate of the Affordable Care Act, and both are really important.\nIn this case, lawyers for Hobby Lobby have argued \u2014 with some success, so far \u2014 that the contraception mandate violates the religious liberty of the corporation itself.\nContraception isn\u2019t a medical luxury, a \u201cspecial\u201d benefit or any of the other things that opponents of the insurance mandate have called it.\nWomen take birth control for all kinds of reasons \u2014 none of which are or should be anyone else\u2019s business.\nThere is no such thing as \u201cfree\u201d contraception."}
