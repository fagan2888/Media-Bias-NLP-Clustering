Davis never changed your sheets, cooked you lunch or straightened up your messy closet.\n\nYet social media is full of tributes today for the actress best known as Alice the housekeeper on The Brady Bunch.\n\nThe sense of loss is palpable. People identified with her stoic but lovable character. It doesn\u2019t matter that Alice existed only on the small screen, or that the show left the air roughly 40 years ago. She came into our living rooms then \u2026 and now in reruns \u2026 and she made an impression.\n\nIs it any wonder that pop culture matters in 2014 when smart phones and tablets allow us to bring shows like The Brady Bunch everywhere we go?\n\nConsider last year\u2019s passing of James Avery, best known for playing the kindly uncle on The Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Social media lit up with viewers who felt Avery\u2019s loss even if he never was a part of their family.\n\nNow, remember the impact of celebrities singing the praises of Sen. Barack Obama during the runup to the 2008 presidential election, or the fact that sites like Funny or Die dedicated itself to protecting the president\u2019s flailing health care reform.\n\nDid it matter that Obama\u2019s resume was wafer-thin in 2008, or that ObamaCare was so riddled with problems the president has spent as much time delaying its impact as trumpeting its alleged benefits?\n\nPopular culture can bring a smile to our face through a charming sitcom, an avuncular character or a story line that makes our real-world problems fade for 23-plus minutes. The same cultural wave can influence hearts and minds if the entertainment industry rallies behind a particular cause.\n\nJust ask Jesse Tyler Ferguson, who says his show Modern Family helped America accept the notion of same sex marriage. And consider how frequently today\u2019s TV shows disparage conservatives by linking them with villainous characters. What impact might that have on the body politic?\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with mourning the loss of a character actor who brought joy into our lives. It simply should be noted just how much a single character or entertainment meme can influence us.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mourning for 'Brady Bunch' Star Ann B.
