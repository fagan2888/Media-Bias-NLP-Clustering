The most famous example is the way civil rights leaders used disobedience (and armed self defense) to help end the Jim Crow laws imposed by state governments.\n\nIt\u2019s also encouraging that gun owners have no intention of obeying bad gun control laws, with evidence of massive resistance to bad laws in states such as Connecticut, Colorado, and New York.\n\nAnd motorists ended the use of speed (i.e., revenue) cameras in Arizona in part by simply ignoring the fines that arrived in the mail (folks in Houston needed to use a referendum).\n\nThese are encouraging stories, but we also need to be realistic about the fact that most Americans meekly comply with lots of other bad laws and regulations imposed by greedy and overbearing governments.\n\nThe regulatory burden in the United States has become absurd, for instance, but it\u2019s difficult to envision a successful strategy to resist various bureaucratic impositions.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe great scholar Charles Murray has a column in the Wall Street Journal about fighting back against the regulatory state.\n\nHe begins with a very depressing assessment.\n\nAmerica is no longer the land of the free. We are still free in the sense that Norwegians, Germans and Italians are free. But that\u2019s not what Americans used to mean by freedom. It was our boast that in America, unlike in any other country, you could live your life as you saw fit as long as you accorded the same liberty to everyone else. \u2026with FDR\u2019s New Deal and the rise of the modern regulatory state, our founding principle was subordinated to other priorities and agendas. What made America unique first blurred, then faded, and today is almost gone.\n\n\n\nIn some sense, we\u2019ve been buried by red tape.\n\n\u2026consider just the federal government. The number of federal crimes you could commit as of 2007 (the last year they were tallied) was about 4,450, a 50% increase since just 1980. A comparative handful of those crimes are \u201cmalum in se\u201d\u2014bad in themselves. The rest are \u201cmalum prohibitum\u201d\u2014crimes because the government disapproves.\n\nThis is something that we\u2019ve already discussed. I made the distinction just the other day between real crimes (which involve an infringement on someone else\u2019s life, liberty, and property) and innocent behavior that is criminalized by government.\n\nBut it\u2019s even worse when folks have no idea how to be compliant.\n\nEveryone knows how to obey the laws against robbery. No individual can know how to \u201cobey\u201d laws such as Sarbanes-Oxley (810 pages), the Affordable Care Act (1,024 pages) or Dodd-Frank (2,300 pages). We submit to them. The laws passed by Congress are just the beginning. In 2013, the Code of Federal Regulations numbered over 175,000 pages.\n\n\n\nEspecially when constitutional protections are weakened.\n\nIt gets worse. If a regulatory agency comes after you, forget about juries, proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, disinterested judges and other rights that are part of due process in ordinary courts. The \u201cadministrative courts\u201d through which the regulatory agencies impose their will are run by the regulatory agencies themselves, much as if the police department could make up its own laws and then employ its own prosecutors, judges and courts of appeals.\n\nAnd the insult to injury is that many regulations make no sense.\n\nRegulations that waste our time and money are bad enough. Worse are the regulations that prevent us from doing our jobs as well as we could\u2014regulations that impede architects from designing the most functional and beautiful buildings that would fit their clients\u2019 needs, impede physicians from exercising their best judgment about their patients\u2019 treatment, or impede businesses from identifying the best candidates for job openings. \u2026Public-school teachers typically labor under regulatory regimes that prescribe not only the curriculum but minutely spell out how that curriculum must be taught\u2014an infantilization of teachers that drives many of the best ones from the public schools.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution?\n\nYou can fight these bureaucrats in their kangaroo courts, or maybe even force the case into a real court.\n\nBut Murray acknowledges that this is prohibitively expensive.\n\n\u2026when the targets of the regulatory state say they\u2019ve had enough, that they will fight it in court, the bureaucrats can\u2014and do\u2014say to them, \u201cTry that, and we\u2019ll ruin you.\u201d\n\nCharles has an idea of how to overcome this problem.\n\n\u2026the regulatory state is the Wizard of Oz: fearsome when its booming voice is directed against any single target but, when the curtain is pulled aside, revealed as impotent to enforce its thousands of rules against widespread refusal to comply. And so my modest proposal: Let\u2019s withhold that compliance through systematic civil disobedience. Not for all regulations, but for the pointless, stupid and tyrannical ones.\n\nMore specifically.\n\n\u2026it should be OK to ignore the EPA when it uses a nonsensical definition of \u201cwetlands\u201d to forbid you from building a home on a two-thirds-acre lot sandwiched between other houses and a paved road\u2026there\u2019s no reason for the government to second-guess employer and employee choices on issues involving working hours and conditions that don\u2019t rise to meaningful definitions of \u201cexploitation\u201d or \u201cunsafe.\u201d \u2026Let\u2019s just ignore them and go on about our lives as if they didn\u2019t exist.\n\nThat\u2019s sounds nice, but how does one overcome the risk of discriminatory and abusive prosecution and persecution by miffed bureaucrats?\n\nHere\u2019s the clever proposal Charles has for the private sector.\n\nLet\u2019s treat government as an insurable hazard, like tornadoes. \u2026let\u2019s buy insurance that reimburses us for any fine that the government levies and that automatically triggers a proactive, tenacious legal defense against the government\u2019s allegation even if\u2014and this is crucial\u2014we are technically guilty. Why litigate an allegation even if we are technically guilty? To create a disincentive for overzealous regulators. The goal is to empower citizens to say, \u201cIf you come after me, it\u2019s going to cost your office a lot of time and trouble, and probably some bad publicity.\u201d\n\n\n\nPeople presumably will be willing to fight if they have some free talent coming to their defense.\n\nI propose\u2026a legal foundation functioning much as the Legal Services Corporation does for the poor, except that its money will come from private donors, not the government. It would be an altruistic endeavor, operating exclusively on behalf of the homeowner or small business being harassed by the regulators. The foundation would pick up all the legal costs of the defense and pay the fines when possible.\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom line.\n\nThe measures I propose won\u2019t get the regulations off the books, nor will they improve the content of those regulations, but they will push the regulatory agencies, kicking and screaming, toward a \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d regime. They will be forced to let the American people play.\n\nAnd if you want to see this strategy in the form of a picto-graph, this is a very helpful depiction.\n\nI mentioned yesterday that I was in Poland for a Liberty Fund conference.\n\nAfter the conference, I had the opportunity to visit the Solidarity Museum, which commemorated the 1980 protests against communism at the Gdansk shipyards.\n\nHere\u2019s an image that warmed my heart. One of the rooms had a tape of Poland\u2019s communist dictator announcing martial law. Here\u2019s a screen capture of him saying there\u2019s no turning back from socialism.\n\nGee, that didn\u2019t turn out to be the case.\n\nIndeed, Poland is now a reasonably good example of how markets enable higher living standards.\n\nAnd that speech should be a permanent memorial about the evil of communism.
