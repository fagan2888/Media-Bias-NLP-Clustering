One of their ongoing projects is \u201cVoxplaining\u201d to Americans how Obamacare is, in fact, working quite well \u2014 regardless of what the vulgar right-wing liars might be asserting. Though I spent a great deal of time refuting one such effort last fall, I once again feel compelled to rise on behalf of Obamacare opponents to puncture Vox\u2019s latest pseudo-factual exercise in ideological self-congratulation. Last week, blogger Sarah Kliff, who has done some good work as a journalist on the healthcare beat, published a piece crowing that the so-called \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act has been vindicated by outcomes. Setting aside problems with her approach \u2014 selecting uniquely hyperbolic predictions to \u201crebut,\u201d and treating shorthand critiques as granular objections, for instance \u2014 let\u2019s examine the eight \u201cmyths\u201d she purports to refute:\n\n(1) Nobody wants to buy Obamacare: Of course it\u2019s true that many people wanted to, and did, obtain coverage through Obamacare \u2014 both on the exchanges, and through the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion. Millions of those who enrolled through the exchanges, however, had little choice in the matter. They\u2019ve been stripped of their existing, preferred coverage, and forced to purchase new, compliant plans. This represents a glaring violation of one of the law\u2019s central pledges. The fact that these people were legally required to buy Obamacare is not evidence that they wanted to do so. Kliff also mentions that it\u2019s \u201cmuch worse\u201d to be uninsured than insured. Empirical data shows that this statement is (tragically and counter-intuitively) not necessarily true, at least for those who are now covered under Medicaid.\n\n(2) Obamacare will \u201cnever\u201d meet its enrollment goal: The administration\u2019s shortfall in sign-ups has, indeed, been a familiar refrain among the law\u2019s critics. Perhaps that\u2019s because Obamacare sign-ups did fail to meet the White House\u2019s public projections during the 2013-2014 open enrollment period. The administration significantly inflated their stats in several ways to hide this fact. (Kliff acknowledges one recently-revealed form of malfeasance, moving the goalposts to celebrate how Obamacare \u201cdidn\u2019t completely miss\u201d its targets). The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office also downgraded enrollment projections for 2015 by millions of people. At the behest of Democrats on the Hill, the White House has now added an unscheduled, on-the-fly enrollment period later this year. Finally on this point, I repeat: It\u2019s very strange to boast that millions have signed up for insurance due to a law that legally requires them to sign up for insurance. That\u2019s not a meaningful achievement.\n\n(3) Obamacare will wreak havoc on the economy: Silly conservatives have insisted all along that Obamacare would hurt the economy and kill jobs, Kliff sighs, eagerly noting that job and economic growth has continued on an upward trajectory since the law passed. She generously concedes that the healthcare law does not deserve \u201call\u201d of the credit for this great news, but look at all these charts showing job growth since 2010! The US economy\u2019s historically slow, plodding recovery finally has most arrows pointed in the right direction, but a strong case can be made that these positive trends have emerged despite Obamacare\u2019s impact \u2014 and have likely been slowed down by it. CBO\u2019s 2014 fiscal assessment determined that Obamacare will reduce overall full-time American employment by the equivalent of 2.5 million workers over the next ten years. The report stated that employment gains will \u201cbe smaller than [they] would have in the absence of the ACA.\u201d CBO cited the law\u2019s work disincentives as a \u201ccentral factor in slowing economic growth,\u201d both now and in the future. Many fewer full-time workers, slower growth. Does that count as \u201chavoc\u201d?\n\n(4) The website will never work: In an especially unfortunate bit of timing for Kliff (and the president, who\u2019d just assured his nodding supporters at Vox that Healthcare.gov was working \u201cflawlessly\u201c), this particular football spike was quickly exposed as\u2026premature. Within days of publication, a spate of errors and glitches introduced fresh headaches for hundreds of thousands of Obamacare consumers. It was also revealed that bugs in the system are blocking newborn infants from being added to coverage. Furthermore, H&R block estimates that a majority of Obamacare subsidy recipients will be forced to pay back at least a portion of their taxpayer-funded assistance, due to miscalculations and incorrect income estimates. These problems are widespread because Healthcare.gov\u2019s so-called \u201cback end,\u201d which is supposed to streamline the process of reconciling this type of data, remains incomplete. It was supposed to be fully built by late 2013. It\u2019s now 2015. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that taxpayers have spent more than $2 billion on the federal website. For $2 billion, that site really should be working \u201cflawlessly.\u201d It\u2019s not. Still.\n\n(5) Only people who had coverage are signing up: Yes, some of Obamacare\u2019s enrollees were previously uninsured. But millions of them were not. There\u2019s a debate over how many \u201cnew enrollees\u201d touted by the Obama administration already had coverage prior to their plans getting canceled, but every estimate shows it\u2019s a substantial percentage. The White House cannot reasonably celebrate these millions of coerced enrollments as \u201cnew.\u201d Conservative healthcare wonk Avik Roy runs the numbers and concludes that only about five million of the administration\u2019s claimed 11.4 million exchange enrollees previously lacked coverage. Kliff offers an array of estimates on this front, the best of which (by far) comes from\u2026the Obama administration, which she\u2019s already admitted has been caught cooking the books.\n\n(6) Obamacare would cause a net-loss of insurance: This \u201cprediction\u201d only applied to very limited period of time, in the midst of the infamous 2013-2014 enrollment meltdown. Most people conceded that eventually, more people would have insurance than would not. Once again, the law mandates that people get insurance. Interestingly, two comprehensive government studies released late last year suggested that the ranks of the uninsured had either slightly increased (US Census Bureau), or had been reduced by far fewer people than Obamacare supporters have claimed (Centers for Disease Control). Even on this slam dunk outcome, Obamacare is not an unvarnished success.\n\n(7) Premiums will skyrocket: Americans were promised, over and over again, that Obamacare would substantially reduce everyone\u2019s rates. Instead, premiums have continued to tick up overall, and they have skyrocketed by double digits for many consumers. Kliff and others are reduced to arguing that aggregate premium increases are less steep \u201cthan expected,\u201d as if that proves critics wrong. Unless the average family is paying less in premiums ($2,500 less per year, in fact), critics are not wrong. Various healthcare experts also argue that premium hikes have been superficially and temporarily held down by certain price control provisions within the law that will expire in the next few years. They anticipate an additional bout of major rate increases when those gimmicks sunset. Another way Obamacare plans have staved off major premium increases is by severely limiting provider and coverage networks, resulting in major frustration and \u201caccess shock\u201d for many \u201cbeneficiaries.\u201d Finally, proponents\u2019 fixation on premiums also distracts from the biggest cost-related challenge facing Obamacare consumers: Unaffordable out of-pocket-costs, including huge deductibles and expensive co-pays. Among the tens of millions of Americans who remain uninsured under Obamacare, the number one reason they cite for declining to participate in the new law is lack of affordability.\n\n(8) Obamacare just can\u2019t work: This is a terribly subjective statement to \u201cfact check,\u201d but it\u2019s basically correct nonetheless. Far more Americans say the law has directly harmed their families than helped, Obamacare\u2019s popularity remains significantly underwater, and the law is objectively not working the way it was marketed. Not even close. Kliff cites a study showing that \u201cmost\u201d Obamacare consumers have been able to get doctors appointments within two weeks. Even if we take this study at face value, a large minority of consumers also say they\u2019ve had to wait weeks or months \u2014 or haven\u2019t been able to see a doctor at all. This study is presented as evidence of the law \u201cworking.\u201d Kliff also concedes that there isn\u2019t a lot of data available yet on Obamacare\u2019s promise of cost-curve bending, though many supporters have misleadingly credited the law with the recent slowdown in the rate of over spending increases (which is accurately attributed to the sluggish economy).\n\nSome Obamacare opponents overstated and exaggerated predictions about the law\u2019s deleterious effects. Critics were virtually unanimous, however, in stating that Democrats\u2019 hugely expensive and disruptive policy experiment would fail to deliver on many of the core pledges upon which it was sold to the public. They were unambiguously correct on the whole, and the American people know it. Far from being \u201cdebunked,\u201d the anti-Obamacare case has been exonerated by actual outcomes, in remarkable detail and breadth \u2014 and no tendentious Voxplanation can change that reality.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Spin.", "title": "No, Vox, Obamacare hasn\u2019t \u2018proved its critics wrong\u2019", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/02/26/no-vox-obamacare-hasnt-proved-its-critics-wrong/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-26T14:21:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-25T23:39:17+00:00"}, "keywords": "ObamaCare, vox,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "One of their ongoing projects is \u201cVoxplaining\u201d to Americans how Obamacare is, in fact, working quite well \u2014 regardless of what the vulgar right-wing liars might be asserting.\n(2) Obamacare will \u201cnever\u201d meet its enrollment goal: The administration\u2019s shortfall in sign-ups has, indeed, been a familiar refrain among the law\u2019s critics.\nThe fact that these people were legally required to buy Obamacare is not evidence that they wanted to do so.\nUnless the average family is paying less in premiums ($2,500 less per year, in fact), critics are not wrong.\nPerhaps that\u2019s because Obamacare sign-ups did fail to meet the White House\u2019s public projections during the 2013-2014 open enrollment period."}
