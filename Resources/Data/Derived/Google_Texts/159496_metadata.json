That penalty is equal to $95 or 1 percent of a person's taxable income, whichever is higher.\n\nTo help people comply with the mandate, the ACA established government-run health exchanges to sell private insurance to individuals and families. Those exchanges saw a flood of more than 3 million people in just the last month of open enrollment, bringing total sign-ups to more than 7 million.\n\nRead MoreStart-ups are making a killing off Obamacare\n\n\n\nChristina LaMontagne, a health cost analyst for the price-comparison site NerdWallet, said that penalty \"wasn't really that significant\" in getting people to enroll, from what her company heard in interviews it did with people exploring their insurance options.\n\nInstead, LaMontagne said, \"We heard people saying they really valued health insurance ... we heard again, and again and again that people wanted health insurance, and they were sick of finding these short-term solutions.\"\n\n\"People have expressed a desire to be insured and have over time pieced together temporary solutions as their employment or health situations have changed,\" she said. \"One common thread were heard from parents is that often some family members were insured while others were not. ... For these families, [the Affordable Care Act] offered an opportunity to get everyone covered in some way and to fill in gaps across the family unit.\"\n\nAnd many of those people qualified for government subsidies to help them offset the cost of the insurance plans. Those subsidies are available to people who earn less than 400 percent of the federal poverty limit\u2014about $46,000 for a single person and about $94,000 for a family of four.\n\n\n\nRead MoreMedicaid enrollment up 3 million under Obamacare\n\n\n\n\"Those subsidies just changed the game,\" LaMontagne said, crediting them with being a significant motivating factor for enrollees. About 80 percent of enrollees on the exchanges qualified for the subsidies.\n\nAnother skeptic of the power of the mandate, Bankrate.com analyst Doug Whiteman, who noted that his company's surveys of the uninsured \"found a very surprising lack of knowledge\" about the ACA \"just a couple of weeks\" before the sign-up deadline. Only 48 percent, for example, could correctly identify the deadline, Whiteman said.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Obamacare's controversial fine on people who fail to have health insurance this year may have not been a big motivator for millions of people to sign up.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Obamacare's controversial fine on people who fail to have health insurance this year may have not been a big motivator for millions of people to sign up.", "title": "Here's what really fueled the Obamacare surge", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/04/08/enalty-may-not-have-sparked-sign-up-surge.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/04/08/101565364-481753327.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare's controversial fine on people who fail to have health insurance this year may have not been a big motivator for millions of people to sign up.", "title": "Obamacare penalty may not have sparked sign-up surge", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/04/08/enalty-may-not-have-sparked-sign-up-surge.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/04/08/101565364-481753327.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Obamacare, Health Care, US: News, Politics, Obamacare, Bankrate Inc, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-04-08T11:44:43-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Obamacare", "modified_time": "2014-04-08T13:41:57-0400", "tag": "Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 101561579, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health insurance, individual mandate, fine, futile"}, "article_summary": "To help people comply with the mandate, the ACA established government-run health exchanges to sell private insurance to individuals and families.\nInstead, LaMontagne said, \"We heard people saying they really valued health insurance ... we heard again, and again and again that people wanted health insurance, and they were sick of finding these short-term solutions.\"\nThat penalty is equal to $95 or 1 percent of a person's taxable income, whichever is higher.\nUnder Obamacare, most people must have some kind of health-care coverage\u2014through their employer, the individual insurance market, Medicare or Medicaid\u2014by March 31 of this year or pay a tax penalty next year.\nAnd many of those people qualified for government subsidies to help them offset the cost of the insurance plans."}
