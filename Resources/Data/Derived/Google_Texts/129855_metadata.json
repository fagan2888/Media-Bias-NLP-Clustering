The Hospital Engagement Networks, formed by the federal Partnership for Patients initiative and made possible by the Affordable Care Act, is making significant strides towards better patient care at an affordable cost.\n\nAs one of 26 hospital organizations and associations that comprise the national Hospital Engagement Network, Dignity Health focused on providing better quality care across 10 patient safety areas that were identified through the partnership. Dignity Health is committed to every initiative across all its hospitals, including seven new measures just launched in January this year. The efforts implemented across Dignity Health hospitals reveal that the organization has reached its goal of improving patient care in six out of the 10 patient safety areas before the three year target date.\n\n\u201cThe goals of the Partnership for Patients align with Dignity Health\u2019s mission and longstanding commitment to making hospital care safer, more reliable, and less costly,\u201d said Barbara Pelletreau, senior vice president of patient safety, Dignity Health. \u201cThrough enhanced collaboration and coordination among our staff, we\u2019re seeing great results, and even more importantly, we\u2019ve improved how care is delivered at Dignity Health hospitals.\u201d\n\nBest Practices Add Up to Big Results\n\nDignity Health is narrowing in on its overall goal of reducing the rate of hospital-acquired infections by 40 percent and readmissions by 20 percent before 2015. To achieve this goal, the hospital system introduced specific evidence-based practices and bedside intervention activities, called MeasureVention, to evaluate full adoption of safe preventive practices and assure coordination of care at the bedside with clinicians, including physicians.\n\nBest practices deployed system wide ensured procedures were conducted as routinely and as safely as possible. For example, nurses and doctors only inserted catheters if absolutely necessary, changing the previously presumed notion that catheters were innocuous, which led to a large decrease in urinary tract infections. Insulin treatments were given to patients at specific times in relation to their meals lowering the overall hypoglycemic rate.\n\nDignity Health also enlisted the help of MeasureVentionists, nurses that have been through specialized training programs to examine current patients\u2019 conditions, and measure their risk for infection and readmission. Through their work, MeasureVentionists were able to assess and document whether protocols were being followed ultimately, raising the bar of patient care across the system.\n\nBelow are the results for all 10 patient safety areas from Jan. 2012 through Dec. 2013:\n\nHypoglycemic Rate: 65 percent reduction achieved by standardizing insulin protocols and enhancing coordination.\n\nachieved by standardizing insulin protocols and enhancing coordination.
