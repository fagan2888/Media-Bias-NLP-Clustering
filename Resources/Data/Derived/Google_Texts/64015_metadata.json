Some time passes, and then we all try again. There will be another doomed-to-fail attempt this year, according to Democrats and senior Republicans. As usual, Republicans have preemptively assigned blame for its failure to President Obama.\n\nBefore his 2012 reelection, Republicans frequently argued that Barack Obama wanted immigration reform to fail, so that he could make Republicans look bad to Hispanics and use that to win reelection. After his reelection, when Obama decided to make another push for reform, under the assumption that a chastened GOP would play along, it eventually became clear that no immigration bill that provided an opportunity for citizenship for currently undocumented residents could pass the House. The end, for Immigration Reform 2013. On to Immigration Reform 2014.\n\nHere\u2019s the latest: Speaker of the House John Boehner will \u201cunveil a set of Republican principles for immigration reform before Obama\u2019s Jan. 28 State of the Union address.\u201d He and Majority Leader Eric Cantor told fellow Republicans that reform would be a priority this year. Barack Obama has been described by Senator Chuck Schumer as \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d that the House would pass something this year. It\u2019s all finally happening!\n\nOr what is happening, at least, is that John Boehner has decided that Republicans once again need to appear open to the idea of creating a more humane immigration process.\n\nThis Politico piece basically explains Boehner\u2019s strategy. His list of principles will include \u201cbeefed-up border security and interior enforcement,\u201d and \u201cearned legal status,\u201d presumably instead of \u201ccitizenship,\u201d for undocumented immigrants. Plus, it won\u2019t be one big bill, because Republicans have spent the entire Obama administration decrying long bills, for their length.\n\nThe draft principles will also include a promise that immigration reform will be done on a step-by-step basis and will foreclose the possibility of entering into conference negotiations using the Senate\u2019s comprehensive package \u2014 pledges that could soothe some Republicans.\n\nMm-hmm. Soothe some Republicans, and also allow those Republicans to vote for more border security without voting to legalize anyone. That\u2019s always been the point of passing reform \u201cstep-by-step.\u201d Not that anyone even actually expects this limited, piecemeal proposal to pass!\n\nThe secret talks are taking place even as leaders doubt that such efforts will be fruitful, in part because of opposition from conservatives who sank the prospects for reform last year. That dynamic hasn\u2019t changed. But Republicans think stating their position is important and could help chart a path forward for reform in 2015 after the midterm elections.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the paragraph that should end all 2014 \u201ccould this be the year comprehensive immigration reform passes\u201d pieces. (We finished early this year, everyone!) Republicans think \u201cstating their position\u201d \u2014 a position they will state by claiming it is their position, not by voting to make their ostensible position law \u2014 is important, for branding reasons, but the House is still full of conservatives, so there\u2019s still no hope for reform.\n\nThat\u2019s why this year, just like last year and the year before, immigration reform won\u2019t happen: There aren\u2019t enough votes for it in the House, because conservatives oppose it and Boehner won\u2019t try to pass it with mostly Democratic votes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The usual process where Democrats want immigration reform, proposals are made and then they die, has a new twist", "title": "GOP\u2019s new immigration spin: If we can\u2019t pass reform, it\u2019s Obamacare\u2019s fault", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The usual process where Democrats want immigration reform, proposals are made and then they die, has a new twist", "title": "GOP\u2019s new immigration spin: If we can\u2019t pass reform, it\u2019s Obamacare\u2019s fault", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/republicans_if_we_cant_pass_immigration_reform_its_obamacares_fault/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/rubio_cantor.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The usual process where Democrats want immigration reform, proposals are made and then they die, has a new twist", "title": "GOP\u2019s new immigration spin: If we can\u2019t pass reform, it\u2019s Obamacare\u2019s fault", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/rubio_cantor.jpg", "creator": "@pareene", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alex Pareene", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Editor's Picks, Eric Cantor, GOP, Immigration, Immigration Policy, Immigration Reform, John Boehner, Marco Rubio, Obamacare, Republican Party, The Right, U.S. House of Representatives", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd068c\"", "article_summary": "And that\u2019s the paragraph that should end all 2014 \u201ccould this be the year comprehensive immigration reform passes\u201d pieces.\nThe end, for Immigration Reform 2013.\nOn to Immigration Reform 2014.\nBefore his 2012 reelection, Republicans frequently argued that Barack Obama wanted immigration reform to fail, so that he could make Republicans look bad to Hispanics and use that to win reelection.\nThat\u2019s why this year, just like last year and the year before, immigration reform won\u2019t happen: There aren\u2019t enough votes for it in the House, because conservatives oppose it and Boehner won\u2019t try to pass it with mostly Democratic votes."}
