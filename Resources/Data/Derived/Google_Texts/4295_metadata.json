The recommendation was decided in consultation with Kevin Page, chairman of the Board of Regents.\n\nAn acting president serves for a short period of time and is not eligible to apply for the permanent position. The appointment of an acting president requires at least seven votes from the 13-member board.\n\nEleven board members voted in favor of Snyder\u2019s appointment. Regents Ron Knecht and Allison Stephens abstained from the vote.\n\nOfficials plan to begin a national search for the permanent position immediately. Contracts with firms to conduct national searches can cost anywhere from $60,000 to $80,000, officials have said in the past.\n\nOthers on the short list for the temporary position included Carol Harter, 72, executive director of UNLV\u2019s Black Mountain Institute, and John White, 46, executive vice president and provost at UNLV.\n\nNeal Smatresk\u2019s resignation as president at UNLV is effective Feb. 2. He will become the president at the University of North Texas.\n\nMany of those who spoke during public comment Friday expressed support for Snyder, but at least one was not happy with the recommendation.\n\n\u201cI feel sick to my stomach about the recommendation,\u201d said Beverly Rogers, who had lobbied for Harter. Rogers is the wife of Jim Rogers, a former chancellor for the Nevada System of Higher Education.\n\nSnyder said she obviously had someone else in mind, but he will now work to heal that relationship.\n\nSnyder will continue to lead the UNLV stadium project in partnership with the hotel-casino industry, which he was a part of as president for Boyd Gaming from 1997 to 2005.\n\nHe also was president and CEO of the Fremont Street Experience.\n\nSnyder was involved in the development of The Smith Center for Performing Arts and served as dean of UNLV\u2019s William Harrah College of Hotel Administration\n\nKlaich, in a memo he sent to the regents on Thursday, said he did not recommend White for the acting president\u2019s position because that would make him ineligible to apply for the permanent position.\n\nStephens felt the process was too rushed to make a decision. The Regents received Klaich\u2019s memo with information gathered during the meetings that were held to receive input on what kind of leader would be best for UNLV on Thursday, less than 24 hours before the vote.\n\nShe also questioned whether White had been asked if he was interested in the interim position since he\u2019s already leading the university as the officer in charge and knows the ins-and-outs of running the institution. An interim president could eventually hold the permanent position.\n\nBut a vast majority of the campus community and local stakeholders were in favor of a national search. An interim president is appointed if there are no immediate plans to launch a search.\n\nThe university\u2019s leadership has gone from Smatresk to White, and will now go to Snyder, and from him it will go to the permanent president, Stephens said.\n\n\u201cWe are taking the university through changes that are unnecessary,\u201d she said after the meeting. \u201cSnyder is perfectly capable, but (White) is already in that position.\u201d\n\nRegent Cedric Crear agreed with Stephens on the additional transitions.\n\nRegent Robert Blakely said the appointment of the acting president was a difficult decision to make.\n\n\u201cProvost White is a wonderful man,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my opinion, he was Smatresk\u2019s option to replace him. (White) is already our officer in charge.\u201d\n\nBut he added he would vote for Snyder because he was best suited for the acting position.\n\nRegent Michael Wixom endorsed Klaich\u2019s recommendation.\n\n\u201cWe really couldn\u2019t go wrong today,\u201d he said.\n\nUNLV\u2019s Faculty Senate Chairman Paul Werth said he hopes to have a good relationship with Snyder. The senate in the next two weeks will work on nominations for the five faculty members who will be advisory members to the Regents\u2019 President Search Committee, which will be composed of six Regents.\n\nOther constituents such as administrators, classified employees and students also get to serve as advisory members to the committee\n\n\u201cI think we are all enthusiastic about the presidential search,\u201d Werth said. \u201cIf it works out well, it will justify the investment and energy.\u201d\n\nMany regents said if White chose to apply, he would be a strong candidate.\n\nContact reporter Yesenia Amaro at yamaro@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0440.", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/regents-name-snyder-acting-president-unlv", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "YESENIA AMARO LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Regents name Snyder acting president of UNLV", "twitter": {"description": "Don Snyder will take the helm at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas as acting president beginning on Feb. 1.", "title": "Regents name Snyder acting president of UNLV", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/regents-name-snyder-acting-president-unlv", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_STADIUM_005_3.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "description": "Don Snyder will take the helm at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas as acting president beginning on Feb. 1.", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-839751"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=823437", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=823437", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540820524", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Don Snyder will take the helm at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas as acting president beginning on Feb. 1.", "title": "Regents name Snyder acting president of UNLV", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/regents-name-snyder-acting-president-unlv", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_STADIUM_005_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-author": "YESENIA AMARO LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "News,Education,", "parsely-section": "News", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-24T11:42:14-08:00"}, "parsely-tags": "News,Education", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_STADIUM_005_3.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-01-24T19:42:14Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96bd\"", "article_summary": "An acting president serves for a short period of time and is not eligible to apply for the permanent position.\nDon Snyder will take the helm at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas as acting president beginning Feb. 1.\nThe appointment of an acting president requires at least seven votes from the 13-member board.\nThe senate in the next two weeks will work on nominations for the five faculty members who will be advisory members to the Regents\u2019 President Search Committee, which will be composed of six Regents.\nRegent Robert Blakely said the appointment of the acting president was a difficult decision to make."}
