It just meant getting to a point where the site worked well enough. Did they make it?\n\nDavid Auerbach David Auerbach is a writer and software engineer based in New York, and a fellow at New America.\n\n\n\nAmid a lot of horse-race analysis, a New York Times article from Sunday does offer some concrete, heartening details near its end. Monitoring has been set up so that the status of the site is known. They evidently can track logon errors and crashes. When Google engineer Michael Dickerson, who was part of the Obama administration\u2019s \u201ctech surge,\u201d \u201cannounced that the day had ended with no major crashes and no one who could not log in, the engineers erupted in applause,\u201d the Times said. This is all good news. And apparently the administration\u2019s relationship with CGI Federal, who had shamelessly passed the buck at congressional hearings, \u201csoured over the summer.\u201d So if it\u2019s forward progress you\u2019re looking for, we have it. The system can be fixed.\n\nBut how fixed is it right now? We\u2019ll have a better idea once we have the signup and enrollment numbers for December. But the Progress Report published by the administration on Sunday offers a couple of clues. The Progress Report is itself a good sign: While selective in what it presents, the information it offers is meaningful and relevant, and none of it seems blatantly fishy to me. This is a drastic change from anything the administration or the contractors were offering even a month ago, and they should get credit for making these numbers available (assuming they\u2019re true).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSystem uptime appears to be hanging around 95 percent, which equates to the system being down about eight hours per week (\u201c*excluding scheduled maintenance\u201d). That\u2019s not a fantastic number, but it\u2019ll do, compared with the embarrassingly low 42 percent uptime the administration gave for the week ending Nov. 2. The administration evidently no longer sees a reason to sugarcoat performance statistics from October, and indeed, they are appalling. Response times and per-page error rates are considerably better as well. By mid-November, it seems that the site\u2019s scalability problems really had been addressed in some substantive fashion\u2014far from perfectly, but way better than detractors had feared (or hoped).\n\nThat leaves questions of functionality, and here the Progress Report is a lot vaguer. It appears that basic signup and registration functionality is in place, but what about generating proper insurance applications, validating eligibility, and the like? The report says little about what work is ahead of the engineering team, but at least one graph suggests there\u2019s some ways to go:\n\nAside from confirming that it took the administration until early November just to start making significant progress on functionality fixes, the graph also indicates that engineers are still frantically fixing the site. If the site were anywhere near stability, you would expect the number of fixes to start to level off close to the administration\u2019s self-imposed Nov. 30, signaling that they were ramping down crisis mode and making fewer fixes per day. But it doesn\u2019t, indicating that they are still in the hump of this bug-fixing graph:\n\nI have updated my original graph to reflect the new information, though I\u2019m proud to say no changes were needed to the guesses I\u2019d made. The government\u2019s graph reflects my graph quite closely. My graph is the derivative of the government\u2019s graph, so in order to reach the point marked \u201cRelative Stability,\u201d when bug-fixing slows down because the site is comprehensively working correctly, the line of the government\u2019s graph would need to go much flatter. So that puts us somewhere in the middle of the hump of my graph, signaling that stability is still a fair ways away.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Healthcare.gov is no longer a total disaster.", "fb-share": "Healthcare.gov: No Longer a Total Disaster!", "sailthru.author": "David Auerbach", "description": "A month ago I said that the goal of the Obama administration was to get healthcare.gov sufficiently stable so that it would work for \u201ca vast majority o ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "A month ago I said that the goal of the Obama administration was to get healthcare.gov sufficiently stable so that it would work for \u201ca vast majority o ...", "title": "Healthcare.gov: No Longer a Total Disaster!", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2013/12/healthcare_gov_nov_30_deadline_the_tech_surge_is_working.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/technology/technology/2013/12/131202_BIT_KathleenSebelius.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A month ago I said that the goal of the Obama administration was to get healthcare.gov sufficiently stable so that it would work for \u201ca vast majority o ...", "title": "Healthcare.gov: No Longer a Total Disaster!", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2013/12/healthcare_gov_nov_30_deadline_the_tech_surge_is_working.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/technology/technology/2013/12/131202_BIT_KathleenSebelius.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg", "creator": "@AuerbachKeller", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-02T15:32:14Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Healthcare.gov: No Longer a Total Disaster!", "sailthru.headline": "The System Can Be Fixed!", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Healthcare.gov: No Longer a Total Disaster!\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/bitwise/2013/12/healthcare_gov_nov_30_deadline_the_tech_surge_is_working.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/technology/technology/2013/12/131202_BIT_KathleenSebelius.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100131202012\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-02T15:32:14Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Technology\",\n  \"author\": \"David Auerbach\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"obamacare\",\n    \"healthcare.gov\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Healthcare.gov: No Longer a Total Disaster!", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "keywords": "healthcare.gov problems, healthcare.gov november 30 deadline, healthcare.gov tech surge, healthcare.gov google, healthcare.gov errors and crashes, healthcare.gov login issues", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.tags": "healthcare.gov problems, healthcare.gov november 30 deadline, healthcare.gov tech surge, healthcare.gov google, healthcare.gov errors and crashes, healthcare.gov login issues", "sailthru.description": "A month ago I said that the goal of the Obama administration was to get healthcare.gov sufficiently stable so that it would work for \u201ca vast majority o ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/technology/technology/2013/12/131202_BIT_KathleenSebelius.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The government\u2019s graph reflects my graph quite closely.\nBut the Progress Report published by the administration on Sunday offers a couple of clues.\nThat leaves questions of functionality, and here the Progress Report is a lot vaguer.\nThe Progress Report is itself a good sign: While selective in what it presents, the information it offers is meaningful and relevant, and none of it seems blatantly fishy to me.\nDavid Auerbach David Auerbach is a writer and software engineer based in New York, and a fellow at New America."}
