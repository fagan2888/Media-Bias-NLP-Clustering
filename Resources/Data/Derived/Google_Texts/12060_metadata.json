The rule, which was expected in January, will now be out in August.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) was expected to update and modernize its reporting system to better track workplace injuries in a final rule-making in August, but the agency has delayed that rule until September. OSHA was also expected to propose new rules in January to protect steel workers from exposure to beryllium, a brittle, steel-gray metal linked to serious illnesses. That notice of public rule-making is now expected this month.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mine Safety and Health Administration pushed back new rules to better protect metal and nonmetal miners from exposure to silica dust, which can cause an irreversible lung disease known as silicosis. The final rules, originally due out in October, will be finalized in April 2016.\n\nThe Center for Progressive reform said it's still parsing through the report, and there are likely to be more than 16 rules that are delayed.\n\n\u201cA lot of people call this a regulatory agenda, but from my perspective, it\u2019s just a catalogue of new regulatory delays,\u201d said James Goodwin, the center's senior policy analyst.\n\nYear after year, from one unified agenda to another, Goodwin said rules are pushed back by be as much as six, eight or 12 months.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s disappointing because it suggests that agencies aren\u2019t making as much progress on these rules as they should be or could be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real shame is, these rules aren\u2019t being created for no reason. They\u2019re going to deliver benefits for public heath, safety and the environment.\u201d\n\nTake the EPA\u2019s promise to regulate perchlorate in drinking water, for example.\n\nGoodwin said the agency started to draft rules for the harmful chemical, which is used in rocket fuel, during the George W. Bush administration but later dropped the rules.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, Obama committed to doing something about it, and now we\u2019re still sitting here waiting for him to do anything,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the fall, the EPA said it would release its proposed rule by February 2016. That deadline has been pushed to March 2017 with a final rule due out in September 2018.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The White House released the regulatory roadmap Thursday night.", "description": "The White House released the regulatory roadmap Thursday night.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The White House released the regulatory roadmap Thursday night.", "title": "Agencies delay rules in regulatory agenda", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/242937-agencies-delay-rules-in-regulatory-agenda", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/whitehouse_102314getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/242937-agencies-delay-rules-in-regulatory-agenda", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-05-22T11:50-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-22T11:50:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/242937-agencies-delay-rules-in-regulatory-agenda", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The White House released the regulatory roadmap Thursday night.", "card": "summary", "title": "Agencies delay rules in regulatory agenda"}, "dcterms.title": "Agencies delay rules in regulatory agenda"}, "article_summary": "\u201cA lot of people call this a regulatory agenda, but from my perspective, it\u2019s just a catalogue of new regulatory delays,\u201d said James Goodwin, the center's senior policy analyst.\nIt\u2019s been less than 24 hours since the White House released its semiannual regulatory roadmap, and groups are combing through the rule-making agenda for the federal agencies.\nThe final rules, originally due out in October, will be finalized in April 2016.\nThat deadline has been pushed to March 2017 with a final rule due out in September 2018.\nYear after year, from one unified agenda to another, Goodwin said rules are pushed back by be as much as six, eight or 12 months."}
