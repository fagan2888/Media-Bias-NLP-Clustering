The Justice Department had refused to give any information about whether Greenwald and Poitras might be subject to a grand jury investigation. Furthermore, last year Greenwald\u2019s partner, David Miranda, was held at Heathrow airport for nine hours, his electronic devices confiscated, under a U.K. counterterror act. In this age, when journalism is all too often aligned with terrorism, Greenwald and Poitras were understandably concerned. Indeed, Poitras has been questioned for hours on end at U.S. airports in the past over her journalistic work pre-dating the Snowden leaks.\n\nBut, as Greenwald told reporters Friday, he \u201cexpected that they wouldn\u2019t be that incredibly stupid and self-destructive to try and do something that in the eyes of the world would be viewed as incredibly authoritarian. \u2026 That would forever undermine their ability to criticize other governments for imprisoning journalists and for having a constitutional fight over the First Amendment that successive administrations have wanted to avoid.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, the U.S. authorities were not so stupid, and Poitras and Greenwald entered the U.S. safely. That the two journalists feared detention at all remains grimly reflective of what whistle-blower attorney Jesselyn Raddack calls the current \u201cwar on information.\u201d Lest we forget, Barrett Brown and Chelsea Manning sit behind bars; Edward Snowden faces hefty charges under the Espionage Act; AP journalists\u2019 phone logs were surveilled by the DOJ; Fox News correspondent James Rosen was once named by the FBI as a possible \u201cco-conspirator\u201d in a crime for the journalistic act of obtaining leaked information. The NSA revelations, shedding light on a vast and unbounded corporate-government surveillance nexus, have unquestionably been in the public interest. The whistle-blower behind them should not fear persecution, nor should the journalists reporting the story. But where Poitras and Greenwald can point to the First Amendment (or whatever meek vestiges of it that the U.S. cares to recognize), Snowden has no such recourse and no such protection.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The NSA journalists feared persecution on returning to U.S.; their fear is a sad reflection of this time", "title": "Greenwald, Poitras enter U.S. freely, but this is no time to celebrate", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The NSA journalists feared persecution on returning to U.S.; their fear is a sad reflection of this time", "title": "Greenwald, Poitras enter U.S. freely, but this is no time to celebrate", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/11/greenwald_and_poitras_enter_u_s_without_detention/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/polk-awards.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The NSA journalists feared persecution on returning to U.S.; their fear is a sad reflection of this time", "title": "Greenwald, Poitras enter U.S. freely, but this is no time to celebrate", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/polk-awards.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@natashalennard", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Natasha Lennard", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Edward Snowden, espionage act, Glenn Greenwald, Journalism, National security, NSA, Surveillance, Transparency", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2827\"", "article_summary": "The Justice Department had refused to give any information about whether Greenwald and Poitras might be subject to a grand jury investigation.\nIn this age, when journalism is all too often aligned with terrorism, Greenwald and Poitras were understandably concerned.\nBut where Poitras and Greenwald can point to the First Amendment (or whatever meek vestiges of it that the U.S. cares to recognize), Snowden has no such recourse and no such protection.\nBoth journalists feared detention or at the very least questioning on returning to U.S. soil.\nIndeed, Poitras has been questioned for hours on end at U.S. airports in the past over her journalistic work pre-dating the Snowden leaks."}
