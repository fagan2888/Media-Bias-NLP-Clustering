In states that declined to set up their own exchanges, like Florida, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded funding worth sixty-seven million dollars for outreach efforts to help the uninsured enroll through the federal marketplace. Nearly four million people in Florida are uninsured\u2014the third highest figure in the country\u2014and Ray had six weeks to recruit staff from community-service groups in sixty-four counties across the state, and guide new hires through twenty hours of online federal training attached to her grant.\n\n\u201cBut our navigators don\u2019t only have to comply with federal requirements for the training,\u201d Ray said. \u201cWe have state requirements that we have to comply with, too.\u201d Last spring, the Florida legislature, apparently concerned that swindlers would land jobs as health-care experts with access Social Security numbers and tax information, decided that the navigators should undergo fingerprinting and criminal background checks, and barred them from visiting state-run health clinics. Ray preferred not to comment on what the advocacy group Healthcare For America Now calls \u201cnavigator-suppression measures.\u201d She only said, \u201cI\u2019m keeping my head down, the noise out, and focussing on what we are supposed to be doing.\u201d\n\nAfter the government shutdown ended, attention shifted to the blips and seizures bedevilling the federal marketplace\u2019s Web site, healthcare.gov. Thirty-four states, all but seven of them Republican-controlled, chose not to set up their own exchanges, leaving hundreds of millions of dollars in outreach funding on the table, and forcing their residents onto the federally-operated Web site at the center of the current uproar. Twenty-one of those states are also expected to refuse nearly three hundred billion dollars in federal funding to expand Medicaid coverage over the next decade, which would have extended care to more than six million people; a majority of those excluded will likely be African-Americans and single mothers. To compound the effects of their recalcitrance, conservative governors, state legislators, and members of Congress have also passed navigator-suppression measures in thirteen states\u2014Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin\u2014home to seventeen million people without insurance who are eligible for coverage under the A.C.A.\n\nTwo weeks after Ray received her grant, she was notified by the House Energy and Commerce Committee that she would have to participate in a phone interview with the committee\u2019s staff in September; she was also asked to give written answers to half a dozen questions from the committee and provide \u201call documentation and communication related to your Navigator grant.\u201d Similar notifications were sent to navigator offices in eleven of the most underinsured states in which residents will need to use the federal health-care exhange\u2014including Texas, Florida, and Georgia, home to about a quarter of the nation\u2019s uninsured. Representative Henry Waxman, a Democrat from California, protested, in an open letter to the committee\u2019s chairman, Michigan Republican Fred Upton, that the requests appeared \u201cto have been sent solely to divert the resources of small, local community groups, just as they are needed to help with the new health care law.\u201d\n\nOn September 18th, Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, released a report that singled out Florida as the site of \u201cnumerous reports of scam artists posing as navigators and Assisters to take advantage of people\u2019s confusion about ObamaCare.\u201d On October 2nd, Fox News aired footage of volunteers for Get Covered America, a non-profit advocacy campaign, going door-to-door in a Miami suburb to distribute flyers about the new insurance marketplace\u2014but wrongly identified them as federally-funded navigators, giving the impression that these \u201cnavigators\u201d were hawking plans like pushy insurance salesmen. Upton linked to the report on his Web site. Ray, who still spends much of her time getting new navigators licensed while the federal government fixes the Web site\u2019s glitches, was reticent about discussing the maelstrom of controversy. \u201cIt\u2019s been busy,\u201d she said.\n\nAs these tactics jam up early efforts in many states, they also amplify the contrast with successful rollouts in states that have wholeheartedly embraced the new law, like Colorado, Connecticut, New York, Kentucky, and Washington.\n\nElisabeth Benjamin, who leads New York\u2019s largest team of navigators at the Community Service Society, spent much her early career improving health-care capacity in developing countries like India, Tunisia, and postwar Iraq\u2014where, she said, people often told her, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re in our country. You have a lot of problems with health care and poor people in your country.\u201d Back home, she started a health-law unit at the Legal Aid Society to assist low-income New Yorkers with unforgiving medical bills. In 2008, she unveiled an insurance ombudsman program at C.S.S. to help people at every income level understand their options for medical coverage. \u201cIf you need a loaf of bread, it\u2019s a buck,\u201d she said, explaining health care\u2019s central distinction from other forms of assistance. \u201cIf you need a transplant, it\u2019s five hundred thousand dollars.\u201d\n\nAround the same time Benjamin was starting her program, Eliot Spitzer, then the governor of New York, proposed statewide health-care reform similar to the law Massachusetts had passed four years earlier. Vermont\u2019s legislature had expanded coverage, and Arnold Schwarzenegger had made national news by calling for a similar program in California. Benjamin joined an affordable-health-care advocacy campaign, Healthcare for All New York, and testified before the New York State Legislature. \u201cWe just assumed there would be a state-by-state movement to extend coverage,\u201d Benjamin said. But two years later, the Obama Administration, with the help of a Democrat-controlled House and Senate, passed the Affordable Care Act. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, along with the state legislature in Albany, accepted the expansion of Medicaid, and the state established its own online exchange. After the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Obamacare, in June, 2012, Cuomo released a statement that said, \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work together with the Obama administration to ensure accessible, quality care for all New Yorkers.\u201d\n\nThat spirit of co\u00f6peration has been integral to New York\u2019s early success. Elisabeth Benjamin, in New York, and Jodi Ray, in Florida, offer exactly the same services to people who were previously unable to obtain medical coverage: they help determine voucher amounts, parse available options, and submit applications online, over the phone, or through the mail. But because New York set up its own exchange, the state received twenty-seven million dollars to fund its navigators, while Florida has just eight million dollars for outreach. Benjamin, who is herself a trained navigator, conceded that there were glitches on New York\u2019s Web site the first week, but said that most of them have been resolved. In the second week, she helped enroll a woman who had worked as a home-health-care aid for twenty years, earning around twenty-four thousand dollars annually. Home health care \u201chas to be the hardest job in America\u2014so physically taxing and emotionally draining,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t give them health coverage. Are you kidding me? They\u2019re part of the health-care system.\u201d Benjamin helped find a plan for the woman that costs seventy-two dollars a month. \u201cI was crying,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nFor the A.C.A. to succeed in its goal of providing coverage for all citizens at an overall reduction in cost, a critical mass of people\u2014old and young, sick and healthy\u2014will need to participate in the insurance exchanges. As of October 23rd, New York had enrolled thirty-seven thousand people, more than twice the goal set by H.H.S. for the entire month of October. Florida won\u2019t know how many people have enrolled until H.H.S. releases its figures sometime in November. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that a total of seven million people nationwide could enroll in the first year. But Dr. Kavita Patel, a health-care-reform expert at the Brookings Institution, and a former policy advisor in the Obama Administration, told me, \u201cIf by the end of 2014 there are three million people enrolled, that would be a success.\u201d The politicians who are currently bemoaning the looming failure of Obamacare might consider doing more to help navigators like Jodi Ray make it work.\n\nAbove: Affordable Care Act navigators in Miami, Florida.
