A homeschool advocacy organization intervened, and the school was forced to back down and apologize.\n\nIn Kansas, as in several other states, families must register their homes as \u201cprivate schools\u201d to homeschool their children. The family followed the law exactly, naming and registering their school and notifying their son\u2019s elementary school in February that he would be withdrawing.\n\nBut a few months later, in May, the school sent the family a letter notifying them that a social worker would be contacting them about the county truancy program.\n\n\u201cIn August,\u201d the letter read, \u201cour truancy social worker will contact you to discuss the requirements of the truancy diversion program. You child will be expected to respond to her contact in August.\u201d\n\nThe family declined to discuss the case for the sake of their privacy, but their attorney, Scott Woodruff of the Homeschool Legal Defense Association, described the letter as \u201cthreatening.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure it frightened the family,\u201d he said.\n\nWoodruff sent the social worker a letter arguing that the family had taken appropriate measures to register their school and notify the public school, and that the school had no right to refer them to the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nA representative from the school system later called the family to apologize for the baseless referral. As far as Woodruff knows, actual truancy charges were never filed.\n\nWoodruff is one of a number of attorneys for HSLDA, and said that only the more serious truancy cases will come to his desk. He took on this case because of \u201cthe threatening tone of the letter,\u201d and the inappropriate involvement of a social worker and the district attorney.\n\n\u201cAny time an agency refers something to a district attorney, there\u2019s at least a possibility that the district attorney will file criminal charges,\u201d Woodruff said. HSLDA stepped in to ensure that the case never got that far.\n\nWoodruff is currently working on about half a dozen cases of families facing truancy actions.\n\nA call to the Wyandotte County Truancy Program, which sent the letter, was not returned.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "When a Kansas City family pulled their son out of a public elementary school to homeschool him, the local school referred them to the district attorney's office for truancy.
