Rob Portman, R-Ohio.\n\nPortman added that the co-ops are \"failed enterprises\" as more than $1.2 billion in taxpayer funding is likely lost.\n\nSlavitt said that the agency is working with the Department of Justice to recoup as the funding from the failed co-ops.\n\nCommittee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, noted that funds to the federal government get a low priority when a company goes into receivership. Normally funds are doled out to other sources such as investors and then the federal government gets whatever remains.\n\nSlavitt said the co-ops are essentially startups and that it is a challenge to build a new business that has large competitors. The co-ops were created to spur more competition in the Obamacare marketplaces.\n\n\"It doesn't surprise me in the first couple of year that co-ops are going to lose money,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A key Obamacare official said he was confident that more insurance co-ops won't fail this year, but several senators in the latest hearing on the startup failures are less enthused.\nMore than half of the 23 consumer-oriented and operated plans, or co-ops, created under the Affordable Care Act have shut down, with a lack of federal funds a primary reason.
