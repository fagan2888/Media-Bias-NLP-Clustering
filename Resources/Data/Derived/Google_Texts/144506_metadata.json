GOP front-runner Donald Trump held a rally at Radford University and Republican hopeful Ben Carson spoke at Regent University in Virginia Beach. Ohio Gov. John Kasich is holding a noon rally Tuesday in Arlington County.\n\n\u201cI will stand up and fight for you throughout this campaign, no matter who the Republicans nominate,\u201d Clinton told an enthusiastic crowd at GMU in Fairfax County.\n\nClinton said she has the \u201cexperience and temperament\u201d to lead the nation, but cast doubt on the GOP field.\n\n\u201cAt some point you can\u2019t just say whatever pops into your head when you are president of the United States,\u201d she said to loud applause.\n\nClinton, who spoke at a Norfolk high school Monday night, hopes to maintain her momentum on Super Tuesday after her big win over Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in South Carolina on Saturday.\n\nShe campaigned Monday with Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime friend who led her unsuccessful 2008 bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cVirginia is Clinton country,\u201d yelled McAuliffe, as Clinton stood next to him at George Mason. \u201cElections matter, and it matters that Hillary Clinton gets elected president of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nClinton did not mention Sanders at GMU. She focused most of her remarks on Republicans and the general election.\n\nA Republican in the White House would \u201crip away the progress, send us backwards and deprive people of rights,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019m running for president to break down every barrier that stands in the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica never stopped being great,\u201d she said, in a twist on Trump\u2019s pledge to \u201cmake America great again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make America whole,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton said she regrets the tenor of the GOP presidential contest \u2014 \u201cthe scapegoating, finger pointing, blaming. \u201d\n\nShe said that as president, she would \u201ctarget communities that have been left out and left behind.\u201d\n\nShe said Republicans want to sell America \u201csnake oil\u201d and return to \u201ctrickle-down economics.\u201d She said she would defend the Affordable Care Act, and said Republicans would return care to the insurance companies.\n\nClinton said she would defend Obamacare, \u201cimprove it and make it work better.\u201d\n\nClinton said the United States doesn\u2019t need any more prisons, but needs investments in education. She promised to allow student debt to be refinanced, and offer reductions, discounts and forgiveness in exchange for public service.\n\nShe also said she would defend Planned Parenthood, marriage equality and voting rights and that the U.S. Senate should not resist President Barack Obama\u2019s prerogative to nominate a Supreme Court justice to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died Feb. 13.\n\nShe said she favors \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d and would protect Social Security and resist Republican attempts to privatize it.\n\nClinton\u2019s backers at the event included Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.\n\n\u201cVirginia is now the battleground of battlegrounds,\u201d said Kaine, who endorsed Clinton in May 2014, nearly a year before she announced her candidacy.\n\n\u201cWe were irrelevant 15 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cNow all of a sudden, folks \u2026 Virginia is [a] front and center battleground, spotlight on.\n\n\u201cWhen the spotlight\u2019s on, you\u2019ve got to do your best work,\u201d he told the crowd, encouraging them to work for Clinton until the polls close Tuesday evening.\n\nRepublicans on Monday criticized Clinton for her email practices as secretary of state marking the final court-ordered release of her private server.\n\nAt George Mason, Clinton spent nearly 30 minutes after her remarks interacting with the diverse crowd, posing for selfies in a sea of cell phones while surrounded by Secret Service agents.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "FAIRFAX \u2014 Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton spent the eve of Super Tuesday in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, telling several hundred students and activists at George Mason University, \u201cI need your help tomorrow.\u201d", "title": "'I need your help tomorrow,' Clinton tells crowd at George Mason", "url": "http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/i-need-your-help-tomorrow-clinton-tells-crowd-at-george/article_7524284a-89eb-5d09-8378-87cbc84fb849.html", "image": {"width": 473, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/75/775bd82c-eaf9-50bc-916a-f2892d7d779f/56d510b77e87d.image.jpg?resize=473%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@roanoketimes", "card": "summary"}, "description": "FAIRFAX \u2014 Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton spent the eve of Super Tuesday in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, telling several hundred students and activists at George Mason University, \u201cI need your help tomorrow.\u201d", "fb": {"app_id": 251357365028982}, "keywords": "hillary clinton,super tuesday,presidential campaign,terry mcauliffe,george mason,affordable care act,politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/roanoketimes"}, "news_keywords": "hillary clinton,super tuesday,presidential campaign,terry mcauliffe,george mason,affordable care act,politics"}, "article_summary": "\u201cVirginia is Clinton country,\u201d yelled McAuliffe, as Clinton stood next to him at George Mason.\n\u201cElections matter, and it matters that Hillary Clinton gets elected president of the United States of America.\u201dClinton did not mention Sanders at GMU.\nClinton said she would defend Obamacare, \u201cimprove it and make it work better.\u201dClinton said the United States doesn\u2019t need any more prisons, but needs investments in education.\n\u201cAt some point you can\u2019t just say whatever pops into your head when you are president of the United States,\u201d she said to loud applause.\n\u201cI will stand up and fight for you throughout this campaign, no matter who the Republicans nominate,\u201d Clinton told an enthusiastic crowd at GMU in Fairfax County."}
