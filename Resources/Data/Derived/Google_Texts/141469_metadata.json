For good reason, too: Profits are at the highest level in a decade, and the return on investment is at the second-highest point since the turn of the century.\n\nThis comes as home prices have been steadily rising since bottoming out after the nadir of the housing bust in February 2012. Home values are nearly 31 percent higher, but are 4.9 percent off from the peak reached in July 2006.\n\nJust over 110,000 sellers flipped a house in 2015, meaning they bought the house and sold it within 12 months, betting on increasing prices. That\u2019s up 16 percent from the year before and the highest total since 2007, according to a new report Thursday from RealtyTrac.\n\nRelated: 12 States with the Hottest 2016 Housing Markets\n\nThe average gross profit from a flipped home in the U.S. totaled $55,000, the largest amount since 2005 when it was $58,750. The return on investment \u2014 the gross profit as a percentage of the original purchase price \u2014 was 45.8 percent, the second-highest since 2000. (ROI in 2013 was 46 percent.)\n\n\u201cAs confidence in the housing recovery spreads, more real estate investors and would-be real estate investors are hopping on the home flipping bandwagon,\u201d Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at RealtyTrac, said in a statement. \u201cNot only is the share of home flips on the rise again, but we also see the flipping trend trickling down to smaller investors.\u201d\n\nStill, the number of flipped properties\u2014both single-family homes and condos\u2014remained just below the historic average since 2000 but was 13.4 percent higher than last year.\n\nNot all markets are big winners for house flippers. For example, a flipped property in Detroit will only gross $22,050 on average from a property investment, the lowest of the 110 metros tracked by RealtyTrac and almost 60 percent lower than the national average. Likewise, an investor will get only an 18.2-percent ROI for a home in the Daphne-Fairhope-Foley metro area in Alabama, compared with the 45.8-percent average.\n\nRelated: Prices Are Rising.
