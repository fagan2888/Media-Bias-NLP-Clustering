But young people haven\u2019t been able to land those jobs either, Feinberg said.\n\nAnd with the debut of Obamacare\u2019s insurance exchanges on Oct. 1, as well as the likelihood of another debt ceiling increase, the immediate future doesn\u2019t show any additional promise for young Americans. Feinberg said that significant spending cuts would help young people get out of their tough economic plight.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there seems to be little appetite in Washington to actually cut spending, and if they\u2019re unwilling to cut spending, all we\u2019re going to see is continued high unemployment for the younger generation,\u201d Feinberg told Red Alert.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The United States economy added 169,000 jobs in the month of August, but that number means little to young people, as youth unemployment remained relatively unchanged.", "title": "Youth unemployment remained unchanged in August, even as economy...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/02/tdionisopoulos_avatar-400x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/09/06/youth-unemployment-remained-unchanged-in-august-even-as-economy-added-jobs/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "youth-unemployment", "published_time": "2013-09-06T11:04:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-08T15:17:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0671\"", "article_summary": "The United States economy added 169,000 jobs in the month of August, but that number means little to young people, as youth unemployment remained relatively unchanged.\nIn the month of August, youth unemployment increased slightly, from 11.6 percent in July to 11.8 percent, according to a report from the nonprofit youth organization Generation Opportunity.\nSo as the White House touts \u201csolid job gains\u201d and the August jobs report as \u201canother sign of progress,\u201d Millennials aren\u2019t experiencing the so-called economic recovery.\nBut young people haven\u2019t been able to land those jobs either, Feinberg said.\n\u201cUnfortunately, there seems to be little appetite in Washington to actually cut spending, and if they\u2019re unwilling to cut spending, all we\u2019re going to see is continued high unemployment for the younger generation,\u201d Feinberg told Red Alert."}
