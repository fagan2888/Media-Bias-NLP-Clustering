Recently, one of Howard Stern’s minions named Wolfie took recording equipment to The Gathering of the Juggalos, where he interviewed a few Insane Clown Posse sycophants and incidentally exposed the King of All Media to the rap trash duo’s annual festival. (Despite Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope’s prior appearances on the “Stern Show,” the 60-year-old has his pop culture blind spots like anyone else — he apparently just learned about Phish culture, too.)

When playing back Wolfie’s interviews on Tuesday’s show, Stern and news anchor Robin Quivers gave color commentary. They pair came up with a somewhat brilliant notion after listening to one Juggalo’s bragging about “just drinking it off and going to bed” if he were to ever break his shoulder.

No ObamaCare for this Juggalo–he’s going into a U.S. special forces unit.

“I don’t think this guy’s fucking around ,” Stern said. “Stage 3 cancer? Drink it off. Now I know why I stay holed up in my apartment–afraid to go outside. I don’t know from this.”

Then, Wolfie interviewed a Juggalo named a Mr. Rottentree of Delaware as well as a few other angry, don’t-give-a-fuck types from the show, and Quivers and Stern realized the a solution to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria:

Quivers: “We’re using the wrong people for these attacks and stand-offs.” Stern: “Imagine a bunch of guys in clown outfits, like, with hatchets. Those fuckin’ Arab dudes would get right in line.” Quivers: “They would run.” Stern: “Our military should be dressed as clowns, evil clowns. Boy that would scare ISIS. Because ISIS has that whole cool uniform–they got the black covering over their faces when they behead people.” Quivers: “The Indians used to paint their faces to scare their enem[ies]. We should be doing that again.” Stern: “The Juggalos are onto something.”
