That number is expected to increase to 244,000 by 2025, according to statistics released by the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP) in anticipation of National Nurse Practitioner Week 2015.\n\nThe AANP attributes this growth to an increase in the prevalence of aging baby boomers, as well as the millions of new patients who are able to enter the healthcare system under the Affordable Care Act. More than 80% of NPs prepare in primary care programs, with 49% of those entering into family practice.\n\nAccording to data from the AANP, 2 of 3 patients support legislation for greater access to NP services. \u201cThe hope of full practice authority is that it will increase access to care, particularly for underserved populations,\u201d said LeAnn Holmes, DNP, APRN-FNP, FAANP, and AANP Nebraska State Representative. \u201cThere are regulatory barriers to providing care that are well within our scope of practice, including things like ordering home health care, certifying Medicare patients for hospice, and performing monthly exams for patients in skilled nursing facilities.\u201d\n\nChallenges aside, Drs. VanBeuge and Holmes express hope for the future of the NP profession.\n\n\u201cThe advanced practice nursing we provide builds on the foundation as a nurse to bring evidence-based practice to our patients, communities, states, and nation,\u201d said Dr. VanBeuge. \u201cFind ways to keep [the] practice moving forward from the patient encounter to the policy level. APRNs must be involved not only in patient care, but at every level of clinical practice and healthcare policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt took 50 years to get to where we are today, but we still aren't done \u2013 we will never be done,\u201d added Dr. Holmes.\n\nClick to enlarge image.\n\nFor more information on National Nurse Practitioner Week 2015, visit https://www.aanp.org/all-about-nps/np-week.
