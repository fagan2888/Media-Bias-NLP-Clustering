In the centenary year of the start of World War I, Mihailovic is ever more the embodiment of remembrance as another Nov. 11 Armistice Day approaches.\n\n\u201cThis is my family,\u201d he said of the remains beneath the rocky soil. \u201cI know many of the names of the soldiers here and many of their stories.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I tell them to their grandchildren and the great grandchildren,\u201d he said of the Serb visitors who make the pilgrimage to the site.\n\nMihailovic also has real family buried here: his grandfather, a World War I veteran who became the cemetery\u2019s first caretaker, and his father, who succeeded him. Mihailovic intends to work here until he dies, and then be buried here, too.\n\nLow-flung weeds run across the pathways of Mihailovic\u2019s grounds, unlike some Western Front battlefields and cemeteries where many heads of state this year have walked the manicured lawns. It does not detract from their significance, especially for Serbs.\n\nSerbia, involved in the war from the very beginning, had an army of about 350,000 soldiers, of whom some 130,000 died, outnumbered as they fought off an Austro-Hungarian invasion for more than a year before Germany and neighbor Bulgaria joined the onslaught.\n\n\u201cA third of the army was lost,\u201d said Mihailovic. \u201cIt\u2019s a story the world should know.\u201d\n\nThe region around Thessaloniki was a rallying point for Serbia\u2019s ravaged army, which endured a harrowing retreat to join Allied troops led by Britain and France in 1916.\n\n\u201cEvery family had a victim,\u201d Mihailovic said, sitting at the entrance of a room filled with Orthodox Christian religious icons and dedications left by visitors.\n\nThe Mihailovic dynasty of caretakers started with grandfather Sava, who took the job at the cemetery when it was built on the site of a field hospital for the wounded. Djordje\u2019s father, Djuro, took over as caretaker until his death in 1960.", "article_metadata": {"description": "86-year-old Serb guards over WWI dead in Greece", "title": "86-year-old Serb guards over WWI dead in Greece", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "86-year-old Serb guards over WWI dead in Greece", "title": "86-year-old Serb guards over WWI dead in Greece", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/08/86_year_old_serb_guards_over_wwi_dead_in_greece/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/greece-wwi-remembrance-personified.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "86-year-old Serb guards over WWI dead in Greece", "title": "86-year-old Serb guards over WWI dead in Greece", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/greece-wwi-remembrance-personified.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Costas Kantouris", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc766\"", "article_summary": "For over half a century, the 86-year-old has been a caretaker at Thessaloniki\u2019s Allied War Cemetery in northern Greece.\nIn the centenary year of the start of World War I, Mihailovic is ever more the embodiment of remembrance as another Nov. 11 Armistice Day approaches.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsTHESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) \u2014 Stooped and unsteady, Djordje Mihailovic walks among rows of discolored marble crosses of Serb soldiers slain a century ago in the horrors of World War I.\nMihailovic also has real family buried here: his grandfather, a World War I veteran who became the cemetery\u2019s first caretaker, and his father, who succeeded him.\nDjordje\u2019s father, Djuro, took over as caretaker until his death in 1960."}
