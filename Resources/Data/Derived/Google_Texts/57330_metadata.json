She also, \"played an integral role in crafting the landmark healthcare law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Education Reconciliation Act.\"\n\nNow we know why ObamaCare is so great. A psycho played an integral role in it.\n\nThe White House has placed an aide to President Obama on unpaid leave after she was charged with shooting a gun at her boyfriend, an officer with the U.S. Capitol Police, during an argument. Barvetta Singletary, 37, who is a special assistant to Mr. Obama and also holds the title of House legislative liaison, was charged with assault and reckless endangerment after allegedly threatening and shooting at the man after having sex with him at her home in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. \u201cWe are aware of the matter and have temporarily placed the employee in question on unpaid leave and revoked her access to the complex until we have more information,\u201d a White House spokesperson said.\n\nHow much more information does the White House really need?\n\nOf course Barvetta had extraordinary qualifications to get where she did. I'm kidding. This is the Democratic Party. She's the daughter of a Democratic official.\n\nShe is the daughter of Councilwoman W. Jeanie Brown-Burrows.\n\nMeanwhile the Capitol Police is another nepotism gig and her boyfriend appeared to be doing quite well for himself.\n\nThe incident began Friday morning at Singletary\u2019s home in Upper Marlboro, Md., after she and the officer argued, according to police charging documents. Singletary asked the officer about another woman he was dating and left her house to search his Cadillac Escalade for his cellphones, the documents state. When she found the officer\u2019s phones, she also retrieved his service weapon in his bag and demanded that he give her the passwords to his phones, charging documents state. The officer ran back to the house, and Singletary followed, later pointing the gun at him, police said. \u201cYou taught me how to use this; don\u2019t think I won\u2019t use it,\u201d police said Singletary told the officer. \u201cYour phone is more important than me holding this gun on you?\u201d Singletary then fired at the officer and missed, the documents state. The officer eventually fled, and \u201cthe defendant was observed wiping the gun down with a towel,\u201d according to charging documents.\n\nAt least she learned something from this administration.
