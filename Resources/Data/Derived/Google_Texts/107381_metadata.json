No one here is like, \u2018What? It\u2019s fine, how it is!\u2019 It\u2019s awful. But we love our babies more than we hate our pumps, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re motivated to be here today.\u201d\n\nWe love our babies more than we hate our pumps. \u2013 Erin Freeburger\n\nFreeburger\u2019s team was among ten squads of brainstormers who took on the intense weekend challenge of improving upon current breast pump designs \u2014 and her team won the first prize of $3,000 and a trip to Silicon Valley to court investors. Their concept: The \u201cMighty Mom\u201d utility belt, is \u201ca fashionable, discreet, hands-free wearable pump that automatically logs and analyzes your personal data.\u201d Milk data, that is.\n\nThe concept, she explained, involves both hardware \u2014 the utility belt to hold pumping parts needed on the go \u2014 and software: It imagines a \u201csmart\u201d breast pump that would collect and track data and upload it to the cloud: milk volume, even fat and protein content as analyzed by infrared sensors. (My reaction: So it\u2019s, like, the iPump?)\n\nOther winners, according to the contest site: Second prize of $2,000 to \u201ca sturdy, easy-to-clean, minimal-parts, hands-free compression bra designed by nursing moms. The bra helps women manually express breastmilk (a technique proven to be as effective as electric pumps) without their hands.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not an iPhone, it\u2019s a mortar and pestle. \u2013 Victoria Solan\n\nAnd third prize of $1,000 to \u201can open software and hardware platform to make the breast pumping experience smarter, more data-rich and less isolating. PumpIO puts pumping women in touch with lactation consultants and communities as they are pumping, when they have questions and to help reinforce their commitment to their baby.\u201d\n\nAnd special recognition goes to \u201ca breast pump that mimics the way that a baby suckles with massage and compression. This team also designed soft, low-profile flanges to be worn discreetly.\u201d And more special recognition to this winner of the popular vote:\n\nCompress Express: A breast pump that mimics the natural and age-old art of hand expression, instead of archaic vacuum technology that dominates the market. Inspired by the simplicity of blood pressure cuffs, this project\u2019s gentle compression technology enables efficient milk expression and creates a discreetly wearable, virtually silent and hands-free breast pumping experience.\n\nDebra Abbaszadeh, a founder of Simple Wishes, a hands-free bra company based in San Francisco, said she thought \u201cthe whole idea of compression versus expression was really interesting. I think it requires a lot of work. I think the concepts, exactly as they are, are not quite there, but it\u2019s a very interesting idea.\u201d\n\nYou might think, given the huge market for breast pumps in a country where most women work and most mothers breastfeed, that pump makers would already have been racing to improve on designs.\n\nSo why should a hackathon \u2014 an intense team brainstorming session that originated in computer engineering \u2014 even be needed?\n\nDespite the commercial efforts, clearly, \u201cMost women are still dissatisfied,\u201d said Victoria Solan, a historian of architecture and design who attended the hackathon. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about how they\u2019re painful, they\u2019re uncomfortable, they don\u2019t work well. So I think the organizers\u2019 original claim \u2014 that there\u2019s no reason that the breast pump shouldn\u2019t be as well designed as the iPhone \u2014 is true. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s not an iPhone, it\u2019s a mortar and pestle.\u201d\n\nBut as some hackathon participants discovered, improving upon it is not necessarily easy.\n\n\u201cWhen I first came in, I was surprised to see so many of the [breast-pump] vendors here, because we pretty much just attacked their product,\u201d Erin Freeburger said. \u201cAnd then, a few hours in, I realized: It\u2019s really hard, some of the mechanics we were trying to do. We\u2019re working with gravity, we\u2019re working with suction, we\u2019re working with parts that have to be cleaned within so many hours because we\u2019re working with milk, the storage has to be refrigerated. We hit some walls and we realized, \u2018Oh, maybe this is why it\u2019s taken so long to fix it.'\u201d\n\nBut the hackathon represents progress, she and others said, at the very least because it united and amplified the voices of women dissatisfied with the current state of pumping.\n\nWomen tend to think it\u2019s a personal, private problem if they have trouble pumping at work or elsewhere, she said. And \u201cProbably the reason it hasn\u2019t changed by now is that we\u2019ve sort of just\u2026.sucked it up.\u201d\n\nReaders, thoughts? Pumping experiences?
