She\u2019s a licensed home daycare provider, and when it comes to health care and making that (mortgage) payment, it\u2019s just out of the question. It\u2019s way too expensive,\u201d said Duran.\n\nSo for her senior project \u2014 along with some classmates \u2014 Duran put together a health and enrollment fair in her school\u2019s library.\n\n\u201cIn Sacramento County, there are about 200,000 families who do not have health insurance,\u201d said Hellan Roth Dowden, Teachers For Healthy Kids. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to get out to the area where the families are to make it easier for them to know about the health insurance.\u201d\n\nThe ALL IN Campaign also played a part reaching out to school communities.\n\n\u201cMeaning schools, early learning, after school providers, to make sure they have general information about the Affordable Care Act \u2014 what Obamacare means to California,\u201d said Melissa Vargas, manager of the ALL IN Campaign for The Children\u2019s Partnership.\n\n\u201cIt saved me having to take a day off and spend six hours in line somewhere; and I\u2019m not a computer person, so I really appreciate it,\u201d said Cheryl Honda.\n\nDuran hopes her senior project helps a lot of people but \u2014 most of all \u2014 her mom.\n\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get her enrolled in some health care, because that is essentially my main goal \u2014 to have my mom healthy,\u201d she said.\n\nThe next ALL IN event will be held at Natomas High School on January 25.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are thousands of people still without health care coverage in Sacramento County, but some families were able to sign up thanks to one high school student.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2014/01/11/rio-americano-high-school-senior-organizes-health-care-registration-event/", "image": {"width": 640, "secure_url": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/juzely-duran.jpg?w=640", "identifier": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/juzely-duran.jpg?w=640", "height": 360}, "type": "article", "description": "There are thousands of people still without health care coverage in Sacramento County, but some families were able to sign up thanks to one high school student.", "title": "Rio Americano High School Senior Organizes Health Care Registration Event"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbssacramento.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/juzely-duran.jpg?w=640", "description": "There are thousands of people still without health care coverage in Sacramento County, but some families were able to sign up thanks to one high school student.", "site": "/social/", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rio Americano High School Senior Organizes Health Care Registration Event"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Sacramento", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Sacramento", "article": {"publisher": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/social/", "author": "http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/social/"}, "keywords": "local, news, seen on, syndicated local, affordable care act, obamacare, rio americano high school", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e592dab1a834e9f02fdb648f19487a6?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, rio americano high school"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe91\"", "article_summary": "The next ALL IN event will be held at Natomas High School on January 25.\nUnderstanding the Affordable Care Act can be somewhat overwhelming, Rio Americano High School student Juzely Duran decided to take on the task for her senior project.\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get her enrolled in some health care, because that is essentially my main goal \u2014 to have my mom healthy,\u201d she said.\nShe\u2019s a licensed home daycare provider, and when it comes to health care and making that (mortgage) payment, it\u2019s just out of the question.\nSACRAMENTO (CBS13) \u2013 There are thousands of people still without health care coverage in Sacramento County, but some families were able to sign up thanks to one high school student."}
