That would amount to an average subsidy per enrollee of $267 per month.\n\nIn April, analysts at the government agency running Obamacare reported the average Obamacare subsidy will be $280 \u2013 $13 higher than CBO estimated. That may not be a big deal, but what is interesting is how much more of the cost of Obamacare has been shifted onto taxpayers in the program\u2019s third year.\n\nAccording to the same government agency, the average Obamacare exchange premium increased from $346 in 2014 to $386 this year. That comprises 12 percent growth over two years. The average tax credit subsidizing coverage increased from $264 to $280, or just six percent. Therefore, the average net premium increased from $82 to $106, or 29 percent.\n\nHowever, when we look at each year individually, it is clear insurers have learned how to shift more costs to taxpayers. The change in gross premium from 2014 to 2015 was ten dollars per month, or three percent. The tax credit actually declined by ten dollars, or four percent. So, the net premium increased by $20, or 24 percent.\n\nPeople were unhappy. So, this year, the average gross premium increased by $30, or 8 percent from 2015. However, the average tax credit increased by $26, or four percent. The net premium, therefore increased only $4, or four percent.\n\nDespite gross premiums growing three times faster in 2016 than 2015, Obamacare beneficiaries will actually see a significantly less painful increase in the net premium they have to pay. Taxpayers are shouldering a higher share of Obamacare\u2019s costs.\n\nAccident? Probably not. Obamacare\u2019s tax credits are based on the lowest-cost Silver plan in a region. The same subsidy will result in a very different net premium if a person chooses Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. The evidence suggests insurers have learned quickly how to design their \u201cmetal\u201d plans to drive enrollees towards plans with the highest share of premium borne by taxpayers.\n\nI expect this will continue, and the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s cost estimates continue to be too low.\n\n* * *\n\nFor the pivotal alternative to Obamacare, please see the Independent Institute\u2019s widely acclaimed book: Priceless: Curing the Healthcare Crisis, by John C.
