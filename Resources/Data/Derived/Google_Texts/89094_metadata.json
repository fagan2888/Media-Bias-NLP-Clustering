The whole reason the Court has taken these cases is that circuit courts disagree, after all. So what\u2019s legal in Texas is illegal in Illinois, with no guidance from the Supreme Court. That is extraordinary.\n\nThe short-handed Court could also begin to bend under the heavy workload. To take but one example, the justices generally parcel out last-minute death penalty appeals. If even a single such appeal cannot be adequately reviewed because of short staffing, that, too, would be extraordinary.\n\nWorst of all, imagine a contested presidential election in November\u2014like Bush v. Gore on steroids. It\u2019s not hard to see this happening in light of recent voting shenanigans in Arizona, Donald Trump\u2019s love of litigation, and the real possibility of a credible third-party presidential run. And there is nothing more extraordinary than a deadlocked court unable to enable the transition of power.\n\nNor would an \u201cextraordinary session\u201d be new: it\u2019s happened 46 times in American history. (46 for the Senate alone, 28 for both the Senate and the House.) It may be unfamiliar, since the last time was under President Truman, but it\u2019s hardly unprecedented.\n\nAnd many of them were much more thinly justified than Obama\u2019s would be. In 2008, for example, Republicans wanted President Bush to call an extraordinary session for Congress to discuss soaring gas prices (remember those?). And President Truman\u2019s call, during the 1948 election season, was in fact a baldly political stunt meant to expose Republican inaction on civil rights.\n\nSo it seems that the president would be well within his authority to convene an \u201cextraordinary session.\u201d What would happen then?\n\nWell, either the Senate would convene or it wouldn\u2019t. If it didn\u2019t convene, that would be a true constitutional crisis: one branch of the government denying the clear authority of another. (Of course, Republicans would say that Obama, the \u201cimperial president,\u201d started it\u2014yet another way the party has come to resemble its putative presidential candidate.)\n\nIt would also be grounds for a Supreme Court case, filed by the White House, demanding that the Senate obey the president\u2019s order. If the Court ruled in Obama\u2019s favor and the Senate still didn\u2019t convene, it would be disobeying both the executive and judicial branches of government\u2014ironically, all the name of a pseudo-constitutional argument that \u201cthe people\u201d only elected President Obama to a three-year second term.\n\nWhatever electoral consequences Senate Republicans face now, they\u2019d surely be punished fourfold for violating a direct order from the Supreme Court and the White House combined. It would make the Clinton Impeachment seem like a class in civics.\n\nSo let\u2019s suppose the Senate does convene. What then?\n\nProbably nothing.\n\nAs commentators have noted, the \u201cspeech and debate\u201d clause of the Constitution makes it very hard to compel the Senate to do anything at all. Just as President Obama has wide discretion in calling them to convene, so the Senate leadership has wide discretion in deciding how to do its business.\n\nIndeed, \u201cnothing\u201d is what happened in 1948; Republican Sen. Robert Taft simply blocked all votes from taking place. Perhaps the GOP would take a cue from House of Cards and issue a slow-motion \u201cquorum call,\u201d taking attendance for hours, or even days. Perhaps Ted Cruz would read Dr. Seuss again. Anything other than actually issue advice and (non-)consent on Obama\u2019s nominee.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

And it would keep this issue alive in the minds of easily-distracted voters.\n\nMost importantly, convening an extraordinary session would at least somewhat take the senators off the campaign trail, which is where they\u2019ll want to be in September and October, and effectively hold them hostage in Washington during prime campaign season. Practically speaking, they\u2019d find a way out of it\u2014there are infinite procedural ways to avoid actually showing up for work in the Senate\u2014 and, of course, Democrats would be just as stuck as Republicans. But they would have to do something, rather than adjourn as usual.\n\nOf course, such a confrontational position might poison whatever appetite Senate Republicans have for a lame-duck confirmation. And there\u2019s reason to believe that may be Obama\u2019s strategy all along: nominate someone who eventually will look better than the alternative.
