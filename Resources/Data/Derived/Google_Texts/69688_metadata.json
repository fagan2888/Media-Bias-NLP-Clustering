The bill, H.R. 3762, passed the Senate in early December and passed the House in early January, but stopped short of becoming law due to the president's veto.\n\nThe House needed a two-thirds majority to override Obama's veto, yet it came up short with a vote of 241-186--with members voting mostly along party lines. Passage of the bill itself was largely symbolic, FierceHealthPayer has reported, as Republicans expected a presidential veto but also wanted to express their opposition to the ACA and pave a legislative path for a future repeal of the law.
