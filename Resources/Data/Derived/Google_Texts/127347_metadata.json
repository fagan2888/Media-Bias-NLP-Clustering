Skyscrapers crumble. Fires erupt. The letters of the Hollywood Sign topple. Tsunami waves swamp the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nHollywood\u2019s favorite geologic bad guy is back in \u201cSan Andreas\u201d \u2014 a fantastical look at one of the world\u2019s real seismic threats.\n\nThe San Andreas has long been considered one of the most dangerous earthquake faults because of its length. At nearly 800 miles long, it cuts through California like a scar and is responsible for some of the largest shakers in state history.\n\nIn the film, opening May 29, a previously unknown fault near the Hoover Dam in Nevada ruptures and jiggles the San Andreas. Southern California is rocked by a powerful magnitude-9.1 quake followed by an even stronger magnitude-9.6 in Northern California.\n\nU.S. Geological Survey seismologist Susan Hough accompanied The Associated Press to an advance screening of the film. Despite the implausible plot, she said the San Andreas will indeed break again, and without warning.\n\n\u201cWe are at some point going to face a big earthquake,\u201d she said.\n\nJUST HOW BIG?\n\nThe San Andreas is notorious for producing big ones, but a magnitude-9 or larger is virtually impossible because the fault is not long or deep enough.\n\nThe most powerful temblors in recorded history have struck along offshore subduction zones where one massive tectonic plate dives beneath another. The 1960 magnitude-9.5 quake off Chile is the current world record holder.\n\nThe San Andreas has revealed its awesome power before. In 1906, a magnitude-7.8 reduced parts of San Francisco to fiery rubble. Nearly five decades earlier, a similar-sized quake rattled the southern end.\n\nIn 2008, the USGS led a team of 300 experts that wrote a script detailing what would happen if a magnitude-7.8 hit the southern San Andreas. They wanted to create a science-based crisis scenario that can be used for preparedness drills.\n\nThe lesson: It doesn\u2019t take a magnitude-9 or greater to wreak havoc. Researchers calculated a magnitude-7.8 would cause 1,800 deaths and 50,000 injuries. Hundreds of old brick buildings and concrete structures and a few high-rise steel buildings would collapse.\n\nComputer models show the San Andreas is capable of producing a magnitude-8.3 quake, but anything larger is dubious.\n\nWILL THERE BE A WARNING?\n\nIn the film, Lawrence Hayes, a fictional seismologist at Caltech (a real university), notices spikes in \u201cmagnetic pulses\u201d that light up California like a Christmas tree, heralding a monster quake.\n\nDespite a century of research, earthquake prediction remains elusive. Scientists can\u2019t predict when a jolt is coming and are generally pessimistic about ever having that ability.\n\nEvery warning sign scrutinized \u2014 animal behavior, weather patterns, electromagnetic signals, atmospheric observations, levels of radon gas in soil or groundwater \u2014 has failed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Separating earthquake fact from fiction in \u2018San Andreas\u2019", "title": "Separating earthquake fact from fiction in \u2018San Andreas\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Separating earthquake fact from fiction in \u2018San Andreas\u2019", "title": "Separating earthquake fact from fiction in \u2018San Andreas\u2019", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/separating_earthquake_fact_from_fiction_in_san_andreas/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/film-san-andreas-the-facts.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Separating earthquake fact from fiction in \u2018San Andreas\u2019", "title": "Separating earthquake fact from fiction in \u2018San Andreas\u2019", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/film-san-andreas-the-facts.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Alicia Chang", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The San Andreas Fault awakens, unleashing back-to-back jolts that leave a trail of misery from Los Angeles to San Francisco.\nHollywood\u2019s favorite geologic bad guy is back in \u201cSan Andreas\u201d \u2014 a fantastical look at one of the world\u2019s real seismic threats.\nThe San Andreas has long been considered one of the most dangerous earthquake faults because of its length.\nDespite the implausible plot, she said the San Andreas will indeed break again, and without warning.\nIn 2008, the USGS led a team of 300 experts that wrote a script detailing what would happen if a magnitude-7.8 hit the southern San Andreas."}
