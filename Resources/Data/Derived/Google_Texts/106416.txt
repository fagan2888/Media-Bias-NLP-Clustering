The substance abuse clinic housed in a Arvada building that burned for five hours Saturday announced on Facebook that an employee remained missing on Sunday.

“All clients got out safely. John Rutter is still missing,” officials with Creative Treatment Options said on Facebook. “The building is gutted and too dangerous to enter at this time.”

The building was heavily damaged, and “full collapse is imminent,” said Deanna Harrington, Arvada Fire District spokeswoman.

The blaze began at the clinic at 6475 Wadsworth Boulevard at about 10 a.m. on Saturday, according to the Arvada Fire District.

Rutter has more than 20 years of experience in the addictions field, according to the Creative Treatment Options website.

“John grew up in the “frozen Tundra” of the cheese-land known as Wisconsin,” a bio of Rutter on the website said.

“John was a clinic director in Milwaukee’s inner city … John lives by the motto: “we are all students and we are all teachers.” John has learned through his own experiences that life is about adjustments to the lessons being taught. He encourages everyone to embrace the journey and not concentrate on the destination because that is the same for everyone,” the website said.

One civilian, and one firefighter were also injured in the blaze. The firefighter is home and recovering, Harrington said.

She didn’t know the condition of the other person who was injured.

It took fire fighters five hours to extinguish the inferno that engulfed the three story building, which housed medical offices as well as the substance-abuse clinic.

“We are still at the scene and we are investigating the cause and origin of the fire,” Harrington said.
