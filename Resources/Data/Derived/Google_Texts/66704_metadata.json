It said the government request would create a \"back door\" to phones that could be abused by criminals and governments, and that Congress has not given the Justice Department authority to make such a demand.\n\nObama's comments were his most expansive on the subject since the dispute.\n\nHe acknowledged skepticism about the government in the wake of the revelations about U.S. surveillance programs by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nBut he pressed his point that a compromise that respected civil liberties and protected security had to be found. That solution would likely be a system with strong encryption and a secure \"key\" that is accessible to the \"smallest number of people possible\" for issues that were agreed to be important.\n\n\"Setting aside the specific case between the FBI and Apple ... we\u2019re going to have to make some decisions about how do we balance these respective risks,\" Obama said.\n\n\"My conclusion so far is you cannot take an absolutist view.\"\n\nAdding to his argument, the president listed airport security and stops for drunk drivers as examples of measures that were intrusive but accepted. He also warned against \"fetishizing\" phones.\n\n\"This notion that somehow our data is different and can be walled off from those other tradeoffs we make I believe is incorrect,\" he said.\n\nTop White House officials have lobbied the industry aggressively to work with the government on the issue, which was brought to a head by the California shootings.\n\nThe FBI says Farook and his wife were inspired by Islamist militants when they shot and killed 14 people on Dec. 2 at a holiday party in California. The couple later died in a shootout with police.\n\n(Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner and Dustin Volz; Editing by Robert Birsel)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - U.S.", "title": "Aiming to sidestep Apple dispute, Obama makes case for access to device data", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/11/Obama-says-cannot-comment-legal-case-Apple-Inc", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/11/Obama-says-cannot-comment-legal-case-Apple-Inc", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-obama_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Last month, the FBI obtained a court order requiring Apple to write new software and take other measures to disable passcode protection and allow access to Farook's iPhone.\n\"Setting aside the specific case between the FBI and Apple ... we\u2019re going to have to make some decisions about how do we balance these respective risks,\" Obama said.\nAdding to his argument, the president listed airport security and stops for drunk drivers as examples of measures that were intrusive but accepted.\nBut he pressed his point that a compromise that respected civil liberties and protected security had to be found.\nBut he made clear that despite his commitment to Americans' privacy and civil liberties, a balance was needed to allow some government intrusion if necessary."}
