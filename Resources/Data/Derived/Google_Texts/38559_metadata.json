Consider the most recent rumblings about Iran.\n\nFor just a moment, it looked like President Obama had scored a rare diplomatic win. At considerable cost to itself, Saudi Arabia had arranged to drive down oil prices, a move that very much benefits the interests of the United States. Lower oil prices hurt Russia and Iran, our two biggest geopolitical antagonists. Lower oil revenues, like the sanctions now levied on both countries, undermine their economies and should enhance the bargaining power of the west.\n\nRelated: Iranian Caught Stealing Plans for DOD\u2019s $1.5 Trillion Jet\n\nPundits suggest that the Saudis have kept their oil production high and driven prices down to preserve market share. In a long-term sense, that makes sense. One hundred dollar oil has allowed numerous players, including the U.S., to increase production. Sustained lower prices will cut output by marginal high-cost sources. Whether the Saudis will keep the lid on prices, and make such a long-term bet, however, remains to be seen. The idea that the U.S. might be coordinating with Riyadh in sending oil prices lower \u2013 given the Obama team\u2019s lack of strategic diplomacy \u2013 has barely surfaced.\n\nAnd rightly so. Astonishingly, Obama has scuttled any advantage lower oil prices might have delivered by hinting that (post-election, naturally), the president could use his executive authority to temporarily \u201csuspend\u201d the embargo on Iran oil output and other measures meant to force them to the negotiating table. His Treasury argues that such a move would not constitute a formal treaty, and therefore not require the approval of Congress. The leak of this plan has infuriated many on the Left and the Right, who realize that this accommodation of a desperate Iran would infuriate Israel, an ally that Obama continually ignores, and also insult Saudi Arabia, a necessary partner in brokering Middle East stability.\n\nAny deal would be a one-way affair. Tehran has yet to agree to any significant slowdown in its efforts to become a nuclear nation. Indeed, western analysts count numerous attempts in recent years by Iran to achieve covertly what they have agreed to eliminate publicly. Why, then, would Obama risk alienating our few allies in the Middle East for an agreement that eludes the goals we have sought for so long?\n\nRelated: An Obama Failure with Iran Seems Inevitable\n\nThis is yet another legacy quest by President Obama. The New York Times, in reporting the prospective move, describes it as \u201cthe most important foreign policy deal of his presidency\u201d. Indeed, it\u2019s hard to find another. The country should not let Obama get away with this.\n\nThe danger of a nuclear Iran is a given. The UN Security Council has acknowledged as much by resolving that Iran must give up its uranium-enriching centrifuges. Today the country has 9,400 active centrifuges, and another 10,000 yet to start spinning. In a major concession, the six powers (U.S., France, China, Russia, Germany and Britain) negotiating a stop to Tehran\u2019s ambitions have agreed that Iran may continue to operate 4,000 centrifuges.\n\nIn the latest round of talks, which ended mid-October, most participants reported virtually no progress. Nonetheless, the U.S. appears keen \u2013 along with Iran -- to strike a deal before the November 24 deadline. At a briefing, a State Department spokesperson said that the parties had made \u201cprogress incrementally,\u201d which under questioning evolved into a \u201ctiny\u201d narrowing of differences, with large issues such as uranium enrichment \u2013 pretty much the core of the exercise \u2013 still outstanding.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Minister Lavrov and Iranian President Rouhani have hinted that an extension of the talks might be beneficial. The U.S. wants no part of that; critics have noted that the termination date of the talks falls neatly between the midterm elections in the U.S. and the possible installation of a GOP-led Congress \u2013 a window that looms critical for a president looking to insert himself into the history books.\n\nTo be clear, Iran wants to see sanctions lifted, but also wants to be a nuclear power. Just before the most recent round of talks, Tehran again declined to answer questions from the International Atomic Energy Agency about suspected activities that could relate to the creation of a nuclear weapon. These were among several \u201cpractical measures\u201d that Iran had pledged to resolve by the end of August 25, signaling its good-faith intention to cooperate with the IAEA. It was clear that its balk would stall the recent talks.\n\nRelated: Iran\u2019s Trade Deals\u2014Will the U.S. Miss the Boat?\n\nTo be even clearer, Iran has used a decade of stalling and pretense to advance its nuclear capabilities. According to a recent report from the non-partisan Iran Watch, \u201cIran now has the ability to enrich uranium to a grade suitable for use in nuclear reactors or to a higher grade suitable for use in nuclear warheads.\u201d More specifically, \u201cBy using the approximately 9,000 first generation centrifuges operating at its Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant, Iran could theoretically produce enough weapon-grade uranium to fuel a single nuclear warhead in about 1.7 months.\u201d The report notes that Iran now has enough low-enriched uranium to build seven nuclear warheads.\n\nNo wonder Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned President Obama against accepting any deal that lifts sanctions without concessions from Tehran. No wonder 354 members of the House of Representatives sent Obama a letter warning that Iran\u2019s lack of cooperation with the IAEA was a \u201cbad omen\u201d and that even members of his own party have threatened new sanctions.\n\nSuch warnings fall on deaf ears. In June 2009, President Obama invited nine presidential historians to dine at the White House, eager to learn what makes a great president. One admiringly described his host as not \u201cbogged down in the details\u201d of the job and plainly seeing \u201cthe opportunity to do big things;\u201d he was impressed that Obama understood that \"this is a major moment in the country's history.\"\n\nHow frustrated Obama must be. It turns out it\u2019s the little things \u2013 the pesky details of managing the Secret Service, the IRS, the Veterans Administration and the CDC, the conducting of war and foreign policy, the schmoozing of Congress, leadership - that may build a legacy, even for someone ready to do \u201cbig things.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Should we trust President Obama to conduct our foreign policy \u2013 a president whose inte", "title": "Obama\u2019s Legacy Extends to Possible Deal with Iran", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/10/29/Obama-s-Legacy-Extends-Possible-Deal-Iran", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01302012_Iranian_Oil_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/10/29/Obama-s-Legacy-Extends-Possible-Deal-Iran", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01302012_Iranian_Oil_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@lizpeek"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Should we trust President Obama to conduct our foreign policy \u2013 a president whose inte", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26a4\"", "article_summary": "Related: An Obama Failure with Iran Seems InevitableThis is yet another legacy quest by President Obama.\nLower oil prices hurt Russia and Iran, our two biggest geopolitical antagonists.\nLower oil revenues, like the sanctions now levied on both countries, undermine their economies and should enhance the bargaining power of the west.\nIn June 2009, President Obama invited nine presidential historians to dine at the White House, eager to learn what makes a great president.\nFor just a moment, it looked like President Obama had scored a rare diplomatic win."}
