Kvitov\u00e1, who has won Wimbledon twice, had never before won an event three times \u2014 nor had she won one two years in a row.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first time defending my title,\u201d Kvitov\u00e1 said on court after the match, \u201cSo I\u2019m very excited about that.\u201d\n\nThe final took a little over two hours, with almost half of the match time going to a closely fought opening set. \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1, ranked sixth in the world, eventually won a first-set tiebreaker, 7\u20136 (6), 66 minutes into the match and on her third set point. It was just the second set Kvitov\u00e1 lost in the tournament, and it was the high point of the match for \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1.\n\nAt 1\u20131 in the second set, world number five Kvitov\u00e1 broke \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1\u2019s serve for the first time in the contest. From there Kvitov\u00e1 needed just 73 minutes total to win the final two sets, 6\u20132, 6\u20132, on four service breaks. \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 never broke Kvitov\u00e1\u2019s serve in the match.\n\nIt was \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1\u2019s seventh loss to fellow Czech Kvitov\u00e1 in seven career tries.\n\nEarlier in the day, Julia G\u00f6erges and Lucie Hradeck\u00e1 took the doubles title, defeating Chuang Chia-Jung and Chen Liang in straight sets, 6\u20133, 6\u20131. The championship marked the G\u00f6erges/Hradeck\u00e1 team\u2019s first title in just their second doubles event together.\n\nWith a qualifying field of 48 players and a main draw of 30, both singles finalists had to beat fan favorites and notable players alike on their way to the finale.\n\nKvitov\u00e1 bested former world number one Caroline Wozniacki in a semi-final match Friday night in straight sets, 7\u20135, 6\u20131. Wozniacki holds the record, with Venus Williams, for most tournament wins at the Connecticut event, with four.\n\nAnd the only set Kvitov\u00e1 had lost this week before today\u2019s finals match was in her second-round victory over American Madison Keys. It was 16th-ranked Keys\u2019s debut in New Haven, and she lost her second match to Kvitov\u00e1, 6\u20134, 1\u20136, 2\u20136.\n\nIn \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1\u2019s semi-final, she took on \u2018lucky loser\u2019 Lesia Tsurenko. Tsurenko lost her third qualifying match, but was added to the main draw of the tournament when world number two Simona Halep withdrew with an injury. Tsurenko went on to win two matches, and was bidding to become just the second lucky loser ever to win a WTA event when she lost to \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 in the semis, 2\u20136, 6\u20137 (4). Even with the two losses in one week, Tsurenko\u2019s semi-final berth will push her ranking to an all-time high of number 35 in the world as of August 31.\n\nThe other big story in the qualifying rounds before the main draw of the tournament was Carol Finke, a Yale sophomore who was awarded a last-minute wildcard berth. Finke lost in straight sets to fellow American Louisa Chirico, 2\u20136, 0\u20136, in front of a small but boisterous crowd of family, friends, and fans.\n\nTotal attendance for the tournament was 51,946, up more than 10 percent over last year. Tournament director Anne Worcester said it was the event\u2019s second straight increase in attendance. The state of Connecticut bought the Open after the 2013 tournament, as declining ticket and sponsorship sales threatened its existence.\n\nWhile overall attendance was up, 52,000 attendees for a nine-day event still adds up to a lot of empty seats. The Tennis Center\u2019s Stadium Court is the world\u2019s sixth-largest tennis venue, with a capacity of about 15,000, but Friday night\u2019s Kvitov\u00e1/Wosniacki semi-final drew a reported audience of just 4,800.\n\nAttendance for the afternoon final was reportedly 3,507. The stadium\u2019s upper deck was not used at all during the tournament.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Sports", "description": "Petra Kvitov\u00e1 won the Connecticut Open singles tennis championship for the second straight year, besting Lucie \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 today in three sets at the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/kvitov-repeats-connecticut-open", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201508/0829_kvitova_pumps_her_fist.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Petra Kvitov\u00e1 won the Connecticut Open singles tennis championship for the second straight year, besting Lucie \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 today in three sets at the", "title": "Kvitov\u00e1 Repeats at the Connecticut Open"}, "org_id": 0, "has_audio": 0, "author": "Jonathan McNicol", "wordCount": 850, "dc": {"title": "Kvitov\u00e1 Repeats at the Connecticut Open"}, "nid": 45974, "datePublished": "2015-08-29", "keywords": "tennis, New Haven Region, The Daily, athletes, sports", "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@mcnicolpants"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0c7\"", "article_summary": "Petra Kvitov\u00e1 won the Connecticut Open singles tennis championship for the second straight year, besting Lucie \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1 today in three sets at the Connecticut Tennis Center.\nIt was 16th-ranked Keys\u2019s debut in New Haven, and she lost her second match to Kvitov\u00e1, 6\u20134, 1\u20136, 2\u20136.\nIt was just the second set Kvitov\u00e1 lost in the tournament, and it was the high point of the match for \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1.\nAt 1\u20131 in the second set, world number five Kvitov\u00e1 broke \u0160af\u00e1\u0159ov\u00e1\u2019s serve for the first time in the contest.\nThe state of Connecticut bought the Open after the 2013 tournament, as declining ticket and sponsorship sales threatened its existence."}
