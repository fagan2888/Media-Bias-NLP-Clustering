Also this year, former Deputy Assistant Secretary Raymond Maxwell said he witnessed a Benghazi document-sorting session in October 2012 in the State Department basement. He said then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, and her deputy, Jake Sullivan, were present.\n\n19) Missing: Obama EPA Text Messages.
