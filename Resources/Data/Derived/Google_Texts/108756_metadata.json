Yet agency officials say bureaucratic requirements are slowing them down and costing more time and resources than necessary.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office recently reviewed the progress of reforms to the federal IT infrastructure, which costs about $80 billion a year. Now a GAO report finds that agency tech chiefs aren\u2019t thrilled about the reporting requirements they have to follow to document their reform efforts.\n\nRelated: Another Failed Gov\u2019t Tech Project Cost $1.1 Billion\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget requires federal chief information officers to report on everything from capital planning and strategic planning to security and investment management. The requirements are to help track where IT funding is going and how well the systems are working. Agency chiefs say that\u2019s just adding to their workload.\n\nThe GAO surveyed tech officers at 24 of the largest federal agencies. The majority think at least two-thirds of the reporting requirements are more tedious than helpful. They said meeting those requirements took significant effort and cost more than $150 million a year to implement.\n\nThe requirements the officers disliked most involved conducting face-to-face reviews of high-risk IT projects and reviews of entire agency IT portfolios as well as updates on their data centers.\n\nRelated: This Tech Flop Is Hurting Our Student Loans Programs\n\nFor its part, the GAO said it was concerned the tech officers didn\u2019t see the value of reporting information that it said was \u201cessential\u201d to overhauling the government\u2019s IT systems.\n\n\u201cEstablishing a common understanding between OMB and CIOs on the priority of these initiatives and their related reporting requirements will help ensure their success,\u201d the auditors said.\n\nThe auditors also said the OMB has already attempted to streamline the requirements, such as changing reporting formats from narratives to performance data.\n\nHowever, they suggested the OMB should further streamline the requirements, as they haven\u2019t addressed all the issues the tech officers raised in the survey. One of the main concerns of tech officers is the need to use multiple online tools to report information. \u201cBy not addressing these challenges, OMB is missing opportunities to help CIOs improve the requirements reporting process and its use of information collected to effectively manage and oversee federal IT,\u201d the GAO said.\n\nRelated: The Federal Tech Mess Is Costing Taxpayers Billions\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s top tech chief, federal CIO Tony Scott, disputed the GAO survey\u2019s conclusions, saying many agency tech officers had lower-level staffers fill out the survey. He said in some cases the officers didn\u2019t know anything about the survey.\n\n\u201cWe have found no evidence in GAO\u2019s report that the lower-level staff who completed a number of these surveys are organizationally well-positioned and experienced enough to provide knowledgeable estimates of the cost of reporting requirements,\u201d Scott said. \u201cFor these reasons, we do not believe costs estimated in the report are reliable.\u201d\n\nThe GAO didn\u2019t seem to buy Scott\u2019s point: Auditors said they\u2019d informed all the information officers they would be responsible for the survey results, regardless of whether they had their staffs complete it.\n\nAside from HealthCare.gov\u2019s infamous troubled launch last year, a number of other agencies have also struggled to modernize their systems\u2014including the Veterans Affairs Department and the Defense Department. They\u2019ve both spent billions trying to update their electronic health reporting systems.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The federal government is in the process of overhauling its massive IT infrastructure", "title": "CTOs Say Onerous Reporting Practices Threaten Federal IT Reform", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/05/CTOs-Say-Onerous-Reporting-Practices-Threaten-Federal-IT-Reform", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11262013_Server_Room_Crybaby.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/05/CTOs-Say-Onerous-Reporting-Practices-Threaten-Federal-IT-Reform", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/11262013_Server_Room_Crybaby.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The federal government is in the process of overhauling its massive IT infrastructure", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb738\"", "article_summary": "Now a GAO report finds that agency tech chiefs aren\u2019t thrilled about the reporting requirements they have to follow to document their reform efforts.\nThe majority think at least two-thirds of the reporting requirements are more tedious than helpful.\nOne of the main concerns of tech officers is the need to use multiple online tools to report information.\nRelated: The Federal Tech Mess Is Costing Taxpayers BillionsThe Obama administration\u2019s top tech chief, federal CIO Tony Scott, disputed the GAO survey\u2019s conclusions, saying many agency tech officers had lower-level staffers fill out the survey.\nThe GAO surveyed tech officers at 24 of the largest federal agencies."}
