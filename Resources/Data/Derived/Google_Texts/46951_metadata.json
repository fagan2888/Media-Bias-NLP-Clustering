Second, the fact that polarization has been asymmetric, turning the GOP into an insurrectionary anti-government party, even when in power. They wrote:\n\nThe Republican Party has become an insurgent outlier \u2014 ideologically extreme; contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime; scornful of compromise; unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.\n\nDespite overwhelming historical data showing asymmetrical polarization in Congress (more recent additions here), their argument did not convince the anecdote-obsessed Beltway pundit class, with its deep belief that \u201cboth sides do it,\u201d no matter what \u201cit\u201d may be. It\u2019s true there are \u201cextremists on both sides,\u201d but as this Wonk Blog post showed, the percentage of non-centrist Republicans skyrocketed from under 10 percent in the Ford years (less than Democrats) to almost 90 percent today, while the Democratic percentage has stayed basically flat [chart]. What\u2019s more, in the last session (2013-2014), the data shows that 147 House Republicans \u2014 more than half the caucus \u2014 were more ideologically extreme than the most extreme Democrat in the House. There is simply no comparison between the two parties. Asymmetric polarization is not only real, it\u2019s one of the most dominant facts of American politics today.\n\nBut it\u2019s a fact that \u201cbalanced\u201d journalism has to ignore. To admit that the political world isn\u2019t balanced would shake their whole belief system to its core. And yet, the shaking seems to have begun. As dysfunction in the GOP has reached new heights, not just threatening America and the global economy, but the party itself (both in Congress and the presidential race), the power of that denial may have begun breaking down, as Republican politicians are now criticizing their own party for what it has become, with conservative pundits like David Brooks castigating the GOP for its \u201cright-wing radicalism.\u201d\n\nSo it was only natural for Bloomberg View to engage in an email Q&A with Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein, \u201cRepublicans Gone Wild,\u201d bringing their perspective to bear on where things stand today.\n\nOrnstein first pointed out that the current state of crisis \u2014 both in Congress and in the presidential primary \u2014 had predictable roots in past strategic moves, heedlessly initiated by party leaders who were now reaping the whirlwind. This basically reverses the order of causation proposed by critics, like Chris Cillizza, who argued that GOP congressmembers were simply following the spontaneous rightward movement of the folks back home:\n\nThe fact is that the \u201cYoung Guns\u201d \u2014 Eric Cantor, Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan, as we wrote early on in the book \u2014 actively incited anger and raised expectations among populist Tea Party adherents when they went out in 2009-2010 and recruited candidates to run in the midterms. They told them to use the debt ceiling as an issue and to promise to bludgeon Obama with it to force him to his knees, to repeal Obamacare and cut government dramatically. They promised that if they took the majority they would immediately cut spending by $100 billion.\n\nOf course, the American political system doesn\u2019t work like that. Parliamentary systems do. But not presidential ones. For folks calling themselves \u201cconstitutional conservatives\u201d this was a pretty fundamental moment of \u201cOops!\u201d Continuing:\n\nThat led to the debt limit debacle in 2011, when they finally backed down at the brink \u2014 after Jason Chaffetz, whom we quote in the book, led the charge to take the country over. And the promise of $100 billion in spending cuts went unfulfilled. The combination of empty threats and unfulfilled promise, amplified by tribal media and social media, has created both a broad public anger at Republican establishment leaders among more radical Tea Party voters, and a seething anger among the 40 to 50 most radical House members at their own leaders for their fecklessness.\n\nThe wild promises that the \u201cYoung Guns\u201d made played a key role (along with outside groups and money) in winning GOP House control in 2010, but they were always utterly unrealistic \u2014 a minor detail that no one inside GOP leadership seemed to notice or care about at the time. One could argue that after 30 years of supply-side, trickle-down mumbo-jumbo they\u2019d become completely adapted to living in fantasyland. How were they to know that this time they\u2019d be getting their fair share of the resulting pain? (An early 2014 report concluded that \u201clurching from government breakdown to breakdown\u201d had already significantly damaged the U.S. economy, resulting in an additional 750,000 unemployed.)\n\nAfter that, Mann added:\n\nNorm\u2019s response underscores the reality of asymmetric polarization, which the mainstream media and most good government groups have avoided discussing \u2014 at great costs to the country. [Emphasis added.] As we wrote, Republicans have become more an insurgency than a major political party capable of governing. Their actions in Congress in recent weeks and on the presidential campaign trail underscore this reality.\n\nBut I would go even farther than Mann regarding the media. Their stubborn adherence to a false balance narrative has, ironically, become an integral part of the GOP\u2019s relentless rightward push. By talking about \u201cgovernment dysfunction\u201d instead of \u201cRepublican obstruction,\u201d the media actively helps the most extreme anti-government Republicans thwart any efforts at competent governance and it helps promote their \u201cgovernment is horrible\u201d worldview. It normalizes the abnormal, even the bizarre.\n\nThere was once a penalty for becoming too politically extreme: one\u2019s actions would be characterized as unrealistic, destructive, heedless of past experience, etc. Sometimes this was justified, sometimes not (as with the Civil Rights movement). But right or wrong, this media practice inhibited radical movements in either direction. For quite some time now, however, conservative Republicans have realized that by moving right and attacking the media for any criticism, they can turn the media into a tacit ally, forcing them to treat preposterous claims as serious ideas, or even proven facts. Thus, when they were planning to force a government shutdown, a key part of their strategy was spinning the media with a preposterous argument that it was the Democrats who were shutting down the government, even though, as the New York Times reported, the shutdown plan traced back to a meeting early in President Obama\u2019s second term, led by former Attorney General Edwin R.
