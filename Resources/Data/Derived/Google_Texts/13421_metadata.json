I see firsthand how coding nurtures both analytical and creative minds.\n\nBut coding is not a silver bullet.\n\nThe easy way to show support for coding in schools would be to announce some sort of poorly thought out and rash Universal Coding Initiative.\n\nWhile that kind of initiative would get great press and would likely include 6-foot, cardboard checks from area business partners \u2014 it would be the opposite of what is working now, and it would be the opposite of what Nashville\u2019s students, teachers, and tech companies need.\n\nThe Academy model in our high schools has given school principals and leaders the autonomy to choose focus areas within their building.\n\nHigh schools, middle schools, and even elementary schools are using clubs and after-school programs to create new opportunities for students.\n\nThe student-based budgeting model that Metro Nashville Public Schools Interim Superintendent Chris Henson and his team developed is a step toward pushing the control of more dollars to the school level \u2014 where educators have deep understanding of students\u2019 unique needs.\n\nWhen schools \u2014 and the high-performing teachers and administrators that run them \u2014 are given the ability to choose the programming that their students need, we open the door to great things.\n\nWe allow them to architect new, bright futures and we empower students to work in fields with high earning potential, doing what they love.\n\nLike at Maplewood High School, where students are using HTML and CSS instruction as a stepping stone to drone research for Nashville Electric Service, and supporting the company in using drones to assess problems with electrical lines.\n\nAt Hunters Lane, where students in the Griffin Academy of Design and Technology learn to write Java\u2014and earn college credit for doing it.\n\nAnd at Nashville Academy of Computer Science, where every high school student graduates with some understanding of how to code, because \u2014 in the words of Steve Jobs \u2014 \u201cit teaches you how to think.\u201d\n\nAnd this is just to name a few\u2014 Eakin Elementary, Rocketship, KIPP Nashville, Overton High School, and more are all working independently to teach kids to code.\n\nEach program plays to the strengths and interests of their team.\n\nA universal approach to coding in schools may score quick publicity points now, but the long-term implications are scary: More responsibilities for teachers, less flexibility for funds controlled at the school level, and limited opportunities to develop NEW good ideas.\n\nMandates, standardizations, top-down directives, and \u201cuniversal\u201d solutions are how bureaucrats operate. Not innovators.\n\nInstead of a universal coding initiative, support educators who build upon their strengths and passions to ignite a love of learning within their students. Support the innovation happening within our public schools.\n\nYes, coding in schools is a good idea. But there are plenty of other ideas around advanced technologies that we need to explore and nurture.\n\nThings like robotics, alternative energy, hardware and circuit boards, bio-engineering, artificial intelligence, or any number of other advanced technologies that will be in high demand for tomorrow\u2019s workforce.\n\nToo many times we have taken a good idea and ruined it with standardization and a top-down approach. Just ask any area teacher if they feel there are too many district initiatives.\n\nAsk if they have time to plan and develop new programs that align with the interests of their students. Ask if they want to start teaching coding.\n\nCoding in schools is a good idea. Don\u2019t screw it up by treating it like the only good idea.\n\nJackson Miller is a parent of students in the Metro Nashville Public Schools and CEO of L2M LLC.
