Instead, teachers should be implementing techniques that include students in the process.\n\nSo many of us have sat through a boring lecture in a giant auditorium able to fit hundreds of students. Hearing a professor drawl on about physics, geology, or chemistry, barely involving the students in the lecture; it makes sense why so many students end up dropping out, failing, or falling asleep during class. These teaching methods don\u2019t work, and it\u2019s time to implement new, inclusive techniques.\n\nA new study from Scott Freeman, a biology lecturer (the irony!) at the University of Washington, Seattle, shows how ineffective lecture classes are when it comes to students\u2019 grades. It found that students who actively participated in class did way better than their lectured counterparts. \u201cThe biggest surprise for us was the magnitude of the effect, especially on failure rates,\u201d Freeman said in a press release.\n\nFreeman\u2019s meta-analysis of 225 other studies found that students who took part in an active-learning classroom scored a letter grade one-third higher than those who sat through lectures. When it came to failing grades, however, the effect was obvious. Students who sat through lectures were 55 percent more likely to receive a D or F, or to withdraw from the course altogether, when compared to those who participated in active learning. These findings held true no matter the class size.\n\n\u201cThe average letter grade increases by only one-third, but the decreased failure rate is substantial,\u201d said Rory Waterman, a chemistry professor at the University of Vermont, in the release. \u201cActive-learning environments do not necessarily turn students into experts, but they help everyone perform better.\u201d Though Waterman was not involved in the study, she advocates for active-learning techniques.\n\nOne such technique emphasized in the study was the use of clickers, which are devices that the students use to respond to questions, among other things. For example, students can respond to a professor\u2019s multiple-choice question, and the answers will then appear as a bar chart showing how many students chose each one. Other ways to involve students in the learning process include group exercises, dramatic presentations, creating personal connections to the material, and building a sense of community in the classroom.\n\nGetting it right is important, though. \u201cYou can goof it up if you don\u2019t do it right,\u201d Freeman said about professors, noting that clickers can be misused. \u201cThere\u2019s a literature on how to use clickers effectively. People [who] have never read any of those papers. They\u2019re just doing it off the cuff. For a scientists or engineer who\u2019s trained to respect and act on it, it\u2019s just horrifying.\u201d\n\nThe findings will most likely not change teaching practices. But for any professor or teacher who is passionate about what they do, it adds to a growing body of evidence that inclusive, active learning is the best way to pass knowledge.\n\nSource: Freeman S, Eddy S, Jordt H, et al.
