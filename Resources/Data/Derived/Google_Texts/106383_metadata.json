In a question-and-answer session with Slavitt, PhRMA board member and Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier joked that he was going to ask about \"the elephant in the room.\"\n\n\"As you can imagine, people have a great deal of concern about the proposal,\" Frazier said, adding that he has heard many of those concerns while walking around the conference that day.\n\nSlavitt stressed that the plan was still in the early stages, and that the agency would be soliciting feedback for several months.\n\nAnd the quote of the day from Slavitt? \"This is America, we want our cake and eat it too.
