JOHANNESBURG--Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS.JO), the world's top producer of the precious metal, beat expectations for its interim earnings on Monday.

The Johannesburg-listed miner reported net revenue of 29.85 billion South African rand ($2.41 billion) for the first six months of 2015, up 7.2% from the corresponding period a year earlier, when the company was hit by a five month-long strike--South Africa's longest ever.

Amplats, a majority-owned unit of globally diversified miner Anglo American PLC (AAL.LN), reported headline earnings of R9.46 per share for the six months ended June 30, up from 60 rand cents per share during the same period in 2014, in line with the company's previously announced guidance.

The company's earnings were boosted by higher metal output. Refined platinum production rose 35% to 820,500 ounces during the first half of 2015.
