Since his announcement last week, he\u2019s shot to the top of the pack, though.\n\nKrauthammer has called Rubio \u201cthe most knowledgeable and fluent current contender\u201d on foreign policy, and Hayes has labeled him \u201cthe best communicator in the Republican party and probably in American politics today.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Kristol seemed giddy over the prospect that Republicans had the opportunity to buck history and nominate a fresh new face for a party that he said typically nominates \u201cthe presumptive heir.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis year, Democrats are falling in line, really to an extraordinary degree, I think, behind Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonOvernight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns Clinton\u2019s email troubles deepen Wasserman Schultz fights to keep her job MORE who lost eight years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it's Republicans who seem to have an appetite for someone new and different. So, we're ready for Marco.\u201d\n\nScott Walker\n\nThe pundits also look favorably on the Wisconsin governor\u2019s likely candidacy.\n\nKrauthammer, Will and Hayes have all said Walker is either tied with Rubio or just slightly behind him as the candidate with the best odds of becoming the party\u2019s standard-bearer.\n\nIn a February interview on \u201cThe Laura Ingraham Show,\u201d Will gushed over Walker, calling him a \u201cpure Reagan-ite\u201d who showed guts in his recall fight and who will reap the rewards from the donor community because of it.\n\nKrauthammer has said Walker has \u201cthe attributes you\u2019d want for this kind of race,\u201d arguing in a February appearance on Fox News that he can appeal to both the Tea Party and establishment wings of the party.\n\nStill, the pundits seem wary of Walker\u2019s early foray into the field, citing some early missteps as evidence he may not be ready for the rigors of a presidential campaign.\n\nWalker has been criticized for changing positions on ethanol subsidies and immigration, for firing a staffer who was critical of the Iowa caucuses, for comparing Wisconsin union demonstrators to the Islamic State and for flubbing questions on evolution and President Obama\u2019s patriotism.\n\nGoldberg wrote a column called, \u201cIs Walker ready for prime time?,\u201d in which he stated that the notion the Wisconsin governor is in over his head is \u201crapidly becoming conventional wisdom.\u201d\n\nKristol compared Walker\u2019s early blunders to \u201cspring training\u2026when a player is learning a new position.\u201d\n\nKrauthammer said the missteps could be overcome, calling them, \u201cRookie mistakes, easily forgotten \u2014 if he learns from them.\"\n\nJeb Bush\n\nThe former Florida governor is falling flat with conservative pundits.\n\nThey generally agree his intentions are good, but that he\u2019s the wrong person to represent the party in 2016 and maybe the worst candidate to take on Hillary Clinton in the general election.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way there will be a Bush-Clinton race in 2016,\u201d Kristol said in 2014.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only Republican candidate who would make the Clinton name an asset for Hillary, not a liability,\u201d Goldberg wrote in a column called \u201cJeb Bush is not the GOP\u2019s ideal \u2018change\u2019 candidate.\u201d\n\nHayes predicted that Bush\u2019s early fundraising success wouldn\u2019t be enough to push him across the finish line, saying on Fox News that the \u201cgrassroots conservatives will have a lot to say about this before this is over.\u201d\n\nAnd Krauthammer has openly bashed Bush for the now infamous remark that some immigrants come to the country illegally \u201cas an act of love,\u201d calling the comment \u201cbizarre.\u201d\n\nWill seems the most open to Bush, calling him \u201cthe most conservative governor of a large state since Ronald Reagan\u201d and defending Bush\u2019s stance on immigration.\n\nBut for Will, Common Core is a bridge too far.\n\n\u201cUnless stopped now, the federal government will not stop short of finding in Common Core a pretext for becoming a national school board,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf Bush does not see the pertinence of this\u2026he should not be put in charge of the executive branch.\u201d\n\nRand Paul Rand PaulOvernight Defense: VA chief 'deeply' regrets Disney remark; Senate fight brews over Gitmo Paul ties release of 9/11 docs to defense bill Will Ted Cruz let it go? MORE\n\nUnfortunately for the libertarian-leaning Kentucky Senator, major conservative pundits hew closely to the hawkish wing of the party.\n\nKrauthammer has said Paul is \u201cclosest to Obama on his view of foreign policy,\u201d and Hayes has written an op-ed on Paul\u2019s foreign policy called \u201cRand Just Doesn\u2019t Understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think Rand Paul is totally overrated as a 2016 possibility,\u201d said Kristol, who is one of the party\u2019s most influential defense hawks. \u201cThe media loves him because he takes a couple of liberal views, publicizes them in an incoherent way. I predict Rand Paul will get fewer votes than his father [former Texas Rep. Ron Paul] got in 2012.\u201d\n\nEven those who aren\u2019t outright hostile to Paul over his foreign policy say his national security stances will cost him politically. Goldberg has sought to parse Paul\u2019s views, saying there\u2019s a difference between being an \u201cisolationist,\u201d which he argues Paul is not, and a \u201cnon-interventionist,\u201d which he said is a better description of the Kentucky senator.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the political ground has just caved in beneath him,\u201d Goldberg said.\n\nOther pundits have expressed admiration of Paul for his willingness to speak bluntly or take difficult positions on a range of issues that many politicians shun, like criminal sentencing reform and drug laws.\n\nHowever, others are skeptical there\u2019s political payoff.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to base his campaign on groups that don\u2019t often vote Republican or vote at all; particularly youth,\u201d wrote Will.\n\nTed Cruz Ted CruzEleven states sue Obama over transgender bathroom directive Poll: Clinton leads Trump in Wisconsin by double digits GOP senators propose sending ISIS fighters to Gitmo MORE\n\nThe Texas senator\u2019s problems among pundits are similar to Paul. Still, they say to watch out for Cruz, arguing that the Tea Party favorite could surprise a lot of people with support from grassroots conservatives.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz has one great advantage: He's very much underestimated, his chances considerably underrated,\u201d Kristol tweeted.\n\nSimilarly, Hayes has said Cruz is \u201cunderestimated by mainstream journalists and the mainstream Republican establishment and the very reasons that they are skeptical of his ability to do well are the reasons that he will do well or will be a formidable candidate in the Republican primary.\u201d\n\nBut they say Cruz\u2019s penchant for mayhem in the Senate and thin legislative record calls into question why he\u2019s even running.\n\nKrauthammer speaks highly of Rubio, another first-term senator, but bashes Cruz \u2014 who has been in the Senate just four years \u2014 as inexperienced.\n\n\u201cCruz talks, but you have to \u2018walk the walk\u2019 rather than just talk the talk,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cYou have to have done something. But that\u2019s not his record in the Senate.\u201d\n\nGoldberg says that Cruz has a \u201cpalpable disdain for the consensus-building and glad-handing that these processes require,\u201d while Will has disputed Cruz\u2019s claim that there is a silent majority of evangelicals who have been on the sidelines awaiting a true conservative candidate.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to nominate Cruz in order to make the GOP conservative,\u201d he wrote.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "On newspaper pages and online, the pundit primary is heating up in the Republican Party.", "description": "On newspaper pages and online, the pundit primary is heating up in the Republican Party.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "On newspaper pages and online, the pundit primary is heating up in the Republican Party.", "title": "Marco Rubio takes early edge in Republican pundit primary", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/240047-marco-rubio-takes-early-edge-in-gop-pundit-primary", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/marcorubio_022715gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/240047-marco-rubio-takes-early-edge-in-gop-pundit-primary", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-26T14:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Jessica Taylor", "author": "Jonathan Easley", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-26T14:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Hillary Clinton, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/240047-marco-rubio-takes-early-edge-in-gop-pundit-primary", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "On newspaper pages and online, the pundit primary is heating up in the Republican Party.", "card": "summary", "title": "Marco Rubio takes early edge in Republican pundit primary"}, "dcterms.title": "Marco Rubio takes early edge in Republican pundit primary"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd128c\"", "article_summary": "On newspaper pages and online, the pundit primary is heating up in the Republican Party.\n\u201cIf there's a winner tonight, it's the Senator from Florida, Marco Rubio,\u201d Will said on Nov. 4, 2012.\n\u201cThere is no need to nominate Cruz in order to make the GOP conservative,\u201d he wrote.\nJeb BushThe former Florida governor is falling flat with conservative pundits.\nMOREUnfortunately for the libertarian-leaning Kentucky Senator, major conservative pundits hew closely to the hawkish wing of the party."}
