The age of the plants range from 45 to 65 years-old. The plants are being closed by Xcel Energy and Black Hills Energy.\n\nThe Xcel plant closures are part of the Clean Air-Clean Jobs Act, which gave the utility accelerated cost recovery for closing the plants as part of a plan to improve Front Range air quality.\n\nMeanwhile, SNL reports that more than 150 coal mines were idle in 2013 as the markets \u2014 both domestic and export \u2014 weakened.\n\n\n\nProduction data from the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration shows that mines idled in the first half of 2013 produced a combined 11.4 million tons of coal in 2012.\n\nSix of the 10 largest mines idled during the first half of the year were in Central Appalachia. If you look at the power plant closure map and the mine closure map you\u2019ll see a tight fit. Though the truth is that Appalachia coal was already being displaced by Wyoming Powder River Basin coal \u2014 which is now more than 40 percent of eastern supplies.\n\nAppalachian coal is just too expensive. But even out West coal production is dispressed. In Colorado 2012 output was down about 20 percent and at the last federal lease sale for Powder River coal there was no bidder. Cloud Peak Energy, the largest Wyoming miner, balked at an offer.\n\n\u201cWe carefully evaluated the estimated economics of this LBA in light of current market conditions and the uncertainty caused by the current political and regulatory environment towards coal and coal-powered generation and ultimately decided it was prudent not to bid at this time,\u201d Colin Marshall, Cloud Peak\u2019s chief executive officer, said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "air quality,coal,electricity,mines,utilities", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Balance Sheet", "description": "Coal-fired power plants and coal mines are going down across the U.S., according to SNL Financial analyses.\r\n\r\nFacing tougher federal health-based standards for mercury emissions in 2015, utility companies have been steadily shuttering coal-fired units, with 8,800 megawatts permanently closed in 2012 and another 5,781 project to be closed this year.
