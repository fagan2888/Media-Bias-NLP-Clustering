And the Rockies can live with this one.\n\nNick Hundley extended his hitting streak to 12 games Sunday with an RBI single off Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather have a 12-game winning streak,\u201d Hundley said.\n\nThe veteran catcher is batting .415 in his career-best hitting streak, which includes two home runs, a triple and three doubles. His eight RBIs over that span account for 17 percent of the Rockies\u2019 runs.\n\n\u201cI feel comfortable at the plate. I\u2019m swinging at the pitches I want to swing at,\u201d Hundley said. \u201cIf the results come, they come. But I\u2019m in a place I want to be.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Paige: The curse of Monfort is ruining the Colorado Rockies\n\nMiami\u2019s Dee Gordon has a 13-game hitting streak after going 2-for-4 against the Giants on Sunday. Gordon and Dodgers third baseman Juan Uribe have the longest hitting streaks this year.\n\nHundley said he received a phone call from Rockies hitting coach Blake Doyle soon after signing with the team in January. Doyle helped Hundley fine-tune his mechanics as a hitter.\n\n\u201cHe had some really good ideas for me,\u201d Hundley said.\n\nHundley\u2019s hit against Kershaw, a three-time National League Cy Young Award winner, was perhaps his most difficult.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get very many mistakes when he\u2019s out there,\u201d said Hundley, who is hitting .342 overall.\n\nMakeup set. The Rockies-Dodgers game Saturday, which was rained out, will be played June 2 at 1 p.m. as part of a split doubleheader at Coors Field.\n\nTickets from Saturday are valid for that makeup game, or ticket holders can exchange for another home game.\n\nFootnotes. LaTroy Hawkins, on the disabled list since April 22 with right biceps tendinitis, will need at least one minor-league rehab appearance before returning, Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u2026 Eddie Butler, who was hit in the shin by a line drive Friday, said his swollen leg is fine and he won\u2019t miss a start. \u2026 The Orioles claimed right-handed reliever Jorge Rondon off waivers. The Rockies designated him for assignment May 2. Nick Groke, The Denver Post\n\nLooking ahead\n\nMonday: Off\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Kyle Kendrick (1-4, 8.73 ERA) at Angels\u2019 C.J.
