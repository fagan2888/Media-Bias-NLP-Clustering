Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy has now appealed a ruling by an Appeals Court that Vincent Smothers must be allowed to testify on behalf of Davontae Sanford, to the Michigan Supreme Court.

Click on link above to hear an interview with Taminko Sanford-Tilmon, mother of Davontae Sanford, who languishes in prison more than five years after he was induced, at the age of 14, to give a false confession in the drug-house murders of four people. Another man, Vincent Smothers, a confessed professional hit man, admitted to the murders and is willing to testify in the case, but Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy and Circuit Court Judge Brian Sullivan have fought his testimony every inch of the way. An appeals court ruled that the testimony of Smothers and his attorney must be allowed, and remanded the case to Sullivan, but the Prosecutor has now appealed that decision to the Michigan Supreme Court.

The interview includes original rap songs about Davontaeâ€™s case and the plight of other Black youth in Detroit and across the U.S.
