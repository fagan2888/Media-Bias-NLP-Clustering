People talk about Boston, [but] you\u2019ve got to be kidding me. LA was the worst place I\u2019ve ever been in during those particular times.\u201d\n\nMaxwell, who played eight seasons with the Celtics (1977-85), echoed that point.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Boston has a monopoly on racism in the United States, but the perception is that Boston is the most racist around and that\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\n\nThe stigma is tied to protests and rioting after the court-ordered desegregation of Boston\u2019s public schools, which was carried out by forced busing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe violence was crystalized in an historic photo snapped in 1976 of a black man being attacked on City Hall Plaza by a white anti-busing protester who wielded an American flag.\n\nRandy Auerbach, the daughter of Celtics\u2019 patriarch Red Auerbach, recalled that photo as she reflected on the city.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in D.C., which was predominantly a black city . . . I came to college in Boston thinking it was a very liberal town . . . and knowing that only because the Celtics essentially were integrated and a special team,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt never occurred to me that the city was so segregated and racist. And I remember that photo. I left college [in Boston]. I went back to D.C. because it was so alienating from what I had come from.\u201d\n\nShe said her father was aware of the Boston\u2019s perception as a racist city.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t talk about it a lot,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I know it left him with a very heavy heart, because he hated injustice, in any sense, in any area.\u201d\n\nSanders, who played for the Celtics from 1960-73, said it\u2019s often lost in the discussion that the Celtics were the first NBA team to draft an African-American player (Chuck Cooper in 1950); were the first NBA team to have an all-black starting lineup, and were the first team to have a black head coach (Bill Russell).\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, there was an awful lot of ignorance out there, and unfortunately, I\u2019m talking about my family members, friends, neighbors \u2014 people who obviously could not see and clearly did not believe what they read,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\u201cI spent all these years talking to these people about when I was in Boston, [and] on that particular team, in that particular organization, we had at a minimum of four black players when the rest of the league had maybe one on each team, maybe two.\n\n\u201cSo here you\u2019re talking about an organization that had so many firsts, and not only that, the firsts were not involved with a matter of numbers; it was a matter of [Red] Auerbach saying, \u2018I want to win every game, and since I want to win every game, I want the best players out there that can take me to that particular goal.\u2019\u201d\n\nSanders said he also heard the perception that the 1980s Celtics were known as Larry Bird\u2019s team because Bird was white.\n\n\u201cAll of the people, and in particular far too many blacks, kept saying to me, \u2018Satch, Larry Bird?\u2019 \u201d Sanders said. \u201cI said, wait a minute. Do they really expect the Boston Celtics to turn away from one of the best players to play the game and say, \u2018You\u2019re white and can play, but we won\u2019t take you.\u2019 I\u2019ve never heard such ignorance, and I spent a whole lot of years in the NBA, listening to guys talk that talk, players talk that talk.\u201d\n\nMaxwell agreed that white athletes received the benefit of the doubt more often than black athletes, and he pointed out that Russell only recently received a statue last year while other white Boston professional sports stars have had statues for years.\n\n\u201cBut again, I think that could be in any city,\u201d Maxwell added.\n\nMaxwell also referenced Clippers owner Donald Sterling, whose racist remarks were caught on tape, leading to his ouster and worldwide outrage.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, what Donald Sterling says [and] has been saying, don\u2019t be surprised or foolish enough to think that some other owners might not have said that or, on the counter side of that, that black players haven\u2019t said that about white owners,\u201d Maxwell said.\n\n\u201cPeople want to say, \u2018Oh, Donald Sterling is the only one who has ever said that.\u2019 Well, he\u2019s the only one who has been caught saying that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.467649363", "eomportal-id": 613387, "description": "Former Celtics stars Tom \u201cSatch\u201d Sanders and Cedric Maxwell have long heard remarks that the city they played in was one of the most racist \u2014 if not the most racist \u2014 in the country, especially during Boston\u2019s busing crisis in the 1970s and \u201980s.
