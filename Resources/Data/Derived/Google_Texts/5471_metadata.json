Fix this place. Let's make this place cleaner,'\" Patrick Kegin, chief patient experience officer at Citrus Valley Health Partners told HealthyCal.\n\n\"We need to establish hospital environments that work. If we do that, it benefits the patients,\" he said.\n\nIn the most recent HCAHPS surveys, the article reports that about three quarters of patients in California said their nurses always communicated well. Slightly fewer said their room and bathroom were always clean and about half reported that the area around their room was always quiet at night. Responses in all three areas in the HCAHPS tool were below the national average.\n\nBut hospitals are seeing improvements. Baljeet Sangha, chief experience officer at San Francisco General Hospital, told HealthyCal that since the organization installed devices to monitor the volume of conversation and other work-related noise, patient satisfaction over nighttime noise has doubled between April and June, Sangha said.\n\nFor more:\n\n- read the HealthyCal article\n\n- check out the California Healthline article\n\n- here are the national HCAHPS scores\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nDoes HCAHPS help or hurt?\n\nPatient experience: The wild card in reimbursements\n\nHospitals target patient experience ahead of reform\n\nWhat patients want in a hospital\n\nBetter patient satisfaction comes from hospital staff\n\nAre high-end hotel amenities a waste of money?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unhappy with their state-wide patient satisfaction scores, hospitals in California are launching new initiatives aimed to make patients and staff happier--and boost federal reimbursements linked to the scores.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Unhappy with their state-wide patient satisfaction scores, hospitals in California are launching new initiatives aimed to make patients and staff happier--and boost federal reimbursements linked to the scores.", "title": "California hospitals amp up customer service to boost HCAHPS scores, reimbursement", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/california-hospitals-amp-customer-service-boost-hcahps-scores-reimbursement/2013-09-23", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems (HCAHPS),Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Experience,patient satisfaction,staff satisfaction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97c2\"", "article_summary": "Unhappy with their state-wide patient satisfaction scores, hospitals in California are launching new initiatives aimed to make patients and staff happier--and boost federal reimbursements linked to the scores.\nLet's make this place cleaner,'\" Patrick Kegin, chief patient experience officer at Citrus Valley Health Partners told HealthyCal.\nFor more:- read the HealthyCal article- check out the California Healthline article- here are the national HCAHPS scoresRelated Articles:Does HCAHPS help or hurt?\nPatient experience: The wild card in reimbursementsHospitals target patient experience ahead of reformWhat patients want in a hospitalBetter patient satisfaction comes from hospital staffAre high-end hotel amenities a waste of money?\nIn the most recent HCAHPS surveys, the article reports that about three quarters of patients in California said their nurses always communicated well."}
