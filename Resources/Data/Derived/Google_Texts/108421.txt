A who’s who in Colorado’s political and legal worlds showed up Friday night to give retiring Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Bender a proper send off.

“I loved the evening,” Bender said afterward.

Legislators praised the judge, saying he really reached out and listened after assuming the top position on the court. And Bender was even serenaded by three judges singing “Hey, Mike Bender” (more on that later).

Bender retired from the job he loved on Tuesday, his 72nd birthday. The Colorado constitution mandates that judicial officers retire at 72.

The party was held in the lobby of the Ralph Carr Judicial Center, the new home of the Supreme Court and the attorney general, which opened in December 2012.

Among those present: Attorney General John Suthers; Rep. Beth McCann, D-Denver, who at one time was chair of the House Judiciary Committee; former Chief Justice Mary Mullarkey and Robert Hyatt, who just retired as chief judge of the Denver District Court. He joked it was rough getting back into a suit and tie again.

The highlight of the night came when state court administrator Jerry Marroney called Court of Appeal judges James Casebolt, Diana Terry and Rich Gabriel to the stage to serenade the retired chief with “Hey, Mike Bender” a la “Hey, Big Spender.” The party-goers loved the song, which noted that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor dedicated the Ralph Carr building.

Hey Mike Bender
