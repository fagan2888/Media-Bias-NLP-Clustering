Middletown Press USDA Undersecretary Kevin Concannon discusses federal programs addressing food insecurity in the nation at Middlesex Community College in Middletown.\n\nMIDDLETOWN >> In the ongoing effort to end hunger, a state coalition is partnering with the medical community to bring an end to food insecurity.\n\nUSDA Undersecretary Kevin Concannon said at a conference Friday held at Middlesex Community College that, short of the Great Depression, the nation has never needed programs to provide food to underprivileged communities than ever before.\n\nAlthough Concannon applauded Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro on her advocacy and championing of federal aid, he said the state is 46th in the nation in providing school breakfast programs to children in need.\n\n\u201cBreakfast is one of the strongest interventions we can provide,\u201d Concannon said, at The Connecticut Food Policy Council\u2019s workshop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nState hospitals, food policy councils, public health experts, medical professionals and other community-based organizations heard from leading national experts on the subject of \u201cHospital-Community Collaboration for Community Health: Expanding Access to Nutritious Foods.\u201d\n\nAccording to Concannon, breakfast has a positive impact on focus and academic performance, but also factors into attendance.\n\nSeveral speakers acknowledged that, as the food budget dwindles at the end of every month, there are higher rates of hospitalizations for things like hypoglecemia and diabetes.\n\nConcannon said the summer is also when children are most likely to go hungry, as 21 million children receive free or reduced meals during the school year, and only 4 million receive those services over the summer.\n\nMarydale DeBor, founder of Fresh Advantage, said including the medical community in discussions of food insecurity is exceptionally important, as there is a corrolation between poor nutrition and risk factors for several illnesses.\n\nSeth Berkowitz, a faculty member at Massachusetts General Hospital, said food insecurity is strongly correlated with HIV treatment nonadherance and diabetes treatment nonadherance.\n\nJudith Felton, coordinator of the Center for Civic Engagement and a professor at the college said food insecurity is an issue that affects many at the school, with many students coming from underserved populations or being first-generation college students.\n\nSeth Berkowitz, MD, MPH, faculty member of Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital who will speak on the health impacts of food insecurity, malnutrition and population health.\n\nThe statewide meeting, the first in the nation, is in response to the Affordable Care Act and the Internal Revenue Service final ruling onnonprofit hospitals\u2019 community health needs assessment obligations allowing for issues regarding food security, and to explore opportunities to strengthen collaboration at the community level, according to a press release.\n\nOther speakers included:\n\nKim Gans, professor of Human Development and Family Studies at the University of Connecticut\n\nGemma Gorham of \u201cFresh to You\u201d Rhode Island, who spoke on their research on mobile farmers\u2019 markets\n\nKola Akindele, community relations manager at Hartford Hospital\n\nMartha Page, executive director of Hartford Food System and Chair of Hartford Advisory Council on Food Policy presentd the \u201cHartford Mobile Market,\u201d a \u201ccommunity benefit\u201d project of the hospital, in collaboration with HFS, Hartford Hispanic Council and Harvard Pilgrim HealthCare Foundation\n\nFor information, see 1.usa.gov/1QzbxzC.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Middletown news, CT news, US
