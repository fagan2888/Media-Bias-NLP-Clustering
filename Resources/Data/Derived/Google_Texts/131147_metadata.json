You hit the big 5-0 today, and we hope Angelina and the kids have something special planned.\n\nGetty Images This man needs an estate plan.\n\nOnce the celebrations are over and you\u2019ve opened that mailing offering you an AARP membership, here are five things you \u2014 like every other presumably less handsome 50-something boomer \u2014 should do:\n\nTake advantage of those 401(k) catch-ups. You can now set aside an extra $5,500 a year pretax. While that may be only a minuscule percentage of your income, it can make a big difference to how the rest of us do in retirement. Do it for 15 years, assume a compounded 5% return and it\u2019ll ad up to an extra $146,165 at age 65.\n\nIf you can set aside more pretax (and let\u2019s face it, you probably can, since Forbes says you made $25 million in 2012), here are three more options.\n\nDon\u2019t neglect your health. This is when you start with those a once-a-decade colonoscopies. But it\u2019s also a good time to plan for how to pay for long-term care \u2013 for yourself and your parents. This will be a major expense for many Americans, and whether you love or hate Obamacare, it\u2019s not stepping into this. Long-term care is only getting more expensive as life expectancies increase, yet who wants to be a burden to their kids? If you haven\u2019t yet, it\u2019s time to start pricing policies. Here are four ways to cut the cost.\n\nAnd nope, multivitamins aren\u2019t of much use for keeping you healthy.\n\nPrepare for life after work. Sure, you and Angie think you\u2019ll be be making movies for as long as you want, but boomers\u2019 plans to keep working often go awry, often for health reasons. (We won\u2019t get into age-ism in Hollywood. Or that make too many turkeys and there goes your career.) And your lifestyle, with all the travel, nannies and the rest, is pretty costly. We\u2019re not saying you\u2019ll end up like Tori Spelling, but money can run out. Have a plan.\n\nFor the rest of us, use the AARP\u2019s calculator to see if you are saving enough.\n\nHave you talked to an estate planner? Time to make sure you\u2019ve got a plan, and a financial adviser who thinks about risk like you do. And will you and Angie ever marry? Not saying you should, but if you don\u2019t, there are some financial hassles to consider in anticipation of the unhappy day when one of you dies. After all, the two of you have six kids together; you\u2019re basically a Southern Gothic melodrama waiting to happen. You can find more estate-planning advice from MarketWatch here.\n\nCome up with a plan to change the world. More prosaically, what about an encore career? We know about your Make It Right affordable-housing effort in New Orleans, which, by the way, may need some help. Even boomers without your money can do some good, or just start a different career. And moving to a university town is often part of the plan. You could always head back to Columbia, Mo., one of our best small cities to retire in, and finally get your journalism degree. Or switch to architecture.\n\nAlso on Encore:\n\nWant to take a year off?
