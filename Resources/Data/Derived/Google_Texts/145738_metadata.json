The goal: Get a case worker in touch within 24 hours to resolve the issue.\n\nThat quick response can contain damage from negative stories before it\u2019s amplified on the Internet, cable television and traditional media, said Eric Dezenhall, a crisis-communications consultant.\n\n\u201cThey do not want a motivated adversary to suddenly become a rock star attacking them at every turn,\u201d said Dezenhall, a communications aide in the Reagan White House who has since consulted for companies. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to defuse hostilities by reaching out to those who have a platform.\u201d\n\nSince Jan. 1, about 150 consumers have been identified either through traditional media or the federal insurance exchange\u2019s social media channels, including @healthcaregov on Twitter and the healthcare.gov page on Facebook, said Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the government agency that runs the federal exchange.\n\n\u2018Borderline Hysteria\u2019\n\nWhile that\u2019s only a small portion of the approximately 55,000 cases referred to the agency\u2019s casework staff between Oct. 1 and Jan. 31, the administration\u2019s damage-control effort mirrors a shift by businesses to a more rapid response when customers publicly protest.\n\n\u201cThe increasing ability for disgruntled parties to do material damage to a company\u201d is \u201ca source of borderline hysteria in boardrooms,\u201d Dezenhall said.\n\nA textbook example of how a grievance can become an online sensation is a 2009 video, \u201cUnited Breaks Guitars,\u201d that Canadian musician Dave Carroll posted on Google Inc.\u2019s YouTube chronicling his effort to get United Airlines to repair a guitar he says baggage handlers broke. It has been viewed 13.8 million times.\n\nAnother is the recent outcry over AOL Inc.\u2019s Tim Armstrong after an employee\u2019s wife wrote an online article criticizing the chief executive officer for blaming retirement-benefit cuts on the medical costs of two workers\u2019 \u201cdistressed babies.\u201d\n\nInvading Space\n\nWhile it was \u201ca novelty two or three years ago\u201d for companies to respond to individual consumer gripes aired on social media, more businesses are doing so now, said David Armano, global strategy director for Edelman Digital.\n\nThe administration is joining that trend in dealing with the flood of complaints about the health-care law.\n\nAddie Wilson, who was featured in a Feb. 3 Washington Post article, had been trying for more than a month to resolve a defect on the federal website that prevented her from receiving the subsidy to which she says she\u2019s entitled to buy insurance.\n\nWilson, who earns $22,000 a year working for a private social service agency that ended its employee coverage on Dec. 31, was discharged from a hospital in late December and told she would need gall bladder surgery in January.\n\nAfter logging on to healthcare.gov, she couldn\u2019t get the website to calculate her subsidy. She then took the call center\u2019s advice to enroll at full price and to follow up with an appeal. She said she was left paying $100 extra in monthly premiums and a deductible that was $4,000 too high.\n\nMultiple Calls\n\nWilson said when she tried to correct her policy in January she was told the system wasn\u2019t ready to make such changes.\n\nShe was home recovering from her surgery when the caseworker called. Since then, he\u2019s been in touch \u201cat least nine or 10 times,\u201d though her issue hasn\u2019t yet been resolved, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very impressed and hopeful,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI definitely feel like they are really working on it.\u201d\n\nSuch appreciation is common when grievances are taken seriously. Eighty-nine percent of customers who complained to a company and were satisfied with the response were likely to make another purchase from the business, according to 2013 survey by TARP Worldwide, an Arlington, Virginia-based consulting firm.\n\nTo be certain, unsolicited, direct contact from a private company, much less the federal government, can be startling for the recipient, especially amid revelations of massive government surveillance exposed by Edward Snowden.\n\n\u201cThe aggrieved party can feel like their personal space has been invaded,\u201d Dezenhall said.\n\nWorth Risk\n\nThat\u2019s a risk the White House is willing to take in the case of the health law, which has been besieged by an organized political opposition that has focused attention on flaws in the rollout of the online insurance marketplaces.\n\nThe Obama team has always been attuned to the power of the personal anecdote, starting with the president\u2019s 2004 national convention speech connecting his mixed-race biography to the American experience through an Obamacare social media campaign telling stories of people who gained insurance coverage through the law.\n\nStill, many people encountered some difficulties signing up for insurance. So the press staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services searches newspaper databases and checks online search engines every day to find news accounts in which someone complains about an experience they\u2019ve had, said Julie Bataille, the agency\u2019s director of communications. Officials also flag cases for follow up when reporters describe them in calls seeking comment from the agency, she said.\n\nPrivate Messages\n\nAgency officials then use publicly available information to attempt to track down contact information -- or sometimes seek it from the journalist who wrote the story -- and then pass it on to a caseworker, Bataille said.\n\nWhile in many cases, the social media team resolves issues by directing people to information online, complicated problems are referred to the casework staff, which includes about 90 full-time equivalent employees assigned to handle issues related to the online insurance exchanges.\n\nThe response to a complaint on social media usually starts with a private message to the poster\u2019s account.\n\n\u201cThe reason that we do it is to make sure that we are looking at every possible way we know to help consumers complete the enrollment process and successfully utilize the health coverage that they are now able to afford,\u201d Bataille said.\n\nFrustrated, Angry\n\nAmong the cases that have been resolved was one involving a consumer who recounted in a media story trying 14 times to enroll for January coverage; he later was allowed to complete an application for retroactive insurance. Agency staff also intervened on behalf of the father of a newborn child who vented on Twitter about being unable to add his daughter to his plan because of a snag in the system.\n\nThe out-of-the-blue phone call from a federal employee takes most people by surprise.\n\n\u201cMany people can\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting a call from the federal government,\u201d said Nancy O\u2019Connor, a casework manager for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\n\u201cNaturally, some of the people we talk to are frustrated, some are angry because they just haven\u2019t been able to get resolution to their issue.\u201d Still, she said, most are \u201cvery happy to talk to someone where they can get some help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mike Dorning", "twitter": {"description": "The day after Addie Wilson was quoted in a newspaper article complaining about her experience with President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care law, her mobile phone rang while she was in the bathroom.", "title": "Obamacare Damage-Control Teams Seek to Calm Complaints", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-13/obamacare-damage-control-teams-seek-to-calm-complaints", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWIR2H.vOhOQ/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Mike Dorning", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,Barack H Obama,Media,Social Media,Law,Tech", "news_keywords": "Health,Barack H Obama,Media,Social Media,Law,Tech", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-13/obamacare-damage-control-teams-seek-to-calm-complaints", "parsely-title": "Obamacare Damage-Control Teams Seek to Calm Complaints", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-02-13T05:01:00.010Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The day after Addie Wilson was quoted in a newspaper article complaining about her experience with President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care law, her mobile phone rang while she was in the bathroom.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Barack H Obama,Media,Social Media,Law,Tech,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-02-13T05:01:00.010Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "The day after Addie Wilson was quoted in a newspaper article complaining about her experience with President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care law, her mobile phone rang while she was in the bathroom.", "title": "Obamacare Damage-Control Teams Seek to Calm Complaints", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-02-13/obamacare-damage-control-teams-seek-to-calm-complaints", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWIR2H.vOhOQ/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "The day after Addie Wilson was quoted in a newspaper article complaining about her experience with President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care law, her mobile phone rang while she was in the bathroom."}, "parsely-post-id": "N0U76U6TTDU101", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iWIR2H.vOhOQ/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "The response to a complaint on social media usually starts with a private message to the poster\u2019s account.\nFacing an onslaught of media attention to the law\u2019s rough debut and sustained attacks by Republicans, the Obama administration is borrowing a corporate tactic and tracking down consumers who air their grievances in news reports or on social media.\nThe administration is joining that trend in dealing with the flood of complaints about the health-care law.\nThat quick response can contain damage from negative stories before it\u2019s amplified on the Internet, cable television and traditional media, said Eric Dezenhall, a crisis-communications consultant.\n\u201cI was definitely surprised and kind of shocked,\u201d said Wilson, 27, who lives in Fairmont, West Virginia."}
