The Daily Caller responded to the speech with this headline: \u201cObama fires verbs at Russian tanks.\u201d\n\nAnd what happened next was covered by the last half of Ekdahl\u2019s observation. Time Magazine political reporter Zeke Miller revealed what the president did next in respondce to this huge foreign-affairs event, tweeting:\n\nObama: This is now officially happy hour with the Democratic Party \u2014 Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) February 28, 2014\n\nYep! Right after making his milquetoast speech on the Ukrainian crisis, the president was taken to the Washington Hilton to party it up at a Democratic National Committee function.\n\nThis was quickly confirmed by CBS News White House correspondent Mark Knoller, who tweeted:\n\nShifting mood from his Ukraine statement, Pres Obama tells DNC: it\u2019s after 5PM \u2013 so it\u2019s Happy Hour with the Democratic Party. \u2014 Mark Knoller (@markknoller) February 28, 2014\n\nIn true Alfred E. Neuman style, Obama\u2019s attitude about the crisis in Europe seemed to be, \u201cWhat, me worry?\u201d After all, Biden had everything under control.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the president has appeared disengaged. Perhaps the most egregious example came after he delivered his Rose Garden speech the morning after the Benghazi attack. After blaming the slaughter of four Americans on a YouTube video, he jetted off to party it up with Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z in Las Vegas.\n\nThe good news is that we have only three years left of Obama. The bad news is that we have three years left of Obama.\n\nActor Gary Sinise treats 50 wounded warriors to Disneyland\n\nRead more tweets compiled by the Twitchy Team.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "President Obama gave yet another example Friday of just how disengaged he is when dealing with real-world problems, while exhibiting his true passion and forte \u2014 political campaigning.
