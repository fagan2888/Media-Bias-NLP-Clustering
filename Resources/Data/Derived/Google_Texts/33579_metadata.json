John McCain and Lindsey Graham, issued a joint statement late last week calling for Iraq to be bombed, all the time. The two most predictable players in American foreign policy wrote that \u201cour most immediate priority must be to reverse the advance of a terrorist force that is more radical, violent, and ambitious than Al-Qaeda. We see no way to achieve this goal without U.S. air strikes, among other military and intelligence actions and additional support for our Iraqi partners.\u201d Less thinking, more bombing: \u201cA delayed or weak response from the United States will only deepen the Iraqi government\u2019s dependence on Iran, and destroy the prospects of national reconciliation.\u201d\n\nThe senators\u2019 statement, however, elided over a real difference that\u2019s broken out between the two over how and with whom to partner in bombing exercises. Graham is actually willing to bring Iran into the fold, since the United States and Iran share a common enemy in ISIS. \u201cThe Iranians can provide some assets to make sure Baghdad doesn\u2019t fall. We need to coordinate with the Iranians,\u201d Graham said on CNN Sunday.\u201d Of course, he was savvy enough to couch this possible strategic alliance in anti-Iranian terms: He added, as Politico writes, that joining with Iran would be \u201cpartially to ensure that the Iranians do not become \u2018the biggest winner\u2019 in the Middle Eastern chaos.\u201d (Is he implying that perhaps Iran could take care of everything and the United States wouldn\u2019t have to get involved again? Let\u2019s hear more about that idea.)\n\nThe idea of partnering with Iran, meanwhile, does not go over well with McCain. He hates ISIS, he hates Iran, he hates all of them, so let\u2019s just go in there while Iran goes in separately and not even exchange a glance. On Monday the senator released his latest, very much not-co-authored-with-Lindsey Graham statement about the \u201cfolly\u201d of suggesting that two nations looking to zap the same militants in the same country could hash out plans on the phone beforehand:\n\n\u201cThe reality is, U.S. and Iranian interests and goals do not align in Iraq, and greater Iranian intervention would only make the situation dramatically worse. It would inflame sectarian tensions, strengthen the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), drive more Sunnis into ISIS\u2019s ranks, empower the most radical Shia militants, deepen the Iraqi government\u2019s dependence on Iran, alienate U.S. allies and partners in the region, and set back the prospects of national reconciliation. \u201cFor all of these reasons, and more, the United States should be seeking to minimize greater Iranian involvement in Iraq right now, not encouraging it. That means rapid, decisive U.S. action to degrade ISIS and halt their offensive in Iraq. And it means dramatically increasing U.S. military assistance and support to moderate opposition forces in Syria that are fighting both ISIS and the Assad regime. The longer we wait to act, the more our Iraqi partners grow dependent on the Iranian regime. That is neither in our interest nor consistent with the values for which we stand.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The hawkish senators both want military force in Iraq.
