It makes you feel really comfortable.\"\n\nThat's just what Boulder library officials want for the new space, which was developed with input from some 30 teenagers who met with the architect and from the Boulder Teen Advisory Board that represents youth interests at the library.\n\n\"I think of my bosses as the teens,\" said teen librarian Crystal Niedzwiadek. \"I really try to listen to them.\"\n\nThe old teen space held a few computers and tables in a tiny, windowless room off the bridge over Boulder Creek. The new teen space is three times as large and looks out over Boulder Creek from the leafy tops of trees.\n\nThere are computers and gaming systems, cozy couches, lots of tables and chairs for solitary pursuits and group work, art supplies, vinyl records and a record player and a coffee and tea station.\n\nIn August, the Foundry, a technology and media lab with recording equipment and a 3-D printer, will open within the teen space.\n\nThe amount of space and the variety of activities is key to making the space work, Niedzwiadek said. The old area was dominated by a relatively small group of boys who used the computers for gaming. Those boys and that activity are still welcome in the teen space.\n\nBut teens with other interests and many girls were hesitant to come into the space. Niedzwiadek said the new space creates a new energy that she hopes will be welcoming to a broad cross-section of teenagers.\n\nNiedzwiadek said she's trying to get the word out about the teen center and work with young people to plan programs that will appeal to their peers. So far, Tuesday movie night has been the most popular.\n\nTeens don't have to be quiet in the teen space. Adults and younger children aren't allowed, and they are encouraged to be themselves and explore their interests.\n\n\"They can use their normal voices here,\" Niedzwiadek said.\n\nThe teen fiction collection will be just outside the teen space, close at hand but still available to other library patrons.\n\nJake Snow, a Fairview High School senior who sits on the library's teen advisory board, said there is no other area in the community that is open to all teenagers, free and indoors. He's thrilled with the new space.\n\n\"It's cool,\" he said. \"It's comfortable. There are a lot of options if you like things other than video games.\"\n\nThe teen space is the first part of the $3.7 million renovation of the Boulder Main Public Library to be completed and open to the public.\n\nThe rest of this phase of construction includes the completion of two study rooms by the end of the month and the temporary reference area in the northwest corner of the second floor of the Arapahoe side.\n\nWork is already underway to raise the floor and run new wiring for computers in the second floor reference area. When that re-opens to the public, materials will be on lower shelves that let in more light, and there will be lots of comfortable reading areas.\n\nThe new children's area by the ramp to the bridge is scheduled to be completed by October.\n\nA new cafe on the bridge should be open by then too. Library officials are trying to finalize the vendor contract and hope to announce the vendor soon.\n\nThe front area of the library, which includes the current children's space, will be renovated in the fall to house adult fiction and media, as well as additional meeting rooms.\n\nLibrary and Arts Director David Farnan said the teen space seeks to serve a marginalized population within the larger community but also meets the library's goals for remaining a relevant community resource.\n\n\"The reason people come to the library isn't to get a book,\" he said. \"It's to become the person they are going to be once they are done digesting that book. That's part of what this space does.\"\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Erica Meltzer at 303-473-1355 or meltzere@dailycamera.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26095673/boulder-library-opens-new-teen-space", "sailthru.author": "By Erica Meltzer ,  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26095673:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-06T09:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Rowan Harper works quietly on a Lego Minecraft set while two other boys play Guitar Hero on a Wii and a girl reads on a sofa by the window in the light-filled northeast corner of the Boulder Main Public Library.", "title": "Boulder Public Library opens new teen space", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26095673/boulder-library-opens-new-teen-space", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0705/20140705__07DCALIBw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0705/20140705__07DCALIBw~1_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2014-07-07T05:47:47-0600", "endDate": "2024-07-05T17:07:16-0600", "description": "Rowan Harper works quietly on a Lego Minecraft set while two other boys play Guitar Hero on a Wii and a girl reads on a sofa by the window in the light-filled northeast corner of the Boulder Main Public Library.", "byline": "By Erica Meltzer,", "pubDate": "2014-07-05T17:15:01-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-06T09:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Public Library opens new teen space", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26095673/boulder-library-opens-new-teen-space", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Rowan Harper works quietly on a Lego Minecraft set while two other boys play Guitar Hero on a Wii and a girl reads on a sofa by the window in the light-filled northeast corner of the Boulder Main Public Library.", "title": "Boulder Public Library opens new teen space"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0705/20140705__07DCALIBw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96a1\"", "article_summary": "The teen fiction collection will be just outside the teen space, close at hand but still available to other library patrons.\nThe teen space is the first part of the $3.7 million renovation of the Boulder Main Public Library to be completed and open to the public.\nThat's just what Boulder library officials want for the new space, which was developed with input from some 30 teenagers who met with the architect and from the Boulder Teen Advisory Board that represents youth interests at the library.\nThe new teen space is three times as large and looks out over Boulder Creek from the leafy tops of trees.\nThe old teen space held a few computers and tables in a tiny, windowless room off the bridge over Boulder Creek."}
