But patients needing more extensive services, including dentures and crowns, have had to be referred elsewhere, Jayakrishnan said.\n\n\u201cWe're expanding our scope of services,\u201d Proctor said.\n\n\u201cWe get two to three calls per day for dentures,\u201d Jayakrishnan said.\n\nThe expansion will include a new digital X-ray machine and some minor remodeling to make room for working on molds, Jayakrishnan said.\n\nWhile the clinic operates on a sliding fee scale depending on a patient's insurance and ability to pay, she said fees for dentures, partials and crowns will be based on the clinic's cost to get the dental prosthetics produced. She said those costs still are being negotiated with an outside provider.\n\nPiecing the funding together\n\nThe Mellon foundation grant will cover the cost of the dental lab expansion and medical case manager salary for one year, Jayakrishnan said.\n\nAfter that, she anticipates the clinic being able to cover the ongoing costs.\n\nThe clinic primarily is funded through the federal Health Resources and Services Administration and insurance reimbursements. It operates on an annual budget of about $2.2 million.\n\nJayakrishnan also seeks grants, and no amount is too small.\n\nShe noted the clinic received $700 from the Muriel E. and Edward C. Wachter Charitable Foundation. That money will be combined with $1,000 from the New Kensington Rotary to help patients pay for diabetic care supplies.\n\nJayakrishnan said the clinic continually seeks ways to better serve the needs of the Alle-Kiski Valley. She noted it has received financial incentives from the HRSA for improving quality of care.\n\n\u201cPeople are healing,\u201d she said.\n\nLiz Hayes is a Tribune-Review staff writer.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=_FkAPn4vo_iMGyfiJeY1O8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYs1Mf8$0KCZdYXKhklJWomnWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "sailthru.author": "Liz Hayes", "description": "A $125,000 grant will help the Community Health Clinic in New Kensington expand its services to meet growing demand.
