After all, he asserts, it doesn\u2019t inflict any \u201clasting harm\u201d upon the victim recipient. Really, who needs God when we have Dawkins\u2019 finely-tuned moral compass to guide our values?\n\nIn a recent interview with the Times magazine, Richard Dawkins attempted to defend what he called \u201cmild pedophilia,\u201d which, he says, he personally experienced as a young child and does not believe causes \u201clasting harm.\u201d Dawkins went on to say that one of his former school masters \u201cpulled me on his knee and put his hand inside my shorts,\u201d and that to condemn this \u201cmild touching up\u201d as sexual abuse today would somehow be unfair. \u201cI am very conscious that you can\u2019t condemn people of an earlier era by the standards of ours. Just as we don\u2019t look back at the 18th and 19th centuries and condemn people for racism in the same way as we would condemn a modern person for racism, I look back a few decades to my childhood and see things like caning, like mild pedophilia, and can\u2019t find it in me to condemn it by the same standards as I or anyone would today,\u201d he said. Plus, he added, though his other classmates also experienced abuse at the hands of this teacher, \u201cI don\u2019t think he did any of us lasting harm.\u201d\n\nNote that he\u2019s not referring to, say, a 22 year-old dating a 16 year-old, or some such. He\u2019s talking about a grown man \u2014 a teacher, in fact \u2014 deliberately and repeatedly violating young children. Yes, children; there were multiple victims of this particular pedophile, and Dawkins presumes to speak for all of them. No harm, no foul. We mustn\u2019t judge. I wonder, whom would Dawkins consider the greater threat to society: The child predators of decades past, or today\u2019s judgmental Christians who might castigate them? And at what point, in his expert opinion, does \u201cmild\u201d sexual abuse graduate to \u201cmoderate,\u201d or \u201charmful\u201d conduct? Finally, who sets the \u201cearlier era\u201d moral statute of limitations? Inquiring minds must know \u2014 though one wonders if Dawkins would deign to respond to questions from pious simpletons who foolishly crowd our little minds with trifling concerns like moral relativism.\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prominent atheist: What\u2019s wrong with a little \u201cmild pedophilia\u201d?", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "Richard Dawkins, author of The God Delusion, has a message for you scolds out there: Stop getting so worked up over \u201cmild\u201d adult-on-child sexual abuse.\u00a0 After all, he asserts, it doesn&\u2026", "title": "Prominent atheist: What\u2019s wrong with a little \u201cmild pedophilia\u201d?", "url": "http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2013/09/11/prominent-atheist-whats-wrong-with-a-little-mild-pedophilia/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-11T15:26:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-10T23:21:58+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc01\"", "article_summary": "And at what point, in his expert opinion, does \u201cmild\u201d sexual abuse graduate to \u201cmoderate,\u201d or \u201charmful\u201d conduct?\nProminent atheist: What\u2019s wrong with a little \u201cmild pedophilia\u201d?\nAfter all, he asserts, it doesn\u2019t inflict any \u201clasting harm\u201d upon the victim recipient.\nposted at 11:26 am on September 11, 2013 by Guy BensonRichard Dawkins, author of The God Delusion, has a message for you scolds out there: Stop getting so worked up over \u201cmild\u201d adult-on-child sexual abuse.\nReally, who needs God when we have Dawkins\u2019 finely-tuned moral compass to guide our values?"}
