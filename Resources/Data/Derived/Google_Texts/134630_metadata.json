The law tries to decide. And sometimes it makes the law makes it hard. Try breastfeeding in a restaurant.\n\nWASHINGTON, May 10, 2015 \u2013 In celebration of Mother\u2019s Day, here are a review of some of history\u2019s mothers and a summary of the lot of moms in today\u2019s world.\n\nMothers owe their day\u2019s celebration to Anna Jarvis. In Grafton, W.Va., in 1908, Jarvis organized the first Mother\u2019s Day celebration to encourage families to honor their moms with simple, at-home gatherings. The holiday quickly became commercialized, and Jarvis became a vocal protester of Mother\u2019s Day charity events and of selling flowers and candy.\n\nGaia, the first goddess in Greek mythology, who was also known as Mother Earth, created herself out of \u201cchaos\u201d and \u201cconjured\u201d Uranus (the starry sky) from nothing, establishing that mothers were capable of anything. This truth is seen often.\n\nEve, the first biblical woman, listened to the serpent, ate the apple and got booted out of Eden. As additional punishment she was made to feel great pain during child labor. During child-delivery, mothers heard screaming \u201cOh God\u201d are really blaming Eve. On behalf of mothers, thank you, Eve.\n\nCleopatra, the last pharaoh of ancient Egypt, took \u201cfamily connections\u201d to the highest level. She may well have been the most powerful mother in history. Nine months after giving birth to a son, she rolled up in a carpet, literally, at Julius Cesar\u2019s palace and persuaded him to give her full control of Egypt instead of having it added to the Roman Empire.\n\nShe later had three more children with Roman general Mark Antony. She committed suicide, but not because of the kids.\n\nJune Cleaver, played by Barbara Billingsley on the hit television show Leave it to Beaver (1957-1963), embodied the perfect mother of that era, providing warmth, wisdom and supportive love to two precocious sons.\n\nToday\u2019s perfect mother cannot be defined, but the image of the Beav\u2019s mom remains.\n\nMarge Simpson is seen keeping her family in check on The Simpsons. Perhaps it is her tall blue beehive hairstyle that elevated her in a 2004 vote for the UK\u2019s Most Respected Mother, when she beat out Cherie Blair (British barrister and Prime Minister Tony Blair\u2019s wife) and Victoria Beckham (model, pop-star singer, fashion-designer, businesswoman and wife of soccer superstar David Beckham).\n\nMaybe it was something about Marge\u2019s voice\u2026\n\nMarie Barone, played by Doris Roberts on Everybody Loves Raymond (1996-2005), won three Emmy Awards portraying the nosy, insufferable, manipulative and meddling mother. We knew when we watched, though, that Marie\u2019s behavior was always grounded in love for her children.\n\nToday, laws touch on every aspect of human endeavor; it then follows that there are laws that affect and are directed at mothers.\n\nAre you a bad mother because you let your children walk through the park alone?\n\nAre you a bad mother because you consider having, or have an abortion?\n\nWhat is a \u201cfit\u201d mother?\n\nMany laws deal with situations when family units destruct. Laws that affect women in their role as mothers include child custody and visitation (which include rights of grandmothers and mothers-in-law), child support and even international custody disputes, where two sets of laws are involved.\n\nThe goal of all laws involving children\u2019s welfare is to provide for their \u201cbest interests.\u201d That term is unfortunately too often disputed. Parents in divorce and seeking visitation and custody arrangements have spent gazillions of dollars on lawyers, experts and \u201chired gun\u201d mental health people to serve their definition of \u201cwhat is best.\u201d\n\nThe first milk; the best milk; so why do some make it so hard?\n\nFrom the first mother, Eve, there was breastfeeding. It is a natural thing to do. Excepting some, of course, and not intending to stir any debate, today\u2019s health professionals and public officials agree and promote breastfeeding to improve the health of the child and the mothers. Breast milk contains antibodies that protect against bacteria and viruses, and children who receive mom\u2019s milk have fewer ear, respiratory and urinary tract infections. Children who are breastfed tend to need fewer healthcare visits, prescriptions and hospitalizations.\n\nSo why did it take until 2010 for federal law to require employers to accommodate this basic human activity? The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to require an employer to provide reasonable break time, and a place other than a bathroom, for an employee to express breast milk.\n\nB-F in public? Forty-nine states, Washington, D.C., and the Virgin Islands have laws that specifically allow women to breastfeed in any public or private location. Idaho\u2019s only law on breastfeeding is to allow women who have jury duty to be exempt if it imposes an undue hardship.\n\nB-F indecent? Twenty-nine states, D.C., and the Virgin Islands exempt breastfeeding from public indecency laws.\n\nBut I have jury duty? Seventeen states and Puerto Rico exempt breastfeeding mothers from jury duty or allow jury service to be postponed.\n\nUnmarried mothers (36 percent of all mothers in 2011, and if age 20-24, over 60 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau) have rights, mostly superior to those of the fathers.\n\nHealthcare decisions, considered mostly an individual right, allow a pregnant unmarried woman\u2019s decision about medical care to trump the father\u2019s wishes, including the right to decide on whether or not to have an abortion.\n\nUnmarried moms, in most states, are considered the full legal custodian, granting them sole physical custody of their children and granting them liberty to make all decisions about where the child stays and what medical care the child receives. If the father wants to visit or take custody, the mom can legally say \u201cno\u201d and that remains the status until there is a court order.\n\nBeing a mother is the most important job in the world. For all persons, whether they want to express it or not, thank you mom. Happy Mother\u2019s Day. No need to consult your attorney.\n\nPaul A.
