This whole notion, according to the Politico website, came to life through a Trump aide who gives the GOP frontrunner \u201ca little chart on how the community\u2019s doing ... I have a guy who does this stuff. I don\u2019t know how he gets it \u2013 all the top stuff.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to tell how much of Pittsburgh Trump actually saw from the tinted windows of his limousine during his brief stopover, but if he looked carefully, he might have noticed that Pittsburgh is not a post-industrial ghost town on a par with Flint, Mich. The city\u2019s once-smoky skies have been cleaned up, and its economy has fared better than many other cities. Officials in formerly mighty Rust Belt leviathans like Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo, N.Y., would be ecstatic if their cities were as vibrant as Pittsburgh is now. With the city\u2019s economy now resting on a foundation of medicine, education and technology, Pittsburgh has moved on from steel.\n\nEven if steel somehow migrated back to the United States from the spots around the globe it fled to in the 1970s and 1980s, who\u2019s to say it would come to Pittsburgh? There\u2019s every likelihood it would go to the South or some other region. Making it all the more implausible that the mills that once hummed in Homestead are going to be revived is the fact that steel isn\u2019t doing all that well in the places it has relocated to. In China, production dropped by 2.3 percent in 2015, thanks to the country\u2019s contracting economy, and it is bleeding an estimated $10 billion per year. Manufacturing jobs are disappearing in other parts of the world on the strength of productivity increases.\n\nAnd, of course, coal has been in freefall in recent years, due to the turn to renewable energy and the growth of the natural gas industry, with its cheaper fuel that burns more cleanly. Presumably, in a Trump administration, our allies would reap the economic benefits of the growing renewables sector while we haplessly try to build a time machine that will return us to 1956.\n\nThere are valid reasons to mourn the decline of manufacturing in the United States, particularly among those who are old enough to have lived through its heyday. Young men could graduate from high school one day, go get their union card the next, and be on their way to a secure middle-class life. Not anymore.\n\nThose once-abundant manufacturing jobs have mostly been replaced by lower-paying work at retail and fast-food outlets. There is a real need for policies that will reduce income inequality, increase the skills of American workers and move more of them into higher-paying jobs, but making facile promises to resurrect dying or diminished industries is not the answer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an appearance in Pittsburgh before the April 26 primary election, Donald Trump promised he would bring back the late Penn State football coach Joe Paterno.", "og": {"url": "http://www.observer-reporter.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?avis=OR&date=20160502&category=OPINION01&lopenr=160509902&Ref=AR&profile=1541", "site_name": "Observer-Reporter", "image": "http://www.observer-reporter.com/storyimage/OR/20160502/OPINION01/160509902/AR/0/AR-160509902.jpg&maxW=1200", "type": "article", "title": "Trump won\u2019t resurrect steel and coal"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.observer-reporter.com/storyimage/OR/20160502/OPINION01/160509902/AR/0/AR-160509902.jpg&maxW=1200"}, "site": "@ORONLINE", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Trump won\u2019t resurrect steel and coal"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 337301709808197}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/ms-icon-144x144.png", "google-site-verification": "lnSu69pQghhnNJ8E31bkbz6pgAK06AacDe_LbMRdIKs", "article": {"section": "Editorials", "tag": "Opinion, Editorials, Loc EDITORIALS, Editor Picks", "published_time": 20160502223838, "modified_time": 201605030022}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "He also promised he would bring steel and coal back to Pittsburgh.\nAnd now he says he\u2019s going to turn back the clock and bring coal and steel back to Pittsburgh and, one assumes, the larger region.\nThose once-abundant manufacturing jobs have mostly been replaced by lower-paying work at retail and fast-food outlets.\nManufacturing jobs are disappearing in other parts of the world on the strength of productivity increases.\nIn an appearance in Pittsburgh before the April 26 primary election, Donald Trump promised he would bring back the late Penn State football coach Joe Paterno."}
