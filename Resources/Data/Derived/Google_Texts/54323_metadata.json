Meanwhile, the national implementation has been managed from inside the Obama administration.\n\nThe Washington Post in a detailed narrative highlighted this decision not to appoint an outside health care czar, who could have hired staff and managed the federal health insurance exchange like a startup, as one of the main failures of the troubled rollout.\n\nThe story notes that the administration tried to hire Kingsdale to help Obama\u2019s top health care advisors, but he wouldn\u2019t take the job. In an interview Tuesday, I asked him why.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\u201cI was just finishing up at the state after four pretty intensive years of public service,\u201d he said. \u201cTo tell you the truth, it looked like it wasn\u2019t clear where and what I was supposed to be doing, but it was clear that I would be down under ... in the bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nAt the Massachusetts Health Connector, \u201cI was running something,\u201d he said. The federal job \u201clooked much more like a staff role, one in which it would be very intense, a lot of work, a lot of commitment, but not necessarily a lot of authority.\u201d\n\nKingsdale said he had conversations with the administration in the spring and summer of 2010. That fall, he joined Wakely Consulting Group as a director in the Boston office.\n\nIn a prior interview, Kingsdale had said he had a sense that there was \u201ca fairly deep distrust or disdain for health insurers\u201d among some members of the Obama administration. But he said Tuesday that was not a factor in his decision at that time.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the right role or the right time for him, he said. Now, if the government came asking, he said, he might have a different answer.\n\n\u201cI think they need somebody to run something now,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "1.0.112576987", "eomportal-id": 161546, "description": "Jon Kingsdale was key to launching the 2006 state health care law.
