Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade, but if I win, all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2016

Donald Trump pledged to end "all the bad things happening in the U.S." Saturday.

"Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade, but if I win, all of the bad things happening in the U.S. will be rapidly reversed!" the Republican presidential front-runner tweeted Saturday morning.

The reference to trade was the only effort to point toward specifics in the claim.

The generalized promise represents a culimination of sorts. Trump has argued that his unique skill at negotiation, which he says his business background demonstrates, will allow him to acheive aims others cannot.

In a radio ad airing in Wisconsin, Trump promises to slash taxes for individuals and businesses, protect Social Security and Medicare from cuts, expand the military, quickly destroy the Islamic State, "bring jobs back" from Mexico, China and Japan, repeal Obamacare and "replace it with something so much better" and improve care for veterans. He has not explained specifically how he would achieve these goals.

But his Saturday tweet largely dispenses with even naming problems. Trump only says he will fix them.

Trump's claim comes during perhaps the roughest patch of the campaign for him. In Wisconsisn, he trails Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who won the endorsement of Gov. Scott Walker. Walker is not popular in the state, but retains strong popularity with Wisconsin GOP voters.
