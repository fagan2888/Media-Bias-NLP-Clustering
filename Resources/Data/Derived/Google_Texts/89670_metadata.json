Connecticut says it has ended chronic homelessness.\n\nMore victories are on the horizon. New York\u2019s homeless veteran population is down 75 percent since 2012, and Mayor Bill de Blasio said in November that the remaining 1,000 or so homeless would get help by the end of this year.\n\nProgress also shows in national numbers. More than 25,000 veterans have left the streets since 2010, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s 2015 Annual Homeless Assessment Report. Nearly 14,000 fewer veterans are in unsheltered locations, and nearly 12,000 fewer veterans are in shelters and transitional housing.\n\n\u201cIn the last five years, we\u2019ve seen such amazing progress,\u201d said Baylee Crone, executive director of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans. \u201cVeteran homelessness, street homelessness, folks out under bridges, living in tents, living in doorways of businesses, those vets have left the streets and over 40 percent have moved into sheltered status.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama laid out the goal in 2009, saying there should be \u201czero tolerance\u201d in letting those who have served the country to go homeless. He said reducing homelessness was a top priority for his administration.\n\nIn the five years since, the federal government has spent more than $16 billion to tackle the problem, with mixed results.\n\nAn estimated 47,000 veterans were homeless at the beginning of the year, when the Department of Veterans Affairs and HUD conducted their annual one-night survey to get a snapshot of the problem.\n\nThe VA has consistently increased spending, but results haven\u2019t always followed, said Rep. Jeff Miller, Florida Republican and chairman of the House Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely unclear if VA\u2019s homelessness prevention efforts are providing a bridge to an independent, purpose-filled life or simply a permanent, government-sponsored home,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThe fact that VA increases in spending on homeless initiatives are growing every year and far outpacing reductions in veteran homelessness calls into question the efficacy of VA\u2019s efforts.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the VA\u2019s Special Homeless Initiatives budgets, which went from less than $376 million in 2009 to more than $1.5 billion in 2014. But the rate of housing people decreased from 2014 to 2015, and the number of homeless veterans went down by only 2,000.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles has been getting local governments to do more. They\u2019re the ones who work with landlords to arrange housing, run the job-training programs the veterans use to get back to work and police unfair practices that leave veterans struggling.\n\n\u201cThe program has made a big impact, but it isn\u2019t 100 percent done,\u201d said Steve Berg, vice president for programs and policy at the National Alliance to End Homelessness. \u201cMainly at the local level, people need to buy into the idea of housing first more. It\u2019s happened a lot, but it\u2019s not 100 percent.\u201d\n\nThe government used to apply a \u201cgraduated\u201d housing system, treating veterans at each stage of housing to show they deserved permanent housing.\n\nBut veterans weren\u2019t graduating, so the government decided to house veterans first and then give them services.\n\nSupporting veterans in subsidized housing saves the government millions of dollars in the long run, said Anthony Love, senior adviser and director of community engagement for the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s homeless programs. Otherwise, these veterans cycle in and out of emergency rooms, jails and detox centers, all on the government\u2019s dime.\n\nTo get mayors across the country to back Opening Doors, the National League of Cities joined the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness and first lady Michelle Obama last year to promote the Mayors Challenge.\n\nOver 700 mayors, nine governors and many local leaders have signed up for the challenge.\n\n\u201cThe Mayors Challenge allowed mayors to say, \u2018Yes, I support your goal, but what do you want me to do?\u2019\u201d said Elisha Harig-Blaine, principal associate of housing for veterans and special needs at the National League of Cities. \u201cThat clarifying question there has put the onus back on the community to say, \u2018Hmm, what do we need?\u2019\u201d\n\nOne big victory in the fight against homelessness has been getting better numbers on the problem, such as the percentage of homeless who are veterans.\n\nVirginia, which is the only state to achieve functional zero so far, had the whole package: local communities working to identify veterans by name, efficient rapid rehousing systems, short-term rent assistance and job training.\n\nThey reported on average 131 veterans housed a month, 90 veterans entering the system every month and 20 percent to 30 percent who did not need any intervention, said Matt Leslie, director of housing development at the Virginia Department of Veteran Services.\n\n\u201cBut we took a different approach,\u201d Mr. Leslie said. \u201cAround the country, it was really community-driven. In the state of Virginia, it was state-driven in support of communities. It was an extra layer, an extra thing we could do, to have the government support bringing potential for additional resources.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite five years and billions of dollars, President Obama failed to meet his goal of ending veteran homelessness by 2015, though officials say they have cut the rate by 36 percent and made progress with better care for veterans in communities across the country.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Despite five years and billions of dollars, President Obama failed to meet his goal of ending veteran homelessness by 2015, though officials say they have cut the rate by 36 percent and made progress with better care for veterans in communities across the country.", "title": "Veteran homelessness on decline in U.S. after Obama administration spends billions", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/24/veteran-homelessness-on-decline-in-us-after-obama-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/24/12242015_homeless28201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/24/12242015_homeless28201.jpg", "description": "Despite five years and billions of dollars, President Obama failed to meet his goal of ending veteran homelessness by 2015, though officials say they have cut the rate by 36 percent and made progress", "card": "summary", "title": "Veteran homelessness on decline in U.S. after Obama administration spe"}, "Author": "Anjali Shastry", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics"}, "article_summary": "Twelve cities, three counties and one state, Virginia, say they have ended veteran homelessness altogether.\n\u201cIn the last five years, we\u2019ve seen such amazing progress,\u201d said Baylee Crone, executive director of the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans.\nNew York\u2019s homeless veteran population is down 75 percent since 2012, and Mayor Bill de Blasio said in November that the remaining 1,000 or so homeless would get help by the end of this year.\nBut the rate of housing people decreased from 2014 to 2015, and the number of homeless veterans went down by only 2,000.\nNearly 14,000 fewer veterans are in unsheltered locations, and nearly 12,000 fewer veterans are in shelters and transitional housing."}
