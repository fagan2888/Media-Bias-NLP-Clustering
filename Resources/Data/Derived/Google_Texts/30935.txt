The top selling single of the 21st century was Party Rock Anthem, by LMFAO, followed at some distance by Somebody That I Used to Know, by Gotye and Kimbra. The top selling album of the 20th century was probably Bat Out of Hell, by Meatloaf, closely followed by Whispering Jack, by John Farnham and The Sound of Music soundtrack.

*Not all record companies have supplied ARIA with sales information on all their performers during the 20th century, so the album list above is incomplete. It lacks obvious million sellers such as the early albums of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and The Seekers. Another impression of sales can be derived from the number of weeks an album spent at number one in the chart. Here's that data, from David Kent's Australian Chart Books, with thanks to Graham West:
