It\u2019s in such trouble. It is in such a mess. We have a leader that doesn\u2019t know how to lead and he doesn\u2019t have the right ideas. And I think he\u2019s got his own ideas, either that or he\u2019s totally incompetent. And we have a country that needs help and it needs help quickly and badly.\n\nIn the spirit of his successful NBC show, The Celebrity Apprentice, Mr. Trump made his own pitch about why he should be the next president.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIt\u2019s a very simple pitch: We want to make America great again. We are losing this country. We are making so many bad decisions, whether it\u2019s ISIS and the way we go about it. Whether it\u2019s Obamacare which is a disaster. Whether it\u2019s social security and other things that are going down the tubes because of what\u2019s going on. Whether it\u2019s our debt, which is at 18 trillion dollars and it\u2019s going to be 24 trillion very quickly and that\u2019s a very important number because that\u2019s a number you\u2019re not going to come back from. There are so many problems with this country \u2013 we have such great potential. The way we negotiate with China is a joke. The potential is there, but the country is in trouble. We have no leadership.\n\nThe billionaire real estate mogul commented that national security is America\u2019s number one problem, followed closely by the high unemployment rate that Trump insists is much higher than the government\u2019s estimation.\n\nI would right now say security. This has just changed \u2014 it used to be jobs, and jobs are certainly a big problem. We have a tremendous unemployment rate, probably 20 percent. It\u2019s not 5.3 or 5.6 percent, because people that give up looking for jobs, they\u2019re considered employed, which is ridiculous. We have a tremendous jobs problem, but right now I\u2019d say security. We have a really big problem with what\u2019s going on around the world. The world hates us.

And she\u2019ll be formidable, but she can absolutely be beaten. Because she\u2019s got a lot of weaknesses. Because if you look at what she did as Secretary of State, it wasn\u2019t so hot.\n\nMr. Trump concluded the interview with a message for CPAC attendees: \u201cMake America great again.\u201d\n\nTrump announced at CPAC that there is an 80 percent chance he will run for the Republican nomination for president.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below", "article_metadata": {"description": "We need to make America great again.", "author": "Tom Hinchey", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "We need to make America great again.", "title": "Donald Trump At CPAC: The Country Is In Trouble, We Have No Leadership", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 829, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Donald-Trump-CPAC-Interview2.png", "height": 468}, "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/donald-trump-cpac-country-trouble-no-leadership/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We need to make America great again.", "title": "Donald Trump At CPAC: The Country Is In Trouble, We Have No Leadership", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Donald-Trump-CPAC-Interview2.png", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-03T14:53:38-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "CPAC 2015", "tag": "Unemployment", "published_time": "2015-03-03T14:53:38-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "cpac, cpac 2015, donald trump at cpac, donald trump cpac 2015, donald trump for president, will donald trump run for president, will trump run, can trump win, trump vs hillary clinton, 2016 election, barack obama, donald trump, hillary clinton, illegal immigration, national debt, unemployment, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "And we have a country that needs help and it needs help quickly and badly.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowBusiness tycoon Donald Trump told Western Journalism reporter Norvell Rose at CPAC last weekend that he is seriously considering a run at the presidency in 2016 because the country \u201cis in trouble\u201d and \u201cneeds help\u201d due to the current lack of leadership in Washington D.C.Well, the country needs help.\nThe potential is there, but the country is in trouble.\nWe have a tremendous jobs problem, but right now I\u2019d say security.\nThis has just changed \u2014 it used to be jobs, and jobs are certainly a big problem."}
