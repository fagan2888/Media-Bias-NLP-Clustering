Discover the historical uses of the plants, shrubs and trees that may be encountered as you look through the lens of history. Plants that live in the Park have been used for wild edibles, dyes, in ceremonies, for tools, fiber, textiles, weapons, and medicine. Documented uses recorded by ethnobotanists, historians, and the Lewis and Clark expedition will be examined. Spend the day exploring, and you will come to look at Rocky Mountain National Park flora in a new way.\n\nAbby has always been passionate about the environment. She gained her Master's degree from Regis University and has since a national park ranger, a Native Plant Master Trainer for Colorado State University and a Clinical Herbalist. She attended the Southwest School for Botanical Medicine and then opened a holistic health care private practice. She has harvested and made her own herbal medicines which she sells in her retail store. Ethnobotany and ecopsychology are her current passions. Abby has been educating children and adults in and about the natural world for 25 years. She is currently affiliate faculty at Metro State University in Denver.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more information on how to register for this class or other Rocky Mountain Conservancy- Field Institute classes, please visit rmconservancy.org or call 970-586-3262.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.eptrail.com/datebook/ci_26039343/explore-historical-plant-use-rocky-mountain-conservancy", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2014/0626/20140626__27eprmcprogram~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Jamie Ragusa - Bailey Education Fellow \n \n  Special to the Trail-Gazette", "description": "Spend a day on July 10 exploring with Rocky Mountain Conservancy - Field Institute Instructor Abby Schreiber and learn the great diversity of flora with a former Park naturalist.", "ag": {"canon": "EstesParkTrail-Gazette:article:26039343:view"}, "startDate": "2014-06-28T08:48:54-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.eptrail.com/datebook/ci_26039343/explore-historical-plant-use-rocky-mountain-conservancy", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2014/0626/20140626__27eprmcprogram~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Spend a day on July 10 exploring with Rocky Mountain Conservancy - Field Institute Instructor Abby Schreiber and learn the great diversity of flora with a former Park naturalist.", "title": "Explore historical plant use with the Rocky Mountain Conservancy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "eptrail.com", "description": "Spend a day on July 10 exploring with Rocky Mountain Conservancy - Field Institute Instructor Abby Schreiber and learn the great diversity of flora with a former Park naturalist.", "title": "Explore historical plant use with the Rocky Mountain Conservancy", "url": "http://www.eptrail.com/datebook/ci_26039343/explore-historical-plant-use-rocky-mountain-conservancy", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2014/0626/20140626__27eprmcprogram~1.jpg", "site": "@eptrailgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-28T08:48:54-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Explore historical plant use with the Rocky Mountain Conservancy", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2014/0626/20140626__27eprmcprogram~1.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Estes Park News", "google-site-verification": "KkJ2C-PvexXpGs0YrC0OaC569g0Ty1BcleONkROSkmQ", "modificationDate": "2014-06-28T08:49:14-0600", "endDate": "2024-06-26T12:30:09-0600", "byline": "By Jamie Ragusa", "sailthru.site": "eptrail.com", "pubDate": "2014-06-28T08:50:27-0600", "news_keywords": "Community events , Community events  news, Estes Park Colorado Community events  news, Estes Park Colorado news, Community events  Estes Park news, Community events  Colorado news, US Community events  news, world Community events  news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcddc7\"", "article_summary": "AdvertisementFor more information on how to register for this class or other Rocky Mountain Conservancy- Field Institute classes, please visit rmconservancy.org or call 970-586-3262.\nSpend the day exploring, and you will come to look at Rocky Mountain National Park flora in a new way.\nSpend a day on July 10 exploring with Rocky Mountain Conservancy - Field Institute Instructor Abby Schreiber and learn the great diversity of flora with a former Park naturalist.\nShe gained her Master's degree from Regis University and has since a national park ranger, a Native Plant Master Trainer for Colorado State University and a Clinical Herbalist.\nShe is currently affiliate faculty at Metro State University in Denver."}
