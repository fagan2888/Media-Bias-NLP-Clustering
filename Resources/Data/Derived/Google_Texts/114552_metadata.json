Richards said.\n\nIn July, Crozer\u2019s board of directors hired advisers Kaufman, Hall & Associates to evaluate the best alternatives for the health system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe announcement noted that hospital admissions continue to decline nationally as the trend moves from inpatient care to observation status and outpatient care. Crozer-Keystone officials also noted the decrease in reimbursements and the increase of patients with health insurance coverage that have higher deductibles and co-pays.\n\n\u201cBased on these trends, we are proactively exploring whether our mission of providing health care to the people of Delaware County is best met by remaining independent or working with another health care system,\u201d a statement released by Crozer-Keystone Vice President of Public Relations and Marketing Grant Gegwich said. \u201cIt is important to note that in making this decision, we are continuing our practice of making and implementing proactive decisions to ensure the vitality of CKHS. This has included efforts to improve efficiency and evolve into a system best equipped and designed to meet the health care needs of our community.\u201d\n\nIt is unknown how or if this will impact system employees, the statement said.\n\nOfficials from the Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals, the parent union of the Crozer-Chester Nurses Association that has been negotiating with the health system since April and without a contract since June, said a change could be beneficial.\n\nBill Cruice, executive director of PASNAP, said the phenomenon of health systems searching for methods to best address the changing dynamic of the health care industry is happening elsewhere.\n\n\u201cHospitals all over the state are going through similar processes to figure out how they can be more effective and more profitable with changes in the ... Affordable Care Act,\u201d Cruice said. \u201cCrozer is no different.\u201d\n\nHis organization also released a statement Wednesday with it perspective of the Crozer-Keystone action.\n\n\u201cFor Crozer, we believe a change in leadership at the top levels could be just what the system needs,\u201d the PASNAP statement read. \u201cFor too long, the current administration has let down the highly skilled doctors and nurses at Crozer by not providing the staff, supplies and leadership that our patients and community deserve.\u201d\n\nCruice said administration has spent too much on executive compensation.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, this very administration has squandered millions of dollars on exorbitant salaries, benefits and special deals for retiring executives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our hope that the first recommendation that this consulting firm makes is to cancel the $10 million Supplement Executive Retirement Plan that CEO Richards plans to take with her on her way out the door.\u201d\n\nCrozer officials said the announcement was not about the union or compensation for administrators.\n\n\u201cIt is about a comprehensive assessment of the rapidly changing health care landscape and our work to assure that we will continue to be the leading health care provider and employer in Delaware County,\u201d a statement read.\n\nIn addition for the potential for merger, Cruice said he would also bring the issue of Crozer\u2019s Ebola readiness at the next negotiation session on Nov. 6.\n\nCrozer-Keystone officials said as the exploration decisions are finalized, they will be made available.\n\n\u201cCKHS has consistently and will continue to remain focused on meeting the health care needs of our community,\u201d Richards said in a statement. \u201cBeing proactive in exploring our options is in keeping with this focus. We take our responsibility \u2014 to the people of Delaware County, our physicians and our 6,000 dedicated employees \u2014 very seriously. We are announcing this decision because we are being transparent in our efforts to proactively plan for the future.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, Primos news, PA news, US news, world news.", "title": "Rx for Crozer?
