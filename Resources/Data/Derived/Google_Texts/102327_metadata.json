Meanwhile, the percentage of privately-insured adult New Yorkers who went to the dentist dipped from 61 percent to 58 percent.\n\nCost is the top reason people avoid dentists, according to the report. Between 2003 and 2013 average dental charges in New York rose 5.4 percent for children and 3.8 percent for adults.\n\nThe report says the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has not helped matters because it does not require insurers to cover adult dental care.\n\nIn New York, 38 percent of dentists accept children on Medicaid. The payment rates dentists get for treating them dropped nearly 34 percent between 2003 and 2013, according to the report.\n\nContact James T.
