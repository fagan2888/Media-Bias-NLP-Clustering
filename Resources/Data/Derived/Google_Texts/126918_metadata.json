During that time, we have seen and experienced a lot. We grew up in the country with a lot of poor families, attended small and large schools, and confronted many of the challenges facing today\u2019s young adults.\n\nA couple of years ago, we began working with small groups of high-school-age members of the Boys & Girls Club in Oshkosh. Each group consisted of eight to 10 Club members, a facilitator, and Lynne and me.\n\nThe program consisted of a series of one-hour \u201cLife Lessons\u201d meetings, where Lynne and I would answer questions and address concerns on a range of subjects suggested by the kids. Topics included personal issues such as self-confidence and self-esteem, depression, bullying, dysfunctional families and relationships, job application, career choices, and resources available.\n\nThe young adults were a mix of white, black and Hispanic. Most were from poor families with one or more significant issues. For many, school is a challenge for concentration and relationships. Students have problems fitting in and finding positive role models.\n\nFor the kids, the Boys & Girls Club is a home away from home. The Club offers a safe environment, food, clothing for some, programs and mentoring. The staff is capable and non-judgmental. The kids are their focus.\n\nThe Club offers an alternative to \u201crunning the streets\u201d and an escape from home. In the Club environment, these young adults are relaxed, open and willing to both learn and help other kids. It\u2019s amazing to observe.\n\nI can recall discussing the suicide topic following the death of two 14-year-old girls one month apart. All of the \u201cLife Lessons\u201d participants have had personal experience with attempted suicide or have friends that have died or attempted to end their life.\n\nWe approached this chilling subject by trying to identify reasons and root causes. We also discussed strategies and tactics to deal with self-destructive thoughts and behavior.\n\nAfter a couple of meetings, we began to develop a relationship and friendship with the participants. We experienced openness, trust and mutual respect. The attendees would give Lynne and me a big hug and \u201cthank you\u201d at the end of each meeting. This says a lot.\n\nThe takeaway from these meetings was helpful information, coping tactics and hope. These young adults had an opportunity to spend time with a successful couple that has life lessons that can be shared.\n\nLynne and I enjoyed the opportunity to share. We hope to continue these meetings in the future. We also encourage others to become involved with helping young adults.\n\n\u2014 Robert Keller is a Kaukauna resident.
