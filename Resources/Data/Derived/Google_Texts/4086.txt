These companies can’t compete… The strong dollar sounds good… that’s about where it stops… If you look at it… you can say we have a strong dollar we have a strong currency… and there are certain advantages to that but there are certain huge disadvantages -- and the disadvantages are companies are really suffering. It’s very hard for Caterpillar and a lot these other companies… It’s very hard for these companies to compete when you have, you know China and Japan knocking the hell out of their currencies,” he said.

“The numbers are catastrophic for this country in terms of what it is going to cost. It’s unaffordable and it doesn’t work, it’s not good… Look at the premiums, look at what’s happening to the premiums for people. Look what’s happening to the deductibles -- how high the deductibles are. You [have to] get hit by a Komatsu tractor in order to use it,” he said.
