(Al Drago/CQ Roll Call)\n\nThose of us who report on and analyze politics for a living have been talking ad nauseam about voters\u2019 frustration and anger.\n\nIt\u2019s the hot topic that presumably explains Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Bernard Sanders, as well as the problems that political veterans such as Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jeb Bush have encountered.\n\nBut voter dissatisfaction isn\u2019t new. The last NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll to show more respondents saying things were headed in the right direction rather than on the wrong track was conducted in January 2004, more than a decade ago.\n\nIn fact, voters\u2019 dissatisfaction with the direction of the country probably explains why we had \u201cchange\u201d elections in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2014, with the incumbent president\u2019s party punished by voters.\n\nNot surprisingly, given the electorate\u2019s mood, pro-change and anti-establishment candidates have enjoyed some success, albeit sometimes brief, over the past dozen years, including Howard Dean, Herman Cain and dozens of tea party-backed congressional candidates.\n\nBut many establishment candidates have also won. John McCain and Mitt Romney were backed by the GOP establishment in 2008 and 2012, and Barack Obama was an incumbent who faced no challenge in his bid for re-nomination.\n\nThe long, choppy recovery that began after the 2008 recession and developing foreign policy and national security challenges undoubtedly have contributed to the public\u2019s sour mood, as has the journalistic narrative for years about partisanship and gridlock in Washington, D.C.\n\nSo if the public has soured on politics, politicians and Washington for a number of years now, why have Americans suddenly turned to the current crop of outsiders?\n\nAfter all, the current poll numbers aren\u2019t close to being records. We\u2019ve seen moments of greater dissatisfaction. An Oct. 17-20, 2008, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found only 12 percent of respondents thought the country was headed in the right direction, compared with 78 percent who said it was on the wrong track. The right direction numbers also reached the teens in the second half of 2011 (19 percent in August and November, and 17 percent in October), and October 2013 (14 percent), during the government shutdown.\n\nOf course, the sheer length of time the public has been unhappy could well have created such frustration and such a high level of exasperation with officeholders that some voters have turned to more extreme solutions, even a willingness to \u201cthrow the baby out with the bathwater.\u201d\n\nThere is a new level of frustration in both parties, though Republicans and Democrats place the blame in different places, of course.\n\nFor Democrats, the inability of politicians to deal with immigration and economic inequality, combined with the rise of the tea party and GOP control of the House and Senate, has produced a sense that the country is headed off on the wrong track.\n\nFor Republicans, the Obama presidency has been a nightmare, especially given judicial decisions on same-sex marriage and health care.\n\nBut while some Democrats are flirting with an outsider such as Sanders, the independent Vermont senator, the Democratic Party has not yet experienced the Trump-Carson-Carly Fiorina anti-establishment wave that the GOP has. (Democrats have not even had their Herman Cain moment yet.)\n\nMuch more of the frustration and anger is on the Republican side, which shouldn\u2019t be surprising given Obama\u2019s historic presidency and everything that has happened over the past six-and-a-half years, from gays in the military and same-sex marriage to the Affordable Care Act, the Iran nuclear deal, administration policy in Syria and the president\u2019s steps to address global climate change.\n\nBrad Todd, a partner in the GOP consulting firm OnMessage Inc., believes the 2014 elections were a turning point for many rank-and-file Republicans \u2014 raising expectations that have not been met and creating fertile ground for outsiders and anti-establishment candidates.\n\nHe notes that Republican congressional candidates campaigned in 2014 on stopping the president, repealing his agenda and changing the country\u2019s direction.\n\n\u201cAfter \u201914 when we took over the Senate, Republican voters decided we had plenty of power and believed that we could put points on the board. But they don\u2019t see us winning now, and they don\u2019t see Obama losing,\u201d Todd said.\n\nAs a result, many conservatives now believe the current GOP leadership is as much of an impediment to change as is Obama. Witness their reaction to Speaker John A. Boehner\u2019s decision to leave Congress.\n\nIn addition to the explanation, suggests a veteran Democratic insider, the early presence of a Bush (Jeb) and a Clinton (Hillary) in the race may well have also driven home to grass-roots elements of both parties just how little has changed since the early 1990s, leading to frustration with the status quo.\n\n\u201cThe presence of Bush and Clinton in the race may have helped create a hunger for something different \u2014 something very different,\u201d commented the Democrat.\n\nThe growing activism on the political right has caught the attention of those on the left, who increasingly believe that the tea party offers progressives a model for becoming more relevant.\n\nFinally, the success of outsiders this time can be explained by their particular qualities. Few true outsiders (e.g., Cain, Steve Forbes, Gary Bauer and Alan Keyes) have run in the recent past, and those politicians who have run as outsiders (e.g., Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul) have lacked broad appeal.\n\nBut Trump is a celebrity who knows how to manipulate the media, and Fiorina is a terrific debater who has become relevant because of her performance in the campaign. And Carson is a black neurosurgeon whose professional r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and personal style are rare in Republican politics.\n\nThis is a different Republican Party with a field that is very different than in the past. Seven years of Obama have created more frustration than ever, but the past 18 months have radicalized some in the GOP grass roots. That change in mood, as well as the makeup of the two party fields, helps explain why this is such a different presidential race than in the past.\n\nRelated: Ted Cruz Wins Values Voter Summit Straw Poll Again Donald Trump: Republicans in Congress Are 'Babies' Scott Walker Drops Out, Wants to Defeat Trump Post-CNN Debate Thoughts Roll Call Race Ratings Map: Ratings for Every House and Senate Race in 2016 Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Those of us who report on and analyze politics for a living have been talking ad nauseam about voters\u2019 frustration and anger.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "Those of us who report on and analyze politics for a living have been talking ad nauseam about voters\u2019 frustration and anger.", "title": "Does Voter Anger Explain the Success of Presidential Outsiders?", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/voter-anger-explain-success-presidential-outsiders", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/4/2015/09/summit_16_092515_drago-445x297.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-09-28T21:47:52Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "Those of us who report on and analyze politics for a living have been talking ad nauseam about voters\u2019 frustration and anger.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,category,category,category,author,RC-Tags,CQToday Topic,stuart-rothenberg-columns-archive,democrats,presidential,republicans,2016,democrats,Republicans,White House,poli", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2015-09-28T21:47:52Z", "modified_time": "2015-09-28T21:47:52Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "Those of us who report on and analyze politics for a living have been talking ad nauseam about voters\u2019 frustration and anger.", "title": "Does Voter Anger Explain the Success of Presidential Outsiders?", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/voter-anger-explain-success-presidential-outsiders", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/4/2015/09/summit_16_092515_drago-445x297.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1489\"", "article_summary": "(Al Drago/CQ Roll Call)Those of us who report on and analyze politics for a living have been talking ad nauseam about voters\u2019 frustration and anger.\nThis is a different Republican Party with a field that is very different than in the past.\n\u201cAfter \u201914 when we took over the Senate, Republican voters decided we had plenty of power and believed that we could put points on the board.\nThe past 18 months have radicalized some in the GOP grass roots, which helps explain the rise of candidates such as Trump.\nThat change in mood, as well as the makeup of the two party fields, helps explain why this is such a different presidential race than in the past."}
