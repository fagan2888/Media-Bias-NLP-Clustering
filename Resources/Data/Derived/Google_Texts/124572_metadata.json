It is a move that will provide access to cell phones for many low-income young adults, including current and former foster youths.\n\nUnder the new expansion, anyone between 18 and 26 on MediCal or receiving CalWorks benefits will have access to a free cell phone plan, which will include up to 1,000 minutes of monthly talk time and limited texting.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires that foster youth gain in-state Medicaid eligibility until age 26, which means nearly all youths aging out or staying in foster care after age 18 would qualify.\n\n\u201cFoster Youth can\u2019t afford cell phones so they go with prepaid plans when they can and then lose service,\u201d said Serita Cox, executive director of the group iFoster. \u201cThey have no way to stay connected to their support networks.\u201d\n\nLow-cost plans ranging from $5 to $8 per month, featuring unlimited monthly minutes and texting, will also be available.\n\nJust this fall, Cox and other advocates for foster youth lined up against a more elaborate plan to expand the states LifeLine, which until now has dealt only with landline phones. That version of the plan included conversion to a voucher system, which would have eliminated fixed rates for the LifeLine wireless services.\n\nLifeLine is a program in each state, financed in part by the federal government, through which telephone providers offer low-income households a subsidized phone plan that permits for (at the least) emergency calls and a certain amount of local calling.\n\nEach \u201chousehold\u201d is allowed to have one LifeLine participant, which means that most aging-out foster youths are eligible. As more states have included cell phone services in LifeLine, the cost of the program at the federal program has ballooned, to the dismay of Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and other spending hawks on Capitol Hill.\n\nJohn Kelly is the editor-in-chief of the Chronicle of Social Change.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Chronicle of Social Change", "description": "The California Public Utilities Commission has signed off on expanding the state\u2019s emergency phone plan to include wireless devices.
