The San Antonio story in this 21st century is of a city on the rise. It’s a city that is growing quickly, whose livability is being enhanced — by the week, by the month. It’s a place that has always been somewhere people of different ages, perspectives, backgrounds, religions have been able to come together well, work together well, and create just a splendid city. More and more these days people are taking notice of San Antonio as a community on the move.

2. How does the AARP Network of Age-Friendly Communities program fit with your "SA 2020" initiative, which asked San Antonio’s residents to help set goals for what the city should be like by 2020.

SA 2020 is all about a vision for a very livable city, to make San Antonio a lively city and a place that is welcoming and comfortable for everyone. The age-friendly initiative fits perfectly with that because it’s about ensuring we don’t just focus on one age group, but that we focus on all age groups, particularly seniors as they get older to ensure that San Antonio will offer them a fantastic quality of life.

3. Why are older San Antonians important to the city?

Particularly in a city like San Antonio that is such a Hispanic city — 63 percent is Hispanic — there’s an inveterate respect for elders in the Hispanic community and the growing community that is 50-plus. It’s a great fit for an age-friendly agenda in a place like San Antonio. We know that just as our future is tied to folks who are sitting in a classroom right now, our future is also tied to the health and well-being of people who are turning 50, and older, and still have a long life to live and a lot to give to the community.
