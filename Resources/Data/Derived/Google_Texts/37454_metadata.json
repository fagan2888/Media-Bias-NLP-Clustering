He is not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he becomes the very danger that the Constitution was designed to avoid.\u201d\n\nTurley specifically came to discuss what he called constitutional concerns raised by the administration\u2019s recent nonenforcement polices, as well as Obama\u2019s duty to faithfully execute the laws of the United States.\n\nTurley chastised Obama\u2019s actions on an array of fronts, from lifting the general prohibition on Internet gambling to granting waivers for the No Child Left Behind Act \u2013 effectively nullifying it, critics said \u2013 to refusing to deport individuals who came to the U.S. illegally as children, even though federal law mandates such deportation. Turley also homed in on Obama\u2019s pre-emption of the employer mandate set by Congress in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMeans and ends\n\nTurley said the issue before Congress \u2013 separating the merits of the underlying policies from the means used to achieve them \u2013 was a difficult one.\n\n\u201cIt so happens that I agree with many of the goals of the administration in the various areas where the president has circumvented Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, in the Madisonian system, it is often more important how you do things than what you do. We have long benefited from a system designed to channel and transform factional interests in the political system. When any branch encroaches upon the authority of another, it not only introduces instability into the system but leaves political issues raw and unresolved.\u201d\n\nThat said, Turley recalled Benjamin Franklin\u2019s favorite saying, that the constitution helps those branches of government that help themselves.\n\n\u201cEach branch is given the tools to defend itself and the Framers assumed that they would have the ambition and institutional self-interest to use them,\u201d Turley testified. \u201cThat assumption is now being put to the test as many members remain silent in the face of open executive encroachment by the executive branch.\u201d\n\nTurley said the administration had assembled a range of arguments justifying its decisions: the interpretation of statutory text, agency discretion, the ability of the chief executive to set priorities and to determine the best way to enforce the law. In addition, Turley said the president appeared to rely on an expectation that no one would be able to secure standing to challenge such decisions in court.\n\n\u201cPeople of good faith can clearly disagree on where the line is drawn over the failure to fully enforce federal laws,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is ample room given to a president in setting priorities in the enforcement of laws. A president is not required to enforce all laws equally or dedicate the same resources to every federal program. Even with this ample allowance, however, I believe that President Barack Obama has crossed the constitutional line between discretionary enforcement and defiance of federal law.\u201d\n\nDefending Congress\u2019 defining function of creating and amending federal law is an essential battle, Turley said.\n\n\u201cThis is more than a turf fight between politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThe division of governmental powers is designed to protect liberty by preventing the abusive concentration of power. All citizens \u2013 Democratic or Republican or Independent \u2013 should consider the inherent danger presented by a president who can unilaterally suspend laws as a matter of presidential license.\u201d\n\nSeparation of Powers\n\nTurley said Obama\u2019s unilateral actions took away what he called the thumping heart of the Madisonian system: the legislative function of converting disparate factional interests into majoritarian compromises. By stepping in and acting unilaterally, the president polarizes the political system, he suggested.\n\n\u201cIn this sense, Congress is meant to be a transformative institution where raw, often competing interests are converted by compromise and consensus,\u201d Turley said. \u201cOne of the most striking aspects of the recent controversies involving presidential nonenforcement is that they involved matters that were either previously before Congress or actually under consideration when President Obama acted unilaterally.\u201d\n\nThe loss caused by the circumvention of the legislative branch is not simply one branch usurping another, Turley said, but a loss of the most important function of the three-branch system, that is to say, channeling factional interests and reaching resolutions on matters of great public importance.\n\nAs important as Obama\u2019s circumvention of Congress when taking action is his refusal to enforce what Congress has passed, Turley said. And, he contended, that has helped give rise to a fourth branch of government.\n\n\u201cThe American governmental system is being fundamentally transformed into something vastly different from the intentions of the Framers or, for that matter, the assumptions underlying the constitutional structure,\u201d Turley said. \u201cAs I recently discussed in print, we are shifting from a tripartite to a quadripartite system in this age of regulation.\u201d\n\nTurley said the administrative state has shifted the center of gravity in the system to a fourth branch of federal agencies.\n\n\u201cAs a result, our carefully constructed system of checks and balances is being negated by the rise of the sprawling departments and agencies that govern with increasing autonomy and decreasing transparency,\u201d he said.\n\nUnnamed and unreachable\n\nIn 1790, Turley observed, the federal government had only 1,000 nonmilitary workers. By contrast, he continued, today there are 2,840,000 federal workers in 15 departments, 69 agencies and 383 nonmilitary subagencies, and that doesn\u2019t include federal contractors.\n\nThe bottom line is, he argued, that massive growth in the federal bureaucracy has changed the very way our lives are governed.\n\n\u201cToday, the vast majority of \u2018laws\u2019 governing the United States are not passed by Congress but are issued as regulations, crafted largely by thousands of unnamed, unreachable bureaucrats,\u201d Turley said. \u201cTo give one comparative measure, one study found that in 2007, Congress enacted 138 public laws, while federal agencies finalized 2,926 rules, including 61 major regulations. Adding to this dominance are judicial rulings giving agencies heavy deference in their interpretations of laws under cases like Chevron.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Turley contended, the Supreme Court has added to the executive\u2019s insulation and authority with a ruling that agencies can determine their own jurisdictions \u2013 a power he said was previously believed to rest with Congress.\n\nTurley quoted chief justice John Roberts\u2019 dissenting caution: \u201cIt would be a bit much to describe the result as \u2018the very definition of tyranny,\u2019 but the danger posed by the growing power of the administrative state cannot be dismissed.\u201d\n\nThe refusal of the administration to enforce congressionally passed laws only exacerbates the shift to the fourth branch of government, Turley said.\n\n\u201cFederal agencies are becoming practically independent in their operations in assuming new forms of regulatory law and adjudications,\u201d he said. \u201cThe refusal to execute those laws enacted by Congress would serve to marginalize the legislative branch further and make the federal government even less dependent on or responsive to that branch.\u201d\n\nPriorities, priorities\n\nNone of what Turley had to say was meant to deny the existence of presidential discretion, the professor testified.\n\n\u201cClearly, for example, the president is allowed to set goals in the execution of laws that place certain public programs above others in priority,\u201d Turley said. \u201cNo area of the law has one-hundred percent enforcement. There are discretionary actions that can include staffing and resource allocations with impacts on the level of enforcement in a given area.\u201d\n\nPresidents have also refused to enforce laws they consider unconstitutional, he said, and have offered up through \u2018signing statements\u2019 interpretations that have seemed at odds with congressional intent, Even so, he said, the Obama administration has stretched the notion of the constitutional nonenforcement of laws intolerably.\n\n\u201cFrom Internet gambling to educational waivers to immigration deportations to health care decisions, the Obama administration has been unilaterally ordering major changes in federal law with the notable exclusion of Congress,\u201d Turley testified. \u201cMany of these changes have been defended as discretionary acts or mere interpretations of existing law. However, they fit an undeniable pattern of circumventing Congress in the creation of new major standards, exceptions, or outright nullifications.\u201d\n\nWhat is most striking about the areas in which Obama has acted, he continued, is that they are precisely the type of controversial questions designed for the open and deliberative legislative process.\n\n\u201cThe unilateral imposition of new rules robs the system of its stabilizing characteristics in dealing with factional divisions,\u201d Turley said. \u201cWhile attorney general Eric Holder has recognized that the judicial branch is \u2018the final arbiter of ... constitutional claims,\u2019 he appears less committed to the concept of the legislative branch\u2019s inherent authority.\u201d\n\nIn so doing, the Obama administration uses political divisions as an opportunity to stamp its will on the nation\u2019s laws.\n\n\u201cWhile political divisions would normally be a reason to leave a matter to the legislative process to resolve, it is increasingly being cited as a rationale for circumventing Congress,\u201d Turley said. \u201cThus, citing gridlock and the failure to correct the law, President Obama has granted widespread waivers to states under the No Child Left Behind Act, effectively nullifying the law in the view of critics. This has been denounced as a circumvention of Congress with the creation of new criteria or conditions by the administration for schools to receive the waivers. This new system is entirely the product of an intrabranch process in circumvention of Congress.\u201d\n\nObama used a different rationale to delay the employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act, Turley said.\n\n\u201cYet, the administration cited deference to agencies in implementing regulations and establishing standards for tax and other provisions,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite having four years to implement the law and the statutorily-set deadline, the administration insisted that Congress cannot hold agencies to such schedules. The law itself unambiguously sets January 1, 2014 as the critical date \u2013 a matter of considerable debate within Congress during deliberations. There is no express power given to change that date.\u201d\n\nStill, the administration said it had the power to unilaterally ignore those dates, Turley testified, another example of bureaucratic muscle.\n\n\u201cIt is another example of the new independence of the \u2018Fourth Branch\u2019 and how specific mandates can now be disregarded in the haze of agency deference,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Congress could not have been more clear as to the activation date for the law, but the position of the administration would make such provisions merely advisory and subject to the agreement of the president.\u201d\n\nNot even a pretense\n\nWhen it came to immigration, the administration\u2019s basis for negating statutory provisions lost even the pretense of reasoned authority, Turley said.\n\nTurley said there has long been a general consensus that a president cannot refuse to enforce a law that is considered constitutionally sound. In other words, a president and his subordinates may not lawfully defy an Act of Congress if the Act is constitutional; the constitution can dispense a statute, but the executive cannot.\n\n\u201cYet, in June 2012, President Obama appeared to exercise precisely this type of \u2018dispensing power\u2019 in issuing an order to federal agencies that the administration would no longer deport individuals who came to this country illegally as children despite the fact that federal law mandates such deportation,\u201d Turley said. \u201cIn disregarding the statutory language, the administration rolled out a new alternative policy that individuals can qualify for \u2018deferred action\u2019 if they had come to the country before the age of 16, have no criminal history, resided in the U.S. for at least five consecutive years, and are either a student or have already graduated from high school, or earned an equivalent GED, or served in the military. Yet, this new, detailed system is the product not of Congress but the internal deliberations of a federal agency. While claimed to simply be an act of prosecutorial discretion, it constitutes a new and alternative immigration process for these individuals.\u201d\n\nAnd, oops, the administration did it again last August when it announced that deportation would no longer occur for any primary provider for any minor child or the parent or guardian of a child who is a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident, the professor observed.\n\n\u201cThe federal law mandates deportation for individuals in the country illegally,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile prosecutorial discretion has been cited in individual case decisions, the administration was using it to nullify the application of federal law to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of individuals. Once again, one\u2019s personal view of the merits of such an exception should not be the focus, or even a part, of the analysis. In ordering this blanket exception, President Obama was nullifying part of a law that he simply disagreed with.\u201d\n\nThere was no claim of unconstitutionality, Turley emphasized. saying it was a raw example of the use of a \u2018dispensing power\u2019 over federal law.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to discern any definition of the faithful execution of the laws that would include the blanket suspension or nullification of key provisions\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the immigration order reflects is a policy disagreement with Congress. However, the time and place for such disagreements is found in the legislative process before enactment. If a president can claim sweeping discretion to suspend key federal laws, the entire legislative process becomes little more than a pretense. What is most striking is the willingness of some to accept this transparent effort to rewrite the immigration law after the failure to pass the DREAM Act containing some of the same reforms.\u201d\n\nAnd what about the president\u2019s decision to allow Americans to keep so-called \u2018substandard\u2019 health insurance policies for another year despite the requirements of the law?\n\n\u201cThe ACA expressly sets the date for compliance that penalizes non-exempt individuals who do not maintain \u2018minimum essential\u2019 health insurance coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cThose non-compliant individuals are subject to a \u2018[s]hared responsibility payment.\u2019 By saying that states can allow individuals to remain non-compliant after the statutory deadline, President Obama inserted a constructive exemption that would have been the subject of intense political debate at the time of the deliberations.\u201d\n\nAgain, Turley said, Obama made the unilateral decision precisely at the time Congress was debating the issue, and after an outcry occurred over what many viewed as the central selling point of the health law, namely, that, if people liked their current policies, they would be allowed to keep them. Then millions lost their policies.\n\n\u201cI will leave others to work through the merits of that controversy,\u201d Turley said. \u201cFor my purposes, I am only interested in the fact that a key issue discussed during the debate over the legislation was unilaterally altered after passage. This is an obviously important part of the debate. The law does not expressly give the president the authority to waive the application of the provisions for selected groups. To the extent that the president was claiming that he had the authority to amend the law in this way, I fail again to see the legal basis for such authority.\u201d\n\nWhile many applauded the president\u2019s unilateral action, Turley said, they did so without considering the implications of such inherent authority for the system as a whole.\n\n\u201cOnce again, it is important to divorce the subject of such legislation or the identity of the president from the constitutional analysis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe circumvention of the legislative process not only undermines the authority of this branch but destabilizes the tripartite system as a whole. If President Obama can achieve the same result of legislation by executive fiat, future presidents could do the same in negating environmental or discrimination or consumer protection laws.\u201d\n\nSuch practices further invest the administrative state with a degree of insularity and independence that poses an obvious danger to liberty interests protected by divided government, Turley added.\n\n\u201cThis danger is made all the more menacing by the clear assumption by the Executive Branch that artificially narrow standing rules will insulate the orders from judicial scrutiny and relief,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Congress so marginalized and courts so passive, the Fourth Branch threatens to become a government unto itself for all practical purposes.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Turley said he does view the president\u2019s actions as even close questions.\n\n\u201cThe actions of the Obama Administration challenge core principles of the separation of powers and lack meaningful limiting principles for future executive orders,\u201d Turley concluded. \u201cClearly, these are times of bitter and intractable divisions between the parties. It is not the first time such divisions have emerged in Congress. However, Madison and others believed that petty partisanship would ultimately yield to common institutional interests when faced with the \u2018danger of attack.\u2019 After all, members have a common article of faith. It is Article I of the Constitution and the words:\n\n\u201c\u2018All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.\u2019\u201d\n\nRichard Moore may be reached at richardmoore.gov@gmail.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"title": "Expert: Obama 'the very danger' Constitution sought to avoid - The Lakeland Times"}, "verify-v1": "rz5P5oRLJOmL+zlrhhQ8xD1eseSZAQ3bn6ZpHmFrG/4=", "GENERATOR": "1up!
