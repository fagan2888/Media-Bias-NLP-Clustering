Otherwise, you will face even stiffer penalties than before.\n\n\"There are still 200,000 people in our area who do not have medical insurance,\" said Ron Rowe, vice president of sales at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City.\n\nHe says, plain and simple, the penalties for not being covered under the affordable care act are going up.\n\n\"The penalties are assessed when you file your taxes at the end of the year,\" he said.\n\nMark Ciaramitaro, vice president of H&R Block health care and tax services, said last year the penalty was $95 for an adult or 1-percent of your income.\n\n\"Now, it's $325 per adult or 2-percent of your income,\" he said.\n\nAnd, according to Ciaramitaro, it's only going up from there.\n\n\"In 2016 , that penalty goes up to $695 per adult or 2.5-percent of your income,\" he said.\n\nBut, there's a common misunderstanding about the cost of health coverage. There are federal subsidies for many to help you cover the cost.\n\n\"A family of four that makes less than $97,000 a year is eligible for a subsidy from the federal government,\" Rowe said. \"We have thousands of people that are paying less than $25 a month because the government pays the rest for them.\"\n\nApplications opened on Nov. 1 and will only be offered for the next few weeks.\n\n\"If you want your coverage to begin by Jan. 1, the deadline is Dec. 15, but last possible date is Jan. 31,\" Ciaramitaro said.\n\nAnd even if you have purchased coverage in the past, you may need to re-visit it.\n\n\"Subsidies are recalculated each year, so they will be increasing in Kansas City. So it is important to re-enroll, and the amount of out of pocket will go down,\" Rowe said.\n\nWe know this is all very confusing, that's why helped you connect you with the professionals with the answers in our Blue KC Healthcare in the Heartland on Tuesday, Dec. 1.\n\nThe event ran from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nThere are still ways to get answers after the phone lines and chat availability ended. Just contact Blue KC at 816-395-BLUE (2583) or livefearlesskc.com.\n\nCopyright 2014 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
