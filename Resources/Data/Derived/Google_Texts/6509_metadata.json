Steven-L-Johnson, CC\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) gave approval for four Chinese poultry processors to import into the United States, lifting a ban set to protect Americans against deadly avian influenza breakouts. The processors will only be allowed to re-export heat-treated/cooked chicken that has been initially slaughtered in the U.S. or another nation that exports slaughtered chickens to the United States.\n\nAccording to the USDA report, the audit that took place in March found China's chicken plants were up to the same processing standard as those in United States, which means that the products are \"safe, wholesome, unadulterated, and properly labeled.\u201d However, no USDA inspectors will be present in the Chinese processing plants, which means American consumers are not guaranteed that their chicken is being slaughtered in safe and sanitary conditions.\n\nChina has an infamous reputation as one of the world\u2019s worst food safety offenders. Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a report on a Chinese chicken jerky manufacturer that created dog treats tied to more than 500 dogs' deaths. The treats were later recalled and blamed for 2,500 animal illnesses. The FDA later found falsified documents, mislabels, and import shortcuts.\n\nJust this year, bird flu infected nearly 30 people, which caused a temporary shutdown of wet markets and the possibility of a permanent ban on the sale of live poultry in Shanghai. After the human death toll in China rose to six earlier this year, 20,000 birds were euthanized as a precautionary measure. Even more recently, last month, rice tainted with unsafe levels of the toxic cancer-causing metal, cadmium, was found in southern China.\n\nAccording to Larry Pope, the chief executive of Smithfield Foods, which recently made a poultry trade agreement to sell chicken to China, believes trade with China would be beneficial.\n\n\u201cThis means increased capacity for U.S. producers, more jobs in the processing and more exports for the U.S. economy,\u201d Pope told the New York Times. \u201cAt the same time, we will continue to supply our same high-quality, renowned products to U.S. consumers.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chicken china, poultry trade, usda ban, food safety", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The USDA has just approved chicken imports from China into the US.", "title": "USDA Approves Chicken Imports From China", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chicken-china-approved-usda-import-us-255727", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/05/usda-approves-import-chicken-us.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The USDA has just approved chicken imports from China into the US.", "title": "USDA Approves Chicken Imports From China", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/chicken-china-approved-usda-import-us-255727", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/05/usda-approves-import-chicken-us.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/05/usda-approves-import-chicken-us.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-05T17:06:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-05T17:06:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The USDA has just approved chicken imports from China into the US."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc98b1\"", "article_summary": "The USDA has just approved chicken imports from China into the US.\nAccording to Larry Pope, the chief executive of Smithfield Foods, which recently made a poultry trade agreement to sell chicken to China, believes trade with China would be beneficial.\nSteven-L-Johnson, CCThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) gave approval for four Chinese poultry processors to import into the United States, lifting a ban set to protect Americans against deadly avian influenza breakouts.\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a report on a Chinese chicken jerky manufacturer that created dog treats tied to more than 500 dogs' deaths.\nAfter the human death toll in China rose to six earlier this year, 20,000 birds were euthanized as a precautionary measure."}
