A Topeka, Kansas, couple has been ordered to stand trial on charges that they sexually assaulted a child since 2008.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that 37-year-old Kenneth Seel and 34-year-old Tiffany Seel are to stand trial on felony counts of rape, aggravated indecent liberties with a child, sodomy and endangering a child.

Kenneth Seel was ordered on Thursday to stand trial on 12 counts. His wife was bound over in October for trial on 11 felony counts and a misdemeanor battery count.

Both Seels have pleaded not guilty.

Tiffany Seel's trial tentatively is scheduled to begin on Jan. 25, while her husband's trial is set for May 23.
