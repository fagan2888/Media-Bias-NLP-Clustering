There is, however, a deep philosophical difference. You look at the way the president\u2019s reacted to what can only be described as a butt kicking election,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cBy any objective standard the president got crushed in this election. So I\u2019ve been perplexed by the reaction since the election, this sort of in-your-face dramatic move to the left. So I don\u2019t know what we can expect in terms of reaching bipartisan agreement. That\u2019s my first choice, to look at things we agree on \u2014 if there are any.\u201d\n\nMcConnell mentioned two areas of possible cooperation: Fast-tracking new trade deals and comprehensive tax reform. But he said his party will not pay a \u201ctrillion dollar ransom\u201d in new revenues for tax reform and urged the crowd filled with powerful executives to lobby the White House to support a more \u201ccompetitive\u201d tax code.\n\nAnd though the GOP leader was publicly down on his relationship with the White House bearing legislative fruit, he predicted that there are still enough moderate Democrats in the Senate that can join with his party to move some legislation to the president for his signature or veto, like tweaks to Obamacare and energy legislation.\n\nAfter the narrowly failed Keystone XL Pipeline vote in the Senate last month, McConnell said his phone blew up from centrist Democrats who were ebullient that McConnell will bring approval of the pipeline up early next year, when it is assured of passing the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that regardless of what direction the president takes, there will be 10-15 Senate Democrats who want to get back to normal and get back toward the political center,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nAs for perhaps his most important relationship with Obama \u2014 considering the president\u2019s executive and judicial nominations next year \u2014 McConnell said that Republicans remain undecided on whether those positions will require 60 or 51 votes for ultimate approval after Democrats altered the Senate rules to require a bare majority last year.\n\nThe Senate GOP, including its new freshmen members, will huddle on Dec. 9 to discuss whether to reverse Democrats\u2019 \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2014 a move that continues to cause division in the party.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you the answer to what we\u2019re going to do, but we\u2019re going to have an in-depth discussion of it shortly,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nWhile Republicans strenuously opposed Democrats\u2019 unilateral rules change at the time, there are many voices in the party arguing against reversing the change. There are several practical reasons for the GOP to keep things as is: In the short-term, keeping it at a bare majority will require fewer Republicans to vote for presidential nominees over the next two years. And in the long-term leaving the rules alone will make it easier for a future Republican president to win approval of his or her nominees.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He also boasts of his deal-making acumen when paired with Biden.", "title": "McConnell 'perplexed' by Obama", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/mitch-mcconnell-perplexed-by-obama-113258.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/02/14122_mitch_mcconnell_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Senate,Mitch McConnell", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He also boasts of his deal-making acumen when paired with Biden.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5c4\"", "article_summary": "McConnell 'perplexed' by ObamaIncoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that he\u2019s \u201cperplexed\u201d by President Barack Obama\u2019s actions since the mid-term elections, arguing Obama seems in denial over the \u201cbutt-kicking\u201d the Democratic Party experienced.\nYou look at the way the president\u2019s reacted to what can only be described as a butt kicking election,\u201d McConnell said.\nSo I\u2019ve been perplexed by the reaction since the election, this sort of in-your-face dramatic move to the left.\n\u201cMy hope is that regardless of what direction the president takes, there will be 10-15 Senate Democrats who want to get back to normal and get back toward the political center,\u201d McConnell said.\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you the answer to what we\u2019re going to do, but we\u2019re going to have an in-depth discussion of it shortly,\u201d McConnell said."}
