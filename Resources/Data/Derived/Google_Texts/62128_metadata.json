Cruz replaces this spirit with Spartan belligerence. He sows bitterness, influences his followers to lose all sense of proportion and teaches them to answer hate with hate.\u201d \u2014 David Brooks, \u201cThe Brutalism of Ted Cruz,\u201d The New York Times, January 12, 2016\n\nDavid Brooks observes a \u201cpagan brutalism\u201d in Ted Cruz and not the \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d of George W. Bush, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum who \u201chave in part emphasized the need to lend a helping hand to the economically stressed and the least fortunate among us.\u201d\n\nCruz, in short, offends Brooks\u2019 sense of \u201cthe best conservatism,\u201d which, if one were referring to a \u201cCourt of the Conservatism That Is\u201d and not a \u201cQuixotic Court of Conservatism at Its Best.\u201d amounts to an unbridled, Wild West kind of Market Rule played on a zero-sum game board where your winning means someone losing. And lest this rapacity be too brutal to win a Presidential election in a country that pitches its humanitarian values globally, a helping hand sowing Judeo-Christian beneficence must be evoked. \u201cCruz,\u201d Brooks tells us, \u201cis a stranger to most of what would generally be considered the Christian virtues: humility, mercy, compassion and grace.\u201d One presumes then that in the Quixotic Court, i.e., this \u201cbest\u201d conservatism that has never been, these virtues abound.\n\nWhen we return to planet Earth, we see what Brooks sees and fears : that Trump\u2019s twitter supporters tweet and don\u2019t vote while Cruz\u2019s backers expecting huge favors in return will vote. The \u201chelping hand\u201d spin is a sop to America\u2019s \u201cmoral exceptionalism.\u201d\n\nIn truth, that helping hand that is sowing virtues should not, by Market Rule decree, be enacted legislatively in any fashion lest \u201cMoral Hazard!\u201d set in and make \u201cMoochers\u201d of the \u201cleast fortunate among us.\u201d Best policy then is to leave that sorry group to their own devices, encouraging them by such \u201ctough love\u201d to jump into the competitive arena and start a business, speculate in stocks and lotteries, and perhaps invent and market a new App. Thus, beneficence in any proactive manner must be evoked, not implemented. And this holds true in both Quixotic and Dark Courts of Conservatism, though the former wears the mask of \u201ccompassion\u201d while the latter boldly makes a virtue of reversing a Judaic-Christian notion of moral action.\n\nRather than lend a helping hand to the least fortunate crowd, whose wages remain at a 1979 purchasing power level while the wealth of, say, those 158 families who have ponied up for about half the 2016 presidential election money thus far, has compounded exponentially, the \u201cThe Dark Court of Conservatism That Is\u201d works strenuously to do nothing and allow \u201cthe invisible hand of the market\u201d rule. This \u201cDo Nothing governmentally\u201d works to cut off all helping hand efforts, from vestiges of the New Deal to the already hobbled intent of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHistorically, this approach of the \u201cThe Dark Court\u201d is embarrassingly revealed, like the Wizard of Oz when the curtain is pulled back. Right now in Michigan, Governor Rick Snyder, accountant, never previously elected to office, but a man, like Dickens\u2019s Merdle, with a reputation \u201cfor business,\u201d is being compelled, bit by bit, to provide an account of how he did nothing while Flint citizens were hooked up to lead contaminated water. Years earlier, the \u201cDo No Public Good\u201d ethos of George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cDark Court\u201d was dramatically revealed when Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. In both Flint and New Orleans, it has been the poor, and mostly black in both cities, who were protected from the \u201cMoral Hazard\u201d that would ensue if anything were done to aid them. Far better, apparently, for the beleaguered to drown, starve or be poisoned than slide disastrously away from a \u201ctriumph of the will.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dark Court\u201d wages a campaign of destruction, one that Brooks sees to his horror is being openly waged by Cruz. \u201cCruz\u2019s programmatic agenda, to the extent that it exists in his speeches, is to destroy things: destroy the I.R.S., crush the `jackals\u2019 of the E.P.A., end funding for Planned Parenthood, reverse Obama\u2019s executive orders, make the desert glow in Syria, destroy the Iran nuclear accord.\u201d However, none of this \u201cbrutality\u201d would be opposed by those funding the present Republican presidential campaigns. Clearly, Trump and Cruz direct themselves more directly to those who are viscerally fired up, like Polyphemus, the Cyclops blinded by Odysseus, who swings in all directions. Those fired up want to be served raw meat without the assuaging trimmings Brooks\u2019s Quixotic Court of Conservatism at its Best requires.\n\nIn this fevered climate of the \u201cThe Dark Court,\u201d Americans, a number thus far sufficient to keep Trump on a roll and advance Cruz, have no need of and have little patience for a patina of \u201chumility, compassion, mercy and grace\u201d that Brooks\u2019 \u201cQuixotic Court\u201d requires. The fact is that such sops to the \u201cbetter angels of our nature\u201d have always been a front, more reliably covered by Liberals, more accomplished Pecksniffians, thus enabling American politics to present a face to the world that appears not totally one of cutthroat capitalism and its progeny of inhumanity, greed, injustice and blindness.\n\nAlthough Trump seems to be right at the heart of a new politics without genteel apologies or compassionate front, he is clearly ruled only by the vagaries of his own ego. He rules in the Dark Court of Egomania where economics is his, not Hakluyt\u2019s. The triumph of the will is Trump\u2019s will, not Ayn Rand\u2019s. There\u2019s no society in Trump\u2019s politics. Cruz, on the other hand, may be just as great an apostate to any belief but in himself, but, like Iago, he inveigles himself in other identities in order to twist them to his own purposes.\n\nFor instance, he mocks the evangelical spirit itself by representing to them a fulfillment of that spirit through his platform of destruction. Thus, to be humble is to assert personal choice above societal or governmental rule; to be compassionate is to be the Samaritan who walks away; to be merciful is to see to it that the unfortunate reap fully the misfortune they have sowed. And grace is bestowed in the fulfillment of God\u2019s rule, which is now synonymous with Market Rule.\n\nThere is no need then for Cruz to put a Christian veneer on the rapaciousness of \u201cThe Dark Court\u201d because he has conflated the two. What Brooks sees as brutalism in platform, Cruz has converted into declarations of simple truths, beatitudes recognized in the \u201cDark Court of Conservatism That Is.\u201d\n\nAlthough we never discover what motivates Shakespeare\u2019s Iago, it seems almost certain that our Cruz wants to take the Republican Party to the extreme economic laissez-faire that financialized capitalism always claims it has been denied. Cruz is almost certain to be rewarded for this by virtue of that revolving door arrangement between the government and the private sector that has done so much to advance plutarchy. Thus, Cruz\u2019s commitment to free market play cut loose from any governmental oversight parallels the declarations of the Club for Growth: cutting taxes, controlling federal spending, personal accounts for Social Security, ending the death tax, eliminating the capital gains tax, fundamental tax reform, providing true school choice and minimizing government\u2019s role in our daily lives.\n\nCruz makes the Dark Court so much darker in regard to tax reform. The tax reform that Cruz proposes is a flat tax and an elimination of the IRS, the agency that is presently investigating The Renaissance Group, a hedge fund that has contributed eleven million dollars to Cruz\u2019s campaign. Cruz\u2019s flat tax proposal promises to relieve every citizen of the bureaucratic nightmare of doing taxes while at the same time destroying the progressive income tax system which had been, as instituted by FDR, a strong contributor to the growth of the middle class, as was estate tax (\u201cdeath\u201d tax), and a strong capital gains tax. What Cruz promises the wealthy is relief from the cost of paying their tax people for challenging the efforts of the IRS to tax them. There will be virtually no taxes on them to challenge.\n\nCruz also makes the Dark Court so much darker in regard to education. Public schools do not need marketplace competition, but because \u201cchoice\u201d is always a good in the American mass psyche, charter schools now seem to confirm some deep sense of freedom. What \u201cchoice\u201d represents here, however, is not existential freedom but a chance for Wall Street backers of \u201ccharter\u201d schools to \u201cmonetize\u201d their new holdings.\n\nWhat was once public education would fall as other previously public entities have to the monetizing urge of The Dark Court.\u201d Statistics now show us that our ill-conceived adventures in Iraq and Afghanistan were so monetized. Cruz wants a war as enthusiastically as a corporation wants a new marketing frontier: \u201c[W]e will utterly destroy ISIS. We will carpet bomb them into oblivion. I don\u2019t know if sand can glow in the dark, but we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d\n\nEven more pernicious in its effects than privatizing both education and war is the way electoral campaigns have been privatized. Future profit making depends upon expenditures supporting candidates who will lead in the continued privatization of all things public, as well as the elimination of all things public which cannot be monetized, or which in fact are dangers to the rule of profit. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act needs to be \u201coverturned\u201d because it represents a first feeble step to cut into those profits. The slippery slope here leads possibly to socialized medicine, something the health care industry puts as much money into preventing as plutocrats put into controlling elections.\n\nThe goal to monetize everything, to go into every niche and corner of human life and explore their monetizing possibilities , which is the ruling passion and guiding principle of The Dark Court, has absolutely no link to the \u201cbetter angels of our nature\u201d David Brooks finds wanting in Ted Cruz. They are absent in \u201cThe Dark Court of the Conservatism That Is\u201d and only paid lip service in \u201cThe Quixotic Court of Conservatism At Its Best\u201d because the feeling in this court is that Americans want the \u201cwar of all against all\u201d that their economic system plays sugar coated. Americans, in this view, are not ready for the raw opportunism of Cruz or the raw egoism of Trump. Both Trump and Cruz, however, having been operating very effectively in the \u201cDark Court.\u201d One can presume that a good number of Americans are to be found there also.\n\n\u201cThe Quixotic Court of Conservatism At Its Best\u201d cannot attack either Cruz or Trump on any grounds but what they share with Liberals, that is, the high ground of humanitarian compassion and moral principle. They are in this bind because the premises of the Dark Court are the same premises as the Quixotic Court and because the former represents a logical extension of Market Rule premises while the latter cannot accommodate those premises and their ideals. The Quixotic Court\u2019s critique of the Dark Court can only head toward some control of Market Rule, some undermining of uninhibited growth, some support of equitable redistribution, some disclosure of the stochastic nature of winning and losing.\n\nNone of this can be done in any conservative court. To inch toward any of this would be to join Bernie Sanders who is already seeking a restructuring of Market Rule.\n\nAnd so Cruz is \u201cbrutal\u201d but nonetheless a perfect logical extension, a fitting culmination, the politician Market Rule has been at work creating since Reagan. He is a dark entity of the Dark Court of Conservatism. And Trump, to repeat, is self created, and thus in no manner the culmination of anything outside himself. Regardless of his self-deification, he as much as Cruz is a product of a schizoid conservatism in which it now seems a crude reality is eliminating its prior pretenses.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.counterpunch.org", "description": "\u201cThe best conservatism balances support for free markets with a Judeo-Christian spirit of charity, compassion and solidarity.
