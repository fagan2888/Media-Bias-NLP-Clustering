All across this country, Americans are waking up and I'm here to tell you, help is on the way.\"\n\nNevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who in January announced the Silver State would join 25 other states in a lawsuit against an executive action on immigration by President Barack Obama, introduced Cruz to a crowd of about 250 people. The action protecting 5 million immigrants who are in the country illegally from deportation is being challenged in court by attorneys general in more than two-dozen states, including Nevada and Texas.\n\nCruz spoke at a luncheon hosted by the Republican Club of Sun City Anthem for a little over 30 minutes. The event was open to members of the club, the community and news media.\n\nBefore talking to the crowd, Cruz took a few question from the media and spoke about his father, Pastor Rafael Cruz, who fled Cuba in 1957 at the age of 18.\n\nAfter more than 54 years of strained relations during the Cold War, the U.S. reopened its embassy in Cuba on Friday.\n\n\"My whole life my dad has been my hero,\" he later told the crowd. \"We are the children of those who risked everything.\"\n\nThe 44-year-old has two campaign event in other parts of Nevada on Saturday, one in Reno and the Basque Fry in Gardnerville, an event for GOP presidential candidates hosted by Laxalt.\n\nDuring his address, Cruz voiced many of the same things he later would raise at his evening event in Las Vegas. As president, he said he would instruct the U.S. Department of Justice to open an investigation into Planned Parenthood and prosecute any and all criminal conduct by the organization's leaders.\n\nHe would also order the Department of Justice and other federal agencies to stop the prosecution of religious liberty. Additionally, Cruz would kill the nuclear deal with Iran, which Republicans and some Democrats have harshly criticized.\n\nCruz, an attorney and solicitor general in Texas before becoming a senator in 2012, has gained in popularity since the Republican Party debate last week.\n\nOut of 17 GOP presidential candidates, he has raised the most hard money. In over three months, his campaign raised $14.3 million, which came from more than 175,000 contributions in all 50 states. The average donation was $68.\n\n\"That's the power of grassroots,\" Cruz said. \"We are building a grassroots Army here in Nevada and all across the country. This state has a critical role.\"\n\nContact Yesenia Amaro at yamaro@reviewjournal.com or 702-477-3843.
