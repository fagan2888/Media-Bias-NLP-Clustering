Weister said bacterial toxins, like botulism or staph, are likely culprits.\n\n\u201cOur epidemiologist aren\u2019t sure what the cause is, but it certainly, toxins are something that would cause people to get sick quickly like this,\u201d Weister said. \u201cBecause this was within three or four hours.\u201d\n\nThe fire department said although some patients experienced severe symptoms, all are in stable condition. A total of 700 people went to the office party.\n\n-- Health News Florida reporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
