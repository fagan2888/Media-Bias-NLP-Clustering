The 2016 Republican primary is giving us a great example of how susceptible politicians are to being swept up in a hip fad.\n\nGov. Chris Christie\u2019s wife has left her Wall Street job as Mr. Christie eyes a 2016 bid for the White House.\n\nMary Pat Christie has left her job at Angelo Gordon, a specialty firm in New York. She made more than $500,000 as a managing director in 2014, according to state disclosure firms.\n\nGetting your wife to take a little hiatus from her job makes some sense if you\u2019re going to have to move the family back and forth between New Jersey, Iowa and New Hampshire for the next few months (GW Bridge traffic permitting, of course) but getting your wife to step away from her senior role at a hedge fund that does private equity might be a little political.\n\nThe Republican base, as you might have heard, is pretty far right these days and wildly distrustful of what they perceive as \u201cWall Street.\u201d Angelo Gordon checks a lot of boxes for possible Rand Paul voters that blame greedy financiers in expensive suits for the collapse of America\u2019s middle class.\n\nThat makes Mary Pat Christie, an accomplished woman by any objective measure, a political liability when her husband needs to court that Tea Party vote. So out of the corner office and onto the campaign trail she goes.\n\nBut the Christies are not the only Elephant-pinned couple running this play.\n\nWhen Ted Cruz strongly intimates that he doesn\u2019t trust those fancy fat cats on Wall Street, he usually omits the fact that his wife Heidi is a Managing Director at Goldman Sachs.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of like how Luke and Leia don\u2019t talk about Dad when they\u2019re at Rebel cocktail parties.\n\nHeidi\u2019s gig did become public knowledge when Cruz had to cop to the fact that he and his family got their health care from Goldman while railing against Obamacare in 2013. But now that Heidi is taking a powder from her decade-long rise at Goldman, the Cruz\u2019s are now getting their health care from the State of Texas.\n\nChristie has been on both sides of the Obamacare debate, but he did sign a bill authorizing an ACA exchange in New Jersey, which might work out well now considering he could be be in the market for health care.\n\nAnd just to be clear that we\u2019re not taking a partisan shot here, we\u2019re well aware that Republicans aren\u2019t the only candidates trying to get the public to forget about their spouses\u2019 business dealings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you want to be the Republican nominee, it's best that you get your successful wife out of the corner office before anyone notices she makes a lot more money than you.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.1", "og": {"site_name": "Dealbreaker", "description": "If you want to be the Republican nominee, it's best that you get your successful wife out of the corner office before anyone notices she makes a lot more money than you.", "title": "Making Your Wife Step Away From Her Finance Job Is The Hot New Republican Primary Trend", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dealbreaker.com/uploads/2015/04/RepWives.jpg", "url": "http://dealbreaker.com/2015/04/making-your-wife-step-away-from-her-finance-job-is-the-hot-new-republican-primary-trend/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://dealbreaker.com/uploads/2015/04/RepWives.jpg", "description": "If you want to be the Republican nominee, it's best that you get your successful wife out of the corner office before anyone notices she makes a lot more money than you.", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "keywords": "Chris Christie, Feminism, politics, Ted Cruz, Wife Problems, , Dealbreaker", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcccef\"", "article_summary": "Chris Christie\u2019s wife has left her Wall Street job as Mr. Christie eyes a 2016 bid for the White House.\nThe 2016 Republican primary is giving us a great example of how susceptible politicians are to being swept up in a hip fad.\nMary Pat Christie has left her job at Angelo Gordon, a specialty firm in New York.\nWhen Ted Cruz strongly intimates that he doesn\u2019t trust those fancy fat cats on Wall Street, he usually omits the fact that his wife Heidi is a Managing Director at Goldman Sachs.\nPresidential politics, like any other cliquey pursuit favored by people that might be not entirely secure with themselves, is prone to copycat behavior."}
