Republican lawmakers have suggested that the agency collaborated with the Treasury Department and the executive’s office to control the damage of the IRS targeting scandal.The White House learned about the e-mail issues in April, two months before the IRS informed Congress about the matter.

In closed-door testimony with House Oversight and Government Reform Committee staff, IRS attorney Catherine Duval said she told Treasury counsel Hannah Stott-Bumsted about the missing e-mails, which were requested by congressional committees. A Fox News affiliate first revealed the conversation in a report Monday.

Duvall and Stott-Bumsted worked together at a D.C. law firm before joining the government. They’re also friends, according to Duvall.

“I was seeking to have a conversation with a colleague,” Duvall said. “I think that talking to appropriate colleagues about issues that you’re working on can sharpen your thinking.”

Duvall added: “I don’t think that Commissioner Koskinen would be surprised that I was talking to Ms. Stott-Bumsted. But Commissioner Koskinen would not know about particular conversations or the content of particular conversations.”

Duvall’s testimony provides a starting point for congressional investigators who want to determine which e-mails could provide evidence of wrongdoing, specifically collaboration between the White House, the Treasury Department and the IRS.

Koskinen has testified that he did not direct anyone to talk to Treasury or the White House about the missing e-mails. He practically challenged Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who heads the House oversight panel, to prove otherwise.

When asked whether Koskinen “caused” anyone at the White House, Treasury Department or the IRS inspector general’s office to find out about the missing e-mails, the IRS chief said: “I did not, and if you have any evidence of that, I’d be happy to see it.”
