Terry McAuliffe announced a budget proposal Thursday that calls for expanding Medicaid in Virginia, sparking another sharp battle with a Republican-controlled legislature that has vowed to block his efforts for the third straight year.\n\nThis year McAuliffe is trying a new strategy that would expand the federal health-care program for the poor and disabled without state dollars and instead charge some hospitals a fee, known as a \u201cprovider assessment,\u201d equal to 3 percent of their revenue. The cash is an untapped resource that McAuliffe said puts expansion within reach.\n\nBut in an effort to gain Republican support, his budget ties those projected Medicaid savings to some of their favorite initiatives. He argues that the state could afford everything from tax cuts to grants for small towns if they would only agree to extend coverage to 400,000 Virginians through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRepublican leaders shrugged off the governor\u2019s approach on Medicaid, but showed a willingness to consider McAuliffe\u2019s proposed $1 billion investment in K-12 and higher education that could shape McAuliffe\u2019s legacy at the midway point in his term.\n\n\u201cTwo years from now, the budget I am announcing today will be winding down,\u201d McAuliffe told a packed hearing during his annual budget speech. \u201cOur nation\u2019s fiscal and political environment may have devolved once again into chaos. We cannot control those outside forces, but we can accept responsibility for our own destiny. The question before us today is: How will we spend the coming two years?\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) said he doesn\u2019t agree with McAuliffe\u2019s rosy economic forecast and batted down any chance for a path to Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disappointed he kind of has overpromised, raised expectations,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish he had not included Medicaid expansion as part of his budget. He knows it isn\u2019t going to pass.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Thursday\u2019s speech brought into focus McAuliffe\u2019s twin goals of Medicaid expansion and funding education, including a 2 percent pay raise for state workers. He wants to pay for an additional teacher in every Virginia public school, increase across-the-board spending to keep pace with enrollment growth and boost college financial aid. He also proposed a 2 percent pay raise for teachers.\n\nHouse Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights), who taught social studies for 30 years, said he\u2019s wary of unintended consequences, such as whether counties and cities can afford their share of a teacher pay raise, Del. S. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, called the plan \u201cvery thoughtful\u201d and said he anticipated \u201cjust nibbling around the edges\u201d there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of common ground in the budget that we can agree on,\u201d said Jones, who stood with McAuliffe as they took questions from reporters after the speech.\n\nBut it was the governor plan to use $156 million in projected Medicaid savings to pay for things Republicans like that rankled many in the party. For example, he would devote $3 million to the Jamestown-Yorktown Museum\u2019s 2019 celebration in the back yard of Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment (R-James City). Norment declined to comment.\n\nHe would pour $13 million into the Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing and $4 million into Go Virginia, a grant program championed by heavy hitters in business. Both are favorites of Cox\u2019s.\n\nGiven McAuliffe\u2019s call for new spending to spur economic development, Cox called it ironic that he would sacrifice thriving programs and ones with corporate buy-in.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really care if I get targeted \u2014 but on the advanced manufacturing piece, I think he would agree that we\u2019ve actually had some success there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat part disturbs me.\u201d\n\nState GOP Chairman John Whitbeck called the approach \u201cunconscionable\u201d and said a third try for Medicaid is \u201cshortsighted at best, and economic malpractice at worst.\u201d\n\n[McAuliffe calls for workers pay hike, but teachers say it comes up short]\n\nEven the governor\u2019s Republican allies in the state legislature said the plan, as outlined, would have a hard time passing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people dying and living significantly shortened lives because of unaffordable access to quality health care,\u201d said Sen. Emmett Hanger (R-Augusta), co-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and one of the few Republicans who have voiced support for McAuliffe\u2019s plan to expand the program. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough sell politically.\u201d\n\nMichael Cassidy, chief executive of the left-leaning think tank Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, rejected the notion that Medicaid expansion is dead on arrival because even states with conservative governors have accepted the dollars.\n\n\u201cVirginia lawmakers should not be obstinate in rejecting options when it\u2019s clear other folks can get to yes,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was unclear Thursday the lengths the debate over Medicaid might take this year, particularly after the governor has fought two battles over the issue. There was nearly a government shutdown over Medicaid in 2014. McAuliffe also called for Medicaid expansion in 2015 but never counted on the projected savings, making it easy for lawmakers to say no. Virginia is one of 21 states that have not expanded Medicaid.\n\nThe Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association earlier this month reversed its opposition to a provider tax, giving McAuliffe a path to expansion. Traditionally the organization has resisted efforts to pay additional fees The association said the option could help hospitals that have complained of a financial crunch exacerbated by their mandate to provide free or reduced-price care to indigent patients.\n\n\u201cNow that the governor\u2019s budget proposal is public, VHHA will evaluate it in light of the principles spelled out in the letter from earlier this month,\u201d association President and CEO Sean T. Connaughton said in a statement. \u201cWhile VHHA evaluates the budget proposal, it should be noted that Governor McAuliffe\u2019s ongoing efforts to find compromise policy solutions to protect health care stability and access are appreciated.\u201d\n\nBut even before McAuliffe unfurled his plan Thursday, Mark J. Rozell, dean of the School of Policy, Government and International Affairs at George Mason University in Arlington, said, he faced a hard sell: \u201cThose minds are made up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The governor is making a third run at Medicaid expansion.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The governor is making a third run at Medicaid expansion.", "title": "McAuliffe unveils budget plan for Virginia", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-to-unveil-budget-plan/2015/12/16/72009080-a428-11e5-ad3f-991ce3374e23_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/12/17/Local-Politics/Images/McAuliffe-01b93-652.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "vapolitics, Terry McAuliffe, budget, Kirkland Cox, Chris Jones, Medicaid expansion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "72009080-a428-11e5-ad3f-991ce3374e23", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "vapolitics, Terry McAuliffe, budget, Kirkland Cox, Chris Jones, Medicaid expansion"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTwo years from now, the budget I am announcing today will be winding down,\u201d McAuliffe told a packed hearing during his annual budget speech.\nMcAuliffe also called for Medicaid expansion in 2015 but never counted on the projected savings, making it easy for lawmakers to say no.\nThe Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association earlier this month reversed its opposition to a provider tax, giving McAuliffe a path to expansion.\n\u201cI wish he had not included Medicaid expansion as part of his budget.\nBut in an effort to gain Republican support, his budget ties those projected Medicaid savings to some of their favorite initiatives."}
