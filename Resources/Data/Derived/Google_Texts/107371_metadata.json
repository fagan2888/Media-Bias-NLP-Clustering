The city also refined the law to apply only to guides who collect payment.\n\nTo obtain a license, tour guides still must pass a 100-question history exam, which costs $100 to take, and pay an annual licensing fee to the city. The council also requires guides to pay a $1 tax per customer, which the Institute for Justice deems a \u201cspeech tax.\u201d\n\nSimilar cases against licensing rules have panned out across the U.S., but the results vary from city to city. McNamara said this has left major disagreements among the federal courts of appeal about how the First Amendment applies to occupational licensing laws.\n\nThough the issue will likely hit the Supreme Court at some point, McNamara said resolution of the dispute on a federal level would probably not end with Savannah. He called the city\u2019s vote to repeal its licensing ordinance a \u201csurrender\u201d in the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI take as a pure admission that they don\u2019t think they can justify this law under the First Amendment and have no desire to take in a court ruling telling them that,\u201d McNamara said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics had said this was a free speech issue.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Critics had said this was a free speech issue.", "title": "Savannah Likely to End Requirement That Tour Guides Pass Test", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151015_TourismSuit_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-15T20:19:07+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1LQlPN8"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Critics had said this was a free speech issue.", "title": "Savannah Likely to End Requirement That Tour Guides Pass Test", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151015_TourismSuit_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "regulation", "published_time": "2015-10-15T13:38:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-15T20:19:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Savannah, Georgia, tour guides, First Amendment, free speech, Institute for Justice"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23bf\"", "article_summary": "To obtain a license, tour guides still must pass a 100-question history exam, which costs $100 to take, and pay an annual licensing fee to the city.\nThe Savannah City Council is voting this afternoon to repeal its decades-old ordinance that bars tour guides from taking an audience sightseeing without first passing an extensive history exam and obtaining a government-issued license.\nOne month after the lawsuit was filed last November, Savannah scaled back its regulations to drop a requirement that compelled tour guides to pass a physical exam from a doctor deeming them healthy enough for the job.\nHe called the city\u2019s vote to repeal its licensing ordinance a \u201csurrender\u201d in the lawsuit.\nThough the issue will likely hit the Supreme Court at some point, McNamara said resolution of the dispute on a federal level would probably not end with Savannah."}
