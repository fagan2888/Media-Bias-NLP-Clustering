After all, enabling physician-to-physician consultations and patient visits via videoconferencing is the antithesis of constructing new hospitals or clinics. But instead of building capacity with physical materials, telemedicine builds capacity with invisible bits and bytes.\n\nAs the Affordable Care Act gives rise to CMS accountable care organizations (ACOs), and commercial payers follow suit with their own fee-for-wellness variations, large health systems are justifying IT investments in telemedicine -- not because of the financial windfalls it will bring but for the savings it will create.\n\nTo reap efficiency and savings benefits, they're taking advantage of the brick and mortar they already have, building telemedicine hubs that can serve wide geographic territories and rolling out videoconferencing across as many service lines as they can.\n\nCost justifications outside fee-for-service model Advocacy groups such as the American Telemedicine Association have spent nearly a half-century making hard-fought, incremental progress evangelizing to payers and providers about the technology's usefulness. But until recently, their main wins have been in far-flung rural areas, where patients are sometimes several hours from the nearest medical facility. Because payers wouldn't honor telemedicine visits as equal to in-person care, the technology never caught on in a big way. So, why all of a sudden is interest in telemedicine growing among mainstream providers? Several business drivers are making it an attractive investment, including health systems looking for new ways to reduce the financial risks posed by their costliest patients. Telemedicine technology enables remote care such as home monitoring via sensors and video check-ins between office visits, which conventional wisdom says can help reduce emergency-room visits and hospital readmissions among patients with chronic conditions. The idea is that remote clinicians can catch complications before they become acute. In theory, home monitoring can also cut costs by addressing small changes in a patient's condition that might not warrant an office visit, especially when that might involve a long round-trip drive. In in the long run, telemedicine should pay dividends in the ACO fee-for-wellness payment model, in which payer and provider share savings over previous fee-for-service models. It also increases care quality and patient satisfaction, common areas on which new reimbursement programs base payments. \"We're interested in providing services and access to our members, patients and own employees, wherever they may be,\" said Kim Henrichsen, R.N., vice president of clinical operations and chief nursing officer for Intermountain Healthcare, a Salt Lake City-based health system that also runs its own health plan. Telemedicine, specifically audio and video consults -- both clinician-to-patient and clinician-to-clinician -- from a central monitoring center extends that access to Intermountain's facilities, which span 22 hospitals and 185 physician clinics. \"We're delivering clinical care through that mechanism.\"\n\nBuilding virtual brick and mortar Mercy, a Catholic healthcare system based in Greater St. Louis broke ground earlier this year on a $50 million, real-life telemedicine hub. But its virtual brick and mortar will extend scarce specialists to remote clinics without Mercy having to staff those outposts in person. The four-story, 120,000-square-foot facility is scheduled to open next year and will host the nation's largest tele-ICU -- which some providers refer to as an electronic ICU -- as well as 75 other telemedicine services, including telestroke treatment, remote sepsis monitoring of patients spread across its 32 acute-care hospitals in four states, home patient monitoring and teleradiology. We're trying to figure out how to deliver care to patients in those small towns. Wendy Deibertvice president of Telehealth Services, Mercy Health System Mercy has administered telemedicine services for a decade, but its new facility will enable the health system's 300 physicians working there around the clock to penetrate further into its network. Moreover, when the appropriate clinicians can make themselves available to patients at home in ways they can't now, especially in the more rural parts of Mercy's 860-square-mile geographical footprint. \"We're trying to figure out how to deliver care to patients in those small towns,\" said Wendy Deibert, vice president of Telehealth Services at Mercy, who added that a shortage of clinicians complicates the situation. \"And it's only going to get harder.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Intermountain, Mercy make telemedicine investments as IT infrastructure.
