Twenty states have now joined Attorney General Greg Abbott (R-TX) in a federal lawsuit to challenge President Obama’s executive immigration overhaul.

The plaintiffs include: Florida, Texas, Georgia, Arizona, Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Mississippi, Maine, North Carolina, and Ohio.

In the eyes of the American people, the scales are tipped slightly in favor of the lawsuit, according to a recent Rasmussen Reports poll:

Forty-five percent (45%) of Likely U.S. Voters favor their state suing the administration over this new immigration policy, according to a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey. Forty-two percent (42%) are opposed to a state lawsuit of this kind. Thirteen percent (13%) are undecided.

Unsurprisingly, these 20 states also have some of the largest illegal immigrant populations and are slated to be among those most affected by the measure.

Texas and Florida have the two densest populations of illegal aliens after California. According to the Pew Research Center, Idaho will also take a heavy hit:

Idaho, where 46% of the state’s unauthorized immigrant population is eligible for deportation relief, tops all other states on this measure. Other states with at least four-in-ten eligible immigrants include Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

It seems that it did not take very long for Americans to realize that Obama's new "common-sense, middle-ground approach" on immigration was, in fact, just another leftist power play.
