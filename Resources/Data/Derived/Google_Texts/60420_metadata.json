Center\n\nBy Ken Datzman, Brevard Business News // July 6, 2015\n\npositioned to grow in the years ahead\n\nTo the tens of thousands of practicing physicians around America, the acronym \u201cICD\u201310\u201d is a haunting thought. In reality, it\u2019s a ball of fire fast coming their way, at a time when providers already struggle to navigate the murky waters of healthcare reform.\n\nThis much more detailed coding system \u2014 labeled a \u201cclinical documentation improvement process\u201d \u2014 will impact the entire health\u2013care community, affecting virtually every business process and system in health plans, provider facilities, clearinghouses, and vendors.\n\nMedical practices are scrambling to ramp up their operations to ensure their systems and business processes will be ready to go live on compliance day, Oct. 1.\n\nThe 10th version of \u201cInternational Classification of Diseases\u201d is set to be rolled out by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. This is the newest coding system for healthcare professionals to code diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases.\n\nThe system has been the talk of the industry for a number of years.\n\nThe implementation of ICD\u201310 is seen as a project unlike any that the healthcare industry has attempted in decades. The new codes on a claim will be used to classify diagnoses and procedures for billing to Medicare and private insurance payers.\n\nOne of the biggest issues with this upgraded documentation will be the level of specificity that physicians will have to abide by.\n\n\u201cThis new compliance is going to increase the codes by tenfold on what a physician will have to do to properly code for a procedure,\u201d said businessman Christian \u201cChris\u201d Romandetti, the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of First Choice Healthcare Solutions Inc., which operates First Choice Medical Group of Brevard, a growing practice that specializes in orthopaedics, neurology, interventional pain management, and diagnostics. He added, \u201cThere are some positives and some negatives of the new system, ICD\u201310. On the upside, CMS is trying to create a national database, as it relates to identifying underlying causes, complications of disease, and the conditions that contribute to the complexity of a disease.\n\nBut at the same time, there is a lot to learn. And the complexity of it all is coming to the medical community soon.\u201d\n\nThe ICD\u201310 changeover was originally mandated in 2009, but has been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nMeanwhile, by enabling more detailed patient\u2013history coding, ICD\u201310 can help to better coordinate a patient\u2019s care across providers, according to CMS.\n\nUsing ICD\u201310, doctors can capture more information, meaning they can better understand important details about the patient\u2019s health than with the previous ICD\u20139. Moreover, the level of detail that is provided for by ICD\u201310 means researchers and public health officials can better track diseases and health outcomes.\n\nRomandetti says First Choice Medical Group of Brevard has stayed on top of the coming ICD\u201310 transition, just as it did for the practice\u2019s changeover from paper to the electronic medical\u2013record system. The government provides financial incentives to physicians for their practices to make the switch.\n\n\u201cWe have fully complied on the electronic medical records front and the incentives have paid for some of our systems,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut there are some great doctors out there in the community who do not want to deal with the growing compliance issues that impact their practices, and we think we\u2019re positioned to provide them with another option.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe believe we could enhance their practices by having them be part of our centralized overhead, centralized compliance, and centralized billing and collection systems. Once you have everybody under one roof, you can go to the payers and bargain for better contracts.\n\nRight now, the market is fragmented. A lot of physicians are standing out on the end of a branch by themselves, and it will be very difficult for them to meet the increasing compliance demands while at the same time, be great practicing physicians.\u201d\n\nServices and scales of economy are \u201cwhere you have to go in this new health care business world. At First Choice, what we do is allow physicians to be physicians and practice medicine while we handle the business end,\u201d said Romandetti.\n\nExperts say the ongoing reimbursement decline coupled with rising regulation will place more pressure on individual practices to partner with other practices or larger health\u2013care systems.\n\nAccording to \u201cPhysicians Practice\u2019s 2014 Fee\u2013Schedule Survey,\u201d the average commercial payer reimbursement for all new and established office visits fell nearly 9 percent between 2012 and 2013. Many administrators predict that this downward trend will continue.\n\n\u201cThere is no question about it,\u201d said Romandetti, \u201cthe practice environment is changing,\u201d adding, \u201cI don\u2019t practice medicine, but clearly, I practice business and will hang my hat on my reputation. I think I practice business pretty darn well.\u201d\n\nRomandetti, a longtime area entrepreneur, has been involved in marina management, boat sales and other business ventures. He is the managing member of Marina Towers LLC in Melbourne.\n\nHe draws this business analogy: \u201cYou can go to the post office and overnight a package. They\u2019ll do a good job and the package will get there tomorrow, or you can take it to Fred Smith (the founder of FedEx) and have it \u2018FedExed.\u2019 It will get there tomorrow, and he\u2019ll make money.\u201d\n\nRomandetti added, \u201cWe think we\u2019re the \u2018FedEx\u2019 of the medical business. We can do the job. We can do it right, and we can make money.\u201d\n\nA publicly listed company (OTCBC:FCHS), First Choice recently expanded its portfolio of Medical Centers of Excellence in the local market.\n\nThe growing regulatory burden and new complexities of health\u2013care reform played a role in Dr. Richard Hynes\u2019 decision as president of The B.A.C.K. Center, in collaboration with his physician colleagues there, to align the longtime practice with First Choice Medical Group of Brevard.\n\nFirst Choice, through a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, TBC Holdings of Melbourne Inc., entered into an operations and control agreement with Brevard Orthopaedic Spine and Pain Clinic Inc., known in the region as The B.A.C.K. Center, or \u201cBack Authority for Contemporary Knowledge.\u201d\n\nThe practice, nearly 35 years old, has locations in Melbourne and Merritt Island.\n\nThe Melbourne facility of The B.A.C.K. Center has available space to readily expand the practice\u2019s medical operations to support the addition of new physicians and care specialists.\n\n\u201cWith our current capability, we feel like we have a nice range of services available and we are not competing with one another,\u201d said Romandetti.\n\n\u201cThe B.A.C.K. Center was not doing any general orthopaedics. The B.A.C.K. Center focused on the spine segment of the market and we focused on the sport segment, so they complement one another.\u201d\n\nThe physicians at First Choice Medical Group Center of Excellence on South Harbor City Boulevard provide a full line of services, including shoulder reconstruction and total joint surgery. They also treat elbow and hand injuries, knee injuries, foot and ankle injuries, movement disorders, and cartilage preservation and restoration.\n\nDr. Hynes, a board\u2013certified orthopaedic surgeon, recently commented on the deal, saying, \u201cWe have witnessed and strongly admire First Choice\u2019s success with First Choice Medical Group and appreciate the enhanced quality of life and streamlined business practices that its proven business model offers medical\u2013care providers \u2014 particularly those of us who would much prefer focusing our energy, time, and efforts on caring for patients, rather than being consumed by the complexities of new health\u2013care regulatory reform coupled with other business challenges related to running a large, successful medical practice in today\u2019s environment.\u201d\n\nDr. Hynes will serve as the medical director, responsible for coordinating and managing the professional medical services of The B.A.C.K. Center. Together, the two entities expect to \u201cadminister\u201d roughly 100,000 patient visits this year. Dr. Hynes calls the First Choice business model \u201cthe wave of the future in private medical practice administration.\u201d\n\nThe First Choice family now has nearly a dozen physicians and six \u201cphysician extenders.\u201d The MD team includes Anthony Lombardo, Donald Vliegenthart, Richard Harrison, Richard Newman, Roberto Saucedo, Lawrence Zeff, Devin Datta, Steven Ortiz, Farhan Zaidi, and Hynes.\n\n\u201cWe have offers out to other physicians in the area, too, about joining our practice,\u201d said Romandetti. \u201cWe are looking to round out our group with the \u2018best\u2013in\u2013class\u2019 surgeons in the region. These surgeons know who they are.\n\nAnd even better, the patients know who they are. We have some really outstanding physicians in this community,\n\nand some are single practitioners.\u201d\n\nFirst Choice is also seeking out opportunities to bring other practices under its Medical Centers of Excellence umbrella, he said.\n\n\u201cRight now, there are two facilities in Florida that we are looking at. They are in different counties. But we still think there is opportunity to grow in Brevard County, because many of these office\u2013based practices do not want to be bogged down with regulatory paperwork.\u201d\n\nMedical practices are increasingly being forced to allocate more staff resources to manage new government regulations and processes, many of which are the result of health\u2013care reform.\n\nDoctors say the practice environment has become a jungle of complex and overlapping requirements. They cite current Medicare programs \u2014 such as \u201cMeaningful Use,\u201d which is using certified electronic medical\u2013record technology, and \u201cPhysicians Quality Reporting System\u201d \u2014 as forces detracting from time spent with patients.\n\nMedical practices responding to the Medical Group Management Association\u2019s 2014 \u201cCost Survey Based on 2013 Data\u201d reported a 4.6 percent increase in spending on total business operations staff per full\u2013time equivalent physician over the last year.\n\nThe report includes data from more than 2,500 groups and is touted as the \u201clargest and most robust cost survey and benchmarking tool in the industry.\u201d\n\nRecently, First Choice reported profitable results for the first quarter of the year, with revenue rising 12 percent.\n\n\u201cOur Medical Centers of Excellence platform continued to demonstrate that our operations are materially benefitting from key efficiencies that we have continued to implement over the past year,\u201d said Romandetti.\n\nFirst Choice is positioned in one of the fastest\u2013growing segments of surgery \u2014 orthopaedics. Just one piece of that market, total hip replacement, nearly doubled among middle\u2013aged patients between 2002\u20132011, primarily because of the expansion of that particular population in the U.S., according to a study presented at the 2015 annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.\n\nIn 2011, 42.3 percent of total hip replacements were performed in patients age 45 to 64, compared to 33.9 percent in 2002. This trend is expected to stay in place or expand for years to come.\n\nThere are several reasons for the anticipated increase in total hip replacements and total joint replacements: an aging population with arthritis requiring joint replacement; the increasing prevalence of obesity, which puts undue stress on the knee and hip joints; and the trend toward baby\u2013boomers remaining physically active later in life, which also places demands on the joints.\n\n\u201cWe think the growth trend in orthropaedics is going to continue for a number of reasons,\u201d said Romandetti.\n\n\u201cFor one, the Affordable Care Act has opened access to a new segment of the population (25 million) that previously didn\u2019t have health\u2013insurance coverage. We have literally watched hard\u2013working people, including roofers and masons, finally be able to have knee surgery, hip surgery and shoulder surgery at First Choice Medical Group of Brevard.\n\n\u201cThey have put this off for years because of their lack of health insurance. So, with all the different dynamics going on in the market, we believe we\u2019re well positioned to grow in the years ahead with our model,\u201d said Romandetti.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE INFORMATION\n\nCLICK HERE to subscribe to Brevard Business News\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "b.a.c.k. center,christian romandetti,dr. richard hynes,first choice healthcare,homepage,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/FIRST-CHOICE-MEDICAL-GROUP-580-15.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "To the tens of thousands of practicing physicians around America, the acronym \u201cICD\u201310\u201d is a haunting thought.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce21\"", "article_summary": "First Choice Medical Group Positioned To Grow With The B.A.C.K.\nCenter, in collaboration with his physician colleagues there, to align the longtime practice with First Choice Medical Group of Brevard.\nWe have literally watched hard\u2013working people, including roofers and masons, finally be able to have knee surgery, hip surgery and shoulder surgery at First Choice Medical Group of Brevard.\nCenter has available space to readily expand the practice\u2019s medical operations to support the addition of new physicians and care specialists.\nHe added, \u201cThere are some positives and some negatives of the new system, ICD\u201310."}
