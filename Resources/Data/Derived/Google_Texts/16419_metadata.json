BCBS is the health insurance market leader in several states. Federal officials are reportedly doing what they can to minimize the increases. The \u2018Paper of Record\u2019 offers more staggering facts:\n\nThe Oregon insurance commissioner, Laura N. Cali, has just approved 2016 rate increases for companies that cover more than 220,000 people. Moda Health Plan, which has the largest enrollment in the state, received a 25 percent increase, and the second-largest plan, LifeWise, received a 33 percent increase.
