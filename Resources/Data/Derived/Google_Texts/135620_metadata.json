(Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer)\n\nHe knows that it worsens over time as more of the dopamine-producing brain cells that regulate movement and other functions die \u2014 although for mysterious reasons the disease messes differently with each person.\n\nIt is a spectrum disorder.\n\nNo one can predict how fast it will move, or what physical and possible non-motor damage it may cause in terms of fatigue, sleep disturbances, dementia, and more.\n\nBut he and others with the same diagnosis make a big bid to live well when Parkinson's symptoms push them toward a closet out of embarrassment.\n\nOne already short guy, the 5-foot, 4-inch tall Michael J. Fox who starred in movies such as \"Back to the Future\" in 1985 and NBC's \"Family Ties\" show between 1982 and 1989, could feel shorter due to the disease.\n\nThe Parkinson's diagnosis he got in 1991 at age 30 makes him now, in the disease's late stages, look \"peculiar,\" Fox, 53, said in a 2009 interview.\n\n\"(Parkinson's) makes me squirm, and it makes my pants ride up so my socks are showing and my shoes fall off, and I can't get the food up to my mouth when I want to,\" he continued.\n\nBut Fox has proven that big things can come from someone who could feel smaller by the day.\n\nThe Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's established in 2000 by the actor has put $450 million toward research and is the largest nonprofit Parkinson's organization worldwide.\n\nJaramillo is no celebrity.\n\nHe is a doctor dedicated to serving the medically underserved.\n\nHowever, in April, Parkinson's Awareness Month, he shares his diagnosis publicly for the first time as a doctor committed to being a good patient \u2014 to living well, to living large, to seizing the day and stepping into it with courage and confidence come what may.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/ci_27846908/longmont-physician-gregory-jaramillo-wont-let-parkinsons-push", "modificationDate": "2015-04-04T21:04:29-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0403/20150403__05TCAJARw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Pam Mellskog \n \n  For the Times-Call", "description": "The folks who gathered in mid-March at the Longmont Senior Center acknowledged how small things can get smaller as their Parkinson's disease progresses.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27846908:view"}, "startDate": "2015-04-04T20:54:48-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/ci_27846908/longmont-physician-gregory-jaramillo-wont-let-parkinsons-push", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0403/20150403__05TCAJARw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The folks who gathered in mid-March at the Longmont Senior Center acknowledged how small things can get smaller as their Parkinson's disease progresses.", "title": "Longmont physician Gregory Jaramillo won't let Parkinson's push him into a closet"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "The folks who gathered in mid-March at the Longmont Senior Center acknowledged how small things can get smaller as their Parkinson's disease progresses.", "title": "Longmont physician Gregory Jaramillo won't let Parkinson's push him into a closet", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles/ci_27846908/longmont-physician-gregory-jaramillo-wont-let-parkinsons-push", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0403/20150403__05TCAJARw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-04-04T20:54:48-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-04-03T19:20:48-0600", "sailthru.title": "Longmont physician Gregory Jaramillo won't let Parkinson's push him into a closet", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Lifestyles", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Pam MellskogFor", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0403/20150403__05TCAJARw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-04-04T20:58:49-0600", "news_keywords": "Lifestyles, Lifestyles news, Longmont Colorado Lifestyles news, Longmont Colorado news, Lifestyles Longmont news, Lifestyles Colorado news, US Lifestyles news, world Lifestyles news."}, "article_summary": "Dr. Gregory Jaramillo, a longtime physician at Salud Family Health Center in Longmont, sat at the table \u2014 himself now a Parkinson's patient and member of the Longmont Parkinson's Support Group gathered there.\nDr. Gregory Jaramillo stretches as he works out with Physical Therapist Rashmita Patel at the Summit in the LifeCare Center of Longmont on Friday.\nDr. Gregory Jaramillo carries artwork while riding in an elevator to the first floor at Salud Family Health Center in Longmont on Wednesday.\nHe knows better than most that Parkinson's disease is incurable.\n( Matthew Jonas / Staff Photographer )Related Dr. Gregory JaramilloParkinson's leads Dr. Gregory Jaramillo to face his own mortality -- and to live wellThe folks who gathered in mid-March at the Longmont Senior Center acknowledged how small things can get smaller as their Parkinson's disease progresses."}
