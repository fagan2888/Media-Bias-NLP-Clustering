Most comfortable in campaign mode, outside the White House bubble he resents, far from congressional obstruction and close to the voters who once adored him, Obama tried to rekindle the campaign spirit.\n\nObama had traveled to the heartland for ice cream and speechifying, with his poll numbers in the dumps and his governing agenda even more troubled. It was a blast from the past. \u201cCynicism is a choice, and hope is a better choice,\u201d Obama said in Minneapolis, harkening back to his 2008 campaign theme.\n\nThat Obama has grown frustrated by Congress is nothing new, but the fact that he is wearing it on his sleeve is. In raging against a dysfunctional legislative branch and taunting congressional Republicans to \u201csue me,\u201d Obama is conceding what had long been obvious: His days of getting legislation through this Congress are over. He\u2019s started to call for \u201cconversations\u201d instead of legislation, most recently over efforts to expand paid family leave, and he is rolling out executive actions on everything from LGBT nondiscrimination to immigration reform because Congress won\u2019t act.\n\nFor Obama, \u201chope\u201d has always been the portal back to the history-making 2008 campaign, an ideal he struggled to revive in his re-election campaign. His most recent swing has tried to light the fire once again, complete with the Springsteen soundtrack and his familiar rally-the-troops line, \u201cDon\u2019t boo, vote.\u201d But 5\u00bd years into his presidency, there is little hope left for change anytime soon: the fall\u2019s midterm races appear destined to maintain the status quo for Democrats, or worse.\n\nSince his re-election, Obama has launched his \u201cfinal campaigns\u201d to sell the Affordable Care Act and boost vulnerable Democrats this fall. But the campaign launched last week in Minnesota is different. It is for his legacy. For the handful of largely symbolic executive actions he hopes will place him on the right side of history. To try to isolate him from the nightmare that has become Washington, stanch his hemorrhaging poll numbers and reconnect him with a skeptical public.\n\nOn Tuesday in Washington, having returned to the bubble, he hit the themes again in a speech at the Georgetown waterfront. \u201cSometimes in our culture right now we just get cynical about stuff, and we just assume things can\u2019t change because nothing seems to change in this town,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true. It can change as long as everybody gets activated, as long as people still feel hopeful and we don\u2019t fall prey to cynicism.\u201d\n\nBut that plea for hope has some cynicism of its own.\n\nAs he spends the summer heat returning to his roots, calling on Americans to embrace hope in campaign-style events across the country, Obama is also dialing up his own frustration with a political system that is by all accounts broken. \u201cI\u2019m finding lately that I just want to say what\u2019s on my mind,\u201d Obama said in Minnesota, turning his taxpayer-funded event into a broadside against Republican obstructionism. \u201cSo far this year, Republicans in Congress have blocked or voted down every single serious idea to strengthen the middle class.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t do anything except block me,\u201d Obama complained. \u201cAnd call me names.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "President Barack Obama is trying to rekindle the campaign spirit, but his plea for hope has some cynicism of its own.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "But his plea for hope contained some cynicism of its own", "title": "With Change Proving Difficult, Barack Obama Returns to Hope", "url": "http://time.com/2951625/barack-obama-hope-change/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/brack-obama-lake-harriet.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/brack-obama-lake-harriet.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "With Change Proving Difficult, Barack Obama Returns to Hope", "description": "But his plea for hope contained some cynicism of its own", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "barack obama, white house, hope and change, cynicism", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time", "author": "https://facebook.com/zekejmiller"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, white house, hope and change, cynicism"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde08a\"", "article_summary": "For Obama, \u201chope\u201d has always been the portal back to the history-making 2008 campaign, an ideal he struggled to revive in his re-election campaign.\n\u201cCynicism is a choice, and hope is a better choice,\u201d Obama said in Minneapolis, harkening back to his 2008 campaign theme.\nOn the shore of the placid Lake Harriet on Friday, President Barack Obama looked like he wanted to stick around.\nMost comfortable in campaign mode, outside the White House bubble he resents, far from congressional obstruction and close to the voters who once adored him, Obama tried to rekindle the campaign spirit.\n\u201cSometimes in our culture right now we just get cynical about stuff, and we just assume things can\u2019t change because nothing seems to change in this town,\u201d Obama said."}
