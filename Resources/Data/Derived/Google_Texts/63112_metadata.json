When school administrators found this out, they took swift action \u2014 against him, not his bullies.\n\nOfficials at South Fayette High School allegedly told the student to delete the recording and threatened to have him arrested on charges of felony wiretapping. By the time the police arrived at the school, however, the student had already deleted the file.\n\nBut rather than leave it there, the police chose to charge the student for disorderly conduct. About a month later, a judge convicted him. No disciplinary actions have been taken against either the administrators and teachers who ignored the bullying or the bullies themselves.\n\nIn her remarks defending her decision to convict the bullied child, Judge Maureen McGraw-Desmet claimed that the student\u2019s recording of his abusers\u2019 taunts was an \u201cextreme\u201d move. It would\u2019ve been better, the judge said, if the child had opted to \u201clet the school handle it\u201d instead.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One student tried to prove administrators were letting him be bullied.
