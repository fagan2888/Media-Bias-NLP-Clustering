Since they provided a public benefit, were financed by donations, and generated little if any income, some hospitals were tax-exempt.\n\nWith the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, hospitals wanting to qualify for tax exemption as a nonprofit entity must meet four additional requirements. They must conduct a community needs assessment every three years, establish and disclose a financial assistance policy, refrain from billing individuals eligible for financial assistance more for emergency or other medically necessary care than the amounts generally billed to patients with Medicare or private commercial insurance, and they must refrain from engaging in certain collection methods.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors have been looking at these trends for years, and a report they published last year in Health Affairs journal, stated that 50 hospitals in the U.S. with the highest markup of prices over their actual costs charged some patients more than 10 times the costs allowed by Medicare, which is a markup of more than 1,000 percent for the same medical services.\n\nThe researchers said the high markup rate was attributable to a combination of a hospital charges lacking regulations and a lack of market competition in the U.S.\n\nGerard F. Anderson, Ph.D, a professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Bloomberg School who authored the study with Ge Bai, Ph.D, CPA, an assistant accounting professor at Washington and Lee University, believes that most highly-profitable hospitals tend to have monopolies, or near monopolies, in their communities, allowing them to charge whatever they like to patients, or private insurers.\n\nThe researchers found that highly-profitable hospitals were charging out-of-network patients, the uninsured, as well as auto and workers\u2019 compensation insurers far more than allowed by Medicare.\n\nPrivate insurers, Anderson said, keep monopoly hospitals in their networks in order to attract customers.\n\n\u201cEither they\u2019re doing something right or they are taking advantage of a flawed payment system. Perhaps the most important question is what are they doing with all of that money?\u201d Anderson said.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the net income from patient care services at 3,000 acute care hospitals during the 2013 fiscal year and found that while the majority of hospitals incurred small losses from patient care, hospitals that were part of a hospital system were more profitable, and as Bai puts it, \u201csome hospitals are obtaining outrageous profits.\u201d\n\nThe most profitable hospitals had the highest patient care markup rate, the authors found.\n\nIn 2013, Medicare and Medicaid\u2019s fee-for-service model incentivized hospitals to conduct more tests and procedures in order to earn more money, according to the researchers.\n\nBut Bai says change may be on the horizon, since a new model, a value-based model, is being phased in over the coming years and is designed to reward hospitals whose patients have the best outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe system is broken when nonprofit hospitals are raking in such high profits,\u201d Anderson states, adding that the country\u2019s most profitable hospitals should lower their prices or put those profits into community services.\n\nIn response, James Hereford, Chief Operating Officer at Stanford Health Care, sent the following statement:\n\n\u201cIn analyzing hospital finances, it is important to differentiate between academic medical centers and other providers. There are important differences in the mission, scope of activities and case mix of Stanford Health Care versus a community hospital. As a nonprofit, we reinvest continuously in our care delivery system to support the level of services Stanford Health Care provides.\u201d\n\nHereford said the hospital has a very high case mix index because Stanford Health Care treats patients with \u201cthe most complex needs.\u201d This advanced level of care by highly trained specialists \u201cis simply more expensive to provide than what is available in a community hospital.\u201d\n\nHe said the hospital provides ongoing financial support for medical discovery, is a teaching institution and supports research activities in collaboration with the Stanford School of Medicine.\n\nOther reasons for the high profit, Hereford said, is that, \u201cWe serve a high-cost area with growing needs. Stanford is located in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the most expensive labor markets in the country. Strong financial performance enables us to attract and compensate the level of highly trained staff needed for tertiary care.\u201d\n\nHe said patient services volume has increased by 80 percent between 2009 and 2013 and emergency room visits have increased by 18 percent during that same five-year period.\n\nAnother major use of funds in 2013, Hereford said, was the ongoing construction of a new 820,000-square-foot Stanford Hospital. He said in 2013, $300 million was invested in capital projects. The new Stanford Hospital projected to open in 2018.\n\nAdditionally, Hereford notes that \u201cIn 2013, Stanford Health Care\u2019s community benefit investment was $199 million; in 2015, it was $266 million.\u201d\n\nSutter Medical Center also commented on the study.\n\nBill Gleeson, Sutter Health Vice President of Communications, told CBS San Francisco:\n\n\u201cOur initial analysis suggests that the authors missed $240 million of expenses which significantly overstated Sutter Medical Center, Sacramento\u2019s actual earnings. At least two other hospitals on the list\u2014Gunderson in Wisconsin, and Norton in Louisville, KY\u2014both part of large systems, have already identified similar inaccuracies in the study since its release yesterday. The study appears to be fundamentally flawed. Our ranking would have been much different had the authors accurately calculated expenses.\u201d\n\nBy Hannah Albarazi \u2013 Follow her on Twitter: @hannahalbarazi.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stanford Hospital and Clinics in Palo Alto and Sutter Medical Center in Sacramento are two of the most profitable U.S. hospitals, yet both hospitals carry the \"nonprofit\" designation.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/05/03/nonprofit-stanford-hospital-among-top-u-s-hospitals-profiting-off-patients/", "image": {"width": 1024, "secure_url": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/stanford.jpg?w=1024", "identifier": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/stanford.jpg?w=1024", "height": 426}, "type": "article", "description": "Stanford Hospital and Clinics in Palo Alto and Sutter Medical Center in Sacramento are two of the most profitable U.S. hospitals, yet both hospitals carry the \"nonprofit\" designation.", "title": "'Nonprofit' Stanford Hospital Among Top U.S. Hospitals Profiting Off Patients"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/stanford.jpg?w=1024", "description": "Stanford Hospital and Clinics in Palo Alto and Sutter Medical Center in Sacramento are two of the most profitable U.S. hospitals, yet both hospitals carry the \"nonprofit\" designation.", "site": "cbssf", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Nonprofit' Stanford Hospital Among Top U.S. Hospitals Profiting Off Patients"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of SF", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS San Francisco", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSSanFrancisco", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSSanFrancisco"}, "keywords": "nonprofit hospitals, stanford hospital, sutter, profit, u.s. hospitals", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/73943609873d357bc6a7462619ad7be9?s=16", "news_keywords": "Nonprofit hospitals, Stanford Hospital, Sutter, Profit, U.S. Hospitals"}, "article_summary": "Another major use of funds in 2013, Hereford said, was the ongoing construction of a new 820,000-square-foot Stanford Hospital.\nThere are important differences in the mission, scope of activities and case mix of Stanford Health Care versus a community hospital.\nPALO ALTO (CBS SF) \u2014 Stanford Hospital and Clinics in Palo Alto and Sutter Medical Center in Sacramento are two of the most profitable U.S. hospitals, yet both hospitals carry the \u201cnonprofit\u201d designation, according to a new study.\n\u201cThe system is broken when nonprofit hospitals are raking in such high profits,\u201d Anderson states, adding that the country\u2019s most profitable hospitals should lower their prices or put those profits into community services.\nThe new Stanford Hospital projected to open in 2018."}
