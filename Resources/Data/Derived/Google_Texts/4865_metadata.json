Where are they going to reach next?\u201d\n\nStewart owns AAA Global Services, a Jacksonville company that employs sign spinners to advertise for local businesses. Stewart\u2019s star employee, Jeff \u201cSign Guy\u201d Cappelletti was shut down by local code enforcement officers on Wednesday and threatened with a hefty fine.\n\nIn addition to that, Cappelletti explained, the code enforcement officers intimidated the businesses he had contracts with in the city of St. Augustine, essentially putting him out of work.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what this is all about,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cMany times my sign spinners have limited financial options. This is a stop gap for them. But right away they seemed to single out Jeff. In a nutshell, what premise does the county have to say you can\u2019t have a sign guy advertising your business.\u201d\n\nCustom-made signs for the event called the county sign code \u201cunconstitutional, anti-jobs and anti-small business.\u201d\n\nStewart, a former Marine, says he hired Cappelletti, in part, because he was a disabled veteran who didn\u2019t want to go on welfare. Protestors spinning signs on two corners of U.S. 1 on Friday were both unemployed when they began working for Stewart. One, who was wearing a Gumby costume, also is handicapped.\n\nBoth St. Augustine police and St. Johns County Sheriff\u2019s Office cruisers rolled slowly by the protest on Friday but did not stop. The colorful sign spinners heard a lot of honking horns and saw a lot \u201cthumbs-up\u201d acknowledgements from motorists.\n\nHopeful politicians and local activists also joined the fun.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re standing with the sign guys,\u201d said Dave Heimbold of the St. Augustine chapter of the tea party. Heimbold had a bright yellow \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me,\u201d flag and held up a sign asking county commissioners to \u201cloosen up\u201d their sign ordinances or resign.\n\nThe sign protestors were in the City of St. Augustine, which does not prohibit sign walkers.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem is that if you disagree with a policy in St. Johns County the staff become bullies,\u201d said Denver Cook, who is campaigning for county commission. \u201cThey take it personally. This is just a difference of opinion.\u201d\n\nStewart says his first amendment attorney has assured him that the St. Johns County ordinance prohibiting sign walkers that advertise a business would not stand a legal challenge. Cappelletti said he appreciates the support his colleagues gave him Friday afternoon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an honest guy, trying to make an honest living,\u201d Cappelletti said. \u201cThis is my niche. You can tell by the amount of people that are honking that people like me. I\u2019m having fun, and people feed off that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On all four corners of the busy U.S. 1 and State Road 312 intersection on Friday afternoon, costumed sign spinners waived their placards in protest of a county ordinance which prohibits sign walkers in St. Johns County.\u201cYou can\u2019t forget about the little guy who has served his country,\u201d said James \u201cStu\u201d Stewart, who was dressed in a very warm chicken suit for the event. \u201c(St. Johns County) is over-reaching on this.
