The counseling and medication, she says, keep her depression and schizophrenia at bay.\n\n\u201cI come here faithfully,\u201d said Young, 50. \u201cI have to come here or I be feeling I just want to give up.\u201d\n\nYoung isn\u2019t nearly as religious about her physical health, despite painful arthritis, a persistent backache and a family history of cancer. Until this month, she hadn\u2019t seen a medical doctor in more than three years.\n\nPeople with severe mental illnesses are more likely to die prematurely than those without, and it\u2019s often from treatable chronic diseases \u2014 in part because many, like Young, don\u2019t receive regular medical care. They may be uninsured or unable to find doctors who take their insurance. They may be reluctant to seek care in traditional medical offices because of stigma or discrimination.\n\nEven when they do have medical appointments, their doctors rarely communicate with their mental health providers. Experts said the lack of coordination can lead to medication problems, higher health costs and gaps in care.\n\nNow, though, providers are beginning to bridge the gap between medical and mental care, forming partnerships aimed at improving patients\u2019 physical and mental health, and reducing costs at the same time. Such holistic projects are underway in numerous states, including California, New York, Washington, and Florida.\n\n\u201cThere has been a sea change in attitudes,\u201d said Garrett Moran, who directs an academy on the integration of behavioral health and primary care for the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. \u201cIf we are going to bend the cost curve, the integration of behavioral health care and physical health care is essential.\u201d\n\nMoran said the old model \u2014 simply referring patients with mental illness to a primary care doctor \u2014 doesn\u2019t work. Instead, the patients need close, coordinated monitoring by both providers.\n\nThe increased collaboration is driven in part by the Affordable Care Act, which made more people eligible for mental health services and funding for improving coordination of care.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Mental Health,Syndicate,Clinics", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "Recognizing the strong link between psychiatric and physical illnesses, providers across the country are integrating primary care into mental health clinics with the help of federal funding.", "title": "Bridging Gap Between Medical, Mental Health Care", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20160303/bridging-the-gap-between-medical-and-mental-health-care", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "Recognizing the strong link between psychiatric and physical illnesses, providers across the country are integrating primary care into mental health clinics with the help of federal funding.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "article_summary": "Now, though, providers are beginning to bridge the gap between medical and mental care, forming partnerships aimed at improving patients\u2019 physical and mental health, and reducing costs at the same time.\n\u201cIf we are going to bend the cost curve, the integration of behavioral health care and physical health care is essential.\u201dMoran said the old model \u2014 simply referring patients with mental illness to a primary care doctor \u2014 doesn\u2019t work.\nEven when they do have medical appointments, their doctors rarely communicate with their mental health providers.\nThe increased collaboration is driven in part by the Affordable Care Act, which made more people eligible for mental health services and funding for improving coordination of care.\nEven on her worst days, Tracy Young goes to her appointments at the San Fernando Mental Health Center."}
