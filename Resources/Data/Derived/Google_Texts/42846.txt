An eastern Kansas mental health facility director is uncertain if the facility will accept a $1.1 million federal loan because of concerns about state funding.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture says it's awarded the $1.1 million loan to The Guidance Center to expand its Oskaloosa clinic.

Keith Rickard, executive director of The Guidance Center, told The Topeka Capital-Journal the center's board of directors hasn't decided if it will take the money because of funding concerns. He says the center relies on Medicaid, which provides about $6.5 million of its budget. The state general fund also granted it about $960,000 in past years.

Kansas Department of Aging and Disability Services spokeswoman Angela de Rocha said concerns about state grant funding are likely unfounded.
