Carol Shea-Porter, and for the third consecutive election she\u2019s facing the same Republican, former Rep. Frank Guinta.\n\n\u201cNew Hampshire has been susceptible to national trends and this cycle is no different,\u201d said Nathan L. Gonzales, deputy editor or the Rothenberg Political Report. \u201cThe 1st District is competitive enough that neither party will probably ever control it forever.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama promises massive economic, wage growth \u2014 if he gets his way\n\nCongressional districts in New York and Illinois also feature rematches of candidates whose seats have switched parties with the ebb and flow of America\u2019s turbulent political drift. Like Mr. Guinta, the Republican challengers in those races are former House members ousted in 2012 who hope to benefit from national headwinds this cycle that is pushing back against Mr. Obama and his Democratic Party.\n\nBut it\u2019s New Hampshire\u2019s 1st District, which includes Manchester, that has most closely mirrored America\u2019s shifting political moods.\n\nMs. Shea-Porter, a 61-year-old former social worker, first won the seat in the 2006 midterm election. She was part of the Democratic wave that rose in opposition to President George W. Bush and the Iraq war, giving Democrats majority control of the House that year for the first time since 1994.\n\nSEE ALSO: Despite union attacks, Walker grabs lead in Wisconsin re-election bid\n\nWhen Republicans recaptured the House majority in 2010, fueled by the rise of the tea party movement in reaction to skyrocketing federal debt and the passage of Obamacare, voters tossed out Ms. Shea-Porter in favor of Mr. Guinta.\n\nBut in the next election, Mr. Guinta, a former mayor of Manchester, couldn\u2019t hold back the rising tide of Democratic voters who turned out in 2012 to re-elect Mr. Obama and return Ms. Shea-Porter to Congress.\n\nA New England College poll released Wednesday showed Mr. Guinta breaking into the lead over Ms. Shea-Porter 51 percent to 39 percent. The same poll last week showed the race tied at 45 percent.\n\nMr. Guinta has insisted that he isn\u2019t waiting for another \u201cwave\u201d election to carry him into office.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take anything for granted,\u201d said Guinta campaign spokesman Jay Ruais.\n\nBut he noted that the GOP challenger, who has embarked on a \u201cKitchen Table Talks\u201d tour to converse directly with voters, regularly hears about the weak economy, lack of jobs and problems with Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing from people is they are very upset about the direction the country is heading,\u201d said Mr. Ruais. \u201cWe hear that all the time.\u201d\n\nMs. Shea-Porter\u2019s campaign did not respond to email or phone messages.\n\nMr. Guinta\u2019s fellow Republican ex-House colleagues looking to stage a comeback this year are tapping into that same national current.\n\nIn Illinois\u2019 17th District, Republican ex-Rep. Bobby Schilling is running to reclaim the seat he lost to Democratic Rep. Cheri Bustos in 2012.\n\nPolls show the race in a statistical dead heat.\n\nRematches\n\nMr. Schilling won the seat with the help of the tea party wave in 2010, ousting incumbent Democrat Phil Hare. Ms. Bustos, aided by redistricting, took it back for Democrats in the next election.\n\n\u201cWe are in a swing district, which slants Democrat during presidential years but bounces back to a slight Republican lean in off years,\u201d said Schilling campaign spokesman Jon Schweppe. \u201cThat being said, every vote is going to matter, and there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s going to come down to the wire on Election Day.\u201d\n\nA similar race is playing out in the state\u2019s 10th District, where Republican Bob Dold is trying to recapture the seat he lost in 2012 to Democratic Rep. Bradley S. Schneider. The GOP had held the seat for years until redistricting helped Democrats seize it.\n\nMr. Schneider was up 47 percent to 42 percent in a poll commissioned by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in early September.\n\nIn New York\u2019s 18th Congressional District, Republican Nan Hayworth is trying to make a political comeback against Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney.\n\nMs. Hayworth won the seat in the tea party wave of 2010. She lost in the next election to Mr. Maloney, a former Clinton White House aide, after redistricting made the upstate New York district more Democratic.\n\nMr. Maloney led Ms. Hayworth by 8 points, 50 percent to 42 percent, in a Siena College poll last month.\n\nMr. Maloney has repeatedly called Ms. Hayworth a \u201ctea party Republican\u201d and an \u201cextremist.\u201d Ms. Hayworth, who calls herself a moderate, has worked to link Mr. Maloney to Mr. Obama and his unpopular policies.\n\n\u201cThis race continues to be between a Bill Clinton Democrat and tea party Republican, but now voters have the chance to compare Sean\u2019s record of results and creating jobs and Congresswoman Hayworth\u2019s record of partisan gridlock,\u201d said Maloney campaign spokeswoman Stephanie Formas.\n\nTerence Michos, an adviser to the Hayworth campaign, said the district\u2019s Democratic makeup remains a hurdle but Ms. Hayworth is getting a boost the national mood that this year favors the GOP.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a difference in the tide, just where the country is thinking and looking at the president\u2019s policies,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District has become the chief bellwether for American political trends over the last decade, with a Democrat winning the district in 2006, losing it in 2010, regaining it in 2012 &mdash; and now facing a tight battle again.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "New Hampshire\u2019s 1st Congressional District has become the chief bellwether for American political trends over the last decade, with a Democrat winning the district in 2006, losing it in 2010, regaining it in 2012 \u2014 and now facing a tight battle again.", "title": "In New Hampshire, Carol Shea-Porter and Frank Guinta face off for the third time", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/2/in-new-hampshire-carol-shea-porter-and-frank-guint/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/02/102_2014_ap2593836154838201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/02/102_2014_ap2593836154838201.jpg", "description": "New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District has become the chief bellwether for American political trends over the last decade, with a Democrat winning the district in 2006, losing it in 2010, regainin", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "In New Hampshire, Carol Shea-Porter and Frank Guinta face off for the"}, "Author": "S.A.
