The decision specifically referred to residential treatment for anorexia and bulimia but could affect other mental disorders, as well, including autism.\n\nThe decision on Tuesday by the state\u2019s Second Appellate Court trumped an earlier ruling by the Los Angeles County Superior Court.\n\n\u201cAt issue in this appeal is whether the [California Mental Health] Parity Act requires coverage for residential treatment for the eating disorders anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa even where the health plan does not provide coverage,\u201d the ruling stated.\n\nThe three-judge court unanimously agreed mental health treatment is covered under the Parity Act.\n\n\u201cWe conclude that the Legislature in crafting the Parity Act, which uses broad statutory language to mandate the provision of medically necessary services for mental health conditions, recognized that most mental health conditions have a physical basis, and also recognized the fundamental difference between the most effective treatments of mental and physical conditions,\u201d the ruling said.\n\n\u201cThe decision is a sweeping affirmation of the broad scope of mental health coverage required by law,\u201d Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in a written statement. He called it \u201ca resounding victory for consumers.\u201d\n\nThe decision can be appealed to the California Supreme Court. Officials at Blue Shield of California, the defendant in the case, have not decided whether to appeal.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed by the Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling to the extent it elevates coverage requirements for certain mental health conditions over coverage required for all other health conditions,\u201d said a written statement from Blue Shield of California. \u201cWe believe this is contrary to the purpose of the Parity Act. We are still reviewing the decision and evaluating our options, such as seeking re-hearing before the Court of Appeal or filing a Petition for Review with the California Supreme Court.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Insurers must provide a broad range of mental health coverage, according to a ruling from the state Court of Appeal that reversed a Superior Court decision. </p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Insurers must provide a broad range of mental health coverage, according to a ruling from the state Court of Appeal that reversed a Superior Court decision.", "title": "Appeals Court Reverses Lawsuit Ruling, Requires Mental Health Coverage", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/appeals-court-reverses-lawsuit-ruling-requires-mental-health-coverage/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-06-12T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-12T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd2da\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are disappointed by the Court of Appeal\u2019s ruling to the extent it elevates coverage requirements for certain mental health conditions over coverage required for all other health conditions,\u201d said a written statement from Blue Shield of California.\nThe three-judge court unanimously agreed mental health treatment is covered under the Parity Act.\n\u201cThe decision is a sweeping affirmation of the broad scope of mental health coverage required by law,\u201d Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones said in a written statement.\n\u201cAt issue in this appeal is whether the [California Mental Health] Parity Act requires coverage for residential treatment for the eating disorders anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa even where the health plan does not provide coverage,\u201d the ruling stated.\nThe California Court of Appeal this week ruled that insurance companies need to provide all medically necessary treatment for those with mental illness."}
