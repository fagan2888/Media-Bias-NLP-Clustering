Some health plans make the experience worse by refusing to cover medical costs for injuries that are related to suicide or an attempt \u2014 even though experts say that in many cases such exclusions aren\u2019t permitted under federal law.\n\nWhen a 24-year-old woman with bipolar disorder attempted suicide last year by taking an overdose of an anti-anxiety medication, her mother assumed her employer plan covering them both would pay the bills for her daughter\u2019s hospital care. But the insurer declined to pay the $6,600 charge, citing an exclusion for care related to suicide.\n\nAfter negotiations with the hospital, the bill was reduced by half.\n\n\u201cSuicide is a common exclusion,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health policy at George Washington University. \u201cInsurers are all over the place on this, and state law varies tremendously.\u201d In court cases arising from a denial of benefits, \u201cif the suicide attempt is related to a diagnosis that was treated, typically [the courts] will not deny coverage,\u201d says Ann Doucette, a GWU research professor of evaluation and health policy.\n\nUnder 2006 rules implementing the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), employment-based health plans can\u2019t deny eligibility for benefits or charge a person more because he has a particular medical condition such as diabetes or depression.\n\nInsurers, however, are allowed to deny coverage for injuries caused by a specific activity or for those that arise from a particular cause that is spelled out in the policy. (These are called \u201csource-of-injury\u201d exclusions.) For example, an insurer that generally covers head injuries and broken bones could decide not to cover those injuries \u2014 and spell that out beforehand in the policy \u2014 if they\u2019re caused by risky recreational activities such as skydiving or bungee jumping. In a similar vein, insurers sometimes apply source-of-injury exclusions to refuse to cover injuries that are intentionally self-inflicted.\n\nMental health advocates and government experts point to the HIPAA rules, noting that source-of-injury exclusions aren\u2019t allowed if they\u2019re the result of a medical condition. So if someone is severely depressed or suffers from another mental illness and sustains injuries from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, for example, the health plan can\u2019t deny claims, these experts say, if the plan would generally cover the treatment for gunshot wounds that were not intentionally self-inflicted.\n\nFurther, the 2006 regulations \u201cmake clear that such source-of-injury exclusions cannot be imposed even if the mental health condition is not diagnosed before the injury,\u201d a Department of Labor spokesman said in an email.\n\nQuestions about suicide exclusions in individual health insurance market plans should be directed to the state insurance offices or the federal Department of Health and Human Services, according to the Labor spokesman. Someone enrolled in a group plan may file an appeal with the health plan.\n\nThis column is produced through a collaboration between The Post and Kaiser Health News.
