TRENTON — Hospitals in New Jersey spent about $998 million in charity care to treat working poor and uninsured patients last year, rising a modest $2.5 million from 2011, according to a report from the state Department of Health.



New Jersey's 72 hospitals share $675 million in charity care reimbursement from the state and federal government to help offset those costs, the equivalent of about two of every three dollars spent.



Prepared by the Department's Office of Healthcare Financing, the report released Friday examines a trend of what appears to be a leveling-off of expenses, but with sharp dips and increases in pockets around the state.



After reaching a high of $1.027 billion in 2010, charity care receipts fell to $995 million in 2011 and inched up to $997 million in 2012. Essex and Hudson counties had the largest decrease in documented charity care of $12.9 million and $10.6 million, respectively between 2011 and 2012 while Mercer and Hunterdon saw the largest increase of $11 million.



Hospitals located in cities, such as Camden, Newark, and Paterson, reported spending an average of $23.3 million -- twice as much as the $9.9 million average spent by suburban hospitals.

Suzanne Ianni, president and CEO of the Hospital Alliance of New Jersey, representing 16 urban hospitals, said she expects to see rates decline as the Affordable Care Act allows people with slightly higher incomes to obtain coverage through Medicaid next year.

"However, certain hospitals may have seen decreases as a result of their population health initiatives," Ianni said. "Hospitals are not only investing in staff to help patients enroll in Medicaid but also in 'feet on the street' to help low income patients better manage their chronic diseases like diabetes or asthma where unmanaged patients frequently rely on the ER. That type of management could lead to a decrease in a hospital's documented charity care."

"It is important to note that none of these additional population health management program costs are captured in documented charity care -- so the billion in costs is actually understated," she added.

New Jersey residents who earn below 301% of the federal poverty level (no more than $34,470 for one person) who do not qualify for Medicaid or any other insurance are eligible to receive free or reduced rate charity care services. New Jersey hospitals are required by law to provide all necessary care regardless of a patient's ability to pay.
