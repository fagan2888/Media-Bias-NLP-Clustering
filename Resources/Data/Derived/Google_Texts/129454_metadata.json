Mostly volunteer-run free clinics are hoping funding from the legislature can help them serve more people.\n\nWith county health department care declining, uninsured Floridians have limited options. Theresa White and Meg Lokey work with free clinics in Clearwater and are hoping to change that.\n\n\u201cWe see people who don\u2019t have insurance, don\u2019t qualify for government programs, government assistance. We are their safety net. There\u2019s a big gap still even with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Lokey.\n\nWhite and Lokey are helping the Florida Association of Free and Charitable Clinics lobby the legislature in hopes of getting state funding for the 90 clinics around the state.\n\n\u201cMost of them don\u2019t have jobs, a lot of them don\u2019t have the ability to go to a dentist, to fix their teeth, to get dental services that they need to get a job. So our services helps increase their chances of being able to get work,\u201d said White.\n\nThe legislature approved $9 million for the charity care last year, but it was ultimately vetoed by the Governor.\n\nPalm Beach County Medical Society CEO Tenna Wiles says that more than 125,000 Floridians received free care last year. She says the vetoed money could have helped even more.\n\n\u201cThey find themselves without coverage at all, this could be cases of people needing neurosurgery, we\u2019ve performed open heart surgery on our patients. Our physicians and our volunteers provide this free of cost,\u201d she said.\n\nWiles says that nearly $160 million dollars worth of health care services were provided free to the uninsured through the clinics last year.\n\nThe Senate has included $9.5 million for free clinics in their budget proposal and advocates hope the House will follow suit.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Mostly volunteer-run free clinics are hoping funding from the legislature can help them serve more people.", "language": "english", "author": "Matt Galka", "og": {"description": "Mostly volunteer-run free clinics are hoping funding from the legislature can help them serve more people.", "title": "Florida's Free Clinics Push for State Funding", "url": "http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Funding-for-Floridas-Free-Clinics-368881491.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/719/10A/71910A20135249C38F6B145E49C33C46", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/4D4/AC8/4D4AC8E36F05441EABEDEB03BAA24E2B.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wctv.tv", "description": "Mostly volunteer-run free clinics are hoping funding from the legislature can help them serve more people.", "title": "Florida's Free Clinics Push for State Funding", "url": "http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/Funding-for-Floridas-Free-Clinics-368881491.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/nurse+doctor+clipboard+generic+ws.jpg", "creator": "@wctv", "site": "@wctv", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Florida's Free Clinics Push for State Funding", "google-site-verification": "VLpGbxCsgs1871fd1G59F0FVrlUu5DfthTQ8LrtSaNQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Floridas Free Clinics Push for"}, "article_summary": "By: Matt GalkaFebruary 15, 2016TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Around $3 million uninsured Floridians struggle to find adequate healthcare in the state.\nMostly volunteer-run free clinics are hoping funding from the legislature can help them serve more people.\nThe Senate has included $9.5 million for free clinics in their budget proposal and advocates hope the House will follow suit.\nWhite and Lokey are helping the Florida Association of Free and Charitable Clinics lobby the legislature in hopes of getting state funding for the 90 clinics around the state.\nTheresa White and Meg Lokey work with free clinics in Clearwater and are hoping to change that."}
