He is preceded in death by his father, Russell Alleck Zimmerman Sr. Al worked at Kroger Grocery Store as a bag boy before proudly enlisting in the United States Army, serving a tour in Thailand and Germany. After military duty, he continued working in the grocery business at Kroger, then managed a Thriftway Supermarket at Hollins and then at Grandin Road. After leaving Thriftway, he started his landscaping business, Super Lawn Enterprises, where he took great pride in his landscaping and the manicuring of lawns. After ending his landscaping business and before retirement, he worked for a short period of time in Inventory for Walmart at Valley View. He loved being outdoors, spending time with his John Deer Tractor while working in his yard and also enjoyed woodworking. His greatest love was spending time with family, especially his grandchildren, Megan and Austin. Al loved to travel to Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, and introduced the love of the Great Smokey Mountains to his grandchildren. Those left to cherish his memory are his loving wife of 47 years, Sharon; daughter, Crissy Hunley and her husband, Bryan; his two beloved grandchildren, Megan and Austin Hunley all of Roanoke; his mother, Louise Zimmerman of Roanoke; a mother-in-law, Lottie Turner of Salem; sister-in-law and her husband, Peggy and Mike Martin of Salem; sister-in-law and her husband, Martha and Clayton Duncan of New Castle; two nephews, David Martin and Shaun Duncan and their families. Along with a host of other relatives, dear friends and his beloved feline companion, Ziva. The family would like to give a special thank you to the Staff of 6 West at Lewis-Gale Medical Center and Good Samaritan Hospice; to Brittany Leftwich for all her help in guiding us during this difficult time; the Pastoral Staff at North Roanoke Baptist Church; and a thank you to all who brought food, supported and prayed for and with us during this time.
