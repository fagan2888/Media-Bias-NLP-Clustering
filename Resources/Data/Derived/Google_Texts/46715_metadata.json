Raw, unsettling emotion blurred my vision.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t just about losing a great man \u2014 perhaps the epitome of what a hockey official should be. It also was about unified first-stage bereavement from a very passionate sector of sport.\n\nI was moved by the Colorado hockey community, its appreciation of my reporting and the wonderful stories I had the privilege of telling about Butch, who was loved by so many.\n\nI was moved because I love the game, just like Butch, and I felt the entire community was feeling the same pain over the loss of a man who had no enemies.\n\n\u201cI always joked that he wanted to be a referee because he needed somebody not to like him,\u201d Jay Stickney told me.\n\nStickney \u2014 unquestionably the funniest person I know \u2014 made me cry when talking about his University of Colorado fraternity brother from the early 1990s, and spending a couple of years post-graduation with Butch in Maui.\n\n\u201cHe was everything I ever wanted in a friend,\u201d Stickney said of the \u201cBig Kahuna,\u201d who was of American Indian descent and only looked Hawaiian.\n\nStickney is the radio guy for the University of Denver hockey team, and Mousseau worked countless Pioneers games since he broke in with the Western Collegiate Hockey Association in 2003.\n\nMousseau worked at every level, from Front Range beer leagues to Colorado Amateur Hockey Association events to the NHL. Yes, he worked at the highest level \u2014 which helps explain why every NHL official donned handwritten \u201cBM\u201d stickers on their helmets throughout North America on Saturday.\n\nAccording to Dave Jackson, an NHL referee who lives in Colorado, the stickers will be on every official\u2019s helmet all weekend. Jackson worked the Avalanche-Wild game Saturday at the Pepsi Center, and I visited with the four-man crew pregame. They all knew Butch and will forever respect his legacy.\n\nMousseau, who was 48 when he died Friday, has his NHL officials jersey and skates enshrined at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. He worked an NHL preseason game, becoming the first American Indian to do so, soon after 9/11 and with Canadian officials unable to cross the border.\n\nBut Butch\u2019s bread and butter was the college game. And he was the best.\n\n\u201cButch loved officiating and he had great respect for the student-athletes and coaches,\u201d said former DU coach George Gwozdecky, who worked with Mousseau for most of Gwozdecky\u2019s 19 years with the program. \u201cNo matter how difficult or intense a game might be, Butch always wore a big smile on his face.\n\n\u201cHis smile had a tremendous calming effect on everyone. On the occasions where I would disagree with a call, his self- deprecating humor and warm personality would quickly diffuse an emotional situation. He was very well-liked by everyone and perhaps the most popular official in the WCHA. \u2026 He will be missed terribly by everyone who knew him.\u201d\n\nButch died of a brain hemorrhage. He fell backward during warm-ups before a WCHA playoff game. He was not wearing a helmet, and his hands were in his pockets when he fell.\n\nHis death has taught us two things: Hockey lost a great human and ambassador of the sport. And never skate without knowing how to break your fall.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers @denverpost.com or @mikechambers\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nAlex Ovechkin, LW, Capitals\n\nWhen: Friday, 7 p.m., Pepsi Center.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: The Capitals, who are a lock to win the Presidents\u2019 Trophy as the team with the best regular-season record, make their annual appearance in Denver.\n\nBackground: With 43 goals going into Saturday\u2019s games, Ovechkin most likely will be trying to add to his league-leading total against his Russian Olympic and World Cup of Hockey teammate, Avs goalie Semyon Varlamov.\n\nTerry Frei\u2019s take: One of the memorable moments in the Avalanche\u2019s 2013-14 season was Ovechkin\u2019s eventful November game in Denver. Avalanche defenseman Jan Hejda\u2019s stick got under Ovechkin, and he fell and slid into the boards headfirst as Hejda fell on him. Ovechkin stayed down as trainers rushed out, and Varlamov appeared concerned from his nearby crease. Ovechkin made it up and, when he arrived at the bench, unleashed a colorful verbal reaction to the play and no penalty call \u2014 well, you just knew it wasn\u2019t a discussion of the weather \u2014 shown on the then-new scoreboard screens. He didn\u2019t miss a shift, and the crowd, which had given him polite applause as he went to the bench, booed him the rest of the night, apparently thinking, among other things, that he had been imitating a thespian soccer player. It\u2019s all part of the show, though, with the best player in the league \u2026 or at least its top goal-scorer. He\u2019s still only 30 and could win the Hart Trophy for the fourth time, if it doesn\u2019t go to Patrick Kane. Ovechkin had a goal and an assist in the Capitals\u2019 3-2 win in Denver last season.\n\nTerry Frei, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chambers: Butch Mousseau was the best, on and off; the ice", "title": "Chambers: Butch Mousseau was the best, on and off; the ice", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/26/chambers-butch-mousseau-was-the-best-on-and-off-the-ice/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-26T16:32:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-26T16:32:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "His death has taught us two things: Hockey lost a great human and ambassador of the sport.\nStickney is the radio guy for the University of Denver hockey team, and Mousseau worked countless Pioneers games since he broke in with the Western Collegiate Hockey Association in 2003.\nMousseau worked at every level, from Front Range beer leagues to Colorado Amateur Hockey Association events to the NHL.\nTerry Frei\u2019s take: One of the memorable moments in the Avalanche\u2019s 2013-14 season was Ovechkin\u2019s eventful November game in Denver.\nI was moved by the Colorado hockey community, its appreciation of my reporting and the wonderful stories I had the privilege of telling about Butch, who was loved by so many."}
