This will likely lead to increased costs for carriers, and could mean lower profits for insurers as employers transition from fully insured products to less profitable administrative services only (ASO) accounts. It also could mean a sicker risk pool among employers that decide not to self-insure, AIS reported.\n\nIn fact, insurers say self-insured employers generate lower earnings. During a Feb. 6 conference call to discuss fourth-quarter 2013 earnings, Aetna Inc. president and CEO Mark Bertolini noted that commercial risk members offered four-times to five-times greater contribution to earnings than ASO members on a dollar basis.\n\nCurrently, the federal government has granted exemptions to large-group employers from some provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as the premium rating rules, essential health benefits (EHBs), actuarial value requirements and the single risk pool, as the law\u2019s drafters were focused on reforming the small-group and individual markets. But the exemptions for large employers go away in 2017 if states opt to expand exchanges to include large employers.\n\nSurprisingly few employers have paid attention to this provision because they incorrectly believe that they will be affected only if they buy coverage through the exchange, Christopher Condeluci, of counsel at the law firm Venable LLP, says.\n\n\u201cBut the statute is crystal clear on this\u2026If a state makes this type of election, then the adjusted community rating rules will apply to large group inside and outside of the exchange.no more experience rating,\u201d Condeluci explained in the AIS report. \u201cThe reason we have the same rules inside and outside the exchange is to make sure the exchange doesn\u2019t get adversely selected against. And state regulators will have no choice but to impose the EHB actuarial value and the single risk pool to plans sold outside of the exchange as well as inside.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beginning in 2017, states have the option of allowing large employers to purchase a fully insured health plan through public insurance exchanges, and it is", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "Beginning in 2017, states have the option of allowing large employers to purchase a fully insured health plan through public insurance exchanges, and it is likely that the rules that apply to large\u2026", "title": "Large employers may move to self-insure starting in 2017", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2014/03/01/large-employers-may-move-to-self-insure-starting-in-2017/", "image": {"width": 223, "identifier": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Condeluci-Christopher.jpg", "height": 260}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-01T20:55:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-01T20:55:25+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "article_summary": "But the exemptions for large employers go away in 2017 if states opt to expand exchanges to include large employers.\nIt also could mean a sicker risk pool among employers that decide not to self-insure, AIS reported.\n\u201cThe reason we have the same rules inside and outside the exchange is to make sure the exchange doesn\u2019t get adversely selected against.\nAnd state regulators will have no choice but to impose the EHB actuarial value and the single risk pool to plans sold outside of the exchange as well as inside.\u201d\nThis will likely lead to increased costs for carriers, and could mean lower profits for insurers as employers transition from fully insured products to less profitable administrative services only (ASO) accounts."}
