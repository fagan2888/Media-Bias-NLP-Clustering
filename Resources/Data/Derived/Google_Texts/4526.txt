Another View -- Jeanne Dietsch: How this entrepreneur would improve NH's economy



AS A SUCCESSFUL tech entrepreneur whose company has brought millions in revenues into New Hampshire for nearly 20 years, I cringe at the constant rant for lower business taxes as a cure-all to attract and retain jobs. If legislators who join in this clamor actually believe what they are saying, they have not done their homework.

..

First, let’s look at facts, particularly the facts that many politicians seem to ignore: California has the highest business taxes in the nation and the highest economic growth. Alabama has the seventh-lowest tax rate and sixth-lowest growth rate in the United States. That does not mean we should raise business taxes, but it does prove that cutting them is not the magic bullet many legislators wish.

..

So what is the key? It’s not a secret. A foundational principle in economics is that exports improve a region’s economy. Exporters — such as the company I own with my husband — bring additional revenues into a state, whereas locally focused companies circulate the money already there. Exporting companies feed local suppliers of parts and services and pay significantly higher wages, on average, than non-exporters. Their employees spend more money and boost the state’s economy.

..

So how can New Hampshire increase its exports? The answer came up frequently in meetings of state business leaders Gov. John Lynch used to hold. When asked what the state needed to help businesses most, the No. 1 answer was consistently: more skilled workers. New Hampshire manufacturers claim they could add hundreds of jobs and increase revenues dramatically with the right labor force.

..

Why do top businesses want more skilled workers? Why did Google open a division and hire 300 workers next to the University of Michigan, and Caterpillar build a plant and hire 500 workers near the University of Georgia? Because highly trained workers are what give their products and services the edge that makes them exportable!

..

American companies can rarely compete internationally on cost, but we can often compete on quality and other features that derive from a first-rate workforce. Capital can buy and run equipment anywhere; talent is the goldmine that successful companies seek. Educational institutions are the magnets that attract the talent and build the skills that let companies build value into their output. Yet most Senate and House members voted for an inconsequential business tax break rather than additional funding to build the workforce necessary to improve our economy!

..

The second most frequent request at Gov. Lynch’s meetings of New Hampshire business leaders was for high-quality, reliable, affordable infrastructure. Businesses cannot do business without consistent access to adequate energy, communications and transport.

..

Not only have legislators inadequately funded road maintenance in the new budget, but the Senate Committee on Science, Technology & Energy did not support amending Article 33.3 in state regulations, which the House passed last year. This would have improved business access to 21st-century gigabit broadband communications across underserved parts of the state.

..

Such regulations are not even part of the budget. There is no cost assigned to them. Yet an amendment to a regulation that bars most New Hampshire towns from bonding improvements in their Internet connectivity was buried in committee for “further study.” This means it will remain illegal for months or years for most towns to bond upgrades that would enable multi-location companies or entrepreneurs or telecommuters in online media, distributed engineering projects, GIS, bioengineering, advanced telemedicine, “big data” analysis, aerospace, entertainment, artificial intelligence, Internet-of-Things and many other growing industries to thrive here.

..

Without such access, each firm with high upload needs has to arrange for its own broadband. Why move here when in Massachusetts they can just plug in? Legislators who claim to support deregulation and business enterprise must give towns the freedom to bring their broadband infrastructure up to competitive levels.

..

Why do purportedly pro-business legislators ignore business leaders’ priorities? Do they think they understand companies’ needs better than the CEOs who run them?



I cannot answer that question. But I can clearly see that the recent budget and Senate regulatory inaction fail to address pressing needs for talent, skills and a high-quality infrastructure to create prosperity across New Hampshire.
