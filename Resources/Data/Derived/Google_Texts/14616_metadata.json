Kasich is continuing his positive vision of solving problems.\u201d\n\nFor much of the Republican primary, Kasich\u2019s campaign has flown under the radar, drowned out by the noise of front-runner Donald Trump\u2019s renegade campaign and the bitter infighting between the GOP\u2019s establishment and anti-establishment wings.\n\nLumped in with the other current and former governors running for the White House \u2013 Bush, who was Florida\u2019s chief executive, and Christie, who holds office in New Jersey \u2013 Kasich is duking it out with them and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for the lead in the GOP\u2019s establishment lane. Meanwhile, Trump, the celebrity billionaire, and the Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a favorite of conservative outsiders, are fighting for first place in national polls.\n\nWhile most of the other candidates\u2019 poll numbers have been mostly flat, Kasich\u2019s approval ratings have been slowly on the rise since December: the website RealClearPolitics has him at 12 percent in its polling average, and they seem poised to peak just in time for the Feb. 9 New Hampshire primary. And the governor, who has largely bypassed Iowa, is staking his White House run on a strong showing in the Granite State.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Decision 2016 [News]", "title": "Kasich\u2019s NH Surge Puts Target on His Back", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Groups supporting Chris Christie and Jeb Bush are on the attack against the Ohio governor.", "title": "Kasich\u2019s NH Surge Puts Target on His Back", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-01-29/kasichs-nh-surge-puts-target-on-his-back", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/c6/1f/ec70a02c4b6e8c120e1d7dd709df/160129-kasich-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Kasich\u2019s NH Surge Puts Target on His Back", "description": "Groups supporting Chris Christie and Jeb Bush are on the attack against the Ohio governor.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Jan. 29, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Gabrielle Levy,Pulse,Kasich, John,New Hampshire,New Hampshire primaries,2016 presidential election,advertising,Decision 2016 [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Groups supporting Chris Christie and Jeb Bush are on the attack against the Ohio governor."}, "article_summary": "A spokesman for Kasich\u2019s campaign, while defending the governor\u2019s record, indicated this problem is one they don\u2019t mind having.\nAnd the governor, who has largely bypassed Iowa, is staking his White House run on a strong showing in the Granite State.\nKasich is continuing his positive vision of solving problems.\u201dFor much of the Republican primary, Kasich\u2019s campaign has flown under the radar, drowned out by the noise of front-runner Donald Trump\u2019s renegade campaign and the bitter infighting between the GOP\u2019s establishment and anti-establishment wings.\nMeanwhile, Trump, the celebrity billionaire, and the Texas Sen.
