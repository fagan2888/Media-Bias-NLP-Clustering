Staying at Bellagio, they walked the Strip in the morning and then had lunch. Nathan then went back to his room and Miranda went off to explore another casino with a girlfriend who had also flown into town.\n\nOn that day Miranda did what she always did when she was awake \u2014 she indulged a nervous habit that she said relaxed her, cracking her neck several times an hour. She didn\u2019t have to use her hands to bring about the reassuring pop, just twisted her head to the right.\n\nLate in the afternoon, the mother of a little girl \u2014 the Wenskes left their 4-year-old daughter with relatives in Texas \u2014 became nauseated. Her left side became what she describes as \u201chypersensitive with a pins and needles feeling.\u201d\n\nWhat she didn\u2019t know then \u2014 and wouldn\u2019t find out for days from Agrawal \u2014 is that she was born with a weakness in the wall of her vertebral artery, which is in the neck and supplies blood to the brain. Years of neck cracking had probably injured the artery wall, forcing it to close up and spit out a blood clot that blocked blood flow to the brain.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still hard to believe,\u201d Miranda drawled in a phone call from her home near Yoakum, Texas. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I was in Las Vegas when it happened. Our little hospitals around here couldn\u2019t have handled it. It could\u2019ve been really bad.\u201d\n\nThinking she could handle her problem by cooling off, Miranda showered. When that didn\u2019t help, Nathan called the Bellagio\u2019s front desk. The hotel\u2019s emergency medical services team checked her out for heat exhaustion and gave her a stroke test that she passed. But 20 minutes after the team left, she felt worse.\n\nThis time when Nathan called the front desk an ambulance was summoned. Soon Miranda was in Spring Valley Hospital\u2019s emergency room. Again emergency personnel, whose tests still didn\u2019t signal a stroke, thought she must be suffering ill effects from the heat.\n\nBut then, just as she was about to be released from the emergency room, her body shut down. She was frantically administered CPR. Then she was placed on a ventilator. She could no longer breathe for herself.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize at first how serious it was,\u201d Nathan Wenske said. \u201cI thought maybe she was allergic to something they gave her. \u2026 When one of the nurses told me it was time to start calling other members of the family, I got it.\u201d\n\nA CT scan would show a clot had formed that blocked the flow of blood to critical parts of her brain. She was given the clot-busting drug tPA to attempt to dissolve the clot, but a second scan showed the clot had not fully dissolved.\n\nIt was time, Agrawal realized, to mobilize Spring Valley Hospital\u2019s special procedures team and use what amounts to a tiny Penumbra Inc. vacuum the Valley Health System made available to him about two years ago.\n\nThe Penumbra system, the doctor says, reduces the risk of bleeding, and may be used up to eight hours after stroke symptoms appear. TPA must be used within three hours.\n\n\u201cPenumbra gives us another option when patients arrive at the hospital too late to receive tPA, or when the clot is too large for tPA to dissolve it completely,\u201d Agrawal said.\n\nSitting recently before scans that showed the blood vessels inside Miranda\u2019s body, Agrawal, an interventional neuroradiologist, pointed to the path followed by a catheter to get to the blood clot. Penumbra representative Kevin Dutcher showed how the vacuum attaches to a catheter.\n\n\u201cI take a small tube (catheter) from the femoral artery in the groin into the brain and place the catheter into the clot. Then we connect the catheter to a suction cannister. It is like a mini vacuum cleaner. You move the catheter back and forth just like a vacuum cleaner. It sucks the clot out into the cannister.\u201d\n\nIn less than an hour, Agrawal had removed the blood clot; it came out in one piece. He also inserted a stent to ensure the weakened artery in Miranda\u2019s neck stays open.\n\n\u201cWhat she suffered from is always fatal unless the clot is removed,\u201d Agrawal said. \u201cThe reason this patient had complete recovery is because the ER physician recognized the problem fast, the stroke neurologist was consulted immediately and my special procedures team was activated right away. Time is critical as close to 9 million brain cells die every minute.\u201d\n\nWhile he\u2019s also had good success using the device on other patients, the 46-year-old practitioner said that far too often patients don\u2019t present in time for treatment.\n\n\u201cIf the brain tissue is dead, there is no benefit of clot removal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were so fortunate that she actually happened to be in the hospital when the clot actually happened. She started feeling weird in the hotel and it was getting ready to go but didn\u2019t happen until the hospital. I can\u2019t stress enough how important time is with a stroke.\u201d\n\nStrokes, the third leading cause of death in the United States, kill about 160,000 Americans each year, the American Stroke Association reports. Strokes are also the leading cause of disability. Depending on the brain region affected, a stroke may cause paralysis, speech impairment and loss of memory and reasoning ability.\n\nAgrawal said that what almost surely happened because of Miranda\u2019s neck cracking should be a cautionary tale for everyone. Yes, he said, it\u2019s true that she was born with an abnormality in an artery in her neck, but such behavior over a long period can be dangerous for anyone.\n\nFor years there has been a debate as to the risk of stroke because neck cracking by chiropractors. A 2012 study found: \u201cConclusive evidence is lacking for a strong association between neck manipulation and stroke, but is also absent for no association.\u201d\n\nAgrawal is not a fan of such procedures.\n\n\u201cIt may be one in thousands of a chance,\u201d Agrawal said, \u201cbut if you\u2019re the one, I\u2019m not sure you care about how small the risk is.\u201d\n\nMiranda, a construction company secretary, no longer cracks her neck. But she remembers what Agrawal said when he saw she\u2019d recover completely.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018There\u2019s my miracle,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be a miracle.\u201d\n\nContact reporter Paul Harasim at pharasim@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2908.", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/vacuum-extracts-blood-clot-threatened-take-tourist-s-life", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "PAUL HARASIM LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Vacuum extracts blood clot that threatened to take tourist\u2019s life", "twitter": {"description": "Miranda Wenske came to Las Vegas last summer to celebrate her birthday and wedding anniversary, not to try to kill herself.", "title": "Vacuum extracts blood clot that threatened to take tourist\u2019s life", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/vacuum-extracts-blood-clot-threatened-take-tourist-s-life", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_Wenske-stroke-1_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_Wenske-stroke-2_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_Wenske-stroke-3_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_wenske-stroke-4_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_STROKEVACCUM_060514CS_001_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_STROKEVACCUM_060514CS_002_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_STROKEVACCUM_060514CS_003_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_STROKEVACCUM_060514CS_004_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_STROKEVACCUM_060514CS_005_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_STROKEVACCUM_060514CS_007_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_STROKEVACCUM_060514CS_008_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_STROKEVACCUM_060514CS_009_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_STROKEVACCUM_060514CS_019_0.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "description": "Miranda Wenske came to Las Vegas last summer to celebrate her birthday and wedding anniversary, not to try to kill herself.", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1888611"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1454712", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=1454712", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540820524", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Miranda Wenske came to Las Vegas last summer to celebrate her birthday and wedding anniversary, not to try to kill herself.", "title": "Vacuum extracts blood clot that threatened to take tourist\u2019s life", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/vacuum-extracts-blood-clot-threatened-take-tourist-s-life", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_Wenske-stroke-1_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-author": "PAUL HARASIM LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,Life,", "parsely-section": "Health", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-22T16:30:05-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Health,Life", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_Wenske-stroke-1_0.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-06-22T23:30:05Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe460c\"", "article_summary": "It sucks the clot out into the cannister.\u201dIn less than an hour, Agrawal had removed the blood clot; it came out in one piece.\nYears of neck cracking had probably injured the artery wall, forcing it to close up and spit out a blood clot that blocked blood flow to the brain.\nSitting recently before scans that showed the blood vessels inside Miranda\u2019s body, Agrawal, an interventional neuroradiologist, pointed to the path followed by a catheter to get to the blood clot.\nIt is also beyond question that her miraculous recovery from a blood clot thrown into her brain is another sign of how important technological advances are to medicine.\nShe would have succeeded if it hadn\u2019t been for Dr. Raj Agrawal, who knew how to use a vacuum cleaner."}
