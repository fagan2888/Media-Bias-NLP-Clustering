The company, which has a significant presence in Denver, tracks billions of e-mails. It knows whether marketing messages make it to a person\u2019s inbox or spam folder. It knows which e-mails consumers opened, ignored or deleted. ReturnPath knows a scary lot of information.\n\nIn its latest report \u201cThe Art and Science of Effective Subject Lines,\u201d ReturnPath analyzed 9 million subject lines received by more than 2 million subscribers in the first two months of this year. The report tells marketers what subject lines are getting consumers to actually click and open. The good news for consumers? Clickbait keywords are on the way out. Clickbait are catchy titles that can trick users into paying attention. Often, we\u2019re let down.\n\nIn ReturnPath\u2019s report, the company divided subject lines into 10 categories, including urgency, discount, news and clickbait. Of the 10, subject lines categorized as \u201cclickbait\u201d performed the worse.\n\nHopefully, we\u2019ll be seeing fewer e-mails with these \u201cclickbait\u201d keywords in the subject line:\n\n\u2022 get rid of\n\n\u2022 secret of\n\n\u2022 shocking\n\n\u2022 what you need to know\n\n\u2022 won\u2019t believe\n\nBut since this is a report intended to help marketers, ReturnPath also mentions which subject lines did well. Urgent headlines did the best. Those words include:\n\n\u2022 expire\n\n\u2022 expiring\n\n\u2022 extended\n\n\u2022 hurry\n\n\u2022 last chance\n\n\u2022 limited time\n\n\u2022 now\n\n\u2022 running out\n\n\u2022 still time\n\nWhile ReturnPath has categorized how well certain words work or don\u2019t work, this doesn\u2019t mean your inbox is going to get a marketing reprieve. For the most part, you asked for those marketing messages from retailers and other sites. Whether you open the e-mail or not, marketers are still trying to figure out new ways to get you to respond.\n\n\u201cClickbait-type headlines draw people in through curiosity. This tactic doesn\u2019t work in the long run because people tire of it,\u201d said Tom Sather, ReturnPath\u2019s senior director of research who is based in Denver.\n\nOther words that are in decline:\n\n\u2022 cheapest\n\n\u2022 quickest\n\n\u2022 buy\n\n\u2022 read\n\n\u2022 see\n\n\u2022 announcing\n\n\u2022 2-for-1\n\n\u2022 clearance\n\n\u2022 here\u2019s how\n\n\u2022 running out.\n\nBut Sather said there\u2019s no magic to writing effective subject lines. The new way to creating an effective subject line is to test two different ones and pick the better performing one.\n\n\u201cThe new trickery isn\u2019t really trickery at all, but systematic A/B testing on all subject lines. By choosing the winner of the test each time, marketers don\u2019t need to worry about the philosophical reason behind why someone responded to a particular subject line. Instead, marketers can narrow down the possibilities of what to test by looking at their competitors or other similar lines of business as a starting place,\u201d Sather said.\n\nPast stories on ReturnPath:\n\nView RSS feed\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "a/b testing,Denver,e-mail,marketing,New York,ReturnPath,spam,Tom Sather", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Tech+", "description": "Related", "title": "Report: Clickbait not so effective, steer clear of \"shocking,\" \"secret\" | Tech+ \u2014 The Denver Post", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/04/28/report-clickbait-not-so-effective-steer-clear-of-shocking-secret/16985/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/04/subjectlines.jpg?fit=472%2C270", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Related", "title": "Report: Clickbait not so effective, steer clear of \u201cshocking,\u201d \u201csecret\u201d", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/04/28/report-clickbait-not-so-effective-steer-clear-of-shocking-secret/16985/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/04/subjectlines.jpg?fit=472%2C270", "creator": "@gadgetress", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "ReturnPath provides tips as to what key words are losing effectiveness when trying to get someone to open an e-mail."}, "article_summary": "In its latest report \u201cThe Art and Science of Effective Subject Lines,\u201d ReturnPath analyzed 9 million subject lines received by more than 2 million subscribers in the first two months of this year.\nIn ReturnPath\u2019s report, the company divided subject lines into 10 categories, including urgency, discount, news and clickbait.\nThe report tells marketers what subject lines are getting consumers to actually click and open.\n\u201cThe new trickery isn\u2019t really trickery at all, but systematic A/B testing on all subject lines.\nOf the 10, subject lines categorized as \u201cclickbait\u201d performed the worse."}
