Medical marijuana has been legal in Louisiana since the legislature approved it in 1991, but the state hasn\u2019t been able to pass regulations on it, which keeps it out of reach of people who could use it. Louisiana dispensaries haven\u2019t flourished to get the medicine to the people the way they did in Colorado after Senate Bill 109 and House Bill 1248 passed in 2010 to set up licensing and governance. The Colorado rules came a decade after state voters passed medical use with Amendment 20 in 2000, and two years before recreational pot was approved with Amendment 64 in 2012.\n\nSo this past week Baton Rouge\u2019s Rep. Dalton Honore\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s pronounced on-uh-RAY \u2014 came to Colorado to learn more, according to article posted Sunday afternoon on the website for The Town Talk newspaper in Alexandria, La.\n\n\u201cAs we speak, I\u2019m in Colorado now talking with legislators and policy advisers to see how the program is going in Colorado,\u201d he told reporter Kaleb Causey on Thursday.\n\nThe Louisiana legislature begins its two-month session Monday, but Honor\u00e9, a Democrat, has pre-filed two pot bills. House Bill 6 would legitimize the state\u2019s medical marijuana industry, and House Bill 117 would allow Louisianans to vote next year on decriminalizing and taxing recreational marijuana.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve seen a huge tax increase,\u201d Honore\u2019 told Causey of Colorado. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to get some facts and figures together. The crime rate has gone down. Traffic fatalities have had a tremendous drop. The arrests of possession of marijuana has dropped from more than 30,000 annually to 2,000. Colorado has accumulated $60 million from the taxes.\u201d\n\nHis arrests numbers are close to those compiled by the pro-pot Drug Policy Alliance, if you count just possession arrests. But all court cases \u2014 including cultivation and distribution \u2014 fell from 39,027 cases in 2011 to 2,036 last year. He hit us a bit low on tax revenue, though. Colorado pulled in about $76 million from taxes and fees in 2014.\n\nAs a legislative trailblazer on the controversial issue of pot, Honore\u2019 is the equivalent to Colorado\u2019s Rep. Jonathan Singer, D-Longmont. Singer, 35, brought a background in social work to the legislative task. Honore\u2019, 72, brought 32 years of law enforcement experience to the issue.\n\nHonore\u2019 ran an unsuccessful 2010 campaign for sheriff in East Baton Rouge Parish, the agency for which Honore\u2019 became the first African-American sheriff\u2019s deputy in 1965, eventually rising to the rank of commander and later serving as a district attorney\u2019s investigator.\n\n\u201cIf I can get it to the people, it will pass with flying colors,\u201d Honore told NOLA.com last month of a potential 2016 decriminalization vote.\n\nThe article cited a Louisiana State University survey last year that indicated 79 percent of Louisianans supported some degree of marijuana legalization.\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, said last year he could support a tightly regulated medical marijuana trade, but he opposes full pot legalizaton.\n\nTwenty-three states and the District of Columbia have legal medical marijuana. Colorado, Oregon, Washington, Alaska and the District of Columbia allow recreational use.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Amendment 20,Dalton Honore',dispensaries,Jonathan Singer,Louisiana legislature", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "A Louisiana lawmaker visited Colorado last week to talk about marijuana as he introduces two bills in the legislative session that starts Monday.", "title": "Louisiana looks to Colorado for marijuana success", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/04/12/louisiana-looking-to-colorado-for-marijuana-success/118839/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/04/Rep.-Dalton-Honore.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "A Louisiana lawmaker visited Colorado last week to talk about marijuana as he introduces two bills in the legislative session that starts Monday.", "title": "Louisiana lawmaker looking to Colorado for marijuana success", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/04/12/louisiana-looking-to-colorado-for-marijuana-success/118839/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/04/Rep.-Dalton-Honore.jpg", "creator": "@joeybunch", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "A Louisiana lawmaker visited Colorado last week to talk about marijuana as he introduces two bills in the legislative session that starts Monday."}, "article_summary": "House Bill 6 would legitimize the state\u2019s medical marijuana industry, and House Bill 117 would allow Louisianans to vote next year on decriminalizing and taxing recreational marijuana.\nThe article cited a Louisiana State University survey last year that indicated 79 percent of Louisianans supported some degree of marijuana legalization.\nTwenty-three states and the District of Columbia have legal medical marijuana.\nAs a legislative trailblazer on the controversial issue of pot, Honore\u2019 is the equivalent to Colorado\u2019s Rep.
