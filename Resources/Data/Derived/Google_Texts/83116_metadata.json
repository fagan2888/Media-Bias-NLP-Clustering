In layman\u2019s terms, that means it builds artificial heart valves to replace failing ones, and also has a number of complementary lines of devices such as stents (which keep veins and arteries open that may have collapsed), catheters to remove blood clots and other therapeutic and diagnostic products and services.\n\nWhat most people don\u2019t realize is, technology in healthcare has advanced as fast \u2014 if not faster \u2014 than personal technology. And given that advance, more people are able to use the products that EW makes to improve quality of life for many more people.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, now that the Affordable Care Act is law, there are clear guidelines on the kind of care \u2014 and devices \u2014 that is preferred. This is the part of the ACA that investors need to understand.\n\nHow Quality Over Quantity Helps EW Stock\n\nIt is no longer about the quantity of care, which led to abuse of the Medicare and Medicaid systems (the medical community\u2019s largest source of income). It is now about quality of care. That means outcomes are important.\n\nAlso, using new technologies that are initially more costly to improve outcomes is more acceptable than treating a patient with a lower tech alternative that may mean a constant stream of doctor visits and prescription drugs.\n\nOne of the clearest examples of this is the new group of drugs to treat Hepatitis C, a liver disease that can cause liver failure and death at worst, and a lifetime of drug therapy at best. Merck & Co., Inc. ( MRK ), Gilead Sciences, Inc. ( GILD ) and others are already major players.\n\nThese new drugs are taken over about a three month period and cure more than 90% of the hep C patients. The thing is, the treatment costs around $85,000, or around $1,000 a pill.\n\nBut, with ACA it\u2019s the outcome that is encouraged. And bear in mind, that many hep C patients that get traditional treatments will end up needing a liver transplant at some point. Those start around $500,000.\n\nAs for EW, in early April it announced that its SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve was showing superior results versus open-heart surgery after one year.\n\nNot only is the transcather aortic valve replacement surgery less invasive and more effective, it also cost one-third what it cost for open-heart surgery.\n\nThat\u2019s why the stock soared more than 15% in the past 5 days.\n\nAnd it\u2019s very likely this is just the beginning, since this TAVR technology is only available to a limited number of patients. EW will likely look to expand its usage and the government will likely more than happily go along.\n\nLouis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.
