That means not just showing up in an election year but making the effort year round to listen to their concerns and fight for the issues they care about,\u201d said RNC spokesman Fred Brown.\n\nAt the Civic Center Park Saturday, Coffman talked to visitors in their own language. He has been taking Spanish lessons since his district was redrawn from a safe, mostly white district to one that is evenly divided among political affiliations and features a melting pot of constituents. The RNC in April held Coffman up as a model as what Republicans need to do woo Latino voters.\n\nCoffman was joined by Republican state legislators and other elected officials. Republicans, including Secretary of State Wayne Williams, also were the festival on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe Colorado GOP has been working hard to reach and engage each of the state\u2019s diverse communities,\u201d House said. \u201cFestivals like Cinco de Mayo provide the perfect opportunity to discuss our shared vision for a more prosperous country where everyone can succeed and provide for their families.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cinco de Mayo,Colorado Republican Party,Mike Coffman,Reince Priebus,Republican National Committee,RNC,Steve House,Wayne Williams", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Republicans reached out to Latino voters at the Cinco de Mayo festival, and will continue when RNC chair Reince Preibus comes to Denver Tuesday.", "title": "GOP woos Latino voters at Denver Cinco de Mayo festival", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/05/02/republicans-woo-latino-voters-at-cinco-de-mayo-festival-rnc-chair-to-come-to-denver-may-5/119715/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/05/woodscinco1.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Republicans reached out to Latino voters at the Cinco de Mayo festival, and will continue when RNC chair Reince Preibus comes to Denver Tuesday.", "title": "Republicans woo Latino voters at Cinco de Mayo festival; RNC chair to come to Denver May 5", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/05/02/republicans-woo-latino-voters-at-cinco-de-mayo-festival-rnc-chair-to-come-to-denver-may-5/119715/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/05/woodscinco1.jpg", "creator": "@lynn_bartels", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Republicans reached out to Latino voters at the Cinco de Mayo festival, and will continue when RNC chair Reince Preibus comes to Denver Tuesday."}, "article_summary": "Republicans reached out to Latino voters at the Cinco de Mayo festival in Denver this weekend, and the outreach will continue Tuesday when RNC Chairman Reince Priebus comes to Denver.\n\u201cFestivals like Cinco de Mayo provide the perfect opportunity to discuss our shared vision for a more prosperous country where everyone can succeed and provide for their families.\u201d\nThe RNC in April held Coffman up as a model as what Republicans need to do woo Latino voters.\nAs part of Cinco de Mayo, Preibus will have lunch with the Colorado Hispanic Advisory Council; Steve House, the chairman of the Colorado Republican Party and Congressman Mike Coffman of Aurora.\nCoffman was joined by Republican state legislators and other elected officials."}
