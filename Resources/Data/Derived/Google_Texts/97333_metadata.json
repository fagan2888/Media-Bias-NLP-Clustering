That monitoring only ended in the weeks before Mr Obama visited Berlin in June this year, the magazine added.\n\nCiting leaked US intelligence documents, it also reported that America conducted eavesdropping operations on the German government from a listening post at its embassy beside the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, one of more than 80 such centres worldwide.\n\nMr Obama\u2019s European allies will now ask him to say what he personally knew about the NSA\u2019s global eavesdropping operation and its targeting of world leaders, including those from friendly states. The White House declined to comment on the German media reports.\n\nLast week, however, Mr Obama assured Mrs Merkel that her phone is not being monitored now \u2013 and will not be in future. But the US has pointedly declined to discuss the NSA\u2019s actions in the past.\n\nIts surveillance operations raises questions about whether US officials breached domestic laws. Hans-Peter Friedrich, the German interior minister, said: \u201cIf the Americans intercepted cellphones in Germany, they broke German law on German soil\u201d. He noted that wiretapping was a crime in Germany and \u201cthose responsible must be held accountable\u201d.\n\nEven before the latest reports, German intelligence chiefs were preparing to travel to Washington this week to demand answers from the NSA about the alleged surveillance of Mrs Merkel.\n\nJohn Kerry, the US secretary of state, received a dose of European fury this weekend when he visited Paris and Rome. The trip was arranged to discuss the Middle East peace process, the Syrian civil war and Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. Instead, he was confronted by outrage over the scale of US surveillance operations.\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of the eavesdropping is what shocked us,\u201d said Bernard Kouchner, a former French foreign minister, in a radio interview. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, we eavesdrop too. Everyone is listening to everyone else. But we don\u2019t have the same means as the United States, which makes us jealous.\u201d\n\nAccording to the leaked documents in Spiegel, NSA officials acknowledged that any disclosure of the existence of the foreign listening posts would lead to \u201cgrave damage\u201d for US relations with other governments.\n\nSuch posts exist in 19 European cities, including Paris, Madrid, Rome and Frankfurt, according to the magazine, which has based its reports on documents provided by Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor.\n\nMr Obama did not comment, but Republican supporters of the US intelligence community began a fightback on the political talk-shows.\n\nMike Rogers, the chairman of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, said that America\u2019s allies should be grateful for surveillance operations which targeted terrorist threats. \u201cI would argue by the way, if the French citizens knew exactly what that was about, they would be applauding and popping champagne corks,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s State of the Union.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing. it keeps the French safe. It keeps the US safe. It keeps our European allies safe.\u201d\n\nPeter King, a fellow Republican congressman, said that Mr Obama should not apologise for NSA operations in Europe. \u201cThe president should stop apologising, stop being defensive,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cThe reality is the NSA has saved thousands of lives not just in the United States but in France, Germany and throughout Europe. Quite frankly, the NSA has done so much for our country and so much for the president, he\u2019s the commander in chief. He should stand with the NSA.\u201d\n\nJohn Schindler, a former NSA official, noted that planning for the terrorist attacks on Sept 11, 2001 had taken place in Hamburg.\n\n\u201cIf 9/11 had happened to Germany and been planned in NY not Hamburg, I\u2019d expect [German] intel to monitor USA top 2 bottom,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nA German intelligence official, quoted by Die Welt, said: \u201cThe Americans did not want to rely exclusively on us after September 11th. That is understandable.\u201d\n\nAnother told the newspaper: \u201cWithout information from the Americans, there would have been successful terrorist attacks in Germany in the past years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "worldnews", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02715/obama_2715128k.jpg"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@philipsherwell"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, President Obama, National Security Agency, NSA, Angela Merkel, snooping, mobile, phone, Germany,Europe,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;World_News;Europe;Germany;North_America;USA;Philip_Sherwell;Angela_Merkel", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/europe/germany", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, President Obama, National Security Agency, NSA, Angela Merkel, snooping, mobile, phone", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "NSA denies Barack Obama was informed of Angela Merkel phone tapping", "section-id": 2232, "GSAGenre": "europe", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-europe-germany", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/europe/germany", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "DCSext.pd": 1, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "Keith Alexander did not inform Barack Obama that Angela Merkel's phone was \n  tapped, NSA says", "tmgads.channel": "news", "article-id": 10407972, "DCSext.Category": "worldnews", "DCSext.Level": 5, "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-27", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-world_news-europe-germany", "last-modified": "2013-10-27", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "World", "wordcount": 845, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Philip Sherwell", "tag": "Angela Merkel", "subsection": "Germany", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 8, "imagecount": 1, "externallinkcount": 0}, "DCSext.articleId": 10407972, "tmgads.articleid": 10407972, "tmgads.level": 5, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"NSA denies Barack Obama was informed of Angela Merkel phone tapping \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10407972/NSA-denies-Barack-Obama-was-informed-of-Angela-Merkel-phone-tapping.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02715/obama_2715128k.jpg\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"10407972\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-27T19:27:34Z\",\"section\": \"World\",\"authors\": [\"Philip Sherwell\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"World News\",\"Europe\",\"Germany\",\"North America\",\"USA\",\"Philip Sherwell\",\"Angela Merkel\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Keith Alexander did not inform Barack Obama that Angela Merkel's phone was   tapped, NSA says", "title": "NSA denies Barack Obama was informed of Angela Merkel phone tapping", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/10407972/NSA-denies-Barack-Obama-was-informed-of-Angela-Merkel-phone-tapping.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02715/obama_2715128k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "europe", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.worldnews.europe.germany", "DCSext.author": "Philip Sherwell", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2013-10-27 19:27"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfca6\"", "article_summary": "The National Security Agency has denied reports that President Barack Obama was personally informed of US phone tapping against German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phones.\nA German intelligence official, quoted by Die Welt, said: \u201cThe Americans did not want to rely exclusively on us after September 11th.\nIt keeps our European allies safe.\u201dPeter King, a fellow Republican congressman, said that Mr Obama should not apologise for NSA operations in Europe.\nInstead, he was confronted by outrage over the scale of US surveillance operations.\nIts surveillance operations raises questions about whether US officials breached domestic laws."}
