Kevin Hagen for The Wall Street Journal\n\nU.S. Rep. Michael Grimm is set to roll out a new campaign ad Friday featuring a Superstorm Sandy survivor, placing a bet that the endorsement will resonate with voters in his hard-hit Staten Island district.\n\nThe emotional television ad, \u201cThere for Us,\u201d comes almost two years after the October 2012 superstorm and touts Mr. Grimm\u2019s hands-on approach to the disaster as he fights to hold onto his seat against Democratic challenger Domenic Recchia.\n\nAt the heart of the 30-second spot is Patricia Dresch, a Staten Island resident whose teenage daughter and husband were killed in the storm.\n\n\u201cCongressman Grimm was at my bedside,\u201d Ms. Dresch says in the ad. Ms. Dresch, 53, was also the first in the city to receive a federally funded buyout of her home last year, and is well known on Staten Island.\n\n\u201cIf he says he\u2019s gonna go out there and fight to get the money to help these people on Staten Island, he\u2019s gonna do it,\u201d Ms. Dresch says in the ad. \u201cAnd he did.\u201d\n\nMr. Grimm, who represents the 11th Congressional district encompassing Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, was indicted in April on tax fraud and other charges related to an Upper East Side restaurant he once owned. He has pleaded not guilty and vowed to fight the charges.\n\nThe campaign ad works to highlight Mr. Grimm\u2019s constituent services in the tightly knit Staten Island district. The congressman said Ms. Dresch \u201csymbolized all the victims of Sandy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Pat Dresch story is just so profound,\u201d Mr. Grimm said in a phone interview Thursday.\n\n\u201cWhen I made her a promise, that really was what I kept thinking of when I was fighting for the money,\u201d he said of the federal Sandy-relief funds.\n\nMr. Grimm added that he and his staff regularly \u201cdrop in\u201d and have dinner with Ms. Dresch and gifted her with a rescue dog \u201cso she wouldn\u2019t be lonely.\u201d\n\nMs. Dresch couldn\u2019t be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nThe Recchia campaign released an ad Wednesday attacking Mr. Grimm over his criminal indictment and noted he may have to step down if convicted.\n\n\u201cWhich do you want?\u201d the voice in the TV ad asks. \u201cSomeone who will be stepping down, or someone who will be stepping up?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "U.S. Rep.
