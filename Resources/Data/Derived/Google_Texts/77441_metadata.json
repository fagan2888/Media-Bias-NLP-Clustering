Sacramento Kings point guard Andre Miller gets it for being reunited with the coach he loves most.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Last year, an upset Miller lashed out at Nuggets coach Brian Shaw. This year, a quieter Miller languished on Washington\u2019s bench. But the one thing that could possibly save his sanity actually happened \u2014 George Karl got another job in the NBA. Karl\u2019s first order of business was to get his security blanket: Andre Miller. The Kings acquired him Thursday before the league\u2019s trade deadline.\n\nBackground: Miller has always been the player Karl could agree on. Karl sulked in 2006 when the Nuggets dealt Miller to Philadelphia as part of the Allen Iverson trade. Karl celebrated in 2011 when Miller was reacquired by Denver.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: Miller is 38 years old. If he has only a couple of seasons left in the NBA, it\u2019s fitting they be spent playing for the coach who has always respected his game most. \u201cHe knows how to deal with players and egos,\u201d Miller said of Karl, \u201cand that\u2019s why he\u2019s been so successful in this league.\u201d It was a veiled comment poking at his previous, most recent, situations. But the lob pass is back. Miller and Karl are together again.
