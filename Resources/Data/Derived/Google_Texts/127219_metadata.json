Mr. Sanders\u2019s plan would require over a trillion dollars a year paid for with a broad set of new taxes. His campaign says the plan would save middle-class families money on co-pays and deductibles despite the tax increase. Mrs. Clinton has hit Mr. Sanders for wanting to scrap President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement and raise taxes on the middle class. She has promised to improve on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe strategy of reminding voters that she was at the forefront of pushing for universal health care could help Mrs. Clinton appear more authentic as she tries to compete with a populist liberal candidate who identifies as a Democratic socialist. But the new line in her stump speech could also evoke a tumultuous period during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration when the first lady was tasked with overhauling the health care system \u2014 and ultimately failed. Her proposals at the time aimed to provide universal health care, though they would have made employers responsible for their workers\u2019 insurance, while Mr. Sanders envisions a government-run system.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160123161639, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "politics/firstdraft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "per": "Clinton, Hillary Rodham;Sanders, Bernard", "keywords": "Clinton Hillary Rodham,Sanders Bernard,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Presidential Election of 2016,Uncategorized", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Amy Chozick", "SCG": "First Draft", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Amy Chozick", "byl": "Amy Chozick", "twitter": {"description": "While criticizing Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 universal health care plan as impractical, Hillary Clinton is reminding voters she tried something similar during her husband\u2019s first term.", "title": "'Hillarycare' Failed, but Hillary Clinton Reminds Voters She Tried", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/23/hillarycare-failed-but-hillary-clinton-reminds-voters-she-tried/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/01/24/us/politics/24firstdraft-clinton-1/24firstdraft-clinton-1-thumbLarge.jpg", "creator": "@amychozick", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000004163961, "description": "While criticizing Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 universal health care plan as impractical, Hillary Clinton is reminding voters she tried something similar during her husband\u2019s first term.", "CG": "Politics", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 23, 2016", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-01232016.jsonp", "article": {"published_time": 1453583799, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/amy_chozick/index.html", "section": "Politics", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2016-01-24T02:42:28-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160124024228, "PUD": 20160123, "pdate": 20160123, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Presidential Election of 2016", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/01/24/us/politics/24firstdraft-clinton-1/24firstdraft-clinton-1-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "First Draft", "description": "While criticizing Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 universal health care plan as impractical, Hillary Clinton is reminding voters she tried something similar during her husband\u2019s first term.", "title": "'Hillarycare' Failed, but Hillary Clinton Reminds Voters She Tried", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/23/hillarycare-failed-but-hillary-clinton-reminds-voters-she-tried/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/01/24/us/politics/24firstdraft-clinton-1/24firstdraft-clinton-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "'Hillarycare' Failed, but Hillary Clinton Reminds Voters She Tried", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/01/24/us/politics/24firstdraft-clinton-1/24firstdraft-clinton-1-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 23, 2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2a44\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe share the same goal, universal health care for every single American,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said of her rival Mr. Sanders.\nMrs. Clinton has hit Mr. Sanders for wanting to scrap President Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement and raise taxes on the middle class.\n\u201cNow, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare, as some of you might remember,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a town-hall-style event in Clinton, Iowa, on Saturday, the second time in recent days she has used the line.\nBut the new line in her stump speech could also evoke a tumultuous period during President Bill Clinton\u2019s administration when the first lady was tasked with overhauling the health care system \u2014 and ultimately failed.\nPhotoAfter weeks of criticizing Bernie Sanders\u2019s plan for a single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care system as budget busting and unrealistic, Hillary Clinton over the past few days has a new message for voters: Universal health care was her idea first."}
