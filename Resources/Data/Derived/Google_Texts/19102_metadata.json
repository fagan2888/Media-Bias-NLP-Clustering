As of Saturday, the effort had resulted in the collection of 500 surveys. Anyone was welcome to enjoy the pig roast free of charge, with an anonymous survey serving as admission.\n\n\u201cThe goal was draw people in who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have access to the surveys,\u201d said Fenwick Broyard, executive director of Community Connection. \u201cWe\u2019ve got quality data from people who might not have had Internet access at home or be able to do it there.\u201d\n\nBroyard said he got the idea for the pig roast \u2014 Saturday marked the first in a series of such events planned for various locations in Athens-Clarke County \u2014 from an event hosted during Athens\u2019 Twilight Criterium bicycle race weekend by Noah Brendel of the Four Coursemen in Athens.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to a ton of community events, and there\u2019s usually hot dogs and hamburgers. Nobody really gets excited about that, right?\u201d Broyard joked. \u201cIt\u2019s not every day you can roast a whole hog for 24 hours.\u201d\n\nThe centerpiece of Saturday\u2019s event, a 200-pound hog, was raised by local farmer Benji Anderson and cooked by Brendel.\n\nAlong with the pig, there were collard greens, baked beans and macaroni and cheese, courtesy of a donation from the Northeast Georgia Food Bank. Daily Groceries Co-op donated vegan side dishes, and Taziki\u2019s restaurant in Athens offered Mediterranean-style potatoes.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like as the idea got out, people were really wanting to be involved, so we had no shortage of help pulling this together,\u201d Broyard said.\n\nAttendees had great things to say about the food, and even greater things to say about the party surrounding the event. Whether dancing to DJ Mahogany or playing in the bounce house, there was something for all ages to do.\n\nCassandra Teel attended the pig roast out of curiosity, and was not disappointed.\n\n\u201cI think this is a great event, and a great concept. I\u2019ve liked getting to meet different people, and seeing the kids interact and have fun,\u201d she said.\n\nEmily Johnson\u2019s children were two of the many kids running around at the pig roast. She said she brought Elliott, 3, and Nora, 6 months, out for a special dinner and a fun place to play.\n\n\u201cI think it does a lot to bring the community together,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cNo matter who you are, or where you come from, anyone can come out here and enjoy the music and some good food.\u201d\n\nAside from collecting health data, Community Connection\u2019s goal for the pig roast was to bring people together and inspire new friendships. Many guests were, in fact, excited by the diverse crowd at the event. Broyard was thrilled that members of the community who might not normally interact came together for the roast.\n\n\u201cWhat I like most about it is we\u2019ve got a beautiful cross-section of our community here. We\u2019ve got people of all ages and all races here mixing and mingling,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that we built some bridges here today. I hope that people got to meet neighbors they didn\u2019t know they had, and that conversations got started and relationships got forged.\u201d\n\nCommunity Connection intern Megan Baer, who coordinated much of the pig roast, said she hoped the event was inviting to every member of the community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard from members of the African-American community that they don\u2019t feel welcome in places I\u2019m shocked to hear about,\u201d she said. \u201cSo everyone who walks in the gate is now my friend.\u201d\n\nCommunity Connection will host three more pig roasts in the coming months in an effort to map health data across all of Athens-Clarke County. The next pig roast is scheduled for April 25 at the East Athens Community Center at 425 McKinley Drive, with a hog prepared by Chuck Ramsey of Pulaski Heights BBQ.\n\nHealth surveys can be filled out online at www.athenspigroast.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Local News, Rayleigh Rozier", "og": {"url": "http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2015-03-21/community-connection-pig-roast-brings-together-diverse-athens-crowd", "site_name": "Online Athens", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/14228132.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Community Connection pig roast brings together diverse Athens crowd"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca759\"", "article_summary": "Anyone was welcome to enjoy the pig roast free of charge, with an anonymous survey serving as admission.\nCars lined the block for the event, a partnership between Community Connection and local hospitals to collect 2,000 health surveys in the community.\nEmily Johnson\u2019s children were two of the many kids running around at the pig roast.\nCassandra Teel attended the pig roast out of curiosity, and was not disappointed.\n\u201cThe goal was draw people in who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have access to the surveys,\u201d said Fenwick Broyard, executive director of Community Connection."}
