Craig Warga for The Wall Street Journal\n\nDowntown Brooklyn cultural institutions drew more than 4.5 million visitors and generated more than $300 million in economic activity last year, according to a report to be released Thursday by the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership.\n\nThe report, based on data from 36 of the area\u2019s 60 arts groups, analyzed the economic impact of institutions\u2019 operating budgets, construction, retail sales and concessions.\n\nThe survey area included a cluster of neighborhoods in and around the Brooklyn Cultural District, which has been transformed in recent years by a cultural building boom spurred by hundreds of millions of dollars in private investment, donations and city capital funds.\n\nThe Brooklyn Cultural District is demarcated by Dekalb Avenue and Hanson Place on the north and south, respectively, and Fort Greene Place and Flatbush Avenue on the east and west.\n\nAmong the arts spaces that have opened there in the past two years: a permanent home for the previously itinerant Theatre for a New Audience, and BAM Fisher, a 250-seat theater, rehearsal and performance space for the Brooklyn Academy of Music.\n\nThe organizations who contributed to the report\u2019s findings booked more than 8,000 hotel-room nights around downtown Brooklyn for performers and production staff in 2013, according to the report.\n\nENLARGE\n\n\u201cArt and culture have been a transformative element in the whole revitalization of downtown Brooklyn,\u201d said Karen Brooks Hopkins, president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which anchors the cultural district.\n\n\u201cYou have venues ranging from 200 seats to 18,000 in a five-block radius,\u201d she said, referring to the nearby Barclays Center.\n\nThe Downtown Brooklyn Partnership is a nonprofit development corporation that promotes the area. Its president, Tucker Reed, noted that neighborhood arts groups welcomed nearly 200,000 international visitors last year.\n\nHeavy investment in the cultural district, both private and public, has led to a host of new venues. The city, beginning with the Giuliani administration, has allocated more than $100 million in the district for arts facilities, public space and affordable housing.\n\nThe 36 cultural groups spent $480 million on construction from 2009 through 2013, according to the study. Those projects included the new BRIC House in the former Strand Theater, and a renovation of the Brooklyn Historical Society\u2019s landmark building.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been absolutely thrilling,\u201d said Dorothy Ryan, managing director of the Theatre for a New Audience, which opened its new home, the Polonsky Shakespeare Center, last fall. In its inaugural year, which featured a buzzy production of \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d by Julie Taymor, the group\u2019s audience doubled to 50,000. Its operating budget this year is $6.3 million, compared with $3.5 million before the building opened.\n\nThe study also looked at free programming: The 36 arts groups together presented 3,445 performances and conducted programs for 81,000 children.\n\nTom McKnight, executive vice president for planning at the city\u2019s Economic Development Corp., said the study shows that \u201cdowntown Brooklyn has really moved beyond what had been envisioned as a central business district.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in Brooklyn,\u201d he said, \u201cis really a new, more innovative, more mixed-use model. It\u2019s places where people are living, it\u2019s places where people are playing, it\u2019s places where people are taking advantage of the cultural offerings.\u201d", "article_metadata":
