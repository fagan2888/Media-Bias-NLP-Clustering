Here are their stories.\n\nNydia Mata, 36, freelance photographer, Chelsea\n\nIn recent years, Mata, a single mom, couldn\u2019t afford health insurance.\n\nWhen she got hit badly by the flu, she didn\u2019t go to the doctor and was forced to send her son away until she recovered.\n\n\u201cIt was a nightmare,\u201d Mata said.\n\nLast year, the photographer bought a silver plan on New York State of Health from Oscar Insurance. After subsidies, she is paying $151 a month.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of benefits,\u201d Mata said. \u201cThere is a partial reimbursement for joining a gym. They send out email reminders for checkups. It\u2019s like having a third parent.\u201d\n\nWill she change her plan during open enrollment?\n\n\u201cI will keep the same plan,\u201d Mata said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazingly great.\u201d\n\nPatricia Shih, 61, Stephen Fricker, 62, musicians, Huntington, L.I.\n\nFor this married couple, Obamacare has been a \u201clife changer.\u201d\n\nPatricia Shih, 61, and Stephen Fricker, 62, both musicians in Huntington, L.I., bought insurance last year through Obamacare. (neil miller for new york daily news)\n\nThey saw their income fall precipitously after the recession hit. Paying their health insurance premiums, which cost close to $1,400 a month, had become a major burden.\n\nLast year, Shih went shopping on New York State of Health. At first, she tried to navigate the site herself, but found the experience \u201cdaunting.\u201d\n\nShih contacted the call center run by the state and ultimately purchased a silver plan from NorthShore-Long Island Jewish CareConnect.\n\nThe cost: $463 a month, after her subsidy, about one-third the price of her old plan. Her deductible is $2,000.\n\nShe will be evaluating other plans during open enrollment.\n\n\u201cI am definitely going to see if I can reduce our out-of-pocket costs,\u201d Shih said.\n\nFor now, she\u2019s grateful for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we would have done without it,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the Republicans have their way and repeal it, it will put us up the river.\u201d\n\nWarren McCann , 63, retiree, Northport, L.I.\n\nMcCann spent 33 years as an executive in the insurance industry.\n\nBut when it came to purchasing a policy of his own on New York State of Health last year, he found the experience difficult.\n\nWarren McCann of Northport, L.I., has some advice for shopping for plans: 'Get a broker. Describe your position medically and financially.' (Christie M. Farriella for New York Daily News)\n\n\u201cThe site left me with an enormous amount of questions,\u201d McCann said. \u201cImportant information was not clear from the website.\u201d\n\nMcCann signed up for a policy that at first glance looked right. But after receiving paperwork from his insurance company, McCann learned the plan was an HMO, meaning he\u2019d be required to get approvals to see specialists.\n\nMcCann enlisted the help of Kyle Sloane, a broker with Newtek Insurance Agency.\n\nSloane ultimately helped McCann find a policy that better suited his needs: a Health Republic PrimarySelect platinum plan.\n\nMcCann is paying $989 a month to cover himself and his wife. There is a zero deductible. No referrals are required.\n\n\u201cThis plan was the right plan based on the network flexibility as well as the monthly premium,\u201d Sloane said.\n\nSoon McCann will be going back to work again. He just learned that premiums for his plan will be rising 14.2%, to $1,130 a month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s excessive. I don\u2019t think I can just renew without doing my homework,\u201d McCann said.\n\n\u201cWe have one of the broadest networks in the state with more than 70,000 doctors and more than 200 of the finest hospitals,\u201d said Health Republic spokesperson Tara Schuh.\n\n\u201cIn 2015, we are still one of the most affordable plans.\u201d\n\nNancy Jovishoff, from Queens, says her health costs still remain high after enrolling in an exchange plan from NorthShore-Long Island Jewish CareConnect. (Marcus Santos/New York Daily News)\n\nMcCann\u2019s advice to others during open enrollment: \u201cGet a broker. Describe your position medically and financially. If you do it by yourself, it\u2019s too complicated and too involved. It\u2019s too much information to absorb.\u201d\n\nNancy Jovishoff , 63, freelance market research exec, Queens\n\nLast year, the Daily News spoke to Jovishoff soon after she enrolled in an exchange plan from NorthShore-Long Island Jewish CareConnect.\n\nOne year later, she\u2019s feeling pretty good.\n\nJovishoff is paying $713 a month to cover herself and her 22-year-old son. She is not eligible for subsidies.\n\nShe\u2019s happy that nearly all of her doctors are in the network.\n\nEven so, her health care costs remain high.\n\nSo far this year, Jovishoff has spent $14,000, including premiums, deductibles and co-pays.\n\nShe said she is looking forward to turning 65 when she will be eligible for Medicare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s expensive,\u201d Jovishoff said of her current plan. \u201cBut it\u2019s much better than the alternative of going on my husband's plan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Phyllis Furman", "twitter": {"description": "An overwhelming majority of those who became insured under health reform \u2014 92% \u2014 said they were \u201ccompletely\u201d or \u201csomewhat satisfied\u201d with their health insurance, according to a survey by the New York State of Health Foundation.", "title": "New Yorkers share Obamacare experiences, advice", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-yorkers-share-obamacare-experiences-advice-article-1.2013278", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2013276.1416210144!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obamacare.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Phyllis Furman", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-11-17T07:49:51", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-yorkers-share-obamacare-experiences-advice-article-1.2013278", "parsely-title": "New Yorkers share Obamacare experiences, advice", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-17T02:49:51-0500", "sailthru.title": "New Yorkers share Obamacare experiences, advice", "nydn_section": "New York", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2013276.1416210144!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obamacare.jpg", "description": "An overwhelming majority of those who became insured under health reform \u2014 92% \u2014 said they were \u201ccompletely\u201d or \u201csomewhat satisfied\u201d with their health insurance, according to a survey by the New York State of Health Foundation.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "New York", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "An overwhelming majority of those who became insured under health reform \u2014 92% \u2014 said they were \u201ccompletely\u201d or \u201csomewhat satisfied\u201d with their health insurance, according to a survey by the New York State of Health Foundation.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "An overwhelming majority of those who became insured under health reform \u2014 92% \u2014 said they were \u201ccompletely\u201d or \u201csomewhat satisfied\u201d with their health insurance, according to a survey by the New York State of Health Foundation.", "title": "New Yorkers share Obamacare experiences, advice", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/new-yorkers-share-obamacare-experiences-advice-article-1.2013278", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2013276.1416210144!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Phyllis Furman", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2013276.1416210144!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obamacare.jpg"}, "article_summary": "(Marcus Santos/New York Daily News)McCann\u2019s advice to others during open enrollment: \u201cGet a broker.\n(neil miller for new york daily news)They saw their income fall precipitously after the recession hit.\nPaying their health insurance premiums, which cost close to $1,400 a month, had become a major burden.\nThe Daily News reached out to some New Yorkers who enrolled last year to learn more about their experiences.\nNydia Mata, 36, freelance photographer, ChelseaIn recent years, Mata, a single mom, couldn\u2019t afford health insurance."}
