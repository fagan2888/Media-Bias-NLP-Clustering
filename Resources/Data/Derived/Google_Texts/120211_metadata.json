(Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nToday, more Americans have health insurance than ever before \u2013 under the Affordable Care Act, more than 17.6 million people have gained coverage, uninsured rates have plummeted, and millions more families have the security of knowing that they won\u2019t go broke just because somebody got sick.\n\nAt the same time, we\u2019ve seen exceptionally slow growth in health care costs as well as encouraging improvements in quality of care for patients. All of that is good news.\n\nBut there are still millions of people who lack this security \u2013 and many of them live in just a small number of communities across the country, including here in Phoenix.\n\nSo I have a challenge for you, Phoenix.\n\nOpen enrollment season for plans on the Health Insurance Marketplace just began, and we're launching the Healthy Communities Challenge to rally folks to get covered in 20 communities with the greatest potential for impact. And if Phoenix signs up the highest percentage of your neighbors who aren\u2019t covered this year, I\u2019ll come visit to tell the whole country about all of your success.\n\nInsurance, by the numbers 154,121: Number of Arizonans covered by the Healthcare Marketplace, as of June 30. 14.5: Percentage of uninsured adults in Arizona in the first half of 2015, down from 20.4 percent in 2013. 194,000: Number of uninsured in the Phoenix metro area that are eligible to get coverage via the Marketplace.\n\nSo maybe you\u2019re a local official, a pastor or a sports hero who can spread the word. Maybe you\u2019ve got a cousin or an uncle who\u2019s been uninsured for far too long. Or maybe you\u2019re between jobs and don\u2019t think that affordable coverage is an option for you. No matter who you are, everybody can get covered or help their neighbors do so.\n\nYou can start by telling folks about how affordable this coverage can be. In Arizona, nearly 7 in 10 people can get covered for $75 or less a month. For a lot of folks, that\u2019s less than their cellphone or cable bill. And last year, consumers in Arizona saved an average of $159 a month thanks to tax credits for marketplace coverage.\n\nYou can tell folks how easy it is to sign up. Getting covered used to mean filling out endless pages of forms \u2013 and sometimes even a medical exam. But today, HealthCare.gov makes the process fast and simple \u2013 you can shop around, compare plans and choose the one that works for you and your family.\n\nYou can tell folks that insurance companies can no longer deny coverage because of a preexisting condition \u2013 and that preventive care like checkups and mammograms are now covered for free.\n\nMost importantly, you should tell folks to go to HealthCare.gov or CuidadoDeSalud.gov to sign up. Or they can call 1-800-318-2596 for confidential assistance 24/7. Help is available in more than 200 languages. And in many cities, local events or assistance are available to help guide you and your neighbors through the process.\n\nPresident Barack Obama.

But no matter what, you should sign up by Jan. 31 to get coverage next year.\n\nSo I hope everyone in Phoenix will get their families and their neighbors involved. That\u2019s what the Healthy Communities Challenge is all about \u2013 working together, block by block, community by community, to help each other and this country get ahead.\n\nSo good luck \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll see you in Phoenix next year.\n\nBarack Obama is president of the United States.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1iL0pU5", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "President Obama: If Phoenix signs up the highest percentage of uninsured, I'll tell the country about your success.", "og": {"site_name": "azcentral", "description": "President Obama: If Phoenix signs up the highest percentage of uninsured, I'll tell the country about your success.", "title": "Obama: Take me up on this challenge, Phoenix", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2015/11/08/obama-uninsured-rate-challenge/75320152/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/azcentral.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama: If Phoenix signs up the highest percentage of uninsured, I'll tell the country about your success.", "title": "Obama: Take me up on this challenge, Phoenix", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e21b6c755b584704551b73e5c082728dcb176fdd/c=640-0-2772-2132&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Phoenix/Phoenix/635802796260240221-Affordable-Care-Act.jpg", "creator": "@azcentral", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600023563", "fb": {"app_id": 115142145268769}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Affordable Care Act", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Affordable Care Act", "title": "Obama: Take me up on this challenge, Phoenix", "author": "Barack Obama", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/op-ed", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf2a988d7d69fb1689f85fce393efb3e8a365bca/c=742-0-2341-2132/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Phoenix/Phoenix/635802796260240221-Affordable-Care-Act.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0f8db94d22a3096e1ff5ae9b36abfa980d793331/c=640-0-2772-2132/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Phoenix/Phoenix/635802796260240221-Affordable-Care-Act.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/31bde25add84b15f8a877607d856294d884852d7/c=82-0-2918-2132/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Phoenix/Phoenix/635802796260240221-Affordable-Care-Act.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/82fe07af2b7812dab2c7e356b7c680e6fa2aa780/c=0-79-2996-1772&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Phoenix/Phoenix/635802796260240221-Affordable-Care-Act.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-11-08T05:02:51.533000-07:00", "shorthed": "Obama: Take me up on this challenge, Phoenix", "articleid": 75320152, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9654aad6bc640fb631fdc892c7bf2a48d660528e/c=0-79-2996-1772/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Phoenix/Phoenix/635802796260240221-Affordable-Care-Act.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ced41a4cd24155403bb6cda6b51d55f13604551a/c=903-0-2097-2132/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Phoenix/Phoenix/635802796260240221-Affordable-Care-Act.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "obamacare, obama uninsured, healthy communities challenge, healthcare.gov, health insurance open enrollment, open enrollment,"}, "article_summary": "So I have a challenge for you, Phoenix.\nPresident Obama: If Phoenix signs up the highest percentage of uninsured, I'll come here and tell the whole country about your success.\n194,000: Number of uninsured in the Phoenix metro area that are eligible to get coverage via the Marketplace.\nSo I hope everyone in Phoenix will get their families and their neighbors involved.\nThat\u2019s what the Healthy Communities Challenge is all about \u2013 working together, block by block, community by community, to help each other and this country get ahead."}
