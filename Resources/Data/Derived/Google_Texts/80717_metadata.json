Those stories focus on money coming into Tennessee from conservative organizations, such as Americans For Prosperity, the American Legislative Exchange Council and groups that favor school choice and school vouchers.\n\nFormer Chicago Times editor Alan D. Mutter, who follows and blogs about the newspaper industry, said the decline of newspapers has led to such collaboration.\n\n\u201cCollaborative reporting is becoming increasingly commonplace,\u201d Mutter said.\n\n\u201cThe reason is that newspapers have experienced a catastrophic drop in their advertising revenues the last 10 years. To make a long story short, newsrooms have far fewer resources today than they did three, five or 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nBut does that collaboration lead to a newspaper collective, in which all members speak in a single voice?\n\nOther than a few passing references to the National Education Association, the American Civil Liberties Union and the AFL-CIO, the newspapers have yet to uncover stories about out-of-state money from liberal interests swaying politics in Tennessee.\n\nNashville media personality Steve Gill, who has monitored the state\u2019s media outlets for years, senses a trend.\n\n\u201cIt bothers the left-leaning newspapers now that conservatives have exercised a majority in the state Senate and the state House, and increasingly you are seeing a conservative agenda passed because, wow, the people of Tennessee elected conservatives,\u201d Gill said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve had left-of-center money play a huge role for a long time in this state. It\u2019s the fact that results are coming and the left-wingers\u2019 heads are exploding in the press.\u201d\n\nOne article quoted State Rep. Joe Armstrong, D-Knoxville, saying ALEC was \u201cself-serving,\u201d \u201cvery partisan,\u201d and \u201cextremist.\u201d\n\nOther stories focus on how cash from other states has helped Tennessee conservatives fight for or against a number of things, including their successful effort earlier this year to kill expanded Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\nTennessee Watchdog found one liberal interest group, known as the Heartland Accountability Project, that has tried to influence state politics \u2014 as recently as this year.\n\nLast summer, various media outlets dwelled on groups affiliated with the Koch brothers and their seeming effort to influence judicial retention elections.\n\nBut the papers failed to report, as Tennessee Watchdog did, that groups affiliated with liberal billionaire George Soros made efforts to influence those elections.\n\nTennessean News Director Maria De Varenne was non-specific when asked Friday if her newspaper uncovered any evidence of Soros\u2019 money coming into the state.\n\nBut De Varenne did talk about a favorite villain among the left.\n\n\u201cWe did these stories because of the influence of the Koch brothers in a couple of previous elections and the examples cited of how much money was coming in to influence some particular legislation,\u201d De Varenne said.\n\n\u201cThe reporters felt like that was a topic that could be mined into a much greater enterprise.\u201d\n\nKnoxville News Sentinel Editor Jack McElroy said political bias isn\u2019t driving these stories.\n\n\u201cThis is not a liberal agenda-driven series,\u201d McElroy said.\n\nDe Varenne, meanwhile, said the editorial board of her newspaper endorsed Mitt Romney for president over Barack Obama in 2012.\n\n\u201cWe always present both sides of the issue,\u201d De Varenne said.\n\nWhen the reporters work together they do so in an informal, loosely connected way, with no formal meetings or business arrangements, McElroy said.\n\n\u201cThere has been an influx of out-of-state money in a lot of places, not just in Tennessee,\u201d McElroy said when asked why the newspapers chose this story.\n\n\u201cThere has been kind of a trend nationally, where organizations are finding that they\u2019re able to influence national policy by working through the legislatures.\u201d\n\nOfficials with the Memphis Commercial Appeal and the Chattanooga Times Free Press did not return requests for comment.\n\nThe newspapers that are working together, with the exception of the Chattanooga Times Free Press, are owned by corporations based out-of-state.\n\nMcElroy and DeVarenne said they were unfamiliar with the Heartland Accountability Project. Heartland is registered in Virginia, according to the Virginia Corporation Commission website.\n\nEarlier this year, Heartland ran a series of radio ads pressuring State Sen. Brian Kelsey, R-Germantown, not to oppose Insure Tennessee, which was Republican Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s failed attempt to expand Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\nThe group has also campaigned for liberal causes in Oklahoma, according to one Tulsa television affiliate.\n\n\u201cIf this group is in the same league as some of these organizations we\u2019ve reported on then we ought to be aware of them as well,\u201d McElroy said.\n\nThere is no registered PAC called Heartland Accountability Project that would require disclosure with the state of Tennessee. They\u2019re an independent expenditure group running issue ads. They\u2019re not a campaign outfit.\n\nAccording to documents obtained from the Virginia Corporation Commission, Liz Howard, an attorney with the Washington, D.C. law firm of Sandler Reiff Young & Lamb, filed Heartland\u2019s articles of incorporation.\n\nAccording to the firm\u2019s website, the firm has a specific interest in Democratic Party and other progressive causes and represents MoveOn.org\n\nA woman who answered the phone at the law firm Thursday said Howard was no longer at the firm. The same woman said someone at the firm would return Tennessee Watchdog\u2019s request for information on Heartland \u2014 but no one called back.\n\nAs for Howard\u2019s whereabouts, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, appointed her to work as deputy commissioner for that state\u2019s Department of Elections, according to the state\u2019s website.\n\nRelated: Republicans blast \u2018most-traveled\u2019 McAuliffe\n\nhttp://watchdog.org/213073/republicans-travel-mcauliffe/\n\nWhen reached at her office Thursday, Howard said she did not know what Heartland is; she later asked that Tennessee Watchdog send questions to her via email. According to an online biography, Howard previously worked for former Tennessee Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen and was the chief financial officer for the Tennessee Democratic Party.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, Howard had not responded to our email.\n\nNewspapers collaborate, in part, to survive. But they should stay careful, says Mutter.\n\n\u201cThe only risk is that they like the idea of collaboration so much that they start sharing stories all the time and they stop competing to report,\u201d Mutter said.\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org\n\nFollow Tennessee Watchdog and receive regular updates through Facebook and Twitter\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
