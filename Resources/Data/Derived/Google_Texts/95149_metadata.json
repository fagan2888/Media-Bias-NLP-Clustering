There were several attempts to amend the plans on the House and Senate floors Thursday, but only one, an anti-abortion measure, succeeded.\n\nDel. Robert G. Marshall (R-Prince William) convinced the GOP-dominated House to add language intended to block Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) from softening regulations on abortion clinics. Similar abortion restrictions have died in the Senate in past years; additionally, if the measure survives, McAuliffe would have the power to kill it with a line-item veto.\n\nThe closely divided Senate made no changes to what its Finance Committee had approved over the weekend.\n\nSen. Mark D. Obenshain (R-Rockingham) had wanted to reject plans to require more retailers to pay their sales taxes a month early. But the Senate went along with McAuliffe\u2019s plan to impose the \u201caccelerated sales tax\u201d on businesses with annual sales over $2.5 million. Currently, only those with more than $26 million in sales must pay early. The House version applies the tax to those making above $3.5 million.\n\nThe Senate did not even debate, much less approve, expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, something McAuliffe included in his budget plan. A slim majority of what had been an evenly divided Senate supported a form of expansion last year. But with Republicans enjoying a 21-19 majority this year, and two Democrats currently absent for medical reasons, expansion had no chance in the upper chamber.\n\nDemocrats could not even muster the votes to block a GOP motion to cut off debate on Medicaid before it began. Sen. Janet D. Howell (D-Fairfax) complained bitterly afterward that a vital policy debate had been thwarted even while Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. (R-Buckingham) had been allowed to deliver \u201ca seven-minute soliloquy on yurts.\u201d\n\nGarrett had questioned whether the state was getting a good deal on the $1.5 million it planned to spend on camping shelters for state parks.\n\nSenate Democrats nevertheless rallied behind the budget package when it came to a final vote, joining Republicans to pass it 38-0.\n\n\u201cI have never seen a time when we took a budget vote and every single vote was green,\u201d said Sen. Jill Holtzman Vogel (R-Fauquier).\n\nThe House and Senate budgets now cross to the other chamber. Differences between the bills will eventually be hashed out by a conference committee.\n\nAmong the points that will have to be reconciled: The Senate approved McAuliffe\u2019s \u201cHealthy Virginia\u201d health-care program to provide psychiatric and broader health care to 20,000 mentally ill Virginians. The House has a rival plan that provides psychiatric and pharmaceutical benefits to 30,000 mentally ill people but not general health care.\n\nThe Senate sets aside an extra $134 million for the state\u2019s rainy-day fund, while the House proposes about $100 million. McAuliffe does not provide any extra payments to the fund.\n\nThe House passed its budget 81 to 18. Democratic Caucus Chairman Scott A. Surovell (Fairfax) said the plan did not include enough money for pre-kindergarten programs, teacher raises or health care for the mentally ill. Democrats also object to tax credits for coal and other industries, as well as the removal of $28 million for new electronic voting machines.\n\nBoth the House and Senate budgets provide a 3 percent pay raise for state employees, including state police, and a 2 percent raise for state university faculty. They also include the state\u2019s share of a 1.5 percent increase in teacher pay, which local school officials would have the option of matching.\n\nMcAuliffe did not call for raises in his budget, although he has said he would welcome a way to do it. He included a 2 percent raise for state employees in last year\u2019s plan \u2014 ultimately rejected \u2014 that relied on an infusion of federal funding from Medicaid expansion.\n\nMcAuliffe also had called for increasing a series of business fees, including from restaurant inspections, to raise about $10.2 million. The House proposal eliminates those hikes. The Senate plan goes along with McAuliffe\u2019s fee increases but trims them so they would raise $3.6 million in new revenue.\n\nHouse lawmakers passed, 63 to 36, an amendment from Marshall that would prohibit the use of state funds to pay for the implementation of changes in regulations on abortion clinics that McAuliffe called for last year. Health Department officials are currently reviewing hospital-style building codes that regulate the clinics and were instituted under then-Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R).\n\nThe General Assembly passed a two-year, $96 billion state budget last year. This year, the legislature and McAuliffe are proposing adjustments to that plan to cover the second year of the budget, which begins July 1.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bills do not expand Medicaid but would raise wages for state employees and teachers.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The bills do not expand Medicaid but would raise wages for state employees and teachers.", "title": "Va.
