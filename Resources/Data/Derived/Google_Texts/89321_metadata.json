Even if the document reflected Bevin\u2019s heartfelt opinion \u2014 which, he told Glenn Beck, it doesn\u2019t \u2014 how many tea partiers would quit the Bevin bandwagon if he had turned around and said, \u201cI did feel that way at the time but, unlike Mitch McConnell, I\u2019ve come to regret supporting TARP\u201d? Instant forgiveness, right? The last two men the party has nominated for president supported TARP; our last VP nominee, whose selection pleased most grassroots conservatives, actually voted for TARP in the House. This is always trotted out as a conservative litmus test but it never operates that way. Even if you were hoping that Bevin was the \u201ctrue conservative\u201d of your dreams, all it would mean if he\u2019d supported TARP is that he\u2019s guilty of the same sin as McConnell. Toss that out and you can still rationalize supporting him as the comparatively conservative choice on other grounds. In fact, Bevin himself is clear-eyed about why he\u2019s become a cause celebre among some righty groups. The election\u2019s a referendum on McConnell, not a choice between him and Bevin. All the challenger has to do is not disqualify himself and then hope that anti-establishment fever sends a huge crowd of tea partiers to the polls in May. And supporting TARP, as I just explained, is almost never disqualifying.\n\nAnyway. He says he didn\u2019t support it. It was the chief investment officer who wrote the SEC document. Bevin was required to sign and concluded it would be grossly inappropriate for him to mess with the CIO\u2019s advice to investors.\n\n\u201cI was not the investment guy,\u201d he said, \u201cI never bought and sold the securities. So it would have been inappropriate and probably illegal, frankly, for me to have changed the investing commentary written by the sub-adviser the fund who was responsible for that.\u201d \u201cI had a fiduciary responsibility as the chairman of this fund company to make sure that I was not perceived in any way, shape or form as having commentary on buy and sell decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the responsibility of the adviser to the fund. And for me to have meddled in that would have been highly, highly inappropriate and all of these various Sarbanes\u2013Oxley rules \u2014 among others \u2014 would have been very much in my grill had I attempted to rewrite or meddle or make the thinking of the actual fund manager that of my own.\u201d\n\nAt the Corner, Patrick Brennan counters:\n\nBevin may or may not be right about the underlying legalities \u2014 it\u2019s not clear how compliance would require him to lend his endorsement to investment advice he didn\u2019t believe. He\u2019s maintaining that he adamantly opposed measures that he was telling investors, to whom he has a fiduciary responsibility and to whom he was selling advice, were a great idea. Of course, Bevin could have privately objected on principle but believed that they were the right measure \u2014 especially for equities investors \u2014 especially in the short term. But I suspect he won\u2019t be saying that, and Mitch McConnell can rightly argue that even Matt Bevin knew financial markets had to be rescued and that passing TARP was the right move.\n\nQuestion for securities experts: If the CEO thought TARP was a disaster in the making and told the CIO that, couldn\u2019t the CIO have written instead, \u201cAlthough opinion among management is divided, our consensus view is that TARP is a positive development\u201d? Surely an expression of mild reservation based on the CEO\u2019s considered judgment of a new federal policy wouldn\u2019t get them sued. But then, again, it doesn\u2019t matter. If you\u2019re for Bevin, you deeply dislike McConnell and think it\u2019s time for fresh blood. The challenger\u2019s position on TARP doesn\u2019t change that, even if it makes his blood slightly less fresh.\n\nSpeaking of McConnell and tea partiers, Rand Paul told Beck on Friday that the reason he endorsed McConnell was \u201d because he asked me. He asked me when there was nobody else in the race and I said yes.\u201d Sounds \u2026 lukewarm, but I think people are making too much of it. Paul was always going to endorse McConnell; it\u2019s his way of showing the establishment ahead of his presidential run that he can play nice with them if he ends up as the nominee. Look at it this way: Now that there is someone else in the race, why hasn\u2019t he withdrawn his McConnell endorsement and switched to Bevin or at least chosen neutrality?
