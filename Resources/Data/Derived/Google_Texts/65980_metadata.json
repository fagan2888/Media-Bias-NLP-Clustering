Nearby orangutan Mias receives daily treatment for cystic fibrosis.\n\nWith the prices of animal food, veterinary care and zoo maintenance on the rise, the zoo is seeking to increase admission prices to feed and care for its more than 4,000 animals.\n\nZoo officials Wednesday will ask a City Council committee for permission to charge $2 more across all age groups during the March-October high season, resulting in a $17 general admission, zoo spokeswoman Tiffany Barnhart said this week. During the November-February offseason, the zoo wants to charge $1 more, resulting in a $13 general admission.\n\nThe zoo is not seeking to increase annual membership fees.\n\n\u201cI think that everyone certainly understands the increase in costs because they\u2019re seeing them at home, as well,\u201d Barnhart said. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of opposition.\u201d\n\nDenver Parks and Recreation supports the fee increase.\n\n\u201cThe rate increases seem to be minimal, and their costs have gone up with new exhibits,\u201d said Jeff Green, spokesman for Denver Parks and Recreation. \u201d It\u2019s in our best interest to have a zoo that\u2019s well-maintained.\u201d\n\nThe zoo last raised admission fees in 2012 to help fund operational costs for the Toyota Elephant Passage. Tickets were raised by $2.\n\nSince 2012, the price of Billy\u2019s hay has increased 77 percent, zoo officials said. Frozen meat is up 27 percent, dry food is up 18 percent, frozen fish is up 12 percent and medications are up 150 percent.\n\n\u201cWe must provide the highest-quality care for all our animals,\u201d Barnhart said.\n\nZoo facilities also are showing their age, Barnhart said. The cost of maintaining them has jumped 39 percent since 2012.\n\nBarnhart said there are nine scheduled free days in 2014 and 69 percent of zoo guests get free or discounted admission, whether through a free day, program or coupon.\n\nThe council\u2019s Infrastructure and Culture Committee plans to meet at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday in Room 39 at Denver\u2019s City and Council Building.\n\nThe proposed price increase would begin in September.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/literally_lizzy", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec40\"", "article_summary": "With the prices of animal food, veterinary care and zoo maintenance on the rise, the zoo is seeking to increase admission prices to feed and care for its more than 4,000 animals.\n\u201cI think that everyone certainly understands the increase in costs because they\u2019re seeing them at home, as well,\u201d Barnhart said.\nDenver Zoo resident Billy the elephant eats more than 100 pounds of hay and produce every day.\nDuring the November-February offseason, the zoo wants to charge $1 more, resulting in a $13 general admission.\n\u201d It\u2019s in our best interest to have a zoo that\u2019s well-maintained.\u201dThe zoo last raised admission fees in 2012 to help fund operational costs for the Toyota Elephant Passage."}
