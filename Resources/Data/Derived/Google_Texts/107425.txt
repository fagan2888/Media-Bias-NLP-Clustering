An 18-year-old suspect is recovering from gunshot wounds in the Grady County Jail after he was shot by police during a pursuit early Tuesday morning in Chickasha.

Police say they tried to pull over Decayla Maul near 9th Street and Kansas Avenue around 1:30 a.m., but he refused to stop. Chickasha police officers and Grady County deputies pursued his car until Maul lost control in the 1700 block of S. 7th Street. He stopped his car in a yard, jumped out, and ran.

Officers then chased Maul on foot through a neighborhood. They said as they ran after him, Maul pulled out a revolver and began shooting at officers. Two Grady County deputies fired back, hitting Maul in the chin and ankle.

Maul was taken into custody and transported to Grady Memorial Hospital. After he was treated and released, he was booked into the Grady County Jail for shooting with intent to kill, driving without a license, eluding, and possession of marijuana.

The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) will investigate the shooting. Chickasha Police say that's standard procedure in an officer-involved shooting. Chickasha Police Major Elip Moore says he believes the officers' and deputies' actions were "legal, justified, and necessary."

There was also a 16 year old in the car with Maul during the chase. He was questioned and released to a guardian. He will not be charged.
