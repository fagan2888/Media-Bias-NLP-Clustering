County is filling the gap for noncitizens with My Health LA, a $61 million program launched last October that has enrolled 131,000 people. Any L.A. County resident who earns 138 percent or less of the federal poverty level \u2014 $33,465 for a family of four \u2014 is eligible, Brigham said.\n\nL.A. is one of 47 California counties to offer basic health coverage for undocumented immigrants, according to Health Access California, a group that advocates such coverage. The 11 counties that don\u2019t offer it include three of the five largest: San Bernardino, Orange and San Diego.\n\nThe state will begin offering health insurance for about 170,000 undocumented children beginning May 1. Approved as part of the 2015-2016 state budget, Medi-Cal for undocumented children is expected to cost about $40 million annually. It was approved largely along party lines with Democrats supporting and most Republicans opposing it.\n\nCalifornia stands out in offering health coverage to undocumented immigrants. To win support for the Affordable Care Act in Congress, President Barack Obama explicitly promised that the federal law would not cover them.\n\nWhile Obamacare scored big successes in some parts of L.A. County, it failed to deliver in others. The biggest gains in health insurance coverage came in Compton, Pomona and Inglewood, where the insured rate grew by at least 8 percentage points from 2013 to 2014. Meanwhile, the insured rate grew by half as much in Pasadena, Torrance and Glendale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd in El Monte, where 27 percent of residents lacked insurance in 2013, the uninsured rate hit 29 percent last year. It was the only city in L.A. County where the uninsured rate got worse under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSan Bernardino County also saw mixed results, according to the American Community Survey. The uninsured rate fell by 6 to 8 percentage points in San Bernardino, Rialto, Ontario and Chino. But in Chino Hills, Redlands and Rancho Cucamonga it fell by 2 percent or less. And in Upland, the change was so small, a reduction of 0.3 percent, that it could be explained by statistical error.\n\nClinics serve poor\n\nMany current and formerly uninsured \u2014 immigrants and citizens alike \u2014 get health care at community clinics such as San Fernando-based Northeast Valley Health Corp. and Valley Community Healthcare in North Hollywood.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and My Health LA, as well as others, have had a huge impact on community clinics.\n\n\u201cMore and more people are covered,\u201d said Kim Wyard, chief executive officer of Northeast Valley Health. For example, the uninsured rate among Northeast\u2019s adult patients has fallen from 65 percent in 2011 to 33 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, Valley Community Healthcare has opened a new center in North Hills because of increased business, President Paula Wilson said.\n\nMost patients at Northeast Valley and Valley Community Healthcare are poor. Those who are uninsured pay on a sliding scale based on income. Both clinics offer primary care, dentistry and other services such as counseling. Among their goals is to give patients a \u201cmedical home\u201d so they won\u2019t go to an emergency room at the first sign of trouble.\n\nA 1986 federal law requires ER\u2019s to treat people during medical emergencies regardless of ability to pay. But the cost can be high, both financially and medically. That\u2019s particularly true if the patient goes to the ER for treatment of a chronic condition such as diabetes, which will only get worse if it isn\u2019t managed properly.\n\nBoth clinics are participating in a project with Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys to track their patients who visit the hospital ER or are treated as inpatients. Usually the clinics have no idea that their patients have gone to the hospital, let alone what happened to them there.\n\nDuring the three-year, $1 million project, funded by the UniHealth Foundation, the clinics will get hospital records and in turn follow up with their patients. That should improve the patients\u2019 health and reduce costs.\n\nCutting uninsured rate\n\nThe county still hopes to push down its uninsured rate, which, at 15.6 percent, is 3 points higher than the state rate.\n\n\u201cWe need to do a lot of work in educating people about the coverage options available to them,\u201d Brigham said.\n\nAt Valley Community Healthcare and Northeast Valley, staffers routinely screen patients to see if they\u2019re eligible for the Affordable Care Act, My Health LA or other programs.\n\n\u201cWhat we find most successful is going to locations they frequent,\u201d Valley Community\u2019s Wilson said. \u201cReally going to soccer fields where these families congregate on a Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust is a major, major issue,\u201d said Olga Duran, Valley Community\u2019s member services director. Because of anti-immigrant sentiment, many immigrants and relatives of immigrants hesitate to enroll.\n\nChurches are important allies in getting people signed up, Duran said. But you have to go out and ask people.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to come to you,\u201d Duran said. \u201cWe have to go to them.\u201d\n\nThe numbers are daunting: In Northeast Valley\u2019s turf alone, Wyard estimates the number of uninsured will be 200,000 in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running as fast as we can, not only to get the message out but to provide service,\u201d Duran said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nThe CHCF Center for Health Reporting partners with the Los Angeles News Group on health care issues.
