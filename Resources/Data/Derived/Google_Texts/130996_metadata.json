Last week, we upped the intensity and everybody came to work. This week, we just have to take it up another notch. We have to still come to work. It\u2019s not about what happened, but what we\u2019re going to do about it.\u201d\n\nDespite the rough-around-the-edges start featuring inconsistent quarterback play and offensive efficiency, plus a tendency to give up big-yardage plays on defense, the Rams seem to have a chance to get the ship righted in the second half. There isn\u2019t a game on the remaining schedule the Rams can\u2019t win. That doesn\u2019t mean 6-0 is likely, and improvement will be necessary to to bowl eligibility, but it\u2019s far from impossible.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @tfrei", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado State,Kevin Davis,Kivon Cartwright", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Field House", "description": "Colorado State football will be staying the course in spite of a 2-4 start, say Kivon Cartwright and Kevin Davis, two Colorado products.", "title": "Kivon Cartwright, Kevin Davis says Colorado staying course despite losses", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2015/10/12/cartwright-davis-say-the-rams-are-staying-the-course/34108/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2015/10/Davis-495x351.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Colorado State football will be staying the course in spite of a 2-4 start, say Kivon Cartwright and Kevin Davis, two Colorado products.", "title": "Kivon Cartwright, Kevin Davis say Colorado State staying the course", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2015/10/12/cartwright-davis-say-the-rams-are-staying-the-course/34108/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2015/10/Davis-495x351.jpg", "creator": "@TFrei", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Colorado State football will be staying the course in spite of a 2-4 start, say Kivon Cartwright and Kevin Davis, two Colorado products."}, "article_summary": "FORT COLLINS \u2014 Two Southern Colorado high school products \u2014 tight end Kivon Cartwright, from Pueblo South, and linebacker Kevin Davis, from Fountain-Fort Carson \u2014 represented the Rams\u2019 players at Colorado State coach Mike Bobo\u2019s Monday noon news conference.\nBoth Davis and Cartwright, as might be expected, said the Rams are staying the course after the 41-10 loss to Boise State dropped them to 2-4 for the season.\nThat was appropriate, given the Rams (0-2 in Mountain West play) face Air Force (2-0) at Hughes Stadium Saturday.\nDavis, who also was a standout hockey player (for Cheyenne Mountain because his high school didn\u2019t have a team) and is from a military family, noted that Air Force recruited him.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean 6-0 is likely, and improvement will be necessary to to bowl eligibility, but it\u2019s far from impossible."}
