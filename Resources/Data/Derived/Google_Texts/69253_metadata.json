I was, too. In fact, growing up, pretty much every parent I knew abused their kids.\n\nOr so many of Adrian Peterson\u2019s critics would have you believe.\n\nPeterson, a star of the Minnesota Vikings, was arrested recently for child abuse after hitting his 4-year-old son with a switch. A \u201cswitch,\u201d for those who don\u2019t know, is a long twig. I should know, having been on the receiving end of quite a few. When no switch was available, Mom was also known to employ a section of the orange plastic track from my Hot Wheels.\n\nAdmittedly, a few of the \u201cchild abusers\u201d I knew were bad and neglectful parents back in that era before \u201cparent\u201d was a verb, but most were caring and attentive people who scraped and sacrificed so their kids might have better than they themselves ever did.\n\nMy own mother \u2014 you may take my word for this \u2014 was the best mother in the history of mothering, fixer of scrapes, keeper of confidences, stretcher of dollars, listener of prayers, critic of a certain budding writer\u2019s earliest work. And, yes, a spanker of behinds when the owners of said behinds got too outrageously out of line.\n\nI don\u2019t write any of this in defense of Peterson, by the way. I have no idea of the severity of the punishment he gave his child.\n\nNo, I\u2019m just here to express the sense of dislocation, of sheer, unadulterated \u201cHuh?\u201d that comes with hearing that the best mother in the history of mothering was a child abuser. But Peterson\u2019s critics have been very clear.\n\n\u201cSpanking isn\u2019t parenting; it\u2019s child abuse,\u201d goes a headline on CNN\u2019s website.\n\n\u201cViolence is violence,\u201d argues a piece on Bleacher Report.\n\nSorry, but that\u2019s going to be a hard sell for me \u2014 and for the three other people my mom raised successfully, and essentially alone, in the gang- and poverty-ridden slums of Los Angeles.\n\nBut then, the idealized model of modern mothering now resembles less her example than it does that of a woman I once saw pleading with a child to behave. The child in question, a boy of about 4, was frolicking barefoot through the ice cream cooler in the supermarket.\n\nNever raising her voice, his mom reasoned with him. He giggled.\n\nShe cajoled him. He ignored her.\n\nShe threatened him with a \u201ctime out.\u201d He didn\u2019t even look her way.\n\nHe was still tip-toeing through the Ben & Jerry\u2019s and she was still begging him not to, as I left the store. This was maybe 25 years ago and I find myself wondering:\n\nIf she couldn\u2019t stop a 4-year-old from strolling through the ice cream cooler, what in the world did she do when that same child was 13 and ditching school, 14 and using drugs, 15 and getting horizontal with some little girl in his class?\n\nI don\u2019t believe in spanking reflexively. Not every offense merits it. Indeed, most don\u2019t.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in spanking to excess. The idea is to sting, not hurt.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in spanking in anger. Anger leads to loss of control.\n\nAnd no, I don\u2019t believe all spanking is abuse. A 2001 study by Dr. Diana Baumrind \u2014 a psychologist who opposes spanking \u2014 found that mild to moderate corporal punishment causes no lasting harm.\n\nHere\u2019s what I do believe. A parent must be loving, accessible, involved, but also an authority figure, the one who sets limits and imposes real and painful consequences for kids who flout them.\n\nOtherwise, you risk sending into the world something we already have in excess \u2014 children poisoned by \u201cself-esteem,\u201d walking in serene self-entitlement, convinced the sun shines for them alone.\n\nSuch children are invariably brought up short. The universe is a rough teacher and its lessons sting worse than any spanking you could get.\n\nThe worst thing you can do is send your offspring into that classroom unprepared.\n\nSpeaking of child abuse.\n\n\u2014 Leonard Pitts: lpitts@miamiherald.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1ure6YD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Spanking, without anger, can be part of responsible parenting", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "Spanking, without anger, can be part of responsible parenting", "title": "Here\u2019s what is, and isn\u2019t, really child abuse", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/columnists/2014/09/21/really-child-abuse/15904255/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Spanking, without anger, can be part of responsible parenting", "title": "Here\u2019s what is, and isn\u2019t, really child abuse", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/66c61cea3fa4db815393df3efc0a2d3004612bb2/c=622-0-3163-2541&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2014/09/19/parent3.jpg", "creator": "@postcrescent", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Peterson, a star of the Minnesota Vikings, was arrested recently for child abuse after hitting his 4-year-old son with a switch.\n\u201cSpanking isn\u2019t parenting; it\u2019s child abuse,\u201d goes a headline on CNN\u2019s website.\nSpeaking of child abuse.\nAnd no, I don\u2019t believe all spanking is abuse.\nSpanking, without anger, can be part of responsible parentingFather-son serious talk (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto )My mother was a child abuser."}
