Cardenas survived.\n\nAurora\u2019s 15 vehicle-collision deaths so far this year put the city on pace to surpass last year\u2019s 19.\n\n\u201cPast fatal, critical-injury collisions have involved alcohol or marijuana, road rage, inattention and reckless driving,\u201d Aurora Police Chief Nicholas Metz said in a statement Saturday. \u201cLives and families are being destroyed by incidents that could have been prevented.\u201d\n\nCardenas tried to rescue his cousins from the burning SUV but ended up watching them die, according to Lt. Michael A. McClelland, a spokesman for Aurora police.\n\nCardenas was taken to University Hospital, where he was treated for injuries that are not considered life-threatening, McClelland said.\n\nHigh speed and sleep depravation probably caused the accident, he said.\n\nDuring the investigation, the highway was partially closed for several hours.\n\nCardenas told officers that he and his cousins work together in oil fields near New Raymer and that their day had started at 3:30 a.m. Friday. After work, they drove to the Denver area and went to a restaurant for dinner with family members. Then they went to a cousin\u2019s house until about 4 a.m. Saturday, McClelland said.\n\nOne witness said she was driving northbound on I-225 when a red Isuzu passed her going more than 80 mph.\n\nCardenas was sleeping in the backseat when he was startled awake by someone screaming, \u201cWatch out!\u201d The SUV careered off the highway near Interstate 70 at about 4:35 a.m.\n\nCardenas was ejected from the vehicle when it rolled numerous times. He immediately saw that the vehicle was on fire. Meanwhile, two men, including an off-duty state trooper, stopped their cars and ran to help. Then a FedEx truck driver stopped, grabbed a fire extinguisher and tried to save the two cousins. The flames and heat from the SUV were too intense to get very close, McClelland said.\n\n\u201cShortly after backing away from the burning Isuzu, it exploded,\u201d he said.\n\nMcClelland said intoxication doesn\u2019t appear to be a factor in the crash.\n\n\u201cAt this time, we do not believe the driver, Hadzi, was intoxicated, as both Juan and family members claim Hadzi is not a drinker.\u201d\n\nEvidence at the scene supports suspicions that the vehicle simply drove off the highway. It did not appear that seat belts were used by the occupants, McClelland said.\n\nInvestigators believe the fuel tank ignited.\n\nVirgen and Cosio-Virgen were pronounced dead at the scene, McClelland said. An investigation of the crash is ongoing.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Aurora: Two cousins killed, one injured in fiery I-225 accident", "title": "Aurora: Two cousins killed, one injured in fiery I-225 accident", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/11/aurora-two-cousins-killed-one-injured-in-fiery-i-225-accident/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411_113310_trafficpic2.jpg", "height": 491}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411_113310_trafficpic2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T07:52:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T18:56:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc425\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPast fatal, critical-injury collisions have involved alcohol or marijuana, road rage, inattention and reckless driving,\u201d Aurora Police Chief Nicholas Metz said in a statement Saturday.\nCardenas told officers that he and his cousins work together in oil fields near New Raymer and that their day had started at 3:30 a.m. Friday.\nHadzigebich \u201cHadzi\u201d Cosio-Virgen, who was driving the red 1999 Isuzu Trooper, and Jorge Luis Virgen, 19, a front-seat passenger, were killed.\nOne witness said she was driving northbound on I-225 when a red Isuzu passed her going more than 80 mph.\nAfter work, they drove to the Denver area and went to a restaurant for dinner with family members."}
