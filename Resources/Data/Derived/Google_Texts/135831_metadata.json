But even Garnett admits there are times when months of hearings and drawn-out jury trials aren't the answer \u2014 especially in the case of adolescents.\n\n\"That may make sense for a murder case, but it doesn't make sense for a kid knocking a mailbox off its post,\" Garnett said.\n\nHis office will be one of four in Colorado participating in a state pilot program to help youths stay out of the court system \u2014 even the juvenile court system \u2014 and resolve their cases through restorative justice. Over the next few months, Garnett and his staff will be working on opening the 20th Judicial District Attorney's Center of Prevention and Restorative Justice.\n\nRather than focusing on punishment in court, restorative justice seeks to get juveniles face-to-face with the people harmed by their crimes.\n\nIn meetings that also include trained facilitators, law enforcement officers and members of the community, offenders create a plan to make amends directly to the people they affected and get a first-hand look at the consequences of their actions.\n\n\"Restorative justice can be very powerful,\" said Peggy Jessel, chief deputy of the Boulder DA Office's juvenile division who will become director of the program. \"It's empowering and healing for the victims. It gives them a chance to ask, 'Why did you pick me?'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough some jurisdictions \u2014 including Boulder County \u2014 already use restorative justice in sentencing as a condition of probation, the state Legislature passed a bill in 2013 seeking to expand the use of restorative justice. The bill also created a pilot program to collect data on its feasibility as a possible alternative to the juvenile court system statewide.\n\nBoulder County was selected by the state as one of four judicial districts \u2014 along with those in Weld, Pueblo and Alamosa counties \u2014 to participate in the pilot program. Garnett said his office has already secured about $500,000 in funding from the state and other grant programs to pay for the estimated $50,000 to $100,000 in extra costs during the center's first several years.\n\nGarnett said he hopes to have the center up and running by October, and he hopes that 60 to 70 percent of the 500 or so juvenile cases Boulder County sees every year will go through the program. Already this year, about 100 juveniles have been diverted to the restorative justice program, he said.\n\n\"This could be one of the most dramatic changes in Colorado law ever,\" Garnett said. \"We're excited to be at the forefront of it.\"\n\n'It personalizes the harm'\n\nThe goal of restorative justice is to have the juveniles figure out how they can make up for their crimes directly to the people affected, rather than a judge levying some sort of punitive sentence.\n\nFor instance, Jessel said a young person who admitted to shoplifting might be required to work to pay for what he or she stole \u2014 and might also have to hear from community store owners about how shoplifting affects them, and apologize to the victim.\n\n\"They need to come up with a way to repair the harm,\" Jessel said.\n\nFinn Kilculoen, left, and Rigo Taboada participate in a peer leader training workshop put on by the Longmont Community Justice Program on Thursday.

Law enforcement officers \u2014 often the arresting officer \u2014 and trained community members also participate.\n\nThe new restorative justice center will take a few adult cases, but Jessel said restorative justice is much more effective on youth.\n\n\"It personalizes the harm, it personalizes who they hurt,\" Jessel said. \"They have to say what they did.\"\n\nJuveniles sometimes have trouble understanding there are consequences for their actions, she said. Restorative justice forces them to confront those consequences.\n\n\"I think with juveniles, they are so impulsive that they don't think through anything,\" Jessel said. \"That's why it is important they meet face-to-face with the victim.\"\n\nState Rep. Pete Lee, D-Colorado Springs, is the lawmaker who authored the bill to create the restorative justice pilot program.\n\n\"(Juveniles) don't respond to things the same way adults do,\" Lee said. \"Emerging brain science explains that, and the criminal justice system has to take that into account.\"\n\nJessel also said for adolescents, having to talk about what they did in front of a room full of people \u2014 including the victim \u2014 can serve as powerful negative reinforcement for future crimes.\n\n\"It can be really scary,\" Jessel said. \"They don't want to come back.\"\n\n'We know it works'\n\nFor the most part, area officials say juvenile offenders who go through restorative justice don't come back.\n\nCandy Campbell, executive director of Longmont Community Justice Partnership \u2014 a community-based restorative justice program \u2014 said her organization sees much lower recidivism rates for young people who go through restorative justice.\n\nNationwide, about 60 percent of juveniles who go through the court process re-offend as juveniles. Campbell said over 20 years of 150 to 180 cases annually, LCJP has an 8 to 10 percent recidivism rate.\n\n\"We know it works based on our statistics,\" Campbell said. \"We have a huge success rate and track record.\"\n\nLCJP's community-based model allows local agencies such as the Longmont Police Department and area schools to refer children directly to the center, avoiding the court system altogether.\n\n\"By being community entrenched, we can serve at a greater level,\" Campbell said.\n\nLaura Snider, a program manager for LCJP, was training students at Longmont High earlier this week as peer leaders to participate in the restorative justice program. Snider said the impact for juvenile offenders can sometimes be more effective when it comes from people their age.\n\n\"Adults can talk until we turn blue in the face,\" she said.\n\nLCJP has been working with the Boulder County DA's Office to establish a similar program in Boulder within the restorative justice center. Garnett said his hope is that more juvenile cases can be resolved without them ever going into a courtroom so young offenders aren't strapped with records for the rest of their lives. Although juveniles can sometimes get the details of their cases sealed, the record of that arrest and case could still prevent them from getting jobs or going to college.\n\n\"It is difficult to do that with a record of arrest,\" Garnett said. \"Even the act of filing a case can have significant problems for a young person.\"\n\nLee, the lawmaker, pointed out that in New Zealand, all cases are sent to restorative justice first and then referred to juvenile court if needed, as opposed to the other way around.\n\nBut Lee acknowledged not all cases are appropriate for restorative justice. Certain charges \u2014 including assault and sexual crimes \u2014 by law cannot go through the restorative justice system. He also said restorative justice requires cooperation of the offender.\n\n\"One of the keys to restorative justice is the offender accepting responsibility for what they did,\" Lee said. \"I think it works because offenders accept responsibility for what they did and develop empathy for their victims and then are committed to repairing the broken relationship that results from criminal offenses.\"\n\nAnd, Lee said, in his experience, victims can sometimes feel like they are pushed to the side in a criminal case. He said restorative justice makes them an integral part of the process.\n\n\"The way the system is set up now, the victim isn't a full participant,\" Lee said. \"The victims are represented by the prosecutor but are somewhat peripheral. In restorative justice, they are an equal partner.\"\n\nJessel, of the DA's Office, said while going through restorative justice, young people may also need other resources, such as substance abuse treatment or mental health evaluations.\n\nAnd, she said, in most cases, the victims don't want the juveniles to have criminal records, but simply want them to realize what they've done and repay the damage.\n\n\"A lot of victims don't necessarily want a criminal case,\" Jessel said. \"They just want them to fix the damage.\"\n\n'Culture change'\n\nAs part of the pilot, Boulder and the other judicial districts taking part in the program will keep data on the cost, recidivism rate and satisfaction level of victims and offenders going through the restorative justice program.\n\nGarnett said the extra cost in setting up the restorative justice program will be made up by reducing court time and prosecution costs as well as keeping juveniles out of detention, and Lee said he thinks the data will show restorative justice is also more effective.\n\n\"That's what's been shown in every other place restorative justice has been effectively integrated,\" Lee said. \"I think when the data comes out and other jurisdictions see that it results in higher satisfaction, lower levels of recidivism and saves money, why would they not adopt it?\"\n\nBut Lee said using restorative justice does require a different way of thinking by prosecutors, and he commended the counties participating in the pilot program.\n\n\"It's a culture change within the DA's Office, and it is always difficult to change culture,\" Lee said. \"They were taught to ask, 'What is the offense, who committed it, and what's the penalty?' With restorative justice, they have to ask different questions: 'What harm occurred, and how do we repair the harm?' It's a lot more of an individual approach to justice than the existing system.\"\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Mitchell Byars at 303-473-1329 or byarsm@dailycamera.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_26176550/face-face-victims-boulder-county-expand-restorative-justice", "sailthru.author": "By Mitchell Byars \n \n  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26176550:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-19T17:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Boulder County is one of four districts in Colorado participating in a state pilot program to help youths stay out of the court system.", "title": "Face to face with victims: Boulder County to expand restorative justice", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_26176550/face-face-victims-boulder-county-expand-restorative-justice", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0718/20140718__20DCAJUVw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County News", "modificationDate": "2014-07-19T18:10:16-0600", "endDate": "2024-07-19T17:00:00-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder County,Colorado,news,events,weather,breaking news,lifestyles,things to do,", "byline": "By Mitchell ByarsCamera", "pubDate": "2014-07-18T19:05:51-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-19T17:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Face to face with victims: Boulder County to expand restorative justice", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0718/20140718__20DCAJUVw~2_300.jpg", "description": "Boulder County is one of four districts in Colorado participating in a state pilot program to help youths stay out of the court system.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_26176550/face-face-victims-boulder-county-expand-restorative-justice", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Boulder County is one of four districts in Colorado participating in a state pilot program to help youths stay out of the court system.", "title": "Face to face with victims: Boulder County to expand restorative justice"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0718/20140718__20DCAJUVw~2.jpg"}, "article_summary": "AdvertisementAlthough some jurisdictions \u2014 including Boulder County \u2014 already use restorative justice in sentencing as a condition of probation, the state Legislature passed a bill in 2013 seeking to expand the use of restorative justice.\nCandy Campbell, executive director of Longmont Community Justice Partnership \u2014 a community-based restorative justice program \u2014 said her organization sees much lower recidivism rates for young people who go through restorative justice.\nThe new restorative justice center will take a few adult cases, but Jessel said restorative justice is much more effective on youth.\nLCJP has been working with the Boulder County DA's Office to establish a similar program in Boulder within the restorative justice center.\nThey were learning to help run the restorative justice sessions, which put juvenile offenders face to face with the people affected by their crimes."}
