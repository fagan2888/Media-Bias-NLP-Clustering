As of September 2015, there were 55 approved Section 1115 demonstration projects in operation in 38 states.

The CMS also has failed to ensure the experiments don't add to Medicaid spending, according to the GAO.On Oct. 16, the CMS sent a report to Congress that was required by the Affordable Care Act as a means to ensure the public has notice, information and opportunity to provide input on the experimental approaches.The document is largely a recap of guidance the CMS issued over the last decade related to Medicaid waivers.\u201cAlthough the report to Congress is long on process reforms, HHS has provided no insight as to the criteria the secretary will use in making such a determination, the principles on which such criteria rest, or the necessary evidence on which her decision to either start or continue a demonstration necessarily must be based,\u201d Rosenbaum, of George Washington University, said.Experts also questioned why the report to Congress indicates that the CMS notified state Medicaid directors in an April 2012 letter that they must subject amendments to a demonstration waiver to the same public comment process as the initial application. The actual letter describes the comment period as optional.\u201cThe big picture here is that a state could change absolutely everything via an amendment and not get stakeholder feedback,\u201d said Leonardo Cuello, director of health policy for the National Health Law Program.The report also did little to address how the CMS determines that a waiver is budget-neutral.\u201cWe remain concerned
