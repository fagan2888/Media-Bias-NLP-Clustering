Nearly three-quarters of Texans searching for health insurance on the Affordable Care Act-mandated insurance exchanges are only able to pick from one or two providers, Texas Medical Association research shows.

Of the 254 counties in Texas, 76 only had one insurer providing exchange-based benefits, while another 111 had two insurers. As the map shows, the majority of the one and two plan counties are in rural Texas, though nearby Kaufman and Wise counties fall under that distinction.

Just because a county is only serviced by one or two providers doesn’t mean the uninsured don’t have options. One insurance company might sell a variety of different plans, with different levels of coverage and prices.
