The contract could pay the firm $975,000 if renewed annually over the next four years.\n\nAn Orange County advertising firm stands to earn almost $1 million from Riverside County to market the county-run hospital to patients who now have more treatment options through Obamacare.\n\nThe Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a contract with Johnson Gray Advertising to provide website and marketing services for Riverside County Regional Medical Center. The contract worth $195,000 can be renewed annually for up to four years, making the deal potentially worth $975,000.\n\n\u201cThis is a very important part of our plan moving forward, to realign the Riverside County Regional Medical Center to make it more competitive,\u201d said Supervisor Marion Ashley. The contract was approved 3-0 with Supervisor John Benoit absent and a vacancy on the board due to Jeff Stone\u2019s election to the state Senate.\n\nThe contract calls for Johnson Gray to revamp the website and conduct a marketing and re-branding campaign for the 362-bed hospital in Moreno Valley and the county\u2019s network of outpatient clinics. The hospital network also includes 77 beds at a psychiatric facility in Riverside.\n\nThe campaign could involve re-naming the hospital and clinic system \u201cto better reflect their roles as a quality patient centered institution that is supported by prestigious and long standing academic affiliations,\u201d the contract read.\n\nUC Riverside, Loma Linda University and Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona send medical students to train at the hospital.\n\nJohnson Gray\u2019s bid was not the lowest; other bids ranged from just under $68,000 to $1.45 million, according to a county staff report. Johnson Gray won because \u201cthe lowest bids did not include website design and/or the bidder had insufficient healthcare/hospital marketing experience,\u201d the report read.\n\nJohnson Gray\u2019s website lists Loma Linda University Medical Center, Irvine-based St. Joseph Health System and UCLA Medical Center among the company\u2019s clients. Representatives of Johnson Gray did not return a phone call seeking comment.\n\nRiverside County hospital CEO Zareh Sarrafian defended the contact in remarks to supervisors. Traditionally, the county Hospital has been a safety net for those who can\u2019t afford care elsewhere.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, provides health insurance to those who previously lacked it. As a result, county officials have said the hospital will have to compete for patients.\n\nWith an annual operating budget of roughly $442 million, the hospital is recovering from a rocky financial period. At one point last year, its budget shortfall exceeded $50 million.\n\nTo lure patients, the hospital will have to promote itself, Sarrafian said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that expertise in-house,\u201d he told supervisors. \u201cAnd we need to do this sooner (rather) than later and try to catch up with the rest of the hospital community, who have been doing this for a very long time in establishing their brand in the community.\u201d\n\nAfter the meeting, Sarrafian said the hospital is sensitive about spending taxpayer money. But the hospital\u2019s marketing efforts are a fraction of what other, for-profit medical centers spend, he said.\n\n\u201cThe growth of our institution depends heavily on our ability to have our region be aware of the quality of care and scope of services\u201d the county hospital provides, Sarrafian added.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "sailthru.author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "content_author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "ICBM": "33.948100, -117.396100", "sailthru.tags": "news, hospital, county, contract, marketing, riverside, gray, johnson, medical, center, million", "content_section": "news", "content_title": "RIVERSIDE COUNTY: Supervisors approve $195,000-a-year contract to market hospital", "geo.position": "33.948100;-117.396100", "author": "JEFF HORSEMAN", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-01-29 16:22:04", "sailthru.title": "RIVERSIDE COUNTY: Supervisors approve $195,000-a-year contract to market hospital", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/niyrti-b88320078z.120150129162204000ggf7n747.10.jpg", "geo.placename": "Riverside", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/niyrti-b88320078z.120150129162204000ggf7n747.10.jpg", "content_type": "article", "publication_date": "2015-01-29", "Description": "News: RIVERSIDE COUNTY: Supervisors approve $195,000-a-year contract to market hospital | hospital, county, contract, marketing, riverside, gray, johnson, medical, center, million", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "News: RIVERSIDE COUNTY: Supervisors approve $195,000-a-year contract to market hospital | hospital, county, contract, marketing, riverside, gray, johnson, medical, center, million", "title": "RIVERSIDE COUNTY: Supervisors approve $195,000-a-year contract to market hospital", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/niyrti-b88320078z.120150129162204000ggf7n747.10.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/hospital-759196-county-contract.html", "type": "article"}, "Keywords": "hospital, county, contract, marketing, riverside, gray, johnson, medical, center, million", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/niyrti-b88320078z.120150129162204000ggf7n747.10.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc490\"", "article_summary": "RIVERSIDE COUNTY: Supervisors approve $195,000-a-year contract to market hospital Share Pin It 1 of 2 More Galleries Riverside County will pay an Orange County advertising firm $195,000 a year for up to five years to promote Riverside County's hospital in Moreno Valley.\nTERRY PIERSON, FILE PHOTO Related article \u00bb HEALING THE HOSPITAL Here's a breakdown of what Riverside County has spent to stabilize and improve Riverside County Regional Medical Center's finances.\nRiverside County hospital CEO Zareh Sarrafian defended the contact in remarks to supervisors.\nAn Orange County advertising firm stands to earn almost $1 million from Riverside County to market the county-run hospital to patients who now have more treatment options through Obamacare.\nTraditionally, the county Hospital has been a safety net for those who can\u2019t afford care elsewhere."}
