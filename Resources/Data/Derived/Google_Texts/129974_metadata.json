(Photo: Mary Frank/Staff Photographer )Buy Photo\n\nDemolition is anticipated soon on a landmark downtown building that was left in ruins after a fire on May 15 at the corner of Robbins and Washington streets.\n\nTownship Administrator Paul J. Shives said municipal officials met with representatives of the property owners earlier this week. The owners are part of a real estate partnership called 27 Washington Street Associates, which had 15 commercial or public tenants leasing space inside the complex.\n\nShives said the owners have hired a demolition contractor and are in the process of disconnecting all the utilities, the first in a series of steps that will culminate in the knocking down of the two-story brick structure. Another meeting with officials is scheduled next week, at which time the township expects to receive a start date for the work.\n\n\u201cThey want to proceed as quickly as possible to demolish the structure,\u201d Shives said.\n\nThough investigators have ruled the fire an accident, no definitive explanation for its cause has been reached. The fire is thought to have originated above a drop ceiling in the rear of East Coast Gamers, one of the previous commercial tenants.\n\nOn the night of the fire, East Coast Gamers owner Michael Marino said he received a call from his alarm company at 11:17 p.m. to inform him that a motion sensor had been tripped inside the store.\n\nHe called a friend who was in town and asked him if he could stop by the business to see whether anything appeared amiss. The friend called Marino back a short time later. There was smoke billowing from the roof. He told Marino to get there as soon as possible.\n\nAfter the fire investigation was over, Marino said, he was informed the wiring in an old electrical junction box above the ceiling panels had failed. The wiring was too frail to be energized, he was told. The building was constructed in 1916, judging from the date he noticed on the cement casting around the old steam boiler in the basement.\n\nErik Larsen: 732-682-9359 or elarsen@app.com\n\nBEHIND THE NEWS\n\nAbout 100 volunteer firefighters responded to the May 15 fire in downtown Toms River, which at one point had threatened to set ablaze the entire block between Robbins and Main streets. Water had to be drafted from the river to fight the flames.\n\nIn addition to East Coast Gamers, 14 other businesses that occupied the two-story brick building were damaged, including Capone\u2019s Gourmet Pizza and Pasta, and Absolute Bail Bonds.\n\nThe offices of Hometown Heroes, a nonprofit charity group that supports local communities in times of need, also was destroyed.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1m0m0qO", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The structure next to Town Hall was gutted in a fire on May 15", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "The structure next to Town Hall was gutted in a fire on May 15", "title": "Landmark Toms River building to be demolished", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/toms-river-area/2014/07/04/toms-river-downtown-fire-ocean-county/12218349/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The structure next to Town Hall was gutted in a fire on May 15", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f93e20b66999d9f1c50fe334960f791cecb2000e/c=522-0-2298-1776&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/07/04/ecgamers0703b.jpg", "title": "Landmark Toms River building to be demolished", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Toms River, downtown fire, Ocean County, New Jersey"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8632\"", "article_summary": "The fire is thought to have originated above a drop ceiling in the rear of East Coast Gamers, one of the previous commercial tenants.\nIn addition to East Coast Gamers, 14 other businesses that occupied the two-story brick building were damaged, including Capone\u2019s Gourmet Pizza and Pasta, and Absolute Bail Bonds.\nThe friend called Marino back a short time later.\nTownship Administrator Paul J.
