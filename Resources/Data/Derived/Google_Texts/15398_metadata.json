He embodies dedication, his rolled-up sleeves creating a story that strains the imagination.\n\nFive years after the Broncos signed Garland as an undrafted defensive tackle, three years after he served his Air Force Academy military commitment and one season after a position switch, Garland will open training camp at Dove Valley this month as a starting left guard in the NFL.\n\n\u201cI have to fight for it, and earn it,\u201d Garland said. \u201cYou work so hard in the offseason, when I get back to training camp that first day I want (first-year Broncos coach Gary Kubiak) to know he made the right decision.\u201d\n\nGarland, 27, faces a challenge from Shelley Smith to keep his position on a revamped offensive line that creates consternation because of its inexperience. Right tackle Chris Clark insists the group will \u201cshock the world,\u201d proving cynics wrong. Garland, who has only 47 snaps in his NFL career, symbolizes both the challenge and the optimism.\n\nBy all accounts, he shouldn\u2019t be in this position. NFL players don\u2019t often move to the other side of the ball. It\u2019s the baseball equivalent of turning a struggling pitcher into a side-armer before deciding whether to cut ties.\n\nGarland\u2019s military background has helped his transition. Kubiak said he\u2019s never been in the office at 5:15 a.m. without seeing Garland at team headquarters.\n\n\u201cHe works harder than anybody. He\u2019s the first one here, last one to leave,\u201d Kubiak said.\n\nBut this goes beyond rigid discipline. A lot of people get up early. Rising before the sun and raising performance requires a special set of skills. Which brings us back to the darkness of the meeting room before the rooster even thinks of clearing its throat.\n\nWhat does Garland do at 5 a.m.?\n\n\u201cA lot of times I am watching film, studying. If I can get just one last second in about the thought process of the plays before I go out to the practice field, it helps a lot. And I do the same thing after practice,\u201d Garland said. \u201cI love left guard. It is intellectually and physically challenging, but when all 11 guys are in sync and you run a good play, it\u2019s an awesome feeling.\u201d\n\nConsidered raw in his technique last season, Garland has benefited from the schematic change to Kubiak\u2019s zone-blocking offense. It calls for mobile linemen who are skilled at reaching the second level of the defense and executing combo blocks. Garland moves like a small man in a big man\u2019s body \u2014 because he is. His natural weight is 240 pounds, 70 lighter than he is now.\n\n\u201cI have to eat 10,000 calories a day to keep it on,\u201d Garland said. \u201cI have to force myself to eat. I know a lot of people would love to have that problem.\u201d\n\nGarland\u2019s appetite for information has accelerated his development. Even he was surprised at the startling differences between defensive and offensive lines when he crossed over.\n\n\u201cThe defense doesn\u2019t stay still. Often times you memorize an (opponent\u2019s) technique, then he shifts over into a shade. You can\u2019t be like, \u2018Oh, wait. What do I do?\u2019 It has to be instantaneous,\u201d Garland said. \u201cYou have to know the nuances. When I was on the D-line, it looked easy. Those big guys were just waddling around. Now I have a huge respect for them.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos appreciate Garland. He provides model preparation. He aced the quizzes April through June. Now the test arrives in training camp.\n\n\u201cOnce you put the pads on and you get beat down a little bit and the wear and tear takes over,\u201d Kubiak said, \u201chow do you continue to play? How consistent are you? Everybody is very impressed with Ben. It\u2019s time for Ben to become a player, but we\u2019ve got to find out when the lights come on.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
