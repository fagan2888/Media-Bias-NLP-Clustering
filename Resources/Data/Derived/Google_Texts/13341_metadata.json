The state of California, including Butte County, has blended its Healthy Families Program into Medi-Cal, beginning Nov. 1.\n\nThe transition may be most troublesome to families with children requiring specialty care, like those with autism spectrum disorder. At the beginning of the year, about 400 of California\u2019s autistic children lost coverage for applied behavior-analysis (ABA) therapy after the state began the switch to Medi-Cal on Jan. 1, despite a Department of Health Care Services letter that assured families \u201cYour child\u2019s coverage will not be interrupted.\u201d\n\nPrior to the transition, Healthy Families and Medi-Cal were parallel plans offering coverage to children of low-income families. Healthy Families enrollees had parents whose earnings put them above the threshold for Medi-Cal. A primary difference between the two is Healthy Families, administered by Anthem Blue Cross, has reimbursed private physicians at a higher rate than Medi-Cal, so when doctors\u2019 offices put limits on the number of Medi-Cal patients they\u2019d accept\u2014as has become increasingly common\u2014Healthy Families patients didn\u2019t encounter that same barrier.\n\nWith the expansion of Medi-Cal under the federal Affordable Care Act, the state decided to discontinue Healthy Families and transfer the 875,000 children in Healthy Families to Medi-Cal, which, moving forward, will be administered by two companies: Anthem Blue Cross and California Health & Wellness, a subsidiary of the Missouri-based Centene Corporation. State officials designed the transition in phases; Phase 4b, the final phase, comprised rural counties including Butte.\n\nThe child-advocacy group Children Now has been monitoring the process.\n\n\u201cWe know from experience that these changes tend to have disruptions despite everybody\u2019s best intentions,\u201d said Ben Rubin, an associate for health policy at Children Now. \u201cThere may be changes to the providers that kids and families are going to see, for example, so it\u2019s been a critical part of our work to make sure the state is properly informing families of the changes so they know who to call and how to prevent any problems due to interruption of care.\u201d\n\nRubin said most Healthy Families patients should be able to stay with their primary-care provider (PCP) and dentist if their parents choose the Anthem Blue Cross option for Medi-Cal. An adequacy assessment by the California Department of Health Care Services found 97 percent of the PCPs in the Healthy Families network are in the Medi-Cal network as well. The state did not release statistics on California Health & Wellness\u2019 plan.\n\nWhere the big problem lies is in specialty care. Only 34 percent of the Butte County specialists who\u2019ve accepted Healthy Families also accept Medi-Cal. So, families of children with intensive health needs may find themselves switching doctors or struggling to find a new one. Rubin acknowledged that so far through the transition, parents of children with autism spectrum disorders have tended to experience the biggest challenges.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long-standing problem with Medi-Cal,\u201d said Dr. Craig Corp, a pediatrician in Chico. \u201cThere are many specialties that we need to refer out of the area for services because no one will see them here. It\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\n\nThe Medi-Cal expansion means more people will join the system, even beyond the 875,000 Healthy Families patients (2,070 in Butte County). Some of those children will have trouble even finding PCPs. Corp pointed out that the Medi-Cal network includes physicians whose only Medi-Cal patients are those already established in the practice, and perhaps the siblings of those children. Families new to Medi-Cal may need to seek out clinics\u2014such as Northern Valley Indian Health\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Center, the Ampla Health Center, Feather River Hospital or Oroville Hospital\u2014if they can\u2019t find a private pediatrician.\n\nIn terms of Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California) reimbursement levels to health-care providers, California is 49th out of the 50 states, Corp said. \u201cThere are many other states where Medicaid reimburses at a similar rate to, say, a Blue Cross or Blue Shield, and people are happy to take it.\u201d\n\nCorp explained that historically, about 80 percent of California physicians either haven\u2019t accepted or have limited Medi-Cal patients because of the low reimbursement rate.\n\n\u201cBasically [Medi-Cal will] pay a lot more to the clinics\u2014the rural health clinics, the federally qualified health clinics\u2014than we get paid,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s essentially where they want the Medi-Cal patients to go.\u201d\n\nParticipants in the Healthy Families program should have received advance notice of the transition to Medi-Cal, but there remain families who have not been notified. To them, Children Now stresses some key points:\n\n\u2022 Medi-Cal coverage includes all the benefits of Healthy Families coverage.\n\n\u2022 Children have a right to continuous care through the transition. In other words, even if they need to switch doctors or dentists, children in Healthy Families should have no gap in coverage.\n\n\u2022 Children have a right to coverage for any medically necessary covered services, including specialty services, even if the services are not in the health-plan network.\n\n\u2022 Premiums will not increase, and families with incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty line will no longer be charged premiums once they move to Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cOverall in the transition there haven\u2019t been wide-scale problems,\u201d Rubin said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not to say there haven\u2019t been problems.\u201d\n\nChildren Now says a family\u2019s new health plan should direct them to the correct service provider.
