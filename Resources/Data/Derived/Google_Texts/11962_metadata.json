If you are white and claim you have never heard anyone in your extended family or your circle of acquaintances express this view, you have deliberately chosen not to pay attention. This is a fundamental premise of the Fox News worldview, often addressed directly by Bill O\u2019Reilly and Sean Hannity, which lies behind their insistence that Barack Obama is a stealth black nationalist and \u201860s radical who will one day reveal his true agenda. It undergirds coverage of every racially coded news event, from the \u201cpool party\u201d in McKinney, Texas, that transfixed the nation last week to the lengthening sequence of unarmed black men and boys killed by police or panicked white civilians.\n\nLike so many aspects of American popular ideology, this contention contains and conceals a powerful element of truth \u2014 but not the truth its proponents perceive. When turned upside down and uncloaked, this anxious insistence that history has no long-term consequences and no connection to present-tense events reveals itself as a distorted mirror image of reality. It is whites far more than blacks who cannot break free of the poisonous attitudes of the past, and facing that truth can help us understand the peculiar state of American race relations in the 21st century, so painfully distilled in that video clip of a white police officer and a bikini-clad African-American teenager.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that the confrontation between those people was a real event in a real place, which unmistakably evoked America\u2019s history of racial violence and civil disobedience. I also saw it, almost literally, as a collision between the past and the future. Whether or not that young lady behaved with perfect decorum on the afternoon in question, she is unmistakably an American of the future \u2013 not a future in which cultural or racial identities don\u2019t matter (we won\u2019t see that in any living person\u2019s lifetime), but a future of increased fluidity and intersection and overlap. Her crime, so to speak, lay in being a black girl who went to a pool party in a largely white suburban neighborhood and acted as if she belonged there, without assuming she was to be held to some special standard of good behavior. That police officer, on the other hand, seemed to have absorbed a contact high from the long and brutal history of police violence against people of color. Fortunately for all of us, his obvious zeal for the role was rendered ludicrous rather than tragic by its context.\n\nYet it is African-Americans who are constantly accused of fixating on ancient history, a charge presented in various ways, many of them subtler than the white-centric paranoia delivered by Fox. Stated most directly and without hyperbole, this boils down to the idea that black people need to get over all that stuff that happened in the history books or in black-and-white video clips, like slavery and lynching and segregated lunch counters and generations of systematic economic and residential discrimination. It isn\u2019t helpful; it\u2019s only holding them back. Anyway, white people living today aren\u2019t responsible for any of it and America simply isn\u2019t racist anymore: Check out Obama and Jay-Z and LeBron. If anybody\u2019s a racist, it\u2019s all the black people calling everybody else racist.\n\nOK, I said I would avoid hyperbole and I lied. Not everyone who expresses this view follows the chain of association all the way through that last sentence, or the one before it. (Although the \u201cI\u2019m not a racist, but \u2026\u201d mode is distressingly common.) But the important ideological thread, even in the most polite and neutral formulation, is the desire to decouple distressing individual events from the even more distressing current of history. The deaths of Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown and Eric Garner and all the rest are disconnected cases of perceived threat and police authority and possible wrongdoing, each to be weighed on its own merits. They do not belong to any larger historical pattern, and those who insist on perceiving such a pattern are dwelling in the past or playing the race card or nursing old grudges or otherwise denying and undermining the greatness of America.\n\nExcept of course for the confusing fact that many white observers do perceive a larger pattern linking the thorniest issues in the African-American community, which is the point where this ideological construction begins to reveal itself. Since it is urgently important to resist the obvious pattern \u2014 the one that would be discerned immediately by any outside observer \u2014 an alternative must be found. So the pattern we get instead of history is a murky and shapeless monstrosity spawned from the bad conscience of the social sciences: The \u201cculture of dependency\u201d or the \u201ccollapse of the black family\u201d or, if we\u2019re really reaching for the dog whistle, the \u201cthug subculture\u201d of baggy pants and Purple Drank and incomprehensible rap lyrics and, most damning of all, a disrespectful attitude towards authority. (Thank God young white folks have never expressed anything like that.)\n\nSimply put, all of this represents a classic case of projection. Who is paralyzed by the past and unable to break free of toxic associations, outmoded stereotypes and ingrained fears and prejudices? Here\u2019s a hint: It isn\u2019t black folks. What we see at work in so many of these cases, and especially in the McKinney pool-party fracas, is a tangled web of half-conscious assumptions inherited from previous white generations, assumptions that were poisoned at the roots by fear and shame and have now become psychotically dissociated from social reality. (Please notice, my hypersensitive fellow European-Americans, that for the moment I am steering away from the term \u201cracist,\u201d which has become an impediment to communication amid all the nutsack-clutching about how it\u2019s the cruelest thing you could ever say to any white person.)\n\nThose assumptions are so familiar to Americans of all races and colors that I hardly need to spell them out. To their core believers, of course, they are not flawed assumptions but profound truths that must be spoken out loud in the face of P.C. liberalism and its pieties. Black people, as a category, are understood to be a uniquely dangerous and disruptive force that must be contained, and whose individual members are virtually interchangeable. African-American men (and boys, all too often) are such threatening figures in themselves that they can be considered armed and dangerous simply because they are black and male. Black people in suburbia, as we saw in McKinney, are instinctively understood by many white residents and police as invaders, bringing the imagined chaos and lawlessness of the \u201cinner city\u201d to the ordered land of weed-free bluegrass rectangles and endless identical cul-de-sacs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hey white people: If we can get over our twisted relationship with the past, the future might actually be better", "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Hey white people: If we can get over our twisted relationship with the past, the future might actually be better", "title": "White panic, white denial: The racial prehistory of the McKinney pool party that white America can\u2019t let go", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/13/white_panic_the_prehistory_of_the_pool_party_and_americas_future/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/lunch_counter_arrest.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hey white people: If we can get over our twisted relationship with the past, the future might actually be better", "creator": "@andohehir", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/lunch_counter_arrest.jpg", "title": "White panic, white denial: The racial prehistory of the McKinney pool party that white America can\u2019t let go", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "White panic, white denial: The racial prehistory of the McKinney pool party that white America can\u2019t let go", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, African American, African Americans, Black, black people, Editor's Picks, mckinney, mckinney texas, Politics, Race, Racism, Texas, Texas pool party, White people, white privilege", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: African American, African Americans, Black, black people, Editor's Picks, mckinney, mckinney texas, Politics, Race, Racism, Texas, Texas pool party, White people, white privilege, News, Politics NewsThere is a central trope of racial discourse within America\u2019s white majority \u2013 or let\u2019s say within a particular subset of that majority \u2013 that African-Americans are overly obsessed with the past.\nIt undergirds coverage of every racially coded news event, from the \u201cpool party\u201d in McKinney, Texas, that transfixed the nation last week to the lengthening sequence of unarmed black men and boys killed by police or panicked white civilians.\nAnyway, white people living today aren\u2019t responsible for any of it and America simply isn\u2019t racist anymore: Check out Obama and Jay-Z and LeBron.\nI also saw it, almost literally, as a collision between the past and the future.\nThose assumptions are so familiar to Americans of all races and colors that I hardly need to spell them out."}
