Summertime in Denver frequently means inclement weather, and Thursday night was no exception.

League officials called the Denver Broncos-Seattle Seahawks preseason game with 1:30 left in the first quarter because of severe weather within the eight-mile limit of Sports Authority Field at Mile High. The Broncos and Seahawks cleared the field and returned around 8:20 p.m., then had a mandatory 10-minute warm-up period. The game restarted at 8:30 p.m. The delay ultimately lasted 45 minutes.

The last lightning delay here was in the regular-season opener last year against the Baltimore Ravens. It lasted 33 minutes.

If the game felt long, it’s because it was. In all, it lasted 3 hours, 47 minutes, the second longest preseason game in Denver Broncos history. The longest was a 3:58 game against Dallas on Aug. 26, 1989.

Once a game is postponed, officials inside the operations center ask the meteorologist for an estimated duration of a game delay based on the forecasts, which is then sent to officials at the stadium, including the referee.

Only NFL commissioner Roger Goodell — or someone he designates — has the authority to actually “cancel, postpone, alter the normal timing of, or terminate games, including games affected by inclement weather,” according to NFL rules. If weather actually is bad enough, and the referee hasn’t called the game (usually because officials in skyboxes can see developing weather easier than on-field officials), then the Game Day Operations Center has the authority to intervene and postpone a game.

Fans haven’t been asked to leave or seek shelter, but are encouraged to if “they feel it’s necessary.” Many people in the highest places at Sports Authority Field at Mile High — I’m looking at Section 535 and 536 — seem perfectly content to wait this out.
