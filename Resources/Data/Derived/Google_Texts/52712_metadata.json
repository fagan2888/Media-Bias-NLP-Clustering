The program, available to qualified riders with incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, provides cardholders a savings of up to half off the per-trip cost on Metro and Kitsap Transit buses, Sound Transit Link light rail, the King County Water Taxi and the Seattle Streetcar.\n\nAddressing disproportionality in the juvenile justice system: Although King County's youth detention rates have dropped more than 60 percent over the last decade, the proportion of youth of color in detention continued to rise. Executive Constantine joined with Superior Court to convene the largest and most diverse group King County has ever assembled to recommend solutions to a growing racial disparity in the regional juvenile justice system.\n\nInvesting in Best Starts for Kids: Secured voter approval for the most comprehensive approach to early childhood development in the nation. Performance-driven and science-based, the program starts with prenatal support, sustains the gain through teenage years, and invests in healthy, safe communities that reinforce progress.\n\nEstablishing baselines: For the first time, King County created a \u201cDeterminants of Equity\u201d report that provides baselines for measuring the status of equity in such community conditions as on-time graduation rates, access to affordable and quality housing, and access to public transit.\n\nAs documented in the report, inequities remain in King County across a broad range of areas. For example, the middle class is not growing, and 95 percent of the net new households created since 2000 earn either less than $35,000 a year, or more than $125,000. There are also race and placed-based income gaps, and since the Great Recession the average income for whites in King County has risen steadily and significantly, while blacks have experienced net average income loss.\n\nThe report also documents numerous efforts to create a more diverse and inclusive workforce.\n\n\u201cAs a regional government working in an increasingly interconnected world, a diverse workforce makes us more competitive, innovative, and nimble\u2014\n\nallowing us to provide the best services to the many communities we serve,\u201d said Executive Constantine.\n\nNew this year is Executive Constantine\u2019s creation of the Office of Equity and Social Justice, which works hand-in-hand with the Equity and Social Justice Inter-Branch Team to support the work of all County employees and agencies, and serves as the backbone and coordinator of key County efforts to advance equity in the organization and community.\n\nThe Executive is also developing the first-ever Equity and Social Justice Strategic Plan to guide the County\u2019s work in this area in the short- and long-term.\n\nFOR MORE INFORMATION, CONTACT:\n\nMatias Valenzuela, Office of Equity and Social Justice, 206-263-8697", "article_metadata": {"apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "article_summary": "FOR MORE INFORMATION, CONTACT:Matias Valenzuela, Office of Equity and Social Justice, 206-263-8697\nAs documented in the report, inequities remain in King County across a broad range of areas.\nThe Executive is also developing the first-ever Equity and Social Justice Strategic Plan to guide the County\u2019s work in this area in the short- and long-term.\nStoryKing County has made substantive progress toward creating a more equitable community and workplace\u2014including a significant increase in affordable healthcare coverage and the creation of a reduced bus fare for low-income riders\u2014according to a new report on equity and social justice published by King County Executive Dow Constantine.\nNew this year is Executive Constantine\u2019s creation of the Office of Equity and Social Justice, which works hand-in-hand with the Equity and Social Justice Inter-Branch Team to support the work of all County employees and agencies, and serves as the backbone and coordinator of key County efforts to advance equity in the organization and community."}
