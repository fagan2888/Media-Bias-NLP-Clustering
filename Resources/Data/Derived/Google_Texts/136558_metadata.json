The decision to release or retain an assistant coach or player will not come down to one opinion, Gruden said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be our decision,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re going to live with and something we\u2019re going to do together.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins allowed 27.4 points per game this season, more than all but two other NFL teams. Defensive backs regularly blew coverages or missed tackles, and opposing receivers feasted on those miscues en route to huge performances, seemingly week after week.\n\nSEE ALSO: SNYDER: Hey, at least Washington wasn\u2019t the worst team in the NFL\n\nThose repeated issues have put Haslett\u2019s future in doubt, with some \u2014 including former Redskins linebacker London Fletcher \u2014 calling for the fifth-year defensive coordinator to be let go. Current players, however, have spoken up on Haslett\u2019s behalf. And Gruden praised the defensive coordinator\u2019s performance in light of injuries his unit accrued over the course of the season.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of respect for Jim Haslett,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cCoach Haslett had his hands tied a little bit this year. We had a lot of injuries, a lot of issues to our defense, the personnel that not many people have had to go through in this NFL season or in the history of this league, playing with as many different guys at as many different key positions throughout the season. I don\u2019t know what the numbers were but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re up there with a record amount of players that had to start and play in this defense.\n\n\u201cObviously, from a production standpoint \u2014 offense, defense, special teams \u2014 we all have to take a step back and look and evaluate everybody, and nobody got the job done this year. You\u2019re 4-12, so we had issues all across the board. I\u2019m not going to talk about fictional things. I\u2019m just going to take a step back here, wait for the meeting with Mr. Snyder and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Coach Haslett had his hands tied a little bit this year,\" Gruden said Monday, adding that the decision to retain or release a coach will be made in agreement with Bruce Allen and Dan Snyder.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "\u201cCoach Haslett had his hands tied a little bit this year,\u201d Gruden said Monday, adding that the decision to retain or release a coach will be made in agreement with Bruce Allen and Dan Snyder.", "title": "Jay Gruden would recommend Redskins retain defensive coordinator Jim Haslett", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/29/jay-gruden-would-recommend-redskins-retain-defensi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/28/cowboys-redskins-football-jpeg-049e4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/28/cowboys-redskins-football-jpeg-049e4.jpg", "description": "\"Coach Haslett had his hands tied a little bit this year,\" Gruden said Monday, adding that the decision to retain or release a coach will be made in agreement with Bruce Allen and Dan Snyder.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Jay Gruden would recommend Redskins retain defensive coordinator Jim H"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jay Gruden, Jim Haslett, Dan Snyder"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f27\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWould I recommend keeping [Haslett]?\u201d Gruden said, repeating a reporter\u2019s question.\nStanding at the podium for the last time in a trying 2014 season, Redskins coach Jay Gruden said Monday that several changes will be made this offseason.\nIf he has his druthers, however, the dismissal of defensive coordinator Jim Haslett will not be among them.\n\u201cI have a lot of respect for Jim Haslett,\u201d Gruden said.\nAnd Gruden praised the defensive coordinator\u2019s performance in light of injuries his unit accrued over the course of the season."}
