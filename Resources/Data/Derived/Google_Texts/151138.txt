While the subject of abortion makes headlines on nearly a daily basis, the unintentional end to a pregnancy fails to gain as much public attention. As part of style website StyleLikeU's "What's Underneath" project, mother of two and personal stylist Karyn Starr gave us a rare and emotional view into what happens when a woman doesn’t plan on losing her baby but does so anyway.

"I lost two babies last year, so I feel very lucky that this one has cooked for so long," Starr, nine months pregnant, tells the camera. "I had a pretty late miscarriage at 17 weeks."

Starr’s story, which unfortunately is not uncommon, includes the unexpected breaking of her water and home still birth of a perfect yet tiny baby. “It was one of those moments when you go, ‘Wow, this is why people go so crazy about all this,’” Starr said.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists estimates that around 15 percent of all known pregnancies will end in miscarriages. Most miscarriages occur during the first 13 weeks of a pregnancy.

The stylist also explained her emergency D&C, or dilation and curettage, a procedure needed to remove tissue from inside the uterus. “There are women all over the world that have miscarriages that die because they don’t have access to someone who can give them a clean D&C.”

Although about half of all women who experience a miscarriage do not need a D&C, for those who do, it can be life-saving. If pieces of the placenta remain inside of a woman, they may become septic and create a deadly infection.
