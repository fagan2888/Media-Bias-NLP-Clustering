Today, even presidential candidates eager to claim the legacy of drug warrior Ronald Reagan are relaxing their views on prohibition.\n\n\u201cWhen they repealed alcohol prohibition, it was left up to the states what to do with alcohol,\u201d says Sullum. \u201cAnd so you have most of the Republican presidential candidates saying the federal government should not interfere if the states want to legalize. That\u2019s really an amazing development.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, progressives have been critics of the war on drugs, he says. It's only when marijuana becomes an industry, run by capitalists, that the left gets uneasy. Libertarians and progressives tend to spar over the nature of regulation of the drug business, not the need for or desirability of legalization itself.\n\nIn 2016, recreational marijuana reform may be on the ballot in nearly a dozen states and Sullum is optimistic. With support for recreational marijuana polling at a record-high 58 percent, it's only a question of how many states legalize in next year's elections.\n\nSullum believes that California, the first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996, is the best bet for passage and the most influential state in play. \"There's a good shot it's going to pass. It's kind of surprising that California has not legalized marijuana by now,\" says Sullum, who is also the author of Saying Yes: In Defense of Drug Use, a nationally syndicated columnist, a drug-policy blogger at Forbes.\n\nAbout 9 minutes.
