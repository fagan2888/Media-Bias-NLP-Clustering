Thomas Rosica, a consultant to the Vatican press office.\n\n\u201cBut it also sends a pragmatic message to Muslims, Christians and Jews that it\u2019s possible to work together - not as a system of checks and balances but as friends.\u201d\n\nThe visit to the Holy Land is the first for Francis as leader of the Roman Catholic Church, and just the fourth for any pontiff in the modern era.\n\nWith so much at stake - the stalled negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, the plight of Christian refugees - the Pope\u2019s every word, gesture and photo-op will be microscopically examined.\n\nAlready, some conservative Israelis are advocating against the Pope\u2019s visit, scrawling anti-Christian graffiti on Catholic buildings in Jerusalem and planning protests outside papal events in Jerusalem.\n\nWhile the protesters form a fringe minority, they underscore the tensions that simmer around the Pope\u2019s short but substantial trip.\n\nWith those challenges in mind, here are five key things to pay particular attention to.\n\n1. The Pope\u2019s schedule makes Rick Steves look lazy.\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing the 77-year-old pontiff rested up this week.\n\nFrancis will be traveling to three cities, shaking hands with dozens of religious and political leaders, celebrating several Catholic Masses and delivering at least 13 speeches and homilies \u2013 all in less than 36 hours.\n\nIn Jordan, the Pope will meet with King Abdullah II, greet refugees from Iraq and Syria, celebrate Mass and visit the Jordan River, where many Christians believe Jesus was baptized.\n\nCrowds welcome Pope Francis to Jordan at start of Holy Land trip\n\n\n\nIn Bethlehem, he will convene with the President of the Palestinian Authority, celebrate Mass in Manger Square, lunch with Palestinian families, greet children from refugee camps and visit the site of Jesus\u2019 birth.\n\nIn Jerusalem, the Pope will meet the city\u2019s grand mufti and chief rabbis, visit the Western Wall and Yad Vashem (a memorial to the Holocaust), lay a wreath on the grave of the founder of modern Zionism, and sign a joint declaration with the head of Eastern Orthodox Christians.\n\nHe\u2019ll also confer with Israel\u2019s Prime Minister and President, chat with Catholic seminarians and celebrate Mass at the site of the Last Supper.\n\nGot all that?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m amazed at what they are trying to do in such a short amount of time,\u201d Rosica said.\n\n2. The Pope says the trip is religious, not political.\n\nFrancis has called the reasons behind his Holy Land excursion \u201cstrictly religious.\u201d Earlier, he had described it as a \u201cpilgrimage for prayer.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the popular pontiff was trying to tamp down expectations that his visit could solve the region\u2019s seemingly intractable political problems. But the trip does have religious roots, church officials say.\n\nAt the Pope\u2019s installation in 2013, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide, invited Francis to Jerusalem to mark the 50th anniversary of a historic meeting between their predecessors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand now what a breakthrough that meeting was,\u201d said the Rev. Alexander Karloutsos, an Eastern Orthodox priest who is helping organize part of the Pope's trip.\n\nAt the time, the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, the world\u2019s two largest Christian communities, weren\u2019t even on speaking terms, said Karloutsos. Marriages celebrated in one church would not be recognized by the other.\n\nOn Sunday, Francis and Bartholomew will sign a joint declaration outlining common principles and a potential path forward to greater unity.\n\n\u201cThese people don\u2019t sign things lightly,\u201d Karloutsos said. \u201cThis is a very substantial document.\u201d\n\nFrancis and Bartholomew also will celebrate a joint religious service at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem on Sunday, the first time the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic leaders have held such a service in 50 years, according to Karloutsos.\n\n3. The \u2018people\u2019s Pope\u2019 will strike again\n\nHe has celebrated Masses for migrants who drowned while trying to sail to Europe, visited Brazil\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods and welcomed homeless men in Rome to his birthday party.\n\nIn the Holy Land, Pope Francis is again expected to draw the world\u2019s attention to the poor and downtrodden; he has refused to travel, as most leaders do in the Middle East, in an armored car.\n\nIn Jordan, where some 600,000 Syrians have fled since the start of the civil war in 2011, the Pope will meet refugees and disabled young people before delivering a speech at a church in Bethany.\n\nOn the West Bank, he will greet children from several Palestinian refugee camps.\n\nPalestinian Archbishop Atallah Hanna, who is Eastern Orthodox (as are most Christians in the Middle East) said he hopes Pope Francis will \u201csee the suffering of the Palestinian people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are misrepresented and are unfortunately seen by some to be criminals and terrorists,\u201d Hanna said. \u201cI hope they can see that we are a civilized, peaceful and well-educated people seeking freedom and a better future.\u201d\n\nJohn Esposito, an expert on international relations at Georgetown University, said the Pope\u2019s meeting with Christians in Bethlehem could open some eyes about the Israel-Palestinian standoff.\n\n\u201cIt will underscore the fact that it\u2019s not just a Muslim-Jewish conflict,\u201d he said.\n\n4. Conservative Israelis are nervous.\n\nIn the weeks before the Pope\u2019s arrival, graffiti calling Jesus \u201cgarbage\u201d and calling for \u201cdeath to Arabs and Christians\u201d has been scrawled on Christian buildings in Jerusalem.\n\nUltra-Orthodox Jews have planned to protest outside the site of the Last Supper - known as the Cenacle - because it is also said to house King David\u2019s tomb.\n\nThey believe Christians should not hold religious services, as Pope Francis plans to do on Sunday, so close to a Jewish holy site, and they worry that Israel will turn the Cenacle over to the Vatican during the Pope\u2019s visit, according to reports.\n\nJerusalem's five most contested sites\n\nOn Wednesday, Israeli police issued restraining orders on several right-wing Jewish activists, according to The New York Times, ordering them to stay away from the Pope during his visit.\n\nRabbi David Rosen, international director for interreligious affairs at the American Jewish Congress, told CNN that the troublemakers are fringe figures who \u201cdon\u2019t deserve anything like the attention they\u2019ve gotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of Israelis are looking forward to the Pope\u2019s visit, if they\u2019re even aware of it yet,\u201d said Rosen, who is in Jerusalem to participate in papal events.\n\nThe rabbi said he is slightly chagrined, though, that Francis will not hold an interfaith service with Muslim and Jewish leaders in Jerusalem, as Pope Benedict XVI did in 2009.\n\n\u201cI am personally disappointed that this opportunity to demonstrate in actions and not simply in words the possibility of bringing together Christians, Muslims and Jews is not on his schedule.\u201d\n\nThe Vatican says that, because the Pope is traveling with Rabbi Skorka and Sheikh Abboud, the whole trip is essentially an interfaith gathering.\n\n5. Muslims view Francis as a welcome change.\n\nPope Benedict XVI didn\u2019t have the best relationship with Muslims, said Georgetown's Esposito, who is traveling to Jordan to meet with Francis on Saturday.\n\nThe former Pope quoted anti-Islamic remarks made by a 14th-century Christian emperor in a speech in 2006, leading to Muslim riots.\n\nBenedict apologized, but later baptized a prominent Muslim-born journalist, which some Islamic leaders called an unnecessary provocation.\n\nIn contrast, one of Francis\u2019 first interfaith steps as Pope was to wash the feet of two Muslims during a Holy Thursday ceremony in 2013, a move noted throughout the Islamic world, Esposito said.\n\n\u201cWhat popes do is as symbolically important as what they say,\u201d Esposito said, \u201cand Muslims have been very impressed with Francis.\u201d\n\nThe Pope also called on Western nations to find a peaceful solution to Syria\u2019s civil war, rather than use military force.\n\nOn this trip to the Holy Land, Francis is expected to call for a Palestinian state, which has long been Vatican policy, but will surely upset some Israelis.\n\nThat can't-please-both dilemma shows how hard it can be to navigate the Holy Land for any world leader, even one with the charisma and political acumen of Francis.\n\nBringing a sheikh and rabbi along may help buffer the Pope from some criticism, but ultimately, all eyes will be on the man in white.\n\n(CNN's Roba Alhenawi contributed to this report.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Editor (CNN) -- So, a rabbi, a sheikh and a pope travel to the Holy Land\u2026 It might sound like the start of a trite joke, but it\u2019s actually the entourage for one of the most highly anticipated papal trips in recent history.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Pope Francis in the Holy Land: 5 things to know", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/05/22/pope-francis-in-the-holy-land-5-things-to-know/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140419142208-pope-francis-friday-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Editor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- So, a rabbi, a sheikh and a pope travel to the Holy Land\u2026\r\n\r\nIt might sound like the start of a trite joke, but it\u2019s actually the entourage for one of the most highly anticipated papal trips in recent history.", "title": "Pope Francis in the Holy Land: 5 things to know"}, "keywords": "catholic church, christianity, foreign policy, islam, israel, jerusalem, judaism, leaders, mass, middle east, palestinians, pope benedict xvi, pope francis, religious liberty, religious violence, vatican, bethlehem, holy land, israel, jerusalem, jordan, palestine, pope francis", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/05/22/pope-francis-in-the-holy-land-5-things-to-know/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f6b\"", "article_summary": "In the Holy Land, Pope Francis is again expected to draw the world\u2019s attention to the poor and downtrodden; he has refused to travel, as most leaders do in the Middle East, in an armored car.\nAlready, some conservative Israelis are advocating against the Pope\u2019s visit, scrawling anti-Christian graffiti on Catholic buildings in Jerusalem and planning protests outside papal events in Jerusalem.\nOn this trip to the Holy Land, Francis is expected to call for a Palestinian state, which has long been Vatican policy, but will surely upset some Israelis.\nIn a region roiled by competing religious and political visions, Francis\u2019 chosen companions communicate an unmistakable message, church officials said.\nAs Pope Francis heads to Jordan, Bethlehem and Jerusalem this weekend, he\u2019s bringing along two old friends from Argentina: Rabbi Abraham Skorka, who co-wrote a book with the Pope, and Sheikh Omar Abboud, who leads Argentina\u2019s Muslim community."}
