But by their twenties, the brothers had found a new hobby to share -- heroin.\n\n\u201cWe used to plot and plan to get high together,\u201d said Ryan. The family asked that we use only first names to protect their identities.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Mom Breaks the Law to Obtain Narcan for Heroin-Addicted Sons 4:14 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nBoth brothers are still living in their childhood bedrooms. But their mom Denise will tell you there is one key difference between her boys now. Ben has been sober for two months. Ryan is still struggling with addiction.\n\nTheir story illustrates the challenges facing many who struggle with heroin addiction \u2014 lack of insurance coverage for treatment, difficulties accessing services, and short-term fixes that don\u2019t seem to make a dent in a disease that is often a life-long battle.\n\nLast year, Denise sent both sons away to separate private rehabilitation facilities in Florida so they wouldn't influence each other\u2019s recovery. They both entered halfway houses and were successful for a time. But then they returned to Missouri.\n\n\u201cAs soon as they got back it started again,\u201d Denise said. \u201cAs soon as I saw the signs I was like, please God, no.\u201d\n\nAt 24, Ben is still covered by his father\u2019s insurance plan. So as soon as Denise saw Ben using heroin again, she enrolled him in a treatment program covered by that health plan, which provides Ben with Suboxone \u2014 a stabilizing medicine similar to methadone that allows recovering addicts to function normally without feeling high.\n\nIn the video below, Ben talks about getting clean after using heroin for four years. He says it was a \u201cbetter high\u201d than anything he\u2019s ever done.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Hooked on Heroin: \u2018It Only Takes Once\u2019 3:03 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\n\u201cI take it three times a day. Once in the morning, once in the afternoon and then once at night,\u201d Ben said. \u201cThere's no withdrawal symptoms. I don't have urges. I don't have cravings. I don't ever think about it anymore.\u201d\n\nBen has been clean for two months.\n\nBut when Ryan returned from rehab, his mother did not enroll him in the treatment program. At 26, he had aged out of his parents\u2019 medical coverage. He has no insurance of his own and has no savings. Ryan says he\u2019d have no way to pay $800 per month for Suboxone and does not want to enter a state-run program.\n\n\u201cIt's really hard,\u201d said Ryan. \u201cIf you don't have insurance you can't go to a nice place. And state-runs take months to get into -- by that time you could be dead.\u201d\n\nMichael Botticelli, the acting director for the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, says there is a \u201ctreatment gap\u201d in America -- a gap between those who want treatment for substance abuse and those who actually enroll in treatment programs.\n\n\"Only one in 10 people who need treatment actually get it,\u201d Botticelli said, citing the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.\n\nBarriers include lack of insurance and under-insurance. In addition, historically many areas didn't approve of treatment facilities being in their communities. That means there are fewer clinics to serve the demand for treatment in many parts of the country. In Vermont, clinics report long waiting lists. In rural Maine, people drive for hours to get to the nearest methadone clinic.\n\nHear how the drug\u2019s powerful grip has taken hold of Denise's family.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Mom of Heroin Addicts: \u2018I Was Just Like Every Other Mother\u2019 3:34 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nBut Botticelli sees promising changes coming with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The new health care law requires insurance companies to cover substance abuse treatment just as they would cover any other chronic medical condition, such as diabetes.\n\nIf insurance companies are not doing so, Americans can file a complaint through their state. Parents and others have an appeals process available to them if they feel an insurance company is violating the law, Botticelli says.\n\nPerhaps the most difficult problem to solve when it comes to treatment are the people who clearly meet the criteria and need help, but don\u2019t seek care.\n\nDenise believes Ryan may fall into that category.\n\nDuring our visit, Ryan at times said he would seek treatment if it weren\u2019t so expensive. But he also indicated that he wasn\u2019t ready to enter a program like the one his brother is in.\n\nBen, however, says he\u2019s committed to staying off heroin. He thinks every day about what he\u2019s putting his mom through.\n\n\u201cIt's just horrible to think of the things I've done,\" he said. \"But, you know, it'll only get better. Once you hit the bottom you can only go up.\u201d\n\nChad Sabora of the Missouri Network for Opiate Reform and Recovery explains why he breaks the law to distribute Narcan, a drug that can reverse overdoses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A mother from Missouri describes how her life has changed since her two sons became addicted to heroin.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/americas-heroin-epidemic/mom-2-heroin-addicts-not-life-i-want-n74961", "type": "article", "image": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_15/310496/x_30_nn_wonboheroin_140408_e6ba4889cc096b730bf3c65feb3701a9.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "A mother from Missouri describes how her life has changed since her two sons became addicted to heroin."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "A mother from Missouri describes how her life has changed since her two sons became addicted to heroin.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_15/310496/x_30_nn_wonboheroin_140408_e6ba4889cc096b730bf3c65feb3701a9.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Mom of 2 Heroin Addicts: 'This Is Not the Life I Want'  - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-04-08", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/americas-heroin-epidemic/mom-2-heroin-addicts-not-life-i-want-n74961", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Nightly News,Health news,U.S. news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb12d\"", "article_summary": "But their mom Denise will tell you there is one key difference between her boys now.\nPlay FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusEmbed Hooked on Heroin: \u2018It Only Takes Once\u2019 3:03 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\u201cI take it three times a day.\nPlay FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusEmbed Mom of Heroin Addicts: \u2018I Was Just Like Every Other Mother\u2019 3:34 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blogBut Botticelli sees promising changes coming with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\nPlay FacebookTwitterGoogle PlusEmbed Mom Breaks the Law to Obtain Narcan for Heroin-Addicted Sons 4:14 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blogBoth brothers are still living in their childhood bedrooms.\nEditor's note: This story is part of a series, Hooked: America's Heroin Epidemic, that will be featured on NBC News from April 7-9."}
