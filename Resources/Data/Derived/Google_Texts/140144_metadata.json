As is, he\u2019s more concerned with defenses than fellow passers.\n\nBut Rivers is 12 years into an NFL career and he\u2019s seen quarterbacks come and go like a three-and-out. And, as the only quarterback to play a full game Sunday afternoon in Denver, Rivers certainly had an opinion about the Broncos\u2019 switch from Brock Osweiler to Peyton Manning.\n\n\u201cBrock didn\u2019t really turn the ball over because of bad decisions. It wasn\u2019t like he was stinking it up out there,\u201d Rivers said after Manning replaced Osweiler in the second half. \u201cBut, you have a guy who hadn\u2019t been a backup in a game since 1994 who\u2019s one of the best of all time.\u201d\n\nBOXSCORE: Broncos vs. Chargers\n\nRivers completed 21-of-35 passes for 228 yards and two touchdowns while getting pressured throughout as the Broncos took advantage of a banged up San Diego line.\n\nOsweiler, too, had trouble staying upright behind a porous front. But he topped Rivers in passing yards in a little more than two quarters \u2014 14-of-22 for 232 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions \u2014 before he was pulled after the offense committed a fifth turnover. Technically, Osweiler gets a victory on his career stat sheet as the starting quarterback, moving him to 5-2, though the Broncos trailed 13-7 when Manning was inserted.\n\n\u201cBrock was put in a tough spot,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe did a heck of a job to get them here.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Pictures from Denver Broncos-San Diego Chargers game\n\nManning, who led the Broncos to scores in four of his five drives before kneeling down on a sixth to end the game, threw for 69 yards on five-of-nine passing in his first action since Nov. 15.\n\n\u201cHe made some good throws,\u201d Rivers said of Manning. \u201cBut they ran the ball for the most part. Did it give them a spark? Sure. The place went crazy.\u201d\n\nImmediately after Manning entered the game the Broncos\u2019 running game perked up.\n\nRivers, if anything, was surprised Manning didn\u2019t start. The Chargers prepared last week for both Manning and Osweiler and they ran through scenarios of how each might enter or exit the game, according to their coach, Mike McCoy, a former Broncos offensive coordinator.\n\n\u201cI thought Peyton would start the game if he dressed,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI was happy to see Peyton back out there. I didn\u2019t want to see him go out that way.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Philip Rivers surprised Peyton Manning didn\u2019t start, says Brock Osweiler in tough spot", "title": "Philip Rivers surprised Peyton Manning didn\u2019t start, says Brock Osweiler in tough spot", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/03/philip-rivers-surprised-peyton-manning-didnt-start-says-brock-osweiler-in-tough-spot/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103_043339_peyton-manning-2.jpg", "height": 464}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103_043339_peyton-manning-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-03T19:42:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:31:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Rivers, if anything, was surprised Manning didn\u2019t start.\nAnd, as the only quarterback to play a full game Sunday afternoon in Denver, Rivers certainly had an opinion about the Broncos\u2019 switch from Brock Osweiler to Peyton Manning.\nIt wasn\u2019t like he was stinking it up out there,\u201d Rivers said after Manning replaced Osweiler in the second half.\n\u201cI thought Peyton would start the game if he dressed,\u201d Rivers said.\nIf football were a game of one-on-one between quarterbacks, maybe Philip Rivers would be more invested in his Broncos counterpart."}
