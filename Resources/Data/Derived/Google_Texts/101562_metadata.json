Until this past week, he was a correspondent for The New York Times who covered labor issues, among other things.\n\nSo, what does the NLRB allege that McDonald\u2019s or its franchisees did?\n\nSTEVEN GREENHOUSE: So, the Labor Board says that McDonald\u2019s and many of its franchisees around the country improperly retaliated against, spied on workers who participated in this Fight for 15 campaign of fast food workers, demanding a base wage of $15 an hour at fast food restaurants around the country.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: OK.\n\nSo, there\u2019s usually a distinction between McDonald\u2019s, the owning franchise, or, I guess, the brand, and all of the franchisees. But why are they lumped together in this?\n\nSTEVEN GREENHOUSE: What\u2019s really gotten under McDonald\u2019s and the business community\u2019s skin is the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board is saying McDonald\u2019s is a joint employer with its franchisees.\n\nSo, it\u2019s saying that a franchise that might have 30 employees and often acts as if, well, I, the franchise owner, I\u2019m the only employer, the NLRB is saying McDonald\u2019s exercises so much influence over the restaurants, telling them, you know \u2014 with all sorts of requirements about how to cook, how to keep things clean, ways to handle your employees, the NLRB said, McDonald\u2019s, you\u2019re a joint employer.\n\nAnd, for McDonald\u2019s, that\u2019s quite bad news, because it means if a franchise owner is charged with not paying overtime or if he\u2019s charged with retaliating against someone for exercising his \u2014 his rights to form a union, not just the franchise operator will be accused and charged, but McDonald\u2019s itself can be held jointly responsible.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, this has repercussions beyond McDonald\u2019s, then.\n\nSTEVEN GREENHOUSE: Yes. So, this has sent shockwaves through franchise industries around the country, you know, restaurants, retailers, I guess auto lube company \u2014 all sorts of companies.\n\nAnd then, on Friday, there was this big telephonic \u2014 telephonic news conference with the Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation, the International Franchise Association, and the National Restaurant Association.\n\nThey\u2019re upset. And they really want to persuade the courts, they want to persuade Congress to do something about this NLRB action.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, now it goes in front of an administrative law judge, but what does that mean? What are the next steps in this fight?\n\nSTEVEN GREENHOUSE: So, these are only allegations. It\u2019s civil, not criminal.\n\nSo, a judge will hear it. And if the judge rules against McDonald\u2019s, then McDonald\u2019s will likely appeal to the five-person NLRB in Washington, then probably to the federal courts.\n\nUnions are very, very happy about what the NLRB did, because it means that it gives them much more leverage pressure against \u2014 against McDonald\u2019s and its franchisees.\n\nIf McDonald\u2019s is considered a joint employer, that means it will pressure its franchisees to comply with the law more.\n\nAnd unions are trying \u2014 this fast food campaign is trying to unionize McDonald\u2019s. And the fact that it could \u2014 that if it\u2019s a joint employer, you could try to run a nationwide campaign to unionize all the McDonald\u2019s around the country, rather than just this franchise here in New York and this one in Cincinnati, this one in Saint Louis.\n\nSo it is really is a boon for the unions, but, as I said, it\u2019s not great for McDonald\u2019s.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Steven Greenhouse, thanks so much.\n\nSTEVEN GREENHOUSE: Sure.
