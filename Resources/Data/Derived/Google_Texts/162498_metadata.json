A new device developed by Tom Froese and Adam Spiers, who studied in the Department of Cybernetics at the University of Reading, UK, and tested by researchers at the University of Cincinnati, however, may usher in a new age of navigational tools for the blind.\n\nAs the first device of its kind, the Enactive Torch looks like a large remote control connected by wire to a wristband. It works similarly to a white cane. However, it doesn\u2019t need to touch anything to inform the person using it that there\u2019s an obstacle in their way. Instead, it uses infrared sensors to detect objects in front of it, after which it sends a signal to the wristband to vibrate. As the object comes closer, it vibrates with more intensity. The new study, which will be presented at the American Psychological Association\u2019s annual convention in Washington, D.C., found that the Enactive Touch worked just as well as normal vision when it came to navigation.\n\n\u201cWhen you compare the participants\u2019 judgments with vision, cane, and Enactive Torch, there was not a significant difference, meaning that they made the same judgments,\u201d said Luis Favela, a graduate student in philosophy and psychology at the university, in a press release. \u201cThe three modalities are functionally equivalent. People can carry out actions just about to the same degree whether they\u2019re using their vision or their sense of touch. I was really surprised.\u201d\n\nThe Torch was able to safely navigate visually impaired participants through an opening similar to a doorway just as well as anything else. In all, 27 undergraduate students with normal or corrected-to-normal vision were told to walk through the opening either using normal vision, a cane while blindfolded, or the Enactive Torch while blindfolded. Although it\u2019s unclear how the device would work in real-world situations (when coming across an empty cardboard box in the street, for example), its creation shows that navigational tools for the blind may soon be upgraded.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 3.4 million Americans aged 40 and older are legally blind or visually impaired. That number is expected to rise to six million by 2030, as more baby boomers develop diabetes and age-related disease. But the device, or its future renditions, will also be good for kids who deal with growing up blind. \u201cIn my research, I\u2019ve found that there\u2019s an emotional stigma that people who are visually impaired experience, particularly children,\u201d Favela said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a kid in elementary school, you want to blend in and be part of the group. It\u2019s hard to do that when you\u2019re carrying this big white cane.\u201d\n\nConsidering that the Enactive Torch is the size of three to four remotes stacked together, children would still have to carry it around to get around. However, Favela says that future renditions will be \u201csmaller and more compact\u201d so that kids who use it won\u2019t stand out, and maybe \u201cfeel like they blend in more.\u201d But before that can happen, further tests to assess its ability to help people step over obstacles or climb stairs, are needed, he said.\n\nSource: Favela L, Riley M, Shockley K, Chemero A.
