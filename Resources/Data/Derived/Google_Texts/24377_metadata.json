(AP) \u2014 Saving water doesn\u2019t always mean saving money in parched California.\n\nMillions of Californians expecting relief on their water bills for taking conservation measures instead are finding higher rates and drought surcharges.\n\nWater departments are increasing rates and adding fees because they\u2019re losing money as their customers conserve. They say they still have to pay for fixed costs including repairing pipelines, customer service and enforcing water restrictions \u2014 and those costs aren\u2019t decreasing.\n\nThe financial blow is only expected to grow because Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s administration has ordered communities to slash their water use anywhere between 8 and 36 percent compared to 2013 levels in response to the four-year drought. Those cuts are expected to leave agencies with a $1 billion hole in revenue, and they\u2019ll likely turn to customers to plug it, according to state estimates.\n\n\u201cJust because you use less water does not mean you have lower rates or a lower bill,\u201d said Lori Dolqueist, a water attorney who represents private utilities. \u201cAll of these agencies and private water companies are being told to sell less of what they do. It\u2019s a challenge financially.\u201d\n\nWhile intensive conservation reduces strains on local water supplies, it can spell trouble for government budgets.\n\nSanta Barbara, for example, expects to lose $5 million if residents hit the city\u2019s 20 percent water use reduction target. Residents are going above and beyond and reached 37 percent in May. That\u2019s good for water supply but bad for financial stability.\n\nThis month, water bills in Santa Barbara rose between $13 and $120, depending on water use, to help the city recover lost revenue and activate a desalination plant.\n\n\u201cOur folks are coming in and saying \u2018Hey, I\u2019m doing everything right, why do I need to pay more?\u201d said Joshua Haggmark, the city\u2019s water resources manager.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear precisely how widespread drought-related rate increases are because no government agency or association tracks them.\n\nBut agencies across California are reporting they\u2019ve taken steps to tap customers to offset the losses of conservation. Residents in the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, are seeing higher bills after the region\u2019s largest water wholesaler increased the price of water 28 percent to make up for lagging sales.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California water rates rise as cities lose money in drought", "title": "California water rates rise as cities lose money in drought", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "California water rates rise as cities lose money in drought", "title": "California water rates rise as cities lose money in drought", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/05/california_water_rates_rise_as_cities_lose_money_in_drought/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/california-drought-rate-hikes.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California water rates rise as cities lose money in drought", "title": "California water rates rise as cities lose money in drought", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/california-drought-rate-hikes.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Fenit Nirappil", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaf7a\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsROSEVILLE, Calif.
