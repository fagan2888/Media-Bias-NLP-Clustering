Sioux Falls, SD

Passenger vehicles aren’t the only thing affected by the high winds and slick roads.

Semi-trucks packed the Flying J at I-29 and 60th Street in Sioux Falls.

According to Safe Travel USA, road conditions have steadily improved since the morn, but that does not mean there aren’t slick spots on the road.

A blizzard warning for NE South Dakota is set to expire at 3 p.m.

According to a Flying J employee, the number of semis parked during the day today is not normal for the business.
