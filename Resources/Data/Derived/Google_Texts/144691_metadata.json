Executive amnesty. VA death lists. The Benghazi filmmaker frenzy. You\u2019d think that statistically this Administration would have to act honestly and/or competently sometime. Instead, Obama\u2019s managed to create the political equivalent of a broken clock that\u2019s never right.\n\nThe liberals are fuming, infuriated that Jonathan Gruber let the cat out of the bag. Then let out another. And another. In fact, he dumped out a whole bag of cats as new media detectives released fresh clips daily depicting his smarmy confessions that he thinks the people who fell for Obamacare are drooling idiots. No, don\u2019t look at us conservatives \u2013 we saw through this crypto-fascist scheme from Day One. Your boy Gruber is just telling it like it is \u2013 when liberals aren\u2019t liars, they\u2019re morons.\n\nLike the hip kids say, hate the game, not the single payer.\n\nWhat to do? With apologies to Elisabeth K\u00fcbler-Ross, the liberals in the media, which is to say \u201cthe media,\u201d ran through the first four of the five stages of grief in record time.\n\nStage One \u2013 Denial: \u201cGruber who? Never heard of the guy I said was key to the whole Obamacare idea. And I never heard of Obamacare either. Look, a squirrel!\u201d\n\nStage Two \u2013 Anger: \u201cThis is an outrage, citing the statements of a guy we spent years touting as an expert on Obamacare who says it was all a giant scam! You are the worst human being since that inhuman monster who wore a whimsical shirt to a comet landing!\u201d\n\nStage Three \u2013 Bargaining: \u201cWell, uh, Mitt Romney hired him too so it\u2019s not so bad. Wait, what? You say that for conservatives, defending Mitt Romney over Romneycare is not a thing?\u201d\n\nStage Four \u2013 Depression: \u201cHow can we ever hope to trick \u2013 I mean \u2018convince\u2019 \u2013 the American people to trust us enough about made-up crises to ever again transfer massive amounts of money and power to us liberals and the institutions we control?\u201d\n\nHow indeed. The liberals will probably never reach Stage Five (Acceptance), and they face the huge hurdle the next time they gin up some bogus problem that demands a solution that \u2013 here\u2019s the shocker \u2013 requires they be given more money and power. That hurdle is the fact that we conservatives are never going to let anyone forget how they Grubered America.\n\nThe climate change scam? They\u2019ll Gruber at us that it\u2019s the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened, even worse than the ice age they were predicting back in the 70s if we didn\u2019t \u2013 wait for it \u2013 give liberals more money and power.\n\nThe midterm election was a big blow to the fading cash and freedom-devouring climate change scam. The fact that global warming does not seem to involve any warming was already presenting a problem for the slobbering fetishists of the climate panic. Now, every time they start saying, \u201cTrust us. I know how a year ago I said that by now the oceans would be dried up, but they\u2019ll totally be gone next summer \u2013 really,\u201d people will respond, \u201cDon\u2019t Gruber me, bro.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s kind of hard to build up a lot of trust for your next big idea when you excuse lying about your last big idea because it was so darn important: \u201cOh yeah, deceiving you about health care was cool because health care is a big deal. Sure, climate change could mean the end of the world, but on that one, well, absolute honesty. This whole green energy thing totally won\u2019t cost you more for electricity, limit your freedom, or enrich our liberal billionaire donors. Cross my heart. Now excuse me, I gotta catch a chartered jet to Gstaad for a conference on the importance of taking away your cars.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, those pushing \u201cnet neutrality\u201d \u2013 that is, allowing the government new and unprecedented power to regulate the web \u2013 have to contend with the annoying threshold question of why any sane person would ever allow this Administration to dig its claws into that final bastion of unregulated freedom. The responses liberals have to our refusal to trust them with more power over the online world are quite illustrative of exactly why we should refuse to trust them with more power over the online world. For example, sometimes they call us stupid for not trusting the same people who Gruber demonstrated think we are stupid. As a lawyer, I have to assess the notion that I\u2019m stupid for not wanting to empower people who think I\u2019m stupid as an unconvincing argument.\n\nThey also call us crazy, as if it\u2019s nuts not to trust an Administration that Grubered us on its last big project. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite of crazy \u2013 it\u2019s ancient wisdom. That ancient wisdom is today distilled in the jury instructions given in our courts, like this snippet from California Civil Jury Instruction (CACI) 107: \u201cHowever, if you decide that a witness has deliberately testified untruthfully about something important, you may choose not to believe anything that witness said.\u201d In other words, as legendary Roman lawyer Cicero probably said, liars gonna lie.\n\nYou truly can\u2019t fool all of the people all of the time, and thanks to Gruber, the time of trusting liberals is drawing to a close. This is wonderful. Look, we conservatives always knew these clowns were pushing Marxy snake oil on a gullible electorate. Now, the truth is impossible to hide.
