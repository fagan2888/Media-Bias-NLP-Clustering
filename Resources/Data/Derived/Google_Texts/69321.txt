Q. My family of three is covered through my wife's job. My wife’s coverage is free for herself, but it’s $1,000 a month for my daughter and me. Can the two of us get coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace in our state (New Jersey)?

A. This is a complicated question, filled with lots of good news and bad news.

Good news: Yes, you and your daughter can get insurance through your state's health insurance marketplace.

Bad news: Because of a glitch in the law, you won't be able to get financial help to pay for it. As long as your wife’s contribution to coverage for her alone is less than 9.5 percent of your entire household’s income (it’s free, so it obviously meets this standard), it disqualifies everyone in your family from getting financial assistance to purchase health insurance through new Health Insurance Marketplace. If your wife did not have insurance through her job, your family would eligible for at least some financial help with premiums if it had an annual household income of less than about $78,000.



Good news: There is nothing to stop you and your daughter from buying unsubsidized health insurance through the marketplace. It might still be cheaper than what you are paying to be on your wife’s plan.
