It stands out when compared to the European Union, a region ripe with \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d due to its market fragmentation. Factors like language, the role of private/public entities, and payer structure make it extremely difficult for small companies to scale up and expand beyond national borders.\n\nPPPs: One of the U.K.\u2019s Greatest Assets\n\nNow faced with collapse by 2020 due to inadequate funds, the National Health Service has embraced its greatest resource \u2013 the public-private partnership. Recognizing that technology boosts preventive measures, empowers patients, and facilitates the delivery of care, the NHS is following in the footsteps of the Affordable Care Act in terms of a supportive regulatory approach.\n\nFrom the NHS Innovation Accelerator aiming to speed up the development and integration of technologies into healthcare settings to the testing of apps and digital tools by mHealth Habitat, along with the establishment of the Innovative Medicines and MedTech Review to increase available capital and bring drugs to consumers faster, the government is not only spurring innovation forward, but it is implementing established solutions into its system.\n\nThe U.S. Health Secretary Sylvia Burwell explains that the Affordable Care Act has \u201cprovided funding for us to make more investments in data and make that data available to the private sector to help find solutions to some of our biggest challenges through innovation.\u201d This trust placed in the private sector to solve public inefficiencies is mirrored in Public Health England and the NHS\u2019s recent initiatives.\n\nChallenges\n\nDespite the regulatory support, digital health startups face several challenges to growth and implementation in the U.K. Disregarding a culture that doesn\u2019t like paying for healthcare and \u2018one main customer\u2019, entrepreneurs familiar with raising rounds in the two environments report that there is a dearth lack of capital when compared to the United States. Additionally, the attitude towards investment in the U.K and E.U. is more results-driven than idea-based and the average timeframe between meeting investors to closing rounds has been set between three to six months compared to just three weeks in the U.S.\n\nThough there are some significant hurdles, the barriers to entry are low and the saturation of the markets \u2013 consumers and providers \u2013 also remains low, giving startups ample opportunity to flourish. Keeping in mind the very unique U.K. atmosphere, we\u2019ve highlighted the twenty top digital health startups to watch below\u2014\n\n1. Andiamo\n\nThis 3D scanning and printing technology has the capacity to produce customized orthotics for children in under 48 hours as compared to the average of 13 weeks. While the cost of producing orthotics is still a bit steep, the end-product allows for the reduction of wait times, repeat appointments due to quality issues, and number of required surgeries. It also reduces opportunity cost for parents and caregivers.\n\nFounded: Unknown\n\nFounders: Samiya & Naveed Parvez\n\nCategory: Care Delivery & Medical Devices\n\nFunding: Undisclosed\n\nWhy you should pay attention \u2013 Starting out as an Indiegogo project, the company has received several awards and grants to bring their technology to over 20 families across the U.K. in under eighteen months.

Their first product, Sleepio, is an app that uses tracked data to create customized programs to help users sleep better without the use of medications.\n\nFounded: Unknown\n\nFounders: Colin Espie & Peter Hames\n\nCategory: App & Behavioral medicine\n\nFunding: $3.3 million\n\nWhy you should pay attention \u2013 Sleepio has been validated in the world\u2019s first placebo-controlled RCT for a digital sleep intervention. On average, Sleepio helped users fall asleep 54% faster, reduced night time awakenings by 62%, and boosted their daytime energy and concentration levels by 58%. The focus on behavioral therapies using personal data lends itself to a vast number of possibilities, particularly in the mental health and rehabilitation fields.\n\n4. Blackford Analysis\n\nBlackford Analysis studies comparison processes and develops cutting edge algorithmic solutions using real-time analysis of datasets.
