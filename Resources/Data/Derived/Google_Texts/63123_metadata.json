They spent 16 hours a day with their aching hands in ice water, ripping the guts, heads, tails and shells off shrimp. One girl was so tiny she had to stand on a stool to reach the peeling table. Some workers had been there for months, even years. Always, someone was watching.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t let us rest,\u201d said Eae Hpaw, 16, her arms a patchwork of scars from shrimp-related infections and allergies. \u201cWe stopped working around 7 in the evening. We would take a shower and sleep. Then we would start again around 3 in the morning.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore than 2,000 trapped fishermen have been freed this year as a result of an ongoing Associated Press investigative series into slavery in the Thai seafood industry. The reports also have led to a dozen arrests, millions of dollars\u2019 worth of seizures and proposals for new federal laws.\n\n___\n\nPervasive human trafficking has helped turn Thailand into one of the world\u2019s biggest shrimp providers. Despite repeated promises by businesses and government to clean up the country\u2019s $7 billion seafood export industry, abuses persist, fueled by corruption and complicity among police and authorities. Arrests and prosecutions are rare. Raids can end up sending migrants without proper paperwork to jail, while owners go unpunished.\n\n\u201cI was shocked after working there a while, and I realized there was no way out,\u201d said Tin Nyo Win, 22, another former Gig factory worker, who routinely peeled 175 pounds of shrimp with his wife for just $4 a day.\n\nHundreds of shrimp-peeling sheds are hidden in plain sight in Samut Sakhon, an hour outside Bangkok, some with slaves locked inside. Last month, AP journalists followed and filmed trucks loaded with freshly peeled shrimp from the abusive Gig shed to major Thai exporting companies. They also traced similar connections from another factory raided six months earlier, and interviewed more than two dozen workers from both sites. In all, several companies received tainted shrimp, including Thai Union, one of the world\u2019s biggest seafood companies, and a subsidiary.\n\nThe farmed shrimp can mix with different batches of seafood as it is packaged, branded and shipped, making it impossible to determine where any individual piece was peeled. But because at least some of the Thai exporters\u2019 shrimp was processed by forced labor, all of it is considered associated with slavery, according to United Nations and U.S. standards.\n\nU.S. customs records show the shrimp made its way into the supply chains of major U.S. food stores and retailers such as Wal-Mart, Kroger, Whole Foods, Dollar General and Petco, along with restaurants such as Red Lobster and Olive Garden. It also entered supply chains for some of America\u2019s best-known seafood brands and pet foods, including Chicken of the Sea and Fancy Feast. AP reporters went to supermarkets in all 50 states and found shrimp products from supply chains tainted with forced labor.\n\nImport and export records from Europe and Asia are confidential, but the Thai companies receiving shrimp tracked by the AP all say they ship to those continents. AP reporters in Germany, Italy, England and Ireland found several brands sourced from Thailand in supermarkets in those countries.\n\nThe businesses that responded to AP\u2019s findings condemned the practices that lead to these conditions. Many asked for details and said they were launching investigations.\n\n\u201cI want to eliminate this,\u201d said Dirk Leuenberger, CEO of Aqua Star, a leading seafood suppler. \u201cI think it\u2019s disgusting that it\u2019s even remotely part of my business.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "AP: Global grocer supply chains tied to slave-peeled shrimp", "title": "AP: Global grocer supply chains tied to slave-peeled shrimp", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "AP: Global grocer supply chains tied to slave-peeled shrimp", "title": "AP: Global grocer supply chains tied to slave-peeled shrimp", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/14/ap_global_grocer_supply_chains_tied_to_slave_peeled_shrimp/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/seafood-from-slaves-shrimp-sheds.jpeg27-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AP: Global grocer supply chains tied to slave-peeled shrimp", "title": "AP: Global grocer supply chains tied to slave-peeled shrimp", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/seafood-from-slaves-shrimp-sheds.jpeg27-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Margie Mason, Robin Mcdowell, Martha Mendoza and Esther Htusan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "AP reporters went to supermarkets in all 50 states and found shrimp products from supply chains tainted with forced labor.\nIn all, several companies received tainted shrimp, including Thai Union, one of the world\u2019s biggest seafood companies, and a subsidiary.\nIt also entered supply chains for some of America\u2019s best-known seafood brands and pet foods, including Chicken of the Sea and Fancy Feast.\nImport and export records from Europe and Asia are confidential, but the Thai companies receiving shrimp tracked by the AP all say they ship to those continents.\nLast month, AP journalists followed and filmed trucks loaded with freshly peeled shrimp from the abusive Gig shed to major Thai exporting companies."}
