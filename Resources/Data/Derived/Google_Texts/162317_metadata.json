Every year, two million people take the 93-question assessment exam that\u2019s been translated into 30 different languages to evaluate personalities for their career, education, management or leadership roles, relationships, counseling, parenting, team development, or simply for their own personal curiosity.\n\nThe test was designed by two psychological theorists, Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers, a mother-daughter team, during World War II as a way to measure the cognitive preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test\u2019s typological theories were originally proposed by Carl Gustav Jung in 1921, who divided an individual\u2019s psychological functions into four different categories, which produced 16 different personality types. After years of studying his work, Briggs and Myers constructed a type indicator test that could assess the normal population with the assumption that we derive our preferences from the way we perceive our experiences, interests, needs, values, and motivations.\n\nThe MBTI went through three decades of revisions based on the test results they collected from thousands of people in order to make the test as accurate as possible, and by 1975 the Consulting Psychologists Press Inc., published the test and made MBTI accessible to the public. It asks a wide range of questions based on Jung\u2019s thoroughly tested theory that the seemingly random variation of our behaviors is actually orderly and consistent when seen through a self-reflecting lens.\n\nEach person is given a four-letter acronym formula at the end of their exam, which gives them a score for each category they were tested in, according to the MBTI Manual: A Guide to the Development and Use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.\n\nThe first letter represents your \u201cfavorite world\u201d and reveals if you prefer to focus on the outer world, which would score you an \u201cE\u201d for extraversion, or if you focus on your inner world, would score you an \u201cI\u201d for introversion. The next category is \u201cinformation,\" which scores your preference to interpret and add meaning.\n\nThe letters represent one of two options, giving you a total of four different letters and a chance to fit into 16 different personality types. Each letter is given a percentage, indicating how strongly you fit that letter. For example, if you score 10 percent extraversion, you don\u2019t fall into that category as strongly as a 90 percent extraversion person does, making it difficult for two people to reach the exact same scores. The test evaluates the following categories and provides a total score that can tell you about how your four mental functions interact and which ones dominate your personality.\n\nFavorite World:\n\nExtraversion (E): Outgoing, engaging, friendly, energetic, enthusiastic, vivacious, communicative, and warm\n\nIntroversion (I): Independent, thoughtful, controled, deliberate, reserved, self-motivated, self-reliant, and focused\n\nInformation:\n\nSensing (S): Practical, hands-on, realistic, down-to-earth, sensual, detail-oriented, traditional, physical, observant, and factual\n\nIntuition (N): Innovative, complex, forward-thinking, idealistic, visionary, sees patterns, unconventional, imaginative, and theoretical\n\nDecisions:\n\nThinking (T): Analytical, objective, rational, unsentimental, levelheaded, logical, pragmatic, outspoken, and tough-minded\n\nFeeling (F): Compassionate, warm, caring, personable, expressive, sympathetic, ethical, and humanitarian\n\nStructure:\n\nJudging: Organized, hardworking, methodical, orderly, determined, authoritative, ambitious, dedicated, and decisive\n\nPerceiving: Tolerant, open-minded, responsive, spontaneous, adaptable, adventurous, changeable, and unstructured\n\nIn order to test the efficacy of Jung\u2019s theory and the execution of Myers and Briggs, the writers and editors at Medical Daily took the test. The test has become a psychological assessment owned by CPP and used by certified professionals that must be distributed by trained instructors at testing centers or colleges and universities. However, there is one test accessible online that is provided by Human Metrics, called the \u201cJung Typology Test,\u201d which uses the same typology formula Jung and Myers used for their personality assessments. Do we put too much faith and reliance into man-made personality exams or is the test an accurate reflection of who we are, how we act, and why?\n\nAfter 13 Medical Daily staff members were given the 70-question Human Metrics exam, they were asked whether or not they agreed with the results and if they believed it was an accurate assessment of their personality. Generally, people agreed with their results, but that doesn\u2019t mean everyone put as much credence as others.\n\n\u201cAs for how legitimate the test is, I\u2019m torn,\u201d said Chris Weller, who scored as an INTJ in the Human Metrics Jung Typology Test. \u201cIt certainly makes it easy to answer how you\u2019d like to see yourself. Maybe as you get older the test grows to reflect the added life experience, making it more accurate. But people are fallible no matter how old they are, so who knows?\u201d\n\nPeople were asked to answer yes or no to questions they agreed with the most, such as \u201cYou are almost never late for your appointments\u201d or \u201cYou often contemplate the complexity of life.\u201d The consistency in which they answered similar questions provided them with a percentage for each four-letter type with its own reflective title.\n\n\u201cI think personality tests capture the essence of who you are and how you feel that particular day you take the test, but I don\u2019t think they are 100 percent valid descriptions,\u201d said Lizette Borreli, who scored as an ENFJ in the Human Metrics Jung Typology Test. \u201cPeople\u2019s personalities tend to change and evolve throughout the years, so these results, in my opinion, could only be applied to who you are in that given point in time.\u201d\n\nIn-Office Results:\n\n3 ISFJ, \u201cthe protector,\u201d makes up 14 percent of the general population and his/her ideal career would be in medicine, counseling, or teaching.
