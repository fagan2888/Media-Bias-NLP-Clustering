Also Friday, Centene shareholders voted to approve the issuance of Centene common stock to Health Net stockholders in connection with the deal, which was originally announced in July.\n\nMeanwhile, Centene logged Q3 earnings of 84 cents a share before the open Tuesday. That was up from 67 cents the prior year and well ahead of consensus estimates of 78 cents. Revenue climbed 31% to $5.8 billion, roughly in line with views.\n\nManaged care membership grew 24% to 4.8 million. The company posted a Health Benefits Ratio of 89% for the quarter vs. 89.7% the prior year.\n\n\u201cThe quarter reaffirms our strong fundamentals and momentum that positions us well for the balance of this year and 2016, including the combination with Health Net,\u201d CEO Michael Neidorff said in a statement.\n\nCentene upped its full-year EPS guidance to a range of $2.84 to $2.90, up from prior guidance of $2.74 to $2.82. Before the Q3 earnings report, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected full-year EPS of $2.81.\n\nCentene shares closed up 4.8% to 60.84 on the stock market today. Shares are still well down from the high of 83 set in early July.\n\nHealth Net\u2019s stock price rose 2.8% to 65.17.\n\nCentene\u2019s Health Net buyout is one of a few big deals to hit the managed care sector this year.\n\nIn July alone, UnitedHealth (UNH) closed its $12.8 billion buyout of Catamaran, a pharmacy benefits manager; Aetna (AET) announced plans to buy Humana (HUM) in a $37 billion cash and stock deal; and Anthem (ANTM) said that it would acquire Cigna (CI) for $54.2 billion.\n\nFollow Vance Cariaga on Twitter: @IBD_VCariaga.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Shares of Centene moved higher Tuesday after the managed care firm topped quarterly earnings views, helped by a strong rise in managed care membership.
