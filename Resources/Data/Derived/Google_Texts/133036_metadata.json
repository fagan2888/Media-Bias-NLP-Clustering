(WHTM) \u2013 Two more family health centers in the Midstate are closing; one in Cumberland County, the other in Dauphin.\n\nPinnacleHealth is closing Cumberland Family Practice to consolidate with Good Hope Family Physicians.\n\nAcross the river in Lower Paxton Township, Baughman Family Medicine started providing health care in 2000, but according to a statement on its website, the practice is closing \u201cdue to dropping reimbursement, increasing overhead and a few unexpected bumps in the road.\u201d\n\nDr. Paul Baughman told ABC 27 News that patients owe him nearly $70,000 in co-payments.\n\nAji Abraham, a senior vice president at Capital BlueCross, says less family practices could mean higher costs. He says people who lose a doctor could feel the pinch if they don\u2019t find a new health care provider.\n\n\u201cIf they have health issues, they may have to go to the ER, hopefully an urgent care clinic, and the ER is an expensive place to get primary care. That adds to the cost,\u201d he said.\n\nInsurance experts say if your health care provider closes, get a copy of your medical records or have them transferred to your new physician.\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nPocket\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two more family health centers in the Midstate are closing; one in Cumberland County, the other in Dauphin.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=394896224", "og": {"site_name": "ABC27", "description": "Two more family health centers in the Midstate are closing; one in Cumberland County, the other in Dauphin.", "title": "Closing family practices could drive up costs", "url": "http://abc27.com/2015/06/12/closing-family-practices-could-drive-up-costs/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://mgtvwhtm.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/55e3a0a192a442df93f605e70d20d8b7.jpg", "height": 366}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "ABC27.com", "description": "Two more family health centers in the Midstate are closing; one in Cumberland County, the other in Dauphin.", "title": "Closing family practices could drive up costs", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwhtm.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/55e3a0a192a442df93f605e70d20d8b7.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@abc27News", "site": "abc27news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Carlisle & West Shore, Harrisburg, Top Video", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, weather, traffic and sports for Harrisburg, Pa.
