KNOXVILLE (WATE) – There is a free service in Knoxville to help you file your taxes starting this week. The Community Action Committee is partnering with Volunteer Income Tax Assistance to offer the service to those with low and moderate income levels.

Brenda Joyce Blair started using the program Thursday morning by filling out paperwork.

“You get lost in numbers, and you don’t want to fill out the paperwork wrong. These are the people to talk to because they’ll go over step-by-step with you to make sure you don’t make a mistake with the IRS,” Blair said.

Blair then got one-on-one help from volunteers certified by the IRS.

“They’re very cordial and they have a nice attitude, and they carry you through the process and where you’re not hindered but helped,” Blair said.

College professor Richard Grover has been volunteering with the program for six years. He says he enjoys helping people navigate through a complicated system.

“There is a lot of people who couldn’t get their taxes done to be honest taxes are so complex the average person just can’t do it,” Grover said.

Sue Campbell helps run the program and says this year they expect to serve at least 2,000 people. She says they expect to be busier than last year because there is new paperwork involved with the Affordable Care Act.

“They know when they come here if there’s a problem, we will help them work through it,” Campbell said.

No appointment is necessary, but Campbell says to make sure to bring important tax paperwork with you, including any deduction information you might have.

The service will run through April 15 at the CAC L.T. Ross Building. It is available Mondays and Wednesdays from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m., Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Saturdays in February from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
