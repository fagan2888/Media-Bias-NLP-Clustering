John McCain warned the president would face impeachment if he were to put \"boots on the ground.\"\n\nMcCain told Phoenix radio host Mike Broomhead on Thursday that the president had \"bungled\" the entire handling of the Syria crisis and would open himself up to impeachment hearings if he overstepped the limits of the authorization before Congress.\n\n\n\nFollow @politicaltickerFollow @jseher\n\n\"No one wants American boots on the ground,\" McCain told the KYFI audience. \"Nor will there be American boots on the ground, because there would be an impeachment of the president if they did that.\"\n\nWhile McCain said he still supports the current plan to intervene in Syria, the Arizona Republican's statement seems to reflect his contentious Thursday town hall meeting with some Phoenix constituents. At the meeting, McCain, who has favored a more robust American response to the Syria crisis, faced intense criticism.\n\n\"We didn't send you to make war for us. We sent you to stop the war,\" one man said.\n\nDespite his warning to the president, McCain spoke out in favor of the Syria authorization again Saturday, endorsing former Army Gen. David Petraeus' endorsement of the administration's plan in a tweet.\n\nOnly one of three Republicans in the Senate Foreign Relations panel to approve the measure, McCain has vocally advocated for a stepped-up American response to alleged use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government. He even refused to pass the White House resolution out of committee until it included provisions to bolster Syrian opposition forces deemed moderate.\n\nMcCain's support for action hasn't stopped the Arizonan from blasting his former 2008 presidential rival for inaction.\n\nIn an interview on CNN's \"The Situation Room\" on Tuesday, McCain told Wolf Blitzer the president needed to \"explain to the American people\" why urgent action in Syria is necessary. The Republican senator also said President Obama made a mistake by consulting Congress instead of immediately launching a bombing campaign against the Syrian government.\n\n\"It's common sense you don't warn them and give them plenty of time to disperse,\" McCain said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- After endorsing President Barack Obama's plan to launch military strikes against Syria, Sen.
