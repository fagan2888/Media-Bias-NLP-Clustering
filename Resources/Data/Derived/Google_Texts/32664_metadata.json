The basic style of play hasn\u2019t changed vastly: Barcelona still keeps the ball as much as it can. It had 62 percent of the possession against Juventus and its default position is still to build attacks methodically from the back.\n\nGoalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen avoided hit-and-hope long kicks up-field in Berlin\u2019s Olympic Stadium, because doing so would only have given more of the ball to Juventus.\n\nBut there is more adventure in Enrique\u2019s setup, a greater willingness to try other options going forward. Exhibit A: Barcelona\u2019s first goal came not from a long-winded exchange of short passes or a dribble from Lionel Messi. Instead, Messi got the attack started with a long diagonal pass from midfield. That landed for Jordi Alba, who quick as a flash passed to Neymar. The Brazilian then slipped the ball to Andres Iniesta, who neatly flicked it to Ivan Rakitic to score.\n\nThe combination was dizzyingly quick and devastating for Gianluigi Buffon, left with no chance from such short range in the Juventus goal.\n\n___\n\nSUAREZ PROVIDES BITE:\n\nHaving the strength and guile of Luis Suarez up front is one reason why Barcelona can be more direct in its attacks. Barcelona did its image no favors when it bought the striker after his infamous chomp of Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini\u2019s shoulder at the 2014 World Cup. The $110-million transfer from Liverpool made it look as though Barcelona was condoning the bad behavior that earned Suarez a lengthy ban.\n\nBut, for lack of a better word, the Uruguay striker does provide real attacking bite for Barcelona. He can make goals on his own, without the usual intricate buildup of play that is Barcelona\u2019s trademark. Teammates look for him, even with long up-field passes that former coaches at the club, notably Pep Guardiola, didn\u2019t advocate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Things learned from Barcelona\u2019s Champions League win", "title": "Things learned from Barcelona\u2019s Champions League win", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Things learned from Barcelona\u2019s Champions League win", "title": "Things learned from Barcelona\u2019s Champions League win", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/07/things_learned_from_barcelonas_champions_league_win/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/germany-soccer-champions-league-final.jpeg20-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Things learned from Barcelona\u2019s Champions League win", "title": "Things learned from Barcelona\u2019s Champions League win", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/germany-soccer-champions-league-final.jpeg20-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Leicester", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4b7\"", "article_summary": "Teammates look for him, even with long up-field passes that former coaches at the club, notably Pep Guardiola, didn\u2019t advocate.\nThe record book would suggest not: Not since Milan in 1990 has a team won the European Cup twice in a row.\nExhibit A: Barcelona\u2019s first goal came not from a long-winded exchange of short passes or a dribble from Lionel Messi.\nHe can make goals on his own, without the usual intricate buildup of play that is Barcelona\u2019s trademark.\nThe basic style of play hasn\u2019t changed vastly: Barcelona still keeps the ball as much as it can."}
