Starkville is home to Mississippi State University, where the football team\u2019s amazing run this season capped off a period of cultural and civic transformation for the town itself. As the New York Times noted in November, Starkville had even passed an anti-discrimination resolution that included sexual orientation and identity.\n\nStarkville was the first place in Mississippi to take that step, in January 2014. Their aldermen led the way for other cities in the state to debate and pass resolutions of their own. In September, Starkville added a policy that extended health benefits to domestic partners of city employees. After that second move, the pressure from local religious leaders to overturn those decisions \u2013 \u201cto move the policies and positions for this city back to a Judeo-Christian position,\u201d as one pastor told the board \u2013 began immediately.\n\nOn Tuesday, in a closed-door executive session, the Starkville alderman voted to repeal both the new anti-discrimination statement and the policy providing health benefits for same-sex couples. Mayor Parker Wiseman says the aldermen behind the repeal provided no notice that they intended to hold those votes or any explanation for doing so. A local paper, the Columbus Dispatch, can\u2019t even be sure which alderman voted which way:\n\n\n\nCity attorney Chris Latimer advised staff to not disclose how individual aldermen voted Tuesday. It is assumed, however, that the same two aldermen who fought for the plus-one insurance extension \u2013 Ward 4\u2019s Jason Walker and Ward 5\u2019s Scott Maynard \u2013 again voted to keep the policies on the books Tuesday as they confirmed their stances on the issue have not changed. It is believed Ward 2 Alderman Lisa Wynn joined the coalition of aldermen against the two policies \u2013 Ben Carver, David Little, Roy A. Perkins and Henry Vaughn \u2013 after she first abstained from and then walked out of City Hall during past votes concerning the plus-one insurance tier.\n\nSo long as we are debating civil rights in this country, so long as those questions remain unsettled in elections and legislative bodies and in the courts, we are going to see outcomes that vary widely \u2013 in this case, whipsawing within the span of a year in a single town. But it\u2019s striking to watch people peering into a black box of a local government, trying to figure out elected officials\u2019 positions on an issue of central importance to citizens\u2019 lives.\n\nThe vote in Starkville was five to two, enough to override a veto from Mayor Wiseman. He told the Columbus Dispatch yesterday that he worries about the signal Starkville is sending:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Starkville, Mississippi, was the first town in the state to pass an anti-discrimination resolution that protected gay people.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/mississippi-town-repeals-anti-discrimination-resolution-secret", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Starkville, Mississippi, was the first town in the state to pass an anti-discrimination resolution that protected gay people.", "title": "Mississippi town repeals anti-discrimination resolution in secret", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/mississippi-town-repeals-anti-discrimination-resolution-secret", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/article-teasers/starkville.jpg?itok=1UCpedj8", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/mississippi-town-repeals-anti-discrimination-resolution-secret", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/article-teasers/starkville.jpg?itok=gR3imEpI", "title": "Mississippi town repeals anti-discrimination resolution in secret", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Starkville, Mississippi, was the first town in the state to pass an anti-discrimination resolution that protected gay people."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-01-08T13:30:50-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "laura-conaway", "title": "Mississippi town repeals anti-discrimination resolution in secret", "tags": "gay-rights,mississippi,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "01/08/2015 13:30:50 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/mississippi-town-repeals-anti-discrimination-resolution-secret"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Starkville, Mississippi, was the first town in the state to pass an anti-discrimination resolution that protected gay people.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Gay Rights, Mississippi"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b34\"", "article_summary": "Just a few weeks ago, the town of Starkville, Mississippi, was being praised nationally as a surprising example of progress in the South.\nOn Tuesday, in a closed-door executive session, the Starkville alderman voted to repeal both the new anti-discrimination statement and the policy providing health benefits for same-sex couples.\nAs the New York Times noted in November, Starkville had even passed an anti-discrimination resolution that included sexual orientation and identity.\nA local paper, the Columbus Dispatch, can\u2019t even be sure which alderman voted which way:City attorney Chris Latimer advised staff to not disclose how individual aldermen voted Tuesday.\nStarkville is home to Mississippi State University, where the football team\u2019s amazing run this season capped off a period of cultural and civic transformation for the town itself."}
