For, if the national political press truly believed that voters are in need of and drawn to coverage of policies that actually impact their lives, it sure does have a funny way of showing it. What the establishment media increasingly serves up to the public instead is a thin gruel of theater criticism and cynical snark. And perhaps the least nourishing ingredient in this journalistic stew is a heaping helping of what the media calls gaffes.\n\nNow, gaffes can come in all shapes and sizes, but what\u2019s most important about them is that the press thinks they\u2019re important. Voters, not so much. Seizing on the inevitable verbal slip-ups or logistical snafus that happen every day in politics just isn\u2019t much of a priority to people who don\u2019t have a decent job or lack access to healthcare or live in fear of the police. For that matter, ever hear a regular citizen call out \u201cWhat about your gaffes?!\u201d at a candidate town hall or along a campaign rope line? Ad Policy\n\nTo the media, however, gaffes serve an important function. They allow it to concoct a broader narrative about candidate or politician that\u2014and this advantage can\u2019t be overlooked\u2014easily fills airtime or column inches. Rather than digging into the full context of a candidate\u2019s rhetoric or analyzing the substance (or lack thereof) of his or her campaign platform\u2014which is much more difficult work\u2014gaffes allows the press to effortlessly remain \u201cobjective\u201d through what is essentially meta-coverage. Covering the messaging, not the message. Or, as I noted on Twitter last week: \u201cthe press loves to cover gaffes because they offer the pretense of accountability, without having to weigh in on actual policy.\u201d\n\nI wrote that in frustration right after the press\u2019s gaffe-obsessed response to last week\u2019s woeful Kentucky Senate debate. In it, Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes had refused for a second time to say whether she voted for Obama in 2008 or 2012 and her awkward evasiveness, nearly everybody in Washington agreed, was a huge gaffe. So much so, NBC News chief political correspondent Chuck Todd had already claimed on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe earlier in the week that her refusal to directly answer the question earlier should have \u201cdisqualified\u201d her from the office. To be clear: Grimes was not avoiding tough questions about being criminally corrupt or secretly belonging to some racist or fascist political group\u2014revelations that would have had actual bearing on her fitness for public service. No, she was merely trying to distance herself from a president who has a lousy approval rating in her home state, a time-honored tradition if ever there was one.\n\nTo Todd and his ilk, though, this alleged gaffe spoke volumes about Grimes\u2019s character and made her an easy target for lampooning by her opponent, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. When confronted about his specious reasoning in a subsequent Facebook Q & A, Todd backed off his judgment a bit (\u201cdisqualifying for some voters\u201d was his new formulation), but still defended his over-the-top analysis as reflecting \u201cpolitical reality.\u201d But for all his cynicism, Todd still tries to have it both ways. For, later in the same Facebook chat he said he was \u201csick\u201d over the fact the McConnell camp had already stuck his Grimes-bashing soundbite into a campaign ad.

Todd believes Grimes made a big gaffe because the DC conventional wisdom\u2014which he both participates and marinates in daily\u2014agrees with him. Under the guise of being objective, the press wants to deny itself any agency in manufacturing and perpetuating said reality. It likes to pretend it\u2019s just calling \u2018em like it's seeing \u2018em, all the while ignoring the fact that the very act of seeing a gaffe is a subjective choice.\n\nThat the line between the political media and the campaigns they cover grows ever more blurry really shouldn\u2019t come as much of a shock to folks like Todd, though. It\u2019s a perfectly predictable outcome, precisely because the press has increasingly adopted the perspective of a political operative rather than a voter when covering campaigns and elected officials. And to the operative, politics is less about governance\u2014ideas and proposals and policy\u2014and more about the horserace\u2014optics and messaging and tactics. So, to cater to this audience, the political press increasingly relies upon polling, gaffes stripped of context, and oppo research for its storylines. In effect, its \u201cobjective\u201d news values are being slowly co-opted by the partisans it covers. It turns out that when you gaze long into gaffes the gaffes also gaze into you.\n\nIndeed, the Beltway media has so inculcated this insider\u2019s framing that it becomes almost impossible for any of them to see past the messaging in order to devote proportional coverage to those issues that really matter. Thus, when Mitch McConnell repeatedly dodges questions about the reality of climate change, the press barely notices. Likewise, when McConnell pushes 13 egregious falsehoods about the Affordable Care Act in less than five minutes during last week\u2019s debate, Todd can muster up no more outrage than to say that that moment should disqualify the senator\u2026from being majority leader. Keep in mind that, if McConnell got his way and shut down Kentucky\u2019s state-run insurance exchange, it would revoke healthcare for 500,000 residents of his state. But to those in the establishment media like Todd and NBC News\u2019s legacy hire and resident bro, Luke Russert, his radical, misguided comments were simply another gaffe, just like Grimes\u2019s, and merely grist for the false equivalency mill. Ad Policy\n\nWhen the national press behaves in this way, it has a pernicious, trickle-down effect on local media as well. Consider, for example, the Des Moines Register\u2019s surreal recap of last week\u2019s Iowa Senate debate. For almost the entire story, the reporter stays fixated on the optics of the debate and rehashing the supposed gaffe the Democratic candidate, Rep. Bruce Braley, madeseven months ago. Finally, down in the eleventh paragraph, the you find one lonely token sentence on policy: \u201cThe pair sparred over Social Security, national security and health care.\u201d But that was but a cruel tease, as right after it the story jumps right back to 20 more paragraphs on zingers and comebacks and body language without giving readers any idea of what the respective candidates\u2019 actual positions are on Social Security, national security, and healthcare. In a long article about an Iowa Senate debate, in other words, the public was left with literally no idea of what the Iowa Senate debate was about.\n\nThis Register story\u2019s glaring omissions and superficial focus serve as a simulacrum of the past few months of myopic midterm campaign coverage. Ultimately, these upside-down news priorities do more than just frustrate readers\u2014they endanger our democracy. They starve the citizenry of information about actual policy differences between the parties and candidates, while simultaneously gorging the public with empty-calorie coverage about meaningless minutiae and petty political squabbles. With control of the Senate hanging in the balance, the media owes it to the American people to fully explain the real-life stakes of the choices on the ballot next month. Sadly, too much of our political press is intent on offering coverage that strictly goes for gaffes, but the price the rest of us will pay for this journalistic negligence is no laughing matter.\n\nContact me directly at reedfrichardson (at) gmail dot com.\n\nI\u2019m on Twitter here\u2014(at)reedfrich.\n\nEditor's note: To contact Eric Alterman, use this form\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This blog post originally included a passage linking to a paper by Petra Marquardt-Bigman titled \"Another Milestone for the Mainstreaming of Anti-Semitism: The New America Foundation and Max Blumenthal's Goliath.\" After a review, we concluded that this paper did not meet our standards as source material and so the link and the passage were removed by the editors.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/alison_lundergan_grimes_ap_img_3-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Eric Alterman, Reed Richardson", "description": "Eric on this week\u2019s concerts and releases and Reed on how the gaffe-obsessed political press is doing a disservice to democracy.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Eric on this week\u2019s concerts and releases and Reed on how the gaffe-obsessed political press is doing a disservice to democracy.", "title": "Just for Gaffes: Why the Political Press\u2019s Obsession With Minutiae Is No Joke", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/just-gaffes-why-political-presss-obsession-minutiae-no-joke/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/alison_lundergan_grimes_ap_img_3.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 994}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T09:39:59+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Eric on this week\u2019s concerts and releases and Reed on how the gaffe-obsessed political press is doing a disservice to democracy.", "title": "Just for Gaffes: Why the Political Press\u2019s Obsession With Minutiae Is No Joke", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/just-gaffes-why-political-presss-obsession-minutiae-no-joke/", "image": {"height": 994, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/alison_lundergan_grimes_ap_img_3.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/alison_lundergan_grimes_ap_img_3-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "October 20th, 2014", "sailthru.title": "Just for Gaffes: Why the Political Press\u2019s Obsession With Minutiae Is No Joke", "keywords": "Eric Alterman, Reed Richardson, The Nation, Chuck Todd, gaffes, Alison Lundergan Grimes, Mitch McConnell, Bruce Braley", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 113065, "sailthru.tags": "Journalists and Journalism,Music,Politics,Blog,Books & the Arts", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "Bruce Braley", "published_time": "2014-10-20T15:15:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T09:39:59+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/ehart1/"}, "sailthru.description": "Eric on this week\u2019s concerts and releases and Reed on how the gaffe-obsessed political press is doing a disservice to democracy.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/alison_lundergan_grimes_ap_img_3-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In a long article about an Iowa Senate debate, in other words, the public was left with literally no idea of what the Iowa Senate debate was about.\nAnd now, here (finally) is Reed:Just for Gaffes: Why the Political Press\u2019s Obsession with Minutiae and Meta-Coverage is No Jokeby Reed RichardsonSerious question: What do political reporters think voters really care about?\nSo, to cater to this audience, the political press increasingly relies upon polling, gaffes stripped of context, and oppo research for its storylines.\nIt turns out that when you gaze long into gaffes the gaffes also gaze into you.\nConsider, for example, the Des Moines Register\u2019s surreal recap of last week\u2019s Iowa Senate debate."}
