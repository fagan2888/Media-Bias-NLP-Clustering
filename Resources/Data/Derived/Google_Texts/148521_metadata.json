This includes employees at Hilo Medical Center, Ka\u2019u Hospital, and Hale Ho\u2019ola Hamakua.\n\nThe layoffs follow a projected $7 million deficit in the fiscal year set to begin July 1. HHSC officials say the hospital system, which is state funded, is currently facing an overall $50 million shortfall for fiscal 2016.\n\n\u201cOur budget shortfall will have considerable impact on healthcare facilities in East Hawai\u2019i. Region-wide cost cutting measures have already been implemented and service cutbacks and layoffs are the only remaining options for our financial viability,\u201d said Gary Yoshiyama, East Hawai\u2019i Regional Board Chair. \u201cMany scenarios were carefully weighed in our preparation to maintain essential healthcare services and minimize any potential harm to patients.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the 87 employees who will be laid off, HMC, Ka\u2019u Hospital, and Hale Ho\u2019ola Hamakua will see reduction in services. Among the planned closures is Home Care Services, which provides chronic and transitional nursing care to homebound individuals, and one wing of adult inpatient psychiatric care at HMC. Ka\u2019u Hospital, Ho\u2019ola Hamakua, and HMC will also see cuts in the amount of long term care beds available.\n\n\u201cSome healthcare services for our communities will be reduced and disrupted as a result of the planned closures, cutbacks, and staff layoffs,\u201d said Dan Brinkman, Interim East Hawai\u2019i Regional CEO. \u201cAs a result of operational efficiencies and cost reductions we\u2019ve already instituted, we are able to complete our current fiscal year intact, but those action are not enough to make up for the coming year\u2019s shortfall. While the vast majority of our workers will keep their jobs, it saddens us that very capable people who help care for our community will lose their jobs. We know our employees and physicians will continue to deliver the high quality patient centered care our community has come to expect.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHigh costs and lower reimbursement rates incurred are contributing factors to the HHSC East Hawai\u2019i region\u2019s estimated shortfall. HHSC officials say that nearly 75 percent of reimbursements made come from Medicare and Medicaid/Quest, which don\u2019t cover the cost of care.\n\nThe hospitals service more than 100,000 people who live in a mostly rural 2,000 square mile area. Many individuals depend on the hospitals as a safety net because they are uninsured and have no other healthcare options.\n\nIn 2014 alone, the East Hawai\u2019i region had 49,000 emergency room visits, 39,000 clinic visits, 9,000 admissions and over 1,100 births. The entire East Hawai\u2019i region has a budget of $160 million, $100 million of which is current payroll, making it the Big Island\u2019s second largest employer.", "article_metadata": {"expires": 0, "description": "Seven percent of employees from Hawai\u2019i Health System Corporation's East Hawai'i region are expected to be laid off as the region suffers a budget deficit.", "og": {"url": "http://bigislandnow.com/2015/05/20/major-layoffs-expected-at-east-hawaii-hospitals/", "type": "article", "image": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/hilo-medical-center.jpg", "site_name": "Big Island Now  |  Major Layoffs Expected at East Hawai\u2019i Hospitals", "title": "Big Island Now: Major Layoffs Expected at East Hawai\u2019i Hospitals"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "theme-color": "#57ace2", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/themes/BigIslandNow2015/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "keywords": "hawaii health system corporation,hhsc,east hawaii region,hilo medical center,ka\u2019u hospital and hale ho\u2019ola hamakua,budget,east hawaii news,featured articles,news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Seven percent of the total workforce of Hawai\u2019i Health Systems Corporation\u2019s East Hawai\u2019i Region will be laid off, according to an announcement made late Tuesday.\nIn 2014 alone, the East Hawai\u2019i region had 49,000 emergency room visits, 39,000 clinic visits, 9,000 admissions and over 1,100 births.\nThe entire East Hawai\u2019i region has a budget of $160 million, $100 million of which is current payroll, making it the Big Island\u2019s second largest employer.\nADVERTISEMENTHigh costs and lower reimbursement rates incurred are contributing factors to the HHSC East Hawai\u2019i region\u2019s estimated shortfall.\n\u201cOur budget shortfall will have considerable impact on healthcare facilities in East Hawai\u2019i."}
