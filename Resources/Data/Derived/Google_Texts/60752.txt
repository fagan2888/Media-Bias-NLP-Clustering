As speculation surrounding a potential 2016 presidential bid by Hillary Clinton heightens amid the former secretary of state's book tour, questions about Clinton's personal wealth have been on the rise.

Clinton once again downplayed her wealth in an interview published in The Guardian on Saturday, saying voters don't see it as a blow to her credibility on issues such as economic inequality.

"But they don't see me as part of the problem," she told The Guardian, "because we pay ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off, not to name names; and we've done it through dint of hard work."

Clinton discussed her financial status earlier in June during an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer, telling the host she and former President Bill Clinton were "dead broke" upon leaving the White House.

“We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt," Clinton said at the time. “We had no money when we got there and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea’s education. You know, it was not easy.”

Critics point to speaking engagements, book deals and exorbitant expenses in an effort to call Clinton out for her comments, claiming she is "tone deaf" and "out of touch."
