The Medi-Cal expansion and the first open enrollment period for Covered California brought millions of applications to the door of the Department of Health Care Services, which oversees Medi-Cal.\n\nComputer issues hampered the processing of many of those applications, and in March 2014 the backlog of unprocessed claims peaked at more than 900,000 applications. It took many months to clear the bulk of those applications. Some of them are still hanging fire almost a year later, said Jen Flory, senior attorney in the Sacramento office of the Western Center on Law and Poverty.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been working on it, but it\u2019s not complete. There are large numbers of people they\u2019re still processing, and different counties are reporting different numbers,\u201d Flory said. \u201cFrom our perspective, anytime there\u2019s even one person where services are withheld, that\u2019s a problem. The number is down, but I would need to see the number zero.\u201d\n\nDHCS officials said the ruling simply reflects changes already made at the department, where recent applications have been processed within the 45-day limit.\n\n\u201cThat action, along with other extensive efforts undertaken throughout 2014, has virtually cleared the number of pending individuals, reducing it by more than 95 percent,\u201d department officials said in a written statement.\n\nDoing the math from the peak of 900,000 unprocessed applications, that leaves roughly 45,000 applications still pending from 10 months ago.\n\nThat remaining backlog dismays Lucy Quacinella, founder of Multiforum Advocacy Solutions, a private legal firm in San Francisco. Quacinella was lead attorney in the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThis ruling is very significant,\u201d Quacinella said. \u201cThe state made some improvements that never would have happened without the lawsuit. We would absolutely be looking at a growing backlog right now.\u201d\n\nQuacinella said the state now must clear those final pending applications.\n\n\u201cThe ruling requires the department to complete eligibility reviews and give a final decision,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if the state is unable to do that, they have to grant preliminary eligibility to those who are likely eligible.\u201d\n\nDHCS officials said that\u2019s happening right now.\n\n\u201cDHCS is processing the remaining pending applicants this week,\u201d DHCS officials said in their written release, \u201cand once all needed verifications of information are complete, eligible individuals will be moved into coverage.\u201d\n\nIt has been a complicated and thorny problem, the statement said.\n\n\u201cThere are multiple factors affecting DHCS\u2019 ability to process individuals into coverage, including the need to receive documents from applicants to verify eligibility, as well as some technology issues,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOf the remaining pending applications, many are individuals who have not yet provided information needed to verify their eligibility, and many others are duplicate applications that will be removed from the system.\u201d\n\nThe second open enrollment period for Covered California started Nov. 15, 2014, and runs through Feb. 15. That effort impacts Medi-Cal, because many Covered California applicants, if they look like they might be eligible for Medi-Cal, are referred to DHCS. That big bump in Medi-Cal enrollment applications has gone smoothly this time around, DHCS officials said.\n\n\u201cImportantly, improvements to our system have resulted in immediate enrollment for more than 80 percent of new applicants found eligible for Medi-Cal,\u201d the DHCS statement said. \u201cWe are committed to complying with any court orders and to further improving this process so that all individuals who qualify for coverage can be enrolled in Medi-Cal as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nAdvocates praised DHCS for that instant enrollment success.\n\n\u201cInstant enrollment makes us all happy,\u201d Flory said. \u201cThey have taken some steps to avoid the backlog, and that\u2019s something. They were voluntary steps. Now it\u2019s required.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state must process applications in 45 days -- or grant temporary access.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Judge Rules on Medi-Cal Backlog, Orders Timely Access to Benefits\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/01\\/23\\/judge-rules-on-medi-cal-backlog-orders-timely-access-to-benefits\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-23 10:06:29\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-01-23 10:06:29\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":23608,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Medi-Cal\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2012\\/01\\/Gavel-20111114-e1409248436930.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The state must process applications in 45 days -- or grant temporary access.", "title": "Judge Rules on Medi-Cal Backlog, Orders Timely Access to Benefits", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/01/23/judge-rules-on-medi-cal-backlog-orders-timely-access-to-benefits/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2012/01/Gavel-20111114-620x411.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "medi-cal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The ruling by Judge Evelio Grillo was a victory for health care advocates in a lawsuit over the state\u2019s extensive backlog in processing Medi-Cal applications.\nThat big bump in Medi-Cal enrollment applications has gone smoothly this time around, DHCS officials said.\nBy David Gorn, California HealthlineOn Thursday, an Alameda County Superior Court judge issued a preliminary injunction requiring the state to adhere to a 45-day limit for processing Medi-Cal applications.\nWe would absolutely be looking at a growing backlog right now.\u201dQuacinella said the state now must clear those final pending applications.\nThat effort impacts Medi-Cal, because many Covered California applicants, if they look like they might be eligible for Medi-Cal, are referred to DHCS."}
