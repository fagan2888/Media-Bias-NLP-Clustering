Much has been made of the fact that the ABC and NBC nightly newscasts have gone 10 days without covering the recently unearthed remarks by Obamacare “architect” Jonathan Gruber about the “stupidity of the American voter.” But when Meet The Press host Chuck Todd was asked about this as a possible example of media bias during an interview with NewsmaxTV’s Steve Malzberg Tuesday, he had a different explanation.

“I’m not saying it’s not a story,” Todd, who did discuss Gruber on Meet The Press this Sunday, told Malzberg. He noted that he’s not in charge of NBC Nightly News’ editorial choices, despite appearing on it from time to time in his role as political director for the network.

“What is the news today of that?” he asked of Gruber. “It’s a political story. Network news hasn’t be covering the political back and forth of Washington a lot lately. I don’t think this has to do with Gruber specifically, I would just caution people on that.”
