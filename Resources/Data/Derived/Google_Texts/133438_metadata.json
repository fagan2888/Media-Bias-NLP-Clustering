Families who have until now rejected even reporting their missing kin for fear of reprisal are beginning to see the value of the civilian volunteers' efforts.\n\nOn this Sunday, the UPOEG leaders were working alongside a team from the Citizens Forensic Science group, formed only a few weeks earlier. Together they hope to create a biological data bank using DNA samples from family members of the disappeared. The volunteers jumped onto truck beds and loaded into cars for the half-hour trip to La Laguna, the area outside Iguala where the UPOEG suspected there was clandestine graves.\n\nTheir search of a nearby zone in La Joya had previously turned up a grave where the federal attorney general\u2019s forensic specialists exhumed eight bodies. But then, abruptly, the attorney general's office abandoned the pursuit, even though there were signs of more burials. Outraged relatives, steeled by new anger over the 43 and fed up after years of fearing retaliation, took matters into their own hands. Many are now coming forward to register the names of their missing family members and offer blood samples for DNA testing.\n\nThe first site uncovered in La Laguna revealed a femur. During the long day under a scorching sun, volunteers found seven graves, six of them holding human remains.\n\nUPOEG leader Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez acknowledges that the vigilante forensics work is illegal, but says that families are out of options. Indeed, the police seem to have accepted the help. Earlier, Jim\u00e9nez had called federal police and demanded they cordon off and guard the graves the citizens' brigade had found. Heavily-armed teams moved in just as the search party\u2019s vehicles headed down the rocky hills back to Iguala.\n\nFather Oscar Mauricio Prudenciano Gonz\u00e1lez, of Saint Gerard\u2019s Catholic Church, has provided church facilities and moral support to the families of the disappeared. He is backing the effort of the Citizens Forensic Science group to encourage people to come forward and register their missing family members and provide DNA.\n\nBut this nascent movement to pressure the Mexican government to recognize the human tragedy of the drug war relies most on the union of mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters who have experienced the horrors of narco-violence in the flesh. Now they're trying to convince neighbors and friends with disappeared loved ones to come forward, as well.\n\nTucsonSentinel.com's original reporting and curation of border and immigration news is generously supported in part by a grant from the Ethics and Excellence in Journalism Foundation.
