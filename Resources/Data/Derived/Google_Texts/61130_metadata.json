Nearly 10 months ago, Simonton\u2019s family was praying he would wake up from a coma that was brought on by dirt biking accident.\n\nOn April 19, 2014, Megan Johnson was watching her fianc\u00e9 ride his dirt bike at the track outside of Tama.\n\n\u201cHe just took a jump the wrong way. I went to see if he was OK and he was not waking up. I knew it was bad,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nShe called Simonton's mother right away. She missed the first call.\n\n\u201cI was at the mall, and i waited a few minutes and the phone rang again. The second I answered she was crying, and I knew,\u201d Kathy Simonton said.\n\nSimonton was life-lighted to Methodist Medical Center with a severe brain injury. After spending almost a month in a coma, his family\u2019s prayers were answered. Simonton woke up and began his recovery at On With Life, a brain rehabilitation center in Ankeny.\n\nNow, family, friends and the motocross community are coming together to help raise money for Simonton, Johnson and their two young boys, 4-year-old Grayson and 1-year-old Cru.\n\nThey are hoping Sunday\u2019s silent and live auction will put a big dent in the family\u2019s mounting medical and household bills.\n\n\u201cI am very emotional,\u201d Johnson said the event Sunday. \u201cI didn't expect to see so many people to be here right away. It is awesome and heartwarming.\u201d\n\nSimonton\u2019s dad said that even though the worst part is over, the road to recovery is not going to be easy.\n\n\u201cHis personality has changed quite a bit. He has a long ways to go because I think \u2026 it just takes time, it takes a lot of time to heal,\u201d Ron Simonton said.\n\nIt\u2019s time that his family is willing to invest in, no matter how long it takes. They are hopeful that he will be released from rehabilitation next month.\n\nIf you would like to make a donation to the family, visit the Go Fund Me page dedicated to Simonton.
