Whoever wins the primary will face Eric Mauck of Fort Worth, the only Democrat in the race, in the general election in November.\n\nAll three Republicans have different priorities: Burgess wants to focus on improving the health care system; Beebe wants to work to fix the economy and create jobs; and Krause thinks that by limiting the influence of lobbyists, problems like the debt and health care would become easier to tackle.\n\nIf re-elected, Burgess will try to get the chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Health, a position he isn\u2019t shy about seeking. He hopes the Affordable Care Act will be repealed, then he can help set the stage for what health care policy comes next.\n\n\u201cI would like to be able to craft from a policy standpoint whatever it is that comes next,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to be able to give some relief to people who are in the individual market right now trying to buy insurance policies.\u201d\n\nBeebe said he is running partially because he believes Burgess focuses too much on health care and is critical of Burgess\u2019 actions. Instead, Beebe wants to focus on creating more jobs and improving the economy.\n\n\u201cWe need someone that knows how to grow a business and the economy, what policies can make that happen and move us forward,\u201d he said. \u201cI have that private-sector experience and know how to grow something like that while keeping on a budget. I also have a background in psychology, so I know how to work with other people.\u201d\n\nHe also wants to help grow the Republican Party and get more youth and minorities involved, and if elected, he\u2019d want to reach out to help bring in new faces and perspectives.\n\nMeanwhile, Krause said his biggest focus will be on the people instead of special interests, and getting back to the basics. He wants to make the tax code easier to understand and more fair, and help reduce the national debt.\n\n\u201cThere are several issues that are entwined with the influence of lobbyists,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a group of people called the special interest groups, and they\u2019re the ones who are winning. [Without them], we would see lower debt, better health care, and so many things would work better.\u201d\n\nBurgess is the only candidate in the race to report fundraising to the Federal Election Commission, with $712,400 raised as of Feb. 10.\n\nOne of the three will face Mauck in the general election. Mauck said he is looking forward to the next section of the campaign and would like to have debates with the Republican nominee.\n\nThe major focus of his campaign has been to restore pride in Congress, while fixing jobs and the economy. Mauck said he believes changing the tax code and changes to economic policy will help strengthen the economy.\n\n\u201cPretty much economic and health care issues are things I\u2019d really fight for,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need tax reform on individuals and corporations. I think that somebody fighting for things that could help the economy grow would give people more faith in the economy.\u201d\n\nJENNA DUNCAN can be reached at 940-566-6889 and via Twitter at @JennaFDuncan.\n\nMichael C.
