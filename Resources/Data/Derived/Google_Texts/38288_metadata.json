County leaders as to how to handle the jail\u2019s swelling population of mentally ill\u2014and pressure from a federal court to improve conditions for such inmates.\n\nLast month, federal court monitors who have been assessing the jails for years sent a letter to L.A. County outlining what they called unconstitutional conditions for mentally ill jail inmates. The court recommended, among other things, finding alternatives to incarceration for inmates who don\u2019t present a public safety threat.\n\nHow many inmates that might be is a matter of some debate. District Attorney Jackie Lacey, who\u2019s taken the masthead of the county\u2019s efforts to build alternatives, is expected to present a report to the Board of Supervisors on the topic on July 15.\n\nThe ACLU and Bazelon report gives some clues as to how many inmates might qualify\u2014and what alternatives may work.\n\nAccording to the ACLU report, about 3,200 inmates with a severe mental illness stay in an L.A. County jail on any given night\u2014that\u2019s about 17 percent of the jail population. Yet only 12 percent of the jail system\u2019s beds are devoted to the mentally ill population.\n\nThe ACLU and Bazelon Center recommend L.A. County seek alternatives, like residential community treatment, for at least a third of these inmates who they say are in the jails either awaiting trial on or on convictions for non-violent offenses.\n\n\u201cAfter drug crimes, status offenses, administrative offenses, and parole violations are the most common charges or convictions for which people with mental illness are held in L.A.\u2019s jails,\u201d the report says.\n\nThat population, the groups say, are better served, and at a lower cost to the county, in community, out-of-jail settings\u2014and they point to programs done elsewhere that may work in L.A.\n\nIn Miami, for instance, the report says, a program providing supportive housing a wraparound services to mentally ill offenders reduced recidivism from 75 percent to 20 percent. Miami has managed to pay for much of the costs of the program through federal benefits.\n\nSimilar programs of various sizes, the report says, exist in San Francisco, New York City, Orange County, and Chicago.\n\nAsked about support for such programs in L.A. County, the L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department, in a statement, said they\u2019re looking forward to Lacey\u2019s report on possible alternatives.\n\nLASD is \u201cfully supportive of alternatives to custody for all low risk inmates, including those who would be more appropriately treated in mental health settings,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cWe believe we will be benefiting with increased State funding established in the current budget to enhance those services as well as new opportunities that the Affordable Care Act provides for this population.\u201d\n\nThe full ACLU report is available here.\n\nAmong other statistics, the report mentions:", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "The ACLU of Southern California and Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law released a report Tuesday calling for alternatives to jail for mentally ill offenders.", "title": "ACLU pushing for alternatives to jail for mentally ill", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/07/01/45081/aclu-pushing-for-alternatives-to-jail-for-mentally/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/fc307dd4923f5091caa4466599c32079/31890-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 700}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
