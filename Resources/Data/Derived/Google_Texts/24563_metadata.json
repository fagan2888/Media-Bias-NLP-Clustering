John Kline (R-Minnesota) and George Miller (D-California), the highest-ranking members on the House Education and Workforce Committee, have brokered a last-minute deal to reform multi-employer pensions\u2026. They\u2019re now urging party leaders to include the plan as part of an omnibus spending bill, just before the 113th Congress is set to leave Washington for good on December 11.\u201d http://bit.ly/1rU18Xk\n\nALEC GOES LOCAL ON RIGHT-TO-WORK \u2014 The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) has a new offshoot, American City County Exchange (ACCE), and it\u2019s meeting today in Washington for a session called \"Local Right to Work: Protect my Paycheck.\" Panelists will include the Heritage Foundation\u2019s James Sherk and Andrew Kloster. Kloster recently wrote a paper outlining how cities and counties can pass their own local right-to-work ordinances (i.e., ordinances that free workers from any legal obligation to pay dues or their equivalent to labor unions that bargain collectively on their behalf).\n\nLabor lawyer Moshe Marvit, writing for the Nation, explains how that would work: \u201cThe courts have long held that when Congress passed the NLRA in 1935, it intended to create a unified national labor law. However, in the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress created a narrow exception with regard to right-to-work laws, allowing only a \u201cState or Territory\u201d to pass such laws. The essence of Sherk and Kloster\u2019s legal argument, as well as their co-panelists\u2019, is that the phrase \u201cState or Territory\u201d is ambiguous as to cities, towns and counties, making these prime targets for right-to-work ordinances.\u201d\n\nMore here: http://bit.ly/1rYgKU1\n\nILLINOIS SENATE PASSES MINIMUM WAGE LAW \u2014 The Illinois Senate last night passed legislation that would raise the state\u2019s minimum wage to $11 an hour by 2019. The bill won\u2019t have an impact on Chicago\u2019s recent decision to raise its own wage to $13, the AP says. Illinois\u2019 House speaker Michael Madigan, meanwhile, says he isn\u2019t going to call legislators back to session before Republican governor-elect Bruce Rauner takes over in January, according to the report.\n\n\u201cBut outgoing Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn \u2014 who has made raising the wage a focus in recent months \u2014 has the power to call the House back himself in an attempt to force a vote, if he wishes,\u201d the report said. http://cbsloc.al/1yhX0wQ\n\nLOW WAGE STRIKES TO MERGE WITH ERIC GARNER PROTESTS \u2014 Fast food and other low-wage workers are expected to go on strike today to press for union representation and to call for a $15 an hour minimum wage. In a sign of how the labor movement is working to forge alliances with the racial justice movement, the organizers are expressing strong support for simultaneous protests over a Staten Island grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict a New York City policeman for using a chokehold that killed Eric Garner.\n\n\"People of color can't depend on fair wages or fair justice in this country,\u201d said Working Family Party Executive Director Dan Cantor. \u201cTomorrow, protests against police violence will mingle with the fast food workers' fight for $15 and a union. The common issue is that black and brown lives still count for less in America.\u201d\n\nTOP DEMS CALL FOR TOUGH LABOR PROTECTIONS ON TPP \u2014 President Barack Obama yesterday pushed back hard against those in organized labor who oppose the Trans Pacific Partnership. Speaking at the Business Roundtable in Washington, D.C. , President Obama said \u201cthose who oppose these trade deals, ironically, are accepting a status quo that is more damaging to American workers.\u201d While Obama ramps up his campaign for TPP, top Congressional Democrats, including Representatives Rosa DeLauro (D-CT), George Miller (D-CA) and Mark Pocan (D-WI), will today release a letter calling on United States Trade Representative Michael Froman to ensure \u201creal and meaningfully enforceable labor protections.\u201d Pros can read more from POLITICO\u2019s Doug Palmer: http://politico.pro/1yhH79V\n\nGOOD MORNING and welcome to Morning Shift, POLITICO's daily tipsheet on labor and employment policy.

UPS, in which former UPS driver Peggy Young claims the delivery company discriminated against her when it denied her light duty during her pregnancy. \u201cOral argument turned into an hourlong, hypertechnical inquiry into statutory construction and, eventually, the precarious balancing of two clauses against a semicolon,\u201d writes Slate\u2019s always-delightful Dahlia Lithwick. More here: http://slate.me/11WNvdw\n\nSUFFER THE LITTLE CHILDREN \u2014 While speaking yesterday at the Business Roundtable about regulations he might eliminate, President Obama said: \u201cIf it\u2019s child labor law, I am probably going to hang out to them. We are going to keep that rule.\u201d Workplace safety advocates wasted no time pointing out the Obama Administration\u2019s hasty 2012 decision to drop, after a huge farm-state outcry, a proposed workplace safety rule protecting children who worked on farms. At the time, the Department of Labor said in a statement \u201c To be clear, this regulation will not be pursued for the duration of the Obama administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what makes his later statement about child labor laws so jarring,\u201d said Center for Progressive Reform Executive Director Matthew Shudtz. \u201cHe needs to do more than keep the laws on the books \u2014 he needs to be moving forward with new rules that address the many hazards that are currently unregulated.\"\n\nWHITE HOUSE REITERATES SUPPORT FOR WELLNESS PROGRAMS \u2014 President Obama didn\u2019t address the EEOC's legal challenges to wellness programs at yesterday's Business Roundtable talk. But White House press secretary Josh Earnest got asked about it. Earnest said the White House is concerned that the EEOC\u2019s lawsuit \"could be inconsistent with what we know about wellness programs \u2026 we know that [they] are good for both employers and employees.\" Earnest added that the Obama administration had worked closely with the business community to formulate wellness policies in the Affordable Care Act that would bring down health care costs. This past weekend, Reuters reported that U.S. CEOs were considering withdrawing their support for the ACA, based on three recent lawsuits from the EEOC alleging certain company wellness programs that penalize employees for not undergoing medical testing violate the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. In a letter to Secretaries Burwell, Lew and Perez, Business Roundtable President John Engler defended the programs, saying they educate and empower employees.\n\nWhether health wellness programs actually lower costs, however, is up for debate. In a recent post on Health Affairs Blog, the authors concluded that wellness programs increased rather than decreased employer spending on health care and added no net health benefit.\n\nTEXAS LEADS LAWSUIT FROM 17 STATES OVER IMMIGRATION: Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott filed a lawsuit in federal court yesterday on behalf of 17 states, alleging President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration violate the constitution\u2019s Take Care Clause ( Article II, Section 3: the president \u201cshall take care that the laws be faithfully executed\u201d) and the Administrative Procedure Act. This is the 31st time Abbott has sued the federal government since Obama took office, according to the AP.\n\nCOFFEE BREAK\n\n\u2014 Scott Walker: Right to Work bill a \"distraction,\" from the AP: http://bit.ly/1tPc2Yl\n\n\u2014 Franchises see job growth in November, from Entrepreneur: http://entm.ag/1zRXU5p\n\n\u2014 Labor leader cries foul over $250,000 Chicago mayoral fund, from Chicago Sun-Times: http://bit.ly/1ymm0qy\n\n\u2014 NLRB files complaint against Pennsylvania hospital, from Philadelphia Business Journal: http://bit.ly/1voCCwU\n\n\u2014 Male worker can\u2019t bring sexual harassment suit over boss\u2019 nipple squeeze, from Bloomberg BNA: http://bit.ly/11VOx9N\n\n\u2014 Dallas County minimum wage rule could be illegal, A.G. says, from the Dallas Morning News: http://bit.ly/1FPtxAh\n\n\u2014 Illinois House OKs employee retirement savings plan, from the State Journal-Register: http://bit.ly/1zS0OXN\n\nTHAT ENDS MORNING SHIFT.
