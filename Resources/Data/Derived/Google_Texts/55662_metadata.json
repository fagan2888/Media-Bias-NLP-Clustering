But on Tuesday the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office set the record straight with a blistering warning.\n\nThe CBO cautioned that America\u2019s unaffordable public programs and crushing debt will condemn us to anemic economic growth.\n\nTotal federal debt will reach $22.3 trillion by 2020. Unsustainable, says the CBO \u2014 especially when now-low interest rates return to normal.\n\nDon\u2019t count on spendaholics in Congress to take this warning seriously. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), for example, responded to the CBO by boasting about this year\u2019 s $468 billion federal deficit \u2014 the smallest since Obama took office \u2014 and smirking at \u201cRepublican rhetoric about \u2018a big government\u2019 boogeyman.\u201d\n\nSorry, senator. The CBO predicts you won\u2019t be seeing deficits that small again except in the rear-view mirror. By 2020, the deficit will nearly double, as federal spending reaches a staggering $4.8 trillion.\n\nA four-foot stack of $100 bills totals $1 million. To get to $1 billion, you need seven stacks as high as the Washington monument. To get to $4.8 trillion, you need 33,000 Washington monuments.\n\nOr an increasing number of entitlement programs. The CBO report devotes an entire chapter to the nation\u2019s newest entitlement, ObamaCare, presenting three distressing facts on the programs next five years:\n\nThe cost of subsidies on the exchanges will more than triple, from $32 billion to $106 billion in 2020.\n\nOver the same period, federal Medicaid costs (also goosed by the ObamaCare law) will double.\n\nDespite all the spending, 30 million people will still be uninsured. That\u2019s more than the number the law helps.\n\nWorst of all is this new CBO prediction: Some 9 million to 10 million people will lose their employer-provided coverage in the next three years. Some will wind up on Medicaid, others in subsidized exchange plans.\n\nTranslation: Millions who now earn their benefits will instead be collecting them as government \u201cassistance.\u201d Hardly progress. One out of every four Americans under 65 will be on health welfare.\n\nShocked at the prospect of losing your on-the-job coverage? You\u2019ve been Gruberized.\n\nJonathan Gruber, the MIT economist who called the public \u201cstupid,\u201d also falsely assured audiences that ObamaCare was designed \u201cto leave those who are happy with their employer-sponsored insurance alone.\u201d\n\nThe White House made similar statements.\n\nThe cost of subsidies on the [ObamaCare] exchanges will more than triple.\n\nSpeaking of deceptions, this week\u2019s CBO report finally puts an end to its own laughable claim that ObamaCare is paid for and repealing it would \u201cadd to the deficit.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what CBO chief Douglas Elmendorf shamelessly told Congress in 2011 and 2012. Democrats used it as ammo against presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who ran on repeal.\n\nShameless, because back then the CBO should have admitted the health law was rigged to take in revenue for four years before paying for entitlements.\n\n\u201cDeficit reduction\u201d there simply meant taxing first, and not starting to spend until later. But once the outlays begin, the law\u2019s a budget-buster, not a deficit-reducer.\n\nThis week\u2019s CBO report shows the staggering cost of ObamaCare over the next 10 years, with no pretense that it\u2019s paid for or solves the problem of the uninsured.\n\nOf course, ObamaCare is only part of the entitlement problem. Medicare is a bigger part \u2014 even though spending per Medicare beneficiary is actually declining, despite overall health-care inflation.\n\nTrouble is, enrollment is set to soar as the rest of the Baby Boom turns 65. Short of upping the eligibility age or means-testing \u2014 or a yet-undiscovered reform that somehow saves money without compromising care \u2014 Medicare spending will continue upward.\n\nOverall, the CBO report is a reality check.\n\nIn his State of the Union speech, Obama bragged about bringing down the deficit \u2014 as if it were his doing, rather than a temporary result of economic recovery \u2014 then launched into a laundry list of spending proposals, including free community college.\n\nAs if the nation could afford yet another entitlement.\n\nThe CBO report shows that entitlement reform is urgently needed.
