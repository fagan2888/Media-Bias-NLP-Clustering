Known for his directing, Moore is responsible for such documentaries as Fahrenheit 9/11, Bowling for Columbine, and Sicko. However, The Inquisitr has kept up with news on Moore over the years outside of his filmmaking accolades. Despite being left-wing, he has shown a lot of disdain for Barack Obama, in which he said the only thing people will remember about his run is that he was black. Moore also threw jabs at Obamacare, in which he generally said it was \u201cawful.\u201d\n\nNow Michael Moore is back in the hot seat again for his statements, this time on Twitter. Apparently, he took to social media to write some scathingly insensitive tweets pertaining to the Ebola panic. He also took the time to attack both the state of Texas and pro-lifers in the process.\n\nAccording to an article by Mediaite, Michael Moore took to Twitter on Thursday morning to slam conservatives for what he believes is their role in exacerbating the Ebola outbreak. Those on his finger-pointing hit list includes the NRA, Texas Governor Rick Perry, congressional Republicans, Wall Street banks, and many others.\n\nThe first Twitter rants \u2014 shown below \u2014 express Michael Moore\u2019s criticism of Texas\u2019s healthcare resources, in which he attacked the state itself through its education.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down. \u201cTEXAS HEALTH RESOURCES\u201d Resources? None. Health? Ha! Texas? Well, that pretty much explains the lack of the 1st two. \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 16, 2014\n\nTexas. The state that questions evolution in its HS textbooks. The state that wants 2 remove Jefferson from a part of its history textbooks. \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 16, 2014\n\nMichael Moore followed up by attacking Texas Governor Rick Perry before moving on to Wall Street bankers, who he blames the health agencies\u2019 budget cuts due to the economic recession of 2008.\n\nPersonally, I haven\u2019t been worried about ebola ever since TX Gov Rick Perry stood in front of the microphones reassuring us he was in charge \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 16, 2014\n\nInfectious diseases budget, facilities, prep cut after Wall St thievery killed economy. Now it helps kill lives. Still not 1 banker jailed. \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 16, 2014\n\nAs stated earlier in this article, these are Michael Moore\u2019s more civil tweets on social media. However, the ones that The Blaze attached in their report were more sarcastic and insensitive. Once again, Moore is ripping apart Texas, but he also includes pro-lifers (anti-abortion) in his tweets.\n\nIf only the Liberian man w/ Ebola in Texas had told the hospital he wanted an abortion. They would have immediately gone all Pro-Life on him \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 18, 2014\n\nIf u get sick in Texas, the last person u want treating u is a person educated in a system that says Adam & Eve rode dinosaurs 6,000 yrs ago \u2014 Michael Moore (@MMFlint) October 18, 2014\n\nIt also seems as though Michael Moore threw a jab at religion too, especially Christianity and/or Judaism, with his evolution remark about Adam and Eve riding dinosaurs.\n\nWhat do you think about Michael Moore\u2019s tweets? Were they funny to you? Were they harsh?
