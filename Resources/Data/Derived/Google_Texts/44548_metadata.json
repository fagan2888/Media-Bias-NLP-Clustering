Bloomberg News\n\nMarc Andreessen is one of the most influential people in venture capital. He\u2019s also one of the top evangelists of technology and tech investing in general, using his massive Twitter megaphone to argue almost daily about the transformative powers of emerging technology trends and generally dismissing talk of a bubble.\n\nSo when he injects a note of measured caution, it\u2019s worth paying attention.\n\nIn one of his patented numbered Tweetstorms\u2013this one went from #1 to #18\u2013Andressen today joined the debate started last week by Bill Gurley, who in a Wall Street Journal interview sounded the alarm bells about excessive spending by startups.\n\nAndreessen agrees, and said that the environment of the last ten years, in which startups could easily raise money at ever-higher valuations, \u201cwill not last.\u201d\n\nHe also said this:\n\n4/When the market turns, and it will turn, we will find out who has been swimming without trunks on: many high burn rate co's will VAPORIZE. \u2014 Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) September 25, 2014\n\nAnd this:\n\n16/Eighth: When market turns, M&A mostly stops. Nobody will want to buy your cash-incinerating startup. There will be no Plan B. VAPORIZE. \u2014 Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) September 25, 2014\n\nHe ended the Tweetstorm with an ominous warning to those companies that think they are special and not subject to these forces:\n\n18/Worry. \u2014 Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) September 25, 2014\n\nIn later tweets Andreessen went on to say that his firm, Andreessen Horowitz, had pulled away from growth-stage investing, largely because hedge funds and other public-market investors have been pumping up valuations by crowding into private deals (he has been outspoken about the way these out-of-towners have come into Silicon Valley deals and in his view behaved poorly).\n\nAndreessen was careful to emphasize that these thoughts apply to the normal ebb and flow of capital and do not mean we\u2019re in a bubble. Still, you can bet that most venture capitalists will be talking about this today, and at their Monday morning board meetings.\n\nThe warnings from Andreessen, Gurley and other VCs are reminiscent of alarm bells sounded in 2008 by venture firm Sequoia Capital when it told its portfolio companies to take a hard look at expenses ahead of a prolonged downturn. The difference there was that the presentation, \u201cRIP: Good Times,\u201d was designed only for Sequoia\u2019s companies\u2013it subsequently leaked out\u2013and came during the financial crisis.\n\nSince then we\u2019ve seen Silicon Valley get back to partying, and it has grown into one fine party indeed. Andreessen\u2019s words, and Gurley\u2019s too, are a reminder to startups that all parties eventually end.\n\nWrite to Zoran Basich at zoran.basich@wsj.com.
