The physical environment is awe-inspiring. The sky casts a presence. Land rolls before the eye. There is a power here.\n\nThe Lakota people tend to be friendly and easygoing. Many display a solid sense of humor. You don\u2019t shake hands hard in Cheyenne River. That\u2019s rude. Traffic moves slowly and respectfully in Eagle Butte, South Dakota. Time passes with a stillness and quietude that vanishes \u201cout in the rest of America.\u201d\n\nIt would be a refreshing place to visit\u2014if not for the ever-present human suffering.\n\nThe homeless aren\u2019t hard to find in Eagle Butte\u2014just look around. The produce at the local grocery store is often yellowed or rotten.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d a dollar store cashier is asked.\n\n\u201cStill breathing,\u201d he says, eyes to the ground.\n\nWaiting in line, a young man in basketball shorts and an oversized T-shirt slouches. A row of fresh stitches from an unknown wound lines the back of his shaved head.\n\nOut in the country, away from Eagle Butte\u2014out in the prairie and down in the valley\u2014decorated mounds of dirt dot rural Episcopal cemeteries.\n\nThey are fresh graves.\n\n\u201cThis one was a burial I did,\u201d said the Rev. Marguerite Watson, an Episcopal priest. \u201cA 12-year-old committed suicide. He hung himself in his closet.\u201d\n\nWatson spends an astonishing amount of time burying people in Cheyenne River, where funerals last 24 hours and \u201cdeath is a reality that constantly proves itself.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not all the Berkeley, California, native deals with, of course. \u201cI have 10 congregations in an area roughly the size of the state of Connecticut,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole reservation is, in the old-fashioned Anglican language, what would be called a cure, or a parish.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do a lot of liturgy,\u201d Watson said, explaining her priestly duties. \u201cBook work and paperwork to hold me accountable to the diocese. \u2026 Prayers from the heart\u2014I was brought up saying prayers from a book, so I really tried to learn to pray from the heart, and still be theologically cognizant. \u2026 I do a lot of anointing and healing prayer. \u2026 I do some pastoral counseling. \u2026 I\u2019ve been asked to clean a house of spooks or ghosts or spirits.\u201d\n\nFolks regularly come knocking on her door asking for help, sometimes for food, sometimes for money, sometimes because they saw something, or felt something, and need spiritual comfort.\n\nShe deals with conflict, \u201canything you might find in the inner city, guns, violence.\u201d Gang activity, too.\n\nBut death takes up most of her time.\n\n\u201cThe suicide rate is off the map,\u201d Watson said. Each year, between five and six people under the age of 25 take their life, she said.\n\nFor his part, Zigmund Hollow Horn, 65, said he has attended \u201cabout 29\u201d suicide funerals, young and old, in his lifetime.\n\nWatson, who lives in Eagle Butte with her husband, Joel, also an Episcopal priest, said she has averaged 55 burials a year since coming to Cheyenne River. This is her fourth year.\n\n\u201cThere are two types of suicide on this reservation,\u201d she said. \u201cSlow and fast. Drinking and drugs and diet. Diabetes is so prevalent around here.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI would say about 70 percent of the people I bury are under the under of 50. Those under the age of 30 are accidents, drunk driving, or suicide. And those between the age of 30 and 50 are drugs and alcohol. At least two a year freeze to death.\u201d\n\nWatson said that 20 percent of the funerals she presided over the last year were for infants or stillborn children.\n\n\u201cSome families I see two and three times a year to bury a family member,\u201d she said.\n\nRampant Poverty\n\nPoverty and inequality are rampant in Cheyenne River.\n\nThe descendants of white homesteaders\u2014people who were given reservation land at little to no cost in years past through a series of federal laws called the Homestead Acts\u2014are present throughout Cheyenne River. Some of the ranchers own highly profitable farms. Others rent to out-of-state cattlemen for grazing purposes.\n\nIn Eagle Butte, if you work for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, you are afforded a modest subsidized house. Same thing if you work for the Bureau of Indian Affairs school or the Indian Health Service.\n\nOtherwise, most live in small, beat-up residences. FEMA trailers are not uncommon, oftentimes stuffed to the brim with people.\n\nKaren Ducheneaux, the daughter of Candace Ducheneaux, possesses a detailed knowledge of the poverty that exists in Cheyenne River. Over the past few years, she helped perform research for a charitably funded study called \u201cCheyenne River Voices\u201d that created a \u201cbaseline data source\u201d for the reservation, not unlike the U.S. Census.\n\n\u201cIn a lot of ways our data differs\u201d from that of the U.S. Census, Ducheneaux said. The reservation population that the study tallied, for instance, was about 30 percent higher than that of the census\u201410,564 versus 8,470.\n\nSimilarly, \u201cwhen we calculated income, it came out much, much, much lower, about half of what the United States identifies,\u201d Ducheneaux said.\n\nAccording to the \u201cCheyenne River Voices\u201d report, the median annual income for reservation families is $18,156. Meanwhile, annual family expenses are listed at a median of $14,055.\n\n\u201cThat means you only have $4,000 of disposable income [a year] to save or to take your kids to a doctor\u2019s appointment,\u201d Ducheneaux said. \u201cWe\u2019re just talking about utilities, and monthly bills, like car payments, credit card payments \u2026 that\u2019s $300 a month for our families to do all their business.\u201d\n\nOn top of it all, the infrastructure in Cheyenne River is old and failing. \u201cOur water system put a moratorium on building,\u201d Ducheneaux said. \u201cYou cannot build a new house; you cannot put a house where a water pit does not already exist. There are no empty houses. There are no houses sitting around for rent.\u201d\n\nIn Cheyenne River, about 75 percent of the tribe is currently living in poverty or hovering just above it, Ducheneaux estimates. \u201cEven people with jobs,\u201d she said, \u201cif something happens and they miss one paycheck, it just collapses.\u201d\n\nHow does that level of poverty compare to other U.S. reservations?\n\n\u201cIf you look at the numbers, particular in Rosebud and Cheyenne River, those reservations in the Dakotas are some of the most dire in Indian country,\u201d said Blythe George, a doctoral candidate studying reservation poverty at Harvard University under noted sociologist William Julius Wilson.\n\n\u201cThey are an extreme version of Native American poverty,\u201d said George, a member of Northern California\u2019s Yurok tribe. \u201cBut is it extreme to say that Native American poverty is more extreme [than poverty in the rest of the country]? Forty-five percent living in poverty is not an unusual number, and because they are rural environments, the numbers can actually be much higher.\u201d\n\nDespite the limited housing, the poor economy, the failing infrastructure, the history of abuse and rampant death, \u201cevery year, our population increases,\u201d Ducheneaux said.\n\n\u201cThis is our place,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople want to be here; they want to belong. We want to be here. But every year people have to leave the reservation because we can\u2019t live here, you can\u2019t find a house, you can\u2019t find a job.\n\n\u201cIt sucks,\u201d she said, wiping away tears.\n\nRELATED: Intergenerational Grief on Cheyenne River Indian Reservation\n\nRELATED: Boarding Schools: A Black Hole of Native American History\n\nVinnie Rotondaro (vrotondaro@ncronline.org) is national correspondent for National Catholic Reporter, where this series first appeared.

But Native American activists and scholars insist that Catholicism\u2019s past continues to affect the present. Papal bulls from the 1400s condoned the conquest of the Americas and other lands inhabited by indigenous people. The papal documents led to an international norm called the Doctrine of Discovery, which dehumanized non-Christians and legitimized their suppression by nations around the world, including by the United States. Now Native Americans say the church helped commit genocide and refuses to come to terms with it. This is Part Three of a six-part series on the legacy of the Doctrine of Discovery.
