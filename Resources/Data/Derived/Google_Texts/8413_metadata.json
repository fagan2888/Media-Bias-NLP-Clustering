Always carry it with you. Do not say anything about where you were born or how you entered the United States. Do not carry papers from another country.\n\n\u201cRemember that providing your name has risks, and that your name can be used to start a deportation process,\u201d the pamphlet says.\n\nCouncilwoman Heather Howard has been a leading advocate for working with the local immigrant population to prevent detentions and deportations, Fox News reported.\n\n\u201cThese [arrests] are really unfortunate,\u201d she said. \u201cThey cause fear and panic in the community, and they work to undermine the community\u2019s effort to improve law enforcement relations.\u201d\n\nElisa Neira, the executive director of Human Services, said the goal of the literature is to better inform illegal immigrants of their rights.\n\n\u201cWe want our residents to be educated, to have access to competent immigration attorneys and nonprofit agencies, to have their documents and records in a safe place and not to fear seeking assistance from local police, schools and other agencies, when needed,\u201d she said in a press release.\n\nAn ICE spokesman told Fox News that the town\u2019s efforts won\u2019t impede ICE\u2019s duties.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not gonna hinder our operations,\u201d Alvin Phillips said. \u201cStandard operations are still ongoing and based on priorities.\u201d\n\n\u201cICE arrests are not unfortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact to the contrary of previous reports \u2014 ICE actions are in keeping with the laws and homeland security priorities: National Security, Public Safety and Border Security.
