Republicans used a similar move early this year to send a bill repealing much of Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood to President Barack Obama, who vetoed it.\n\nThe strategy would allow Republicans who control the House and Senate to put just such a bill on the desk of a new president if their party wins the White House, without having to grind through months of budget process. To succeed, Republicans need the Senate parliamentarian to let them use rules set by a budget resolution into the next Congress.\n\n\u201cIt could be pretty powerful if it works,\u201d said John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet concluded one way or the other.\u201d\n\n\u2018Pass Muster\u2019\n\nSuch a strategy \u201cmight pass muster,\u201d said Bill Hoagland, a vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former Republican congressional aide.\n\nLegislation generally expires at the end of a Congress. Yet rules set by a budget resolution remain in force until a new one is adopted, meaning that a resolution enacted by the current Congress may allow a filibuster-free vote early next year on a new Republican president\u2019s economic agenda, Hoagland said. \u201cI think it might be an open question,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\n\u201cWhat unified us this last year on the budget was the ability to vote to defund Planned Parenthood and Obamacare with 51 votes,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cSo if we find a similar unifying theme then I think that does provide us with an opportunity and that\u2019s what we\u2019re exploring. We haven\u2019t settled on anything yet.\u201d\n\nThis Congress would first have to enact a budget resolution, something that is optional because lawmakers and the White House agreed to a two-year deal that raised spending caps last year.\n\nBipartisan Agreement\n\nInstead, Congress could skip the budget process and just move ahead with spending bills, which are a top priority of Republican leaders this year. A number of senators are urging that path because there already is a bipartisan agreement on the overall budget amount. A group of Republican conservatives, though, want to cut spending below that level.\n\nGoing forward with a budget this year has another downside for Senate Republicans, because it would require many of their vulnerable incumbents to vote on politically charged amendments.\n\nSenator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who faces a tough fight for re-election against former Democratic Senator Russ Feingold, said he and other Republicans want to see if the parliamentarian will approve the idea of using this year\u2019s budget to bypass a filibuster in the next Congress.\n\nJohnson said he also wants the ability to cancel the filibuster-proof instructions if Democrats take control of the Senate in November. Otherwise, he would rather give up on that strategy -- known as reconciliation -- and work on the spending bills.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s Intriguing\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather spend time working thoughtfully, prioritizing spending in each one of those spending bills, unless we can have reconciliation and be able to kill it if we need to,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of strategy involved there.\u201d\n\nSenator Rob Portman of Ohio, a budget director for former President George W. Bush, also said the Senate parliamentarian would have to weigh in on the scenario.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s intriguing,\u201d he said.\n\nUsing the reconciliation tool to target the president\u2019s health-care law could also help leaders win over conservatives who are balking at voting for the higher spending numbers agreed to last year.\n\nSenator Jeff Sessions of Alabama said it would be a \"bitter pill\" to do a budget that keeps the higher spending from last year\u2019s deal. But he acknowledged that he might vote for a budget if there are other sweeteners attached, like reconciliation.\n\n\u2018Bitter Pill\u2019\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not going to say I won\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other things that could sweeten the bitter pill, there\u2019s no doubt about it. There are things that could be done with reconciliation and other issues that might be positive.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, who have 54 Senate votes, can only afford to lose three in their party and still be able to pass a budget resolution, which requires a simple majority. That means every vote is critical.\n\nSenator Roy Blunt of Missouri, vice chairman of the Republican Conference, said another alternative is to try instead to overhaul the budget process.\n\nThat process \u201chas almost never worked the way it was intended to work,\u201d Blunt said. \u201cThere has to be a better pathway.\u201d\n\nEither way, Republicans are eager to look past the Obama era. On Thursday, the chairmen of the House and Senate budget committees said they won\u2019t invite Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan to testify on the administration\u2019s budget proposal due Feb. 9 -- a major snub.\n\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, a Georgia Republican, predicted in a statement that the president\u2019s budget \u201cwill double down on the same failed policies\u201d offered by Obama in the past. \u201cCongress should continue our work on building a budget that balances and that will foster a healthy economy,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Steven T.
