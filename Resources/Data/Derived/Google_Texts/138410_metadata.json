Advocates estimate that over the next decade some 500,000 such individuals will come of age in the United States.\n\nNo one can say for sure what adulthood will hold for them. To start, where will everyone live and work? A 2008 Easter Seals study found that 79 percent of young adults with autism spectrum disorders continue to reside with their parents. A solid majority of them have never looked for a job.\n\nAnd yet the life expectancy of people with autism is more or less average. Here is another truth, then, about children with autism: They can\u2019t stay at home forever.\n\nThis realization \u2014 as obvious as it is worrying \u2014 has recently stirred the beginnings of a response from researchers, architects and, not least, parents. In 2009, a pair of academics, Kim Steele and Sherry Ahrentzen, collaborated on \u201cAdvancing Full Spectrum Housing,\u201d a comprehensive design guideline for housing adults with autism.\n\nPerhaps the first development to closely follow their template is Sweetwater Spectrum, a residence for 16 adults whose abilities and disabilities span the full range of autism. The innovative $10.4 million project opened in January in the heart of California wine country, and its founding families and board hope to make Sweetwater a model for like-minded experiments across the country.\n\n\u201cYou hear about different organizations planning to do these things,\u201d said Ahrentzen, a professor in the Shimberg Center for Housing Studies at the University of Florida, in Gainesville. But \u201cit takes time to get all these different funding sources in place.\u201d\n\nSteele said: \u201cDid it become fashionable? All of a sudden there are a lot more.\u201d\n\nThe pair ran off a list of new and prospective housing projects on Cape Cod, Mass., and in the Catskills of New York, as well as Phoenix and suburban Minnesota.\n\nOne of the most promising efforts, Ahrentzen said, is Airmount Woods, in Ramsey, N.J., which will welcome tenants in November.\n\nBut it would be hard for any of these campuses to look as \u201cvisually stunning as Sweetwater on the outside,\u201d Steele said, with its 3,250-square-foot, four-bedroom, five-bathroom houses near a picturesque downtown.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to plan a pleasant day at Sweetwater. Start off the morning with 30 minutes on the elliptical trainer in the exercise room. For breakfast, how about collecting a few fresh eggs from the chicken coop to cook in the community kitchen? Sow a tray of tomato seeds in the expansive greenhouse, shoot a few baskets on the outdoor hoop. And if it\u2019s Friday, why not drop by activity night in the social hall?\n\nThese amenities are central to the enterprise, said Sweetwater\u2019s chief executive and executive director, Deirdre Sheerin, 53. The public image of living with autism is one of lethargy and social isolation, she said. Picture someone \u201csitting on a Barcalounger with a video game, eating weird foods.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, everything about Sweetwater exists to inspire a \u201clife with purpose.\u201d To start, residents have chosen to move here; they have chosen their housemates, too. Similarly, families contract for their own care, be it round-the-clock support or drop-in help. In one sense, Sheerin said, Sweetwater is a glorified landlord: each tenant signs a 12-month lease and pays rent ($650) and an association fee ($2,600) every month.\n\nAt the same time, Sweetwater\u2019s mission statement lays out some ambitious principles. Residents will be able to age in place. The community should \u201caccommodate a broad financial spectrum,\u201d subsidizing residency for a quarter of its tenants. And attendants (who are not Sweetwater employees) should be offered incentives to encourage stable, long-term care relationships.\n\nGeorge Uberti, a 28-year-old personal attendant, likes the idea of helping clients in a community that belongs to them.\n\n\u201cBut the real difference is the resources,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a pool here that\u2019s just outside. We have a library. We have a farm. Normally, a big part of supportive living is we have to manage behaviors within certain settings. We have to ride the bus.\u201d\n\nHere is what it looked like on a Saturday evening at the end of summer, when two dozen residents, families and caregivers gathered outside the rec center for a cookout.\n\nAshley Pease, 25, was giggling and hopping to the Xbox game \u201cDance Central.\u201d Her party outfit included a black bridle helmet and a stuffed elephant. John Edmonston, 25, was drinking a juice box on the floor, although this was hard to see. He had positioned a giant beanbag over his head and trunk to promote a sense of calm.\n\nThe mustering of residents was no small accomplishment in itself, Uberti said. \u201cWe tried to do one of these when we first moved in, and it did not go well. We could barely talk the residents into coming into the kitchen.\u201d Indeed, Pease\u2019s housemate, Chris Jackson, had shifted from the edge of \u201cFunkytown\u201d to the kitchen, then to the patio, before retreating across the courtyard. He had barely checked in with his mother, Patty Jackson, 54, which worried her not a bit.\n\nChris is hardly the only 22-year-old in America to ignore his mom in public. Plus, she remembered the alternative.\n\nBefore moving into Sweetwater, he spent 10 years at a residential school in Boston. Every month, his parents would make a three-day cross-country trek from their home outside San Francisco. Leaving at the end of those visits was wrenching.\n\nSweetwater is an open campus, and a host of attendants and parents are watchful all the time.\n\n\u201cNow we take him into town for ice cream,\u201d Jackson said, \u201ckiss him on the cheek and say, \u2018I\u2019ll see you next week.'\u201d Patty Jackson had prepared a bag of snacks for her son and another for Edmonston, whenever he emerged from his beanbag shelter.\n\n\u201cJohnny is gluten-free,\u201d she said. \u201cI brought some gluten-free brownies.\u201d\n\nIt was parents who founded Sweetwater, and the place has taken the shape of what Mark Jackson called \u201can extended family.\u201d Maris Buesser was interrogating her housemate\u2019s mother about the car she had parked in the lot. (\u201cDoes the Mercedes CLK have buttons on the steering wheel?\")\n\nNearby, Buesser\u2019s mother was trying to arrange a duet between her daughter, who plays flute, and another resident, Christopher Kite, who plays piano. Soon, Buesser, 23, and Kite, 28, were discussing Mercedes-Benzes.\n\nBuesser\u2019s mother, Stephanie Ozer, 57, looked on approvingly. \u201cThat may not sound like much,\u201d she said later. \u201cBut that type of interaction and back and forth? That is something I\u2019ve dreamed of.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "New housing projects aim at the 500,000 or so autistic children who will become adults in the next decade"}, "article_summary": "In 2009, a pair of academics, Kim Steele and Sherry Ahrentzen, collaborated on \u201cAdvancing Full Spectrum Housing,\u201d a comprehensive design guideline for housing adults with autism.\nA 2008 Easter Seals study found that 79 percent of young adults with autism spectrum disorders continue to reside with their parents.\nBy MICHAEL TORTORELLOThe New York TimesHere is a truth about children with autism: They grow up to become adults with autism.\nPerhaps the first development to closely follow their template is Sweetwater Spectrum, a residence for 16 adults whose abilities and disabilities span the full range of autism.\nHe had barely checked in with his mother, Patty Jackson, 54, which worried her not a bit."}
