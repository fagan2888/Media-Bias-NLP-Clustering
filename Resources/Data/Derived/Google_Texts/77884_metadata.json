Fire department personnel found a handwritten note on a closet door inside the apartment where the deceased victim was found that warned of danger, and to \"get out,\" and of the presence of hydrogen sulfide, Haas said.\n\nThe emergency responders decontaminated the building and evacuated residents. Photos on social media showed emergency workers and vehicles including a fire truck on a street that had been blocked off from traffic.\n\nNoak said residents were later cleared to return to the building.\n\nIt was unclear whether the man who died or the people injured were students, a University of Texas at Austin spokeswoman said.\n\n(Reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas; Additional reporting by Eric Beech in Washington and Eric M.
