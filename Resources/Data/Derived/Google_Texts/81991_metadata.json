Fifty years later the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was launched, and that has collected hundreds of terabytes of data that scientists have created \u201cextremely detailed and accurate maps of the far side,\u201d the space agency said.\n\nComputer technology has enabled the creation of animations of the moon\u2019s far side so accurate that you would swear you were there. Except, air.\n\nNASA has compiled video of the moon\u2019s far side before. But not like this.\n\nRELATED: First Video of the Dark Side of the Moon\n\n\u201cThis perspective shows just what the phases of the Moon would look like from the vantage point of the lunar farside,\u201d says Universe Today. \u201cYou can see the Moon going through the synodic 29.5 day period a familiar phases, albeit with an unfamiliar face.
