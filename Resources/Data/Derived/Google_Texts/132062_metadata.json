The worker at the school, which is about 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Philadelphia, has been placed on leave pending the results of an investigation, the statement said.\n\n\u201cThe treats may have been misrepresented as cookies or crackers,\u201d Faidley said in the statement released on Friday.\n\nFaidley could not be reached for comment on Saturday.\n\n\u201cOur research on the product indicates that the treat ingredients would not be harmful to people, with the exception for those individuals with specific food allergies,\u201d Faidley\u2019s statement said.\n\nOne student at the school, Gabriel Moore, told local television station WFMZ that he ate three of the treats.\n\n\"She made it look like it was a joke that they were dog treats and then she came around and said, 'No they are cookies. They are fine,'\" Gabriel told the station.\n\nDavid Moore, Gabriel\u2019s father, told WFMZ the children trusted the aide.\n\n\u201dLike what if it was rat poisoning or something,\u201d Moore told the station. \u201cSo it was kind of shocking to be honest with you.\u201d\n\n(Reporting by Dave Warner in Philadelphia, Editing by Alex Dobuzinskis and Eric Walsh)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "An aide at a rural Pennsylvania school handed out pet treats to dozens of fourth-grade students and may have told them the food was cookies or crackers, according to local media reports.", "title": "School aide fed pet treats to children in Pennsylvania: reports", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, USA, PETFOOD, SCHOOL", "sailthru.title": "School aide fed pet treats to children in Pennsylvania: reports", "keywords": "US,USA,PETFOOD,SCHOOL,Living / Lifestyle,United States,General News,Children / Youth Issues,Education,Pennsylvania,Human Interest / Brights / Odd News", "DCSext.Comments": 1, "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;USA;PETFOOD;SCHOOL;Living / Lifestyle;United States;General News;Children / Youth Issues;Education;Pennsylvania;Human Interest / Brights / Odd News", "WT.cg_n": "World", "DCSext.ContentID_domesticNews": "USKBN0EI0RK20140607", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "domesticNews", "sailthru.date": "2014-06-07T17:35:40+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "domesticNews;ford;Honda;Inspiration;everything;treasuryMarkets;Continental;Shell;Amtrak;Amtrak2;yahoo3;Adfriendly1;VerizonMap;pennsylvania;echoActivityStream;Boston;Suntrust_SmallBiz;AllianzInvestments;HSBC_US;TDAmeritrade;FedExSMB;Goldman;everythingButHugin;SprintNow;AXAinsurance;OutloudFeed;chsfood;Allianz;JPMorgan;CFA;nyse;sprintxpert2;statestreetetf;samsung;cfaglobal;merrilledge;aa48hours;accenture;PrudentialInvestments;MLGZero;fedex_neg;ubs;MLedge;BNY;Intel;BNYForesight;PFG", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "School+aide+fed+pet+treats+to+children+in+Pennsylvania%3A+reports", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKBN0EI0RK20140607", "WT.cg_s": "U.S", "description": "An aide at a rural Pennsylvania school handed out pet treats to dozens of fourth-grade students and may have told them the food was cookies or crackers, according to local media reports.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "sailthru.description": "An aide at a rural Pennsylvania school handed out pet treats to dozens of fourth-grade students and may have told them the food was cookies or crackers, according to local media reports.", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Editorial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/us/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-domesticNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "An aide at a rural Pennsylvania school handed out pet treats to dozens of fourth-grade students and may have told them the food was cookies or crackers, according to local media reports.", "title": "School aide fed pet treats to children in Pennsylvania: reports", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-petfood-school-idUSKBN0EI0RK20140607", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,USA,PETFOOD,SCHOOL,Living / Lifestyle,United States,General News,Children / Youth Issues,Education,Pennsylvania,Human Interest / Brights / Odd News", "published_time": "2014-06-07T17:35:40+0000", "modified_time": "2014-06-07T17:35:40+0000", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Sat Jun 07 17:35:40 UTC 2014", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "article_summary": "It was unclear what might have motivated the aide to hand out the pet treats to students.\nPHILADELPHIA An aide at a rural Pennsylvania school handed out pet treats to dozens of fourth-grade students and may have told them the food was cookies or crackers, according to local media reports.\nOne student at the school, Gabriel Moore, told local television station WFMZ that he ate three of the treats.\n\u201dLike what if it was rat poisoning or something,\u201d Moore told the station.\n\u201cThe treats may have been misrepresented as cookies or crackers,\u201d Faidley said in the statement released on Friday."}
