President Obama may be right when he says ObamaCare is “here to stay”.

Now that Supreme Court has upheld the Affordable Care Act’s subsidies, Judge Andrew Napolitano isn’t very optimistic about the Republicans ability to “undue” ObamaCare!

On Thursday’s show, FOX News’ Senior Judicial Analyst joined Tom to discuss what he call’s the High Court’s “inconceivable” decision and what it means for the future of President Obama’s signature domestic achievement!

Napolitano says now that the latest legal challenge has failed, he finds it hard to believe future cases will have any more luck.

He also says that even if Republicans ran Washington D.C., doctrines already in place make it extremely difficult to stop government benefits once they’ve begun.

Basically, The Judge says it may now take four generations to kill ObamaCare.
