Fees charged to airline passengers generated $31.5 billion for 59 of the world’s biggest airlines last year, so it should come as no surprise that carriers continue to add new fees to the cost of flying.

Starting Sept. 1, Las Vegas-based Allegiant Air began to charge travelers $5 to have a boarding pass printed out at domestic airports. Fliers can avoid the fee by checking in online and printing out a boarding pass at home or using the airline’s smartphone app.

Allegiant is following the lead of Florida-based Spirit Airlines, which last year doubled the fee to print out a boarding pass to $10.

Also last week, American Airlines launched a mandatory $150 fee to escort unaccompanied minors ages 12 to 14. Previously, the charge was mandatory only for children ages 5 to 11.

The move brings American’s policy in line with its merging partner US Airways.
