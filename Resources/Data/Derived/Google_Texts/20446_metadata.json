All their capital is borrowed. They\u2019re trying to sign the kind of expensive, chronically ill individuals that insurers have avoided for decades. In three weeks they face mighty competitors with a hundred times the resources.\n\nBut the 24 insurance-company startups created by the Affordable Care Act say they\u2019re ready to battle the establishment, stay in business and change health care.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is a big part of the ACA story,\u201d said John Morrison, president of the National Alliance of State Health CO-OPs. \u201cWe bring a completely different paradigm to health care finance. We\u2019re not interested in making as much money as we can. We\u2019re not interested in making profits. What we are interested in is making consumer patients healthy and saving money.\u201d\n\nMorrison and other co-op officials talked to reporters Wednesday while in Washington for a NASHCO meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe health law designed co-ops to give competition to Blue Cross, Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and other commercial insurers. Private, nonprofit co-ops emerged as a compromise after Congress balked at establishing a government-run \u201cpublic option\u201d insurer.\n\nIndividuals and small employers will be able to buy co-op policies through the ACA\u2019s online marketplaces \u2014 along with plans offered by other carriers \u2014 in the two dozen states where they do business. The marketplaces are scheduled to open Oct. 1. The original idea was to have a co-op in every state, but Congress cut startup funding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on the job less than 365 days. We stood up an insurance company in less than 365 days,\u201d said Janie Miller, CEO of Kentucky Health Cooperative. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of in the eye of the hurricane right now. But it\u2019s an exciting hurricane.\u201d\n\nPart of the excitement comes from trying to enroll members when co-ops aren\u2019t allowed to use their federal startup loans for advertising. They\u2019re trying to get the word out through community groups, clinics and hospitals.\n\n\u201cI feel pretty confident that we\u2019re going to have tens of thousands of Iowans and Nebraskans going on the marketplace, and they\u2019re going to see us,\u201d said David Lyons, CEO of CoOpportunity Health, which will sell plans in both those states. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to like what they see.\u201d\n\nCritical for co-ops is getting low hospital prices. As startups, they can\u2019t promise hospitals high patient volume in return for discounts the way competitors can. Many co-ops are \u201crenting\u201d provider networks assembled by competitors, which limits the ability to negotiate.\n\nNevertheless, co-ops\u2019 status as local nonprofits promising to cover the sickest, previously most unprofitable patients \u2014 and also to pay bills promptly \u2014is helping secure good hospital relations, officials said.\n\n\u201cPleasantly, almost across the board nationally, co-ops have been received with open arms by hospitals and doctors and providers of all kinds who welcome our influence in the market and who have given us great deals,\u201d Morrison said.\n\nBut covering people with a habit of showing up repeatedly in hospital emergency departments poses large risks.\n\n\u201cA lot of systems have loyally uninsured people who come back over and over,\u201d said Kathleen Oestreich, CEO of Meritus Health Partners, the Arizona co-op. \u201cIn exchange for network pricing concessions, we said, \u2018We\u2019ll design a product for your system, and we will work with you to\u2026 reach out to your historically uninsured.\u2019\u201d\n\nCo-ops say they\u2019ll handle the costs of the chronically ill with health-act reinsurance dollars designed to temporarily compensate plans with high expenses and by managing treatment more efficiently.\n\n\u201cOld insurance was transactions and avoiding risk. That\u2019s how you made money,\u201d said Dr. Martin Hickey, CEO of New Mexico Health Connections. Now, he said, insurers need to \u201cidentify your high risk people, intervene with them\u2026 to stabilize their lives, to get them on the right meds and keep them out of the high-cost hospitals who are purely volume- and revenue driven.\u201d\n\nCo-ops also brag that they avoid the palatial headquarters, bureaucracy, clunky computers and high CEO salaries of their rivals.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the legacy systems,\u201d said Kevin Lewis, CEO of Maine Community Health Options. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the Taj Mahals or the overhead of some of our competitors.\u201d\n\nCo-ops face skepticism from right and left. Republicans see the startup money as likely to be wasted and compare them to Solyndra, a taxpayer-backed solar-panel company that went bankrupt. Even backers of the health law believe co-ops face steep challenges.\n\nBut a July report from the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 inspector general gave a largely positive progress report. Co-ops claim they\u2019re already doing their job of adding competition.\n\n\u201cIn New Mexico I can tell you our presence drove the rates down substantially from where they were,\u201d said Hickey. \u201cWe have the white hats on right now.\u201d\n\nSaid Morrison: \u201cIf co-ops price their product right [and] get significant market share through the exchange, we will through our practices force the rest of the marketplace to change.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "They have rented offices and zero customers.
