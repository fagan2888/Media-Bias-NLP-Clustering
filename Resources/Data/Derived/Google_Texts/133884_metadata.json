About 88% of college graduates and those with some college education reported having a positive quality of life. About 85% of those without any college education reported the same.\n\nOverall, among both the college educated and those without a degree, a large majority reported having a very good quality of life. According to the Robert Morris University survey, almost 87% of Americans reported having a good or very good quality of life. Only about 9.5% described their quality of life as poor and only 1.4% called it very poor.\n\nThe survey, done for the university by Trib Total Media, asked questions of 1,006 adults nationwide. They survey did not gather information on what college they attended. The goal was to determine what the perceived value of a college degree is in terms of quality of life and financial standard of living.\n\nOne surprising result, according to a news release from Robert Morris University, was that only 59.1% of those with a college education attributed their quality of life with attaining a college degree. And only 56% credited their good or very good financial standard of living with having a college education.\n\nThose numbers, according to the university press release, are lower than what would typically be expected.\n\n\u201cOur results confirm that numerous other objective measures have proven: college graduates earn more and have a better quality of life than those without a college degree,\u201d Wendy Beckemeyer, vice president for enrollment at Robert Morris University, said in the news release.\n\n\u201cHowever, these results also show that colleges and universities must constantly demonstrate the link between what students learn and experience in college, and what they achieve in the real world.\u201d\n\nGet Free Updates!
