Originally this tax hike was billed as impacting only a small percentage of health plans, however it is now expected to impact broad swaths of the 150 million-strong employer-sponsored health care universe.\n\n\u201cThis tax does not hit \u2018Cadillac\u2019 plans,\u201d James A. Klein, president of the American Benefits Council said in a statement. \u201cIt hits ordinary plans that are expensive simply because they cover many people whose health costs are generally higher than average \u2013 women, older and disabled workers and families who experience catastrophic health events.\u201d\n\nAmong those likely to fall victim to the levy? Retirees, low- and moderate-income families, small business owners and individuals who are self-employed. Obviously, such added burdens could have severely detrimental impacts on a U.S. economy that\u2019s already struggling to regain its post-recessionary momentum.\n\nA bipartisan coalition in Washington, D.C. \u2013 dubbed \u201cFight the 40\u201d \u2013 is working to repeal the tax. Its ultimate goal? \u201cTo ensure that employer-sponsored coverage remains an effective and affordable option for working Americans and their families.\u201d\n\nIf the Cadillac Tax isn\u2019t repealed, though, maintaining such effectiveness and affordability could prove exceedingly problematic \u2026\n\nIn fact it already is. According to the coalition, employers are already cutting benefits and changing the designs of their plans in anticipation of the tax kicking kicking in beginning in 2018. Also, each year the mandate will snare more plans \u2026 from 48 percent of large employer plans in 2018 to a whopping 82 percent of them by 2023, according to a recent study.\n\n\u201cThe way it\u2019s structured \u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 is now a misnomer,\u201d one industry source told FITS. \u201cIt\u2019s more like a Ford Fiesta tax.\u201d\n\nIn other words it\u2019s going to hurt a lot more people than its supporters would have you believe \u2026\n\nWe support efforts to \u201cFight the 40.\u201d If you do too, check out the coalition\u2019s website here and follow them on Twitter here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2015/08/03/fight-the-40-looks-to-sink-cadillac-tax/", "type": "article", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/confidential-documents.jpg", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "title": "\u201cFight The 40\u201d Looks To Sink Cadillac Tax"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe way it\u2019s structured \u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 is now a misnomer,\u201d one industry source told FITS.\n\u201cThis tax does not hit \u2018Cadillac\u2019 plans,\u201d James A.
