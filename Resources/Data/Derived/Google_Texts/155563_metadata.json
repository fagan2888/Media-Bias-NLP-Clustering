Only 24 percent of Americans trust government most of the time, while 75 percent distrust government nearly all the time.\n\nThink about it. More people trusted government during the dark days of Watergate than they do now. And that is a real problem.\n\nIn the last years of his life, Chuck Colson sensed this growing distrust, this lack of confidence in government, and he sounded the alarm on this very program. In 2011, he said the following:\n\n\u201cAs Christians, we know that God established government to preserve order and do justice. This is why Paul in Romans 13 is so insistent upon obedience to the law and to governing authorities, because their authority comes from God.\n\n\u201cBut we need to remember as well that free democratic governments function only with the consent of the governed. And the governed only give their consent when they have confidence in those who are governing them. If that confidence fails, then the whole experiment we have enjoyed in America, known as ordered liberty, fails as well. The result would be chaos, the enemy of human flourishing.\u201d\n\nWhen Chuck spoke those words in 2011, the context was the government debt crisis. The crisis in confidence is far worse today. I think Chuck would agree with me on this: No system can survive when a) the people believe they are being lied to, and b) government itself is seen as playing outside the rules\u2014that is, in our case, disregarding the Constitution.\n\nThe revelations of the past week or two regarding the Affordable Care Act is a case in point. You\u2019ve probably seen video clips of MIT Professor Jonathan Gruber\u2014one of the ACA\u2019s chief architects\u2014praising the ACA\u2019s lack of transparency and claiming that American voters were too \u201cstupid\u201d to know that they were being misled. It didn\u2019t help that the House minority leader and even the President acted as if Gruber had little to do with crafting the ACA.\n\nEven more serious, I believe, is the President\u2019s determination to \u201cgo it alone\u201d regarding immigration reform. Meaning, that he will take powers unto himself to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens without the consent of Congress. It seems that he plans to announce this on television tonight.\n\nAs a recent Washington Post editorial reminded us, just three years ago, the President himself said he didn\u2019t have such powers. \u201cBelieve me,\" he said, \"the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. Not just on immigration reform. But that\u2019s \u2026 not how our system works. That\u2019s not how our democracy functions. That\u2019s not how our Constitution is written.\u201d\n\nThose are his words. Even the Washington Post, a, dare I say, left of center publication, believes the President\u2019s going it alone now sets a dangerous precedent for executive power.\n\nAs theologian and Colson confidante T. M. Moore writes in his regular ViewPoint reflections, \u201cThe temptation to use political power in unjust ways \u2026 is a very powerful temptation, indeed. When the Founders of this country crafted our form of government, they built in a series of checks and balances between the various entities of our government \u2026 so that this temptation could be minimized by lawful means. This system of checks and balances has served our country very well for more than 230 years.\u201d\n\nFolks, it\u2019s a system we need to defend. We must hold our elected officials accountable. We must make our voices heard. And above all, as Chuck told us, we must pray and live out our faith every day in the public square with confidence in God\u2019s ultimate sovereignty.\n\nReprinted with permission from BreakPoint.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "If the public's confidence in their government fails, then the whole experiment we have enjoyed in America, known as ordered liberty, fails as well.", "title": "Blank checks and balances?
