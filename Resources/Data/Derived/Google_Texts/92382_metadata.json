Even Jesus apparently cited a version of the red-sky-in-morning precept when noting that the Pharisees and Sadducees knew how to \u201cdiscern the appearance of the sky,\u201d but could not discern \u201cthe signs of the times.\u201d\n\nBut, like the Pharisees and Sadducees, today\u2019s high priests of climate change are misleading congregants from the real signs of the times, the true portending disasters.\n\nTerrorism, for instance, is at our doorstep and even inside our house. And global terrorism is a real and present danger that no confab in Paris or climate crusaderism will stop. Yet the climate change disaster story continues to be writ large by unholy denizens of doom.\n\nCertain politicians with the help of public-relations spin doctors have boiled down largely natural climate perturbations to a man-made global warming emergency. From there, it\u2019s a simple step for them to distill the climate change concoction to talking points that anyone can swallow and regurgitate: \u201c97 percent of scientists agree,\u201d \u201churricane intensity has increased,\u201d \u201cweather is becoming more extreme,\u201d \u201cdeniers are paid off.\u201d\n\nThe truth, or rather half-truth, of these talking points is another matter.\n\nUnfortunately, today, more contemporary half-baked climate sayings can be put to verse based on half-truths rather than nothing-but-the-truth.\n\nSo, since the partiers who occupied Paris and their devotees across the globe believe unequivocally that climate change is the biggest danger to the planet, a new bit of weather wonkery can be crafted. Here are a few offerings:\n\n\u2022 When there\u2019s warming at night \u2018ore the Seine, climate change is a fright all the same.\n\n\u2022 In a two-degree rise, lies our demise.\n\n\u2022 Seeing the science is \u201csettled,\u201d it\u2019s time to peddle, a foreboding without mettle.\n\n\u2022 Driving your SUV causes a rise in the sea, so turn over the key, to those better than thee.\n\n\u2022 Polar bears sweating, Las Vegas betting, politicians netting, contributions without vetting.\n\n\u2022 Scientific dissent comes only from Big Oil\u2019s cent.\n\n\u2022 A warm December is climate change to remember, a cold July is a denier\u2019s lie.\n\nAlthough not stated so eloquently, such precious prose was in full flower during the Paris climate confab, resulting in the usual dire predictions and assurances of arctic ice melting, seas rising, and increased hurricanes and other extreme weather events.\n\nThe Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac has always relied on proverbial thinking for their forecasts \u2014 old wives tales that 97 percent of people agree must be true. This year, their projections include snow and cold for the Northeast during the week of Christmas. Instead, Washington D.C. and much of the Northeast are experiencing Christmas temperatures in the 50s and 60s. Hmm, maybe there is something to the environmentalists\u2019 precognition. Or perhaps they have just as much prescient luck as the old almanac, and really simply encapsulate what they hope to be true. After all, they know better than the rest of us.\n\nRegardless, as the payments come due as a result of the Parisian climate agreement, an overarching overture will be: When an environmentalist is upset, claiming Mother Earth is beset, hold on to your wallet.\n\nOr, simply: Green guy in mourning, taxpayers take warning.\n\n\u2022 Anthony J.
