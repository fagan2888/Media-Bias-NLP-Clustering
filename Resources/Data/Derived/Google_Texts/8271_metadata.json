But due to the weed innuendos, the commercial has been banned by NBC and CBS \u2014 because it not-so-subtly encourages smoking weed. In the commercial, Waka sits alone on a couch, surrounded by what is seemingly weed smoke. \u201cCan\u2019t live without my Pine Brothers\u2026 Straight up,\u201d he says, holding up several bags of Pine Bros Cough Drops.\n\n\u201cSo next time you need sore throat relief\u201d \u2014 here Waka pauses, glancing down at the apparent weed smoke coming from his hand-held blunt, \u201cfor whatever reason, take your Pine Brothers.\u201d\n\nThe 28-year-old rapper is notorious for his pot use, especially when he tweeted about hiring a personal blunt roller who\u2019d be paid $50,000 a year. \u201cAll resumes must be sent on a rolling paper or blunts,\u201d he tweeted. Later, comedian and actor Seth Rogen got the job as his blunt roller.\n\nOriginally, Pine Brothers had planned to have Martha Stewart in the commercial, but decided to drop her for Waka instead. \u201cWe just like to change up our creative every year, and Waka couldn\u2019t be more different,\u201d Pine Brothers spokesman David Roach said. \u201cWe got a lot of pushback from NBC and CBS. They\u2019re in the Stone Age, because there is nothing offensive about the ad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pine, brothers, hires, rapper, waka, flocka, flame, commercial, starts, weed, controversy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Waka Flocka Flame makes an appearance in a cough drop commercial, encouraging the use of throat lozenges after smoking weed.", "title": "Waka Flocka Flame Made Cough Drops Controversial [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/pine-brothers-hires-rapper-waka-flocka-flame-commercial-starts-weed-controversy-312234", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/11/25/waka-flocka-flame.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Waka Flocka Flame makes an appearance in a cough drop commercial, encouraging the use of throat lozenges after smoking weed.", "title": "Waka Flocka Flame Made Cough Drops Controversial [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/pine-brothers-hires-rapper-waka-flocka-flame-commercial-starts-weed-controversy-312234", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/11/25/waka-flocka-flame.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/25/waka-flocka-flame.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-11-25T17:44:10-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-25T17:44:09-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Waka Flocka Flame makes an appearance in a cough drop commercial, encouraging the use of throat lozenges after smoking weed."}, "article_summary": "\u201cCan\u2019t live without my Pine Brothers\u2026 Straight up,\u201d he says, holding up several bags of Pine Bros Cough Drops.\nIn the commercial, Waka sits alone on a couch, surrounded by what is seemingly weed smoke.\nOriginally, Pine Brothers had planned to have Martha Stewart in the commercial, but decided to drop her for Waka instead.\n\u201cWe just like to change up our creative every year, and Waka couldn\u2019t be more different,\u201d Pine Brothers spokesman David Roach said.\nBut due to the weed innuendos, the commercial has been banned by NBC and CBS \u2014 because it not-so-subtly encourages smoking weed."}
