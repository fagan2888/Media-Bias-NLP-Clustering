In order to avoid injuries, everyone must learn at their own pace.\n\n\"Certainly when someone pushes body and mind farther there is going to be some discomfort,\" she said, speaking to Reuters. \"But a lot of people make the mistake of running as fast as they can and they get hurt.\"\n\nOther experts agree, adding that the true benefits of running can only be accessed once the right technique has been perfected. \"It's actually one of the hardest goals, and more immediately important than mileage and calories,\" Davin Siik, a running coach for Equinox, explained. \"People fall out of the habit, often afraid that it's too difficult or too hard on their body.\"\n\nTogether, Allen and Siik recommend that novice runners always keep in mind the following rules:\n\nWalk for the first four to six weeks. Even if your goal is to run, this will help you get in the habit.\n\nConsistency is the key to success.\n\nRecord each run in a log. This will help you track your progress and maintain commitment.\n\nRun with the \u201crunner\u2019s tilt\u201d: A slight forward tilt that shifts your weight off your hips and engages your back muscles.\n\nKeep your eyes on the horizon.\n\nRelax your shoulders, and avoid crossing your arms.\n\nBy following these steps, you will gradually establish the right technique as well as the required consistency. Soon enough, you\u2019ll hopefully begin to experience some of the countless benefits of outdoor aerobic exercise: improved immune system and lower risk of infection; reduced risk of metabolic disorders; lower levels of stress; and improved psychiatric health.\n\n\"Get good shoes, start slow, find your pace,\" Van Allen told reporters. \"It's great to have dreams but in order to get there you have to start where you are.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "running for beginners, benefits of exercise, jen van allen, david siik", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Running for beginners requires patience and commitment to a solid technique, experts caution.", "title": "What You Need To Know Before You Begin A Running Routine", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/running-beginners-benefits-exercise-require-right-technique-consistency-276386", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/14/shutterstock186646370.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Running for beginners requires patience and commitment to a solid technique, experts caution.", "title": "What You Need To Know Before You Begin A Running Routine", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/running-beginners-benefits-exercise-require-right-technique-consistency-276386", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/14/shutterstock186646370.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/14/shutterstock186646370.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-04-14T10:11:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-14T10:11:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Running for beginners requires patience and commitment to a solid technique, experts caution."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7647\"", "article_summary": "By following these steps, you will gradually establish the right technique as well as the required consistency.\nOther experts agree, adding that the true benefits of running can only be accessed once the right technique has been perfected.\nRun with the \u201crunner\u2019s tilt\u201d: A slight forward tilt that shifts your weight off your hips and engages your back muscles.\n\"Get good shoes, start slow, find your pace,\" Van Allen told reporters.\nHigher temperatures and longer days attract new runners, but novice athletes should remember to find the right outdoor rhythm before hitting strenuous routes, experts caution."}
