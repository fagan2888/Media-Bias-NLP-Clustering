With the health savings account, you need to have a high-deductible plan. Can I get that under the Affordable Care Act?\u201d\n\nThe Takeaway: HSA users can shop on Covered California, but not all plans are HSA-friendly.\n\nThe federal guidelines on HSAs say you must have a high-deductible insurance policy to complement your account. The IRS decides how high each year and for 2014, it wants the deductible to be at least $1,250 for an individual and $2,500 for a family.\n\nYou\u2019ll find plans that satisfy the IRS requirement in both the individual and small business sections of the exchange. They\u2019re typically bronze-level plans and they\u2019ll be labeled HSA-compatible at the top, where you\u2019ll also see HMO and PPO designations. Make sure you\u2019re looking there and not just at the deductible.\n\nThese plans do come with subsidies if you\u2019re eligible.\n\nThe Orders: Start window-shopping (and take note of some changes to HSAs under Obamacare).\n\nMany of the high-deductible plans that cover people with HSAs are grandfathered into the Affordable Care Act. That means they may not perfectly comply with the law but were in existence before it was passed in 2010.\n\nOnce you leave a grandfathered plan, you can\u2019t get back in, so make sure you do some thorough window-shopping before switching plans. And take note of some recent changes to HSAs. They could impact your decision.\n\nThe health reform law says you cannot use an HSA to purchase drugs without a prescription, unless it\u2019s insulin. It also upped the penalty for non-medical spending from 10 to 20 percent.\n\nAnd something the law did not change for HSAs: coverage for dependents. HSAs do not cover kids until age 26 like most plans now do. They\u2019re cut off at age 24.\n\nCheck out last week\u2019s Second Opinion: Do Student Health Center Fees Satisfy the Individual Mandate?\n\nThis article relates to: City Heights, Community, Health Care, News, Share\n\nWritten by Megan Burks Megan Burks is a reporter for Speak City Heights, a media project of Voice of San Diego, KPBS, Media Arts Center and The AjA Project.
