Mike’s Pharmacy at 1007 N. Curry St. in Carson City will close next week, according to Loreen Hautekeet of the locally-owned business.

Mike and Loreen Hautekeet have operated the business but after nearly two decades of holding out against box store competition, she said, the Affordable Care Act — also known as Obamacare — has taken a toll and closure is the result.

“This is one of the unintended consequences,” she said, noting the government’s role isn’t helping small drug stores survive.

“Our last day of business will be the 11th,” she said, which is next Wednesday. On Tuesday, the pharmacy at North Curry and West William streets will be conducting its 17th annual Turkey Roundup from 6 a.m. until 6 p.m.

The firm has collected frozen turkeys, non perishable food items, cash and credit card donations to help families in need at Thanksgiving and will again this year. The donations are distributed through area food banks.

Though Mike’s Pharmacy is closing, it’s selling the pharmacy’s files to the CVS Pharmacy drug store firm, according to Loreen Hautekeet.

Ronni Hannaman, executive director of the Carson City Chamber of Commerce, said the closure will mean the only locally-owned pharmacy left in the city will be MedCare, but Loreen Hautekeet said Mike’s was the sole such locally-owned and operated outlet because MedCare actually is a Fernley firm with a Carson City store. Hannaman said Mike’s not only was locally owned, but “has been good to this community and has lots of friends.”
