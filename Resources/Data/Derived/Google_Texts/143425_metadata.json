It is important to note that the government shutdown of 2013 was not about \u201cpaying for past debts\u201d but about paying for a brand-new entitlement called Obamacare\u2013an illiberal state intrusion of the sort that even Europe is now abandoning.\n\nIndeed, if American government is dysfunctional, it is because the policy elite are determined to resist the very principles that Fukuyama insists are essential. They want to re-introduce socialist modes of economic planning, against the lessons of recent history, and overriding the constitutional procedures that provide the only real guarantee that the will of the individual, as expressed in free elections, finds meaning in our democratic system.\n\nIt is true that Capitol Hill is divided between two opposition movements\u2013at least for now. The Democrat-held Senate came to power on the back of the anti-war movement of 2006. The Republican-controlled House owes its ethos to the Tea Party wave that resisted massive deficit spending. These two movements hold each other in check. Yet what they share in common is a skepticism of federal government power, in one form or another.\n\nIt may be that such skepticism is misplaced. The U.S. is an indispensable world power, for example, and the more restrained foreign policy favored by anti-war Democrats\u2013and some Tea Party Republicans\u2013may weaken America\u2019s ability to defend freedom at home as well as abroad.\n\nYet there is nothing inherently wrong with a system that translates the general public desire for restrained government into inaction in Washington, D.C.\n\nThat is what the system is designed to do.\n\nOddly, Fukuyama seems to presume that a government that \u201cdoes something\u201d is preferable to one that does less. One constant in both the 2013 and 1995-6 shutdowns was that the economy continued to grow through both (albeit more slowly, for other reasons, in 2013). A robust private sector that expands freedom and opportunity does not need most of what the federal government actually does.\n\nIt is faith in individuals, not faith in government, that we lack as we confront the emergence of new-old rivals. Our politics appear \u201cpolarized\u201d only on the surface.\n\nQuietly, the best ideas of either side are adopted and taken out of the arena of debate: Democrats are warming to labor and pension reforms, for example, while the GOP has become more tolerant towards homosexuality.\n\nThe problem is not our \u201cvetocracy,\u201d but our illiberal state.\n\nPhoto: Reuters", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fukuyama Gets It Wrong on American 'Vetocracy'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Fukuyama Gets It Wrong on American 'Vetocracy'", "title": "Fukuyama Gets It Wrong on American 'Vetocracy' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/06/08/Fukuyama-Reuters.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/06/08/fukuyama-gets-it-wrong-on-vetocracy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fukuyama Gets It Wrong on American 'Vetocracy'", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/06/08/Fukuyama-Reuters.png", "title": "Fukuyama Gets It Wrong on American 'Vetocracy' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Congress, Reuters, Senate,National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2014-06-08T09:21:00-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "National Security", "tag": "Senate", "categories": "National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt is a prescription Fukuyama ought to obey himself, especially when observing American politics.\nIndeed, if American government is dysfunctional, it is because the policy elite are determined to resist the very principles that Fukuyama insists are essential.\nOddly, Fukuyama seems to presume that a government that \u201cdoes something\u201d is preferable to one that does less.\nA robust private sector that expands freedom and opportunity does not need most of what the federal government actually does.\n\u201cWhen observing broad historical trends, it is important not to get carried away by short-term developments,\u201d he advises."}
