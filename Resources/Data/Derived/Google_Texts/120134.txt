President Obama got some advice about reaching out to Republicans from an unlikely source Thursday: Vice President Joseph R. Biden.

During a meeting in Switzerland with President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, Mr. Biden observed aloud to reporters that Mr. Macri was accompanied by Argentinian dissident Sergio Massa, a Peronist leader and member of the national legislature.

“I want the American press to observe something,” Mr. Biden said as the trio posed for photos. “The new president brought a member of the opposition with him. That’s what we’ve got to do at home.”

At home, Mr. Obama has yet to have a face-to-face meeting with Speaker Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who took the leadership post in October. They were together — at least, Mr. Ryan was seated behind the president — at Mr. Obama’s final State of the Union address on Jan. 12.

The newly elected Mr. Macri is former mayor of Buenos Aires and the head of Argentina’s “Let’s Change” coalition.
