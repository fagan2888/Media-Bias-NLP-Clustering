The all-time high for a December day is 79 degrees, which was set on Dec. 31, 1982.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost flirting with setting the all-time high for December,\u201d he said.\n\nBuy Photo Cousins Narali Surati, Toral Soram, Yadev Sudrati, and Precia Soram can't keep control of their laughter as they ride the Arctic Plunge Snow Tube at the ICE attraction at Opryland.

(Photo: Larry McCormack / THE TENNESSEAN)\n\nThe mild, unseasonable weather likely came up at celebrations around the region on Friday since there were mud puddles and no chance of a storybook dusting of snow.\n\nThe temperature on the 25th reached 69 degrees \u2014 making it the sixth warmest Christmas Day on record. Before this Christmas, it\u2019s only been 60 degrees or higher twice in the last 35 years: in 1982 and 1987.\n\nWarm Decembers in Tennessee correlate with El Ni\u00f1o, or warmer than usual temperatures in the Pacific Ocean that affect weather around the world, according to Jackson. Both 1982 and 1987 were strong El Nino years, he noted.\n\nThe El Ni\u00f1o pattern is \u201cholding true this year,\u201d he said.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance this weekend will break, or at least tie, another record.\n\nThe forecasted high for Sunday is 75, which is also the record from Dec. 27, 1982.\n\nThe warm weather of the last week brought heavier than usual storms that left six dead and wreaked havoc on several communities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about things that very rarely happen in December,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cThis is more of late March weather.\u201d\n\nThere is a chance of rain into the start of the work week, according to the National Weather Service. There is a 50 percent change of rain and thunderstorms on Saturday although the likelihood decreases into the night and Sunday.\n\nParts of the state continue to have flood advisories in effect although most have been lifted for Middle Tennessee. Several creeks around Nashville are still under flood warnings, according to the NWS.\n\nThese creeks should be avoided:\n\n\u2022 Mill Creek near Antioch.\n\n\u2022 Mill Creek near Nolensville.\n\n\u2022 Sevenmile Creek at Blackman Road.\n\n\u2022 Richland Creek at Belle Meade near Harding Place.\n\nWhen Dec. 26 was warmest\n\n2015: 75\n\n1875: 73\n\n1942: 72\n\n1889: 71\n\n1971: 70\n\n1904: 68\n\n2008: 66\n\n1982: 65\n\n1973: 65\n\nSource: National Weather Service\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1Os4j32", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Mark it in the diary, or memorialize it on Instagram: Nashville made weather history today.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Mark it in the diary, or memorialize it on Instagram: Nashville made weather history today.", "title": "Nashville's 140-year-old weather record?
