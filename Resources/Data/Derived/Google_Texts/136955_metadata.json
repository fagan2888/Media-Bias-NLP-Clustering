Before and during the televised dust-up between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, we caught up with supporters of both would-be nominees, who held dueling rallies outside the debate hall.\n\nHillary\u2019s supporters were largely motivated by her professionalism and confirmed status as a woman, but seemed amenable to voting for Bernie if he were the nominee. On the other hand, Bernie backers were moved by the Vermont senator\u2019s self-described revolution, and for the most part, offered only tepid support for a possible Clinton candidacy.\n\nAbout 2.50 minutes.\n\nProduced by Anthony L. Fisher and Joshua Swain.
