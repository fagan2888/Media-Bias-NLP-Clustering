We have these social mores, and he breaks all of them and he\u2019s successful. And people are wondering how he gets away with it.\u201d\n\nHand-wringing over Trump\u2019s rapid climb is now palpable among everyday Americans, growing ever more anxious over the prospect of the billionaire reaching the White House. A recent Washington Post/ ABC News poll showed that 69 percent of Americans said the idea of \u201cPresident Trump\u201d made them anxious.\n\nTrump-inspired angst is apparently sufficient that on Super Tuesday, as he was piling up victories, Google recorded a 350 percent increase in users submitting the question, \u201cHow can I move to Canada?\u201d\n\nAmanda Long, an Arlington, Virginia, massage therapist, is not among those fantasizing about escape. But she has grown accustomed in recent weeks to clients lying down on her table and bellowing, \u201cCan you believe this guy?\u201d\n\nLong allows her clients to vent for a few minutes before she tries to quiet them, if only so they can relax and she can attend to their aches.\n\n\u201cIt stresses me out to listen to it,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t give you a good massage if I\u2019m grabbing your shoulders like Donald Trump\u2019s orange face.\u201d\n\nThe assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Pearl Harbor. The rise of Joe McCarthy in the 1950s. The Cuban missile crisis. The slaying of John Kennedy. Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation. The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Americans are not unacquainted with anxious moments.\n\nWhat makes Trump distinct is that he\u2019s \u201ca demagogue who has become a vessel for peoples\u2019 anxiety and anger,\u201d said Michael Kazin, a Georgetown University history professor.\n\nJudith Schweiger Levy, a Manhattan psychologist, has noticed a recent uptick in Trump references among her patients, including a middle-aged businesswoman who blurted out this week that her sister is supporting the billionaire.\n\n\u201cShe was so upset and worried that she could have a sister \u2014 someone so close to her \u2014 who would have zero problem with Trump,\u201d Levy said. \u201cAnother patient \u2014 also a woman \u2014 all she could talk about was Trump and how he\u2019s crazy and frightening.\u201d\n\nRuminating on Trump\u2019s effect, Levy said: \u201cPart of the reason he makes people so anxious is that he has no anxiety himself. It\u2019s frightening. I\u2019m starting to feel anxious just talking about him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2016/03/AP_1603202348265975.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "A recent Washington Post/ ABC News poll showed that 69 percent of Americans said the idea of \u201cPresident Trump\u201d made them anxious.\n\u201cShe was so upset and worried that she could have a sister \u2014 someone so close to her \u2014 who would have zero problem with Trump,\u201d Levy said.\nWhat makes Trump distinct is that he\u2019s \u201ca demagogue who has become a vessel for peoples\u2019 anxiety and anger,\u201d said Michael Kazin, a Georgetown University history professor.\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you a good massage if I\u2019m grabbing your shoulders like Donald Trump\u2019s orange face.\u201dThe assassination of Abraham Lincoln.\n\u201cAnother patient \u2014 also a woman \u2014 all she could talk about was Trump and how he\u2019s crazy and frightening.\u201dRuminating on Trump\u2019s effect, Levy said: \u201cPart of the reason he makes people so anxious is that he has no anxiety himself."}
