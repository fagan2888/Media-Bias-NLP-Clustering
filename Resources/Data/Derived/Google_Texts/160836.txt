Hillary Clinton said Monday that illegal immigrants should have access to Obamacare if they have the funds to purchase it.

“If someone can afford to pay for an insurance policy off the exchanges that were set up under the Affordable Care Act, I support that,” Clinton said in an interview on CNN. “If they can afford it, they should be able to go into the marketplace and buy it.”

She drew the line at subsidizing health care for undocumented immigrants.

“It is not going to apply to people who are in need of subsidies in order to afford that, because the subsidies question has to be worked out in comprehensive immigration reform,” Clinton said.

She said that she wants “more options” for illegal immigrants to “get the health care they need” because it is the “moral thing to do for them” and it is important for American health.

Clinton was responding to remarks made by her daughter Chelsea on the campaign trail last week.

“She thinks it’s so important to extend the Affordable Care Act to people who are living and working here, regardless of immigration status, regardless of citizenship status,” Clinton’s daughter said in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Clinton has been criticized for her immigration policy, which includes allowing non-violent illegal immigrants into America, vowing not to deport illegal children or their family members, and letting illegal immigrants stay in the country if they survive the dangerous journey to America.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) questioned whether the latter stance was “moral” or “compassionate” in remarks on the Senate floor last week. Cotton also condemned Clinton for her “opportunist and irresponsible position” on allowing undocumented children to stay in America, a position that he said she has shifted in the last year in order to gain votes.
