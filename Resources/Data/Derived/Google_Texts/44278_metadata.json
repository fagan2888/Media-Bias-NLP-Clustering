She tried to get his attention, waving her arms in vain, but he missed her because he was determined not to be distracted by those running in the opposite direction.\n\n\u201cRight by her,\u201d Tim recalled last week. \u201cOf course they catch it on the TV coverage. Al Trautwig (said), \u2018Oh, he\u2019s going to catch hell for that when he gets home.\u2019 \u201c\n\nIt was that kind of single-minded focus that made DeBoom a two-time Ironman world champion \u2014 no American has won there since he repeated in 2002 \u2014 but after he retired from triathlon there was a hole in his life he had a hard time filling. Only now is he starting to come out of it.\n\n\u201cGetting there, getting much better,\u201d said DeBoom, who was inducted into the USA Triathlon Hall of Fame last weekend. \u201cThe cutting back on exercise has been tough. I truly love the feeling of being outside and working out. I\u2019ve been able to cut back the number of hours pretty easily, because my days are filled with other stuff and with my daughter. But I still feel that craving to do something (physical) a couple times a day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same as any other addiction, but people associate it with being healthy. I\u2019m trying to get to that point where I\u2019m healthy. I don\u2019t think racing Ironmans is healthy, I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAdjusting to life after his triathlon career wasn\u2019t just a matter of making do with reduced physical activity.\n\n\u201cI think for four or five years it\u2019s been a struggle to find a passion that would consume him a bit,\u201d Nicole said. \u201cYou don\u2019t just create a passion. Somehow something happens and you\u2019ve got a new passion. It\u2019s a hard process to watch someone go through.\u201d\n\nAt age 44, Tim has decided to get his degree from the University of Iowa. He left there two decades ago with one semester remaining to focus on triathlon. He\u2019s going to finish up with online classes.\n\n\u201cIt will be a nice monkey to get off my back,\u201d DeBoom said. \u201cIt was almost shame, where I didn\u2019t tell people I hadn\u2019t graduated from college. Even with everything I accomplished, I found it stupid that I left school.\u201d\n\nNow he takes a camera when he goes on long runs and bike rides. He loves to post pictures of Colorado\u2019s natural majesty on Instagram, seeing it as a photo journal he can share with the world. He has cut way back on the amount of time he spends working out \u2014 only \u201can eighth or a quarter of what I used to do,\u201d he says \u2014 and hasn\u2019t been in a swimming pool in almost three years.\n\n\u201cI never thought I would say that, because from the age of 6 to 40, the most time I had spent out of the pool was maybe two weeks,\u201d DeBoom said. \u201cI don\u2019t really miss the black line when I have trails and roads to ride and run. I\u2019m after more of an overall health. It\u2019s become more social. I used to love solo five- to seven-hour rides. Now I really can\u2019t imagine doing that without someone. You\u2019re having fun, but you\u2019re not focused on your heart rate and your watts (power output).\u201d\n\nAn Ironman consists of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a marathon run (26.2 miles). It\u2019s not that DeBoom was obsessive, but he was all in.\n\n\u201cObsessive is maybe the wrong word,\u201d Nicole said. \u201cTim never came home and talked about triathlon all day. We weren\u2019t that kind of couple. But it was this underlying rule that the workout ruled your life. Holidays weren\u2019t traditionally holidays like we knew them growing up. We went for four- or five-hour bike rides. The workout ruled.\n\n\u201cTo that extent, it was sort of obsessive. The job never ended.\u201d\n\nNicole\u2019s post-triathlon transition was easier because of the successful sportswear company she founded, Skirt Sports.\n\n\u201cFor a while I was like, \u2018Oh, great, that will happen to me too, I\u2019ll have something,\u2019 \u201d Tim said. \u201cWhat I didn\u2019t realize was how she was one of the rare and lucky ones that found something that she probably enjoys even more than racing.\u201d\n\nTim was 31 when he won his second Ironman. The following year, he was in contention for another win when he was felled by excruciating back pain late in the race, later to discover he had passed a kidney stone. He kept going back to Kona in subsequent years, competing until he was 41.\n\n\u201cOnce you have success at Kona, that\u2019s the only race that matters,\u201d DeBoom said. \u201cThat\u2019s all your sponsors care about, that anybody cares about. I could have skipped the whole season, shown up at Kona, had a good race and would have been fine. Then you have a bad race and all of a sudden that\u2019s all anybody remembers. And that\u2019s all you remember.\u201d\n\nIt was tough for Nicole to watch.\n\n\u201cHis career never rebounded to the point of winning again,\u201d Nicole said. \u201cIt was kind of a very slow decline for a good five to 10 years.\u201d\n\nRecently the DeBooms moved from north Boulder to south Boulder to put a little distance between them and the elite triathlon scene there. He still loves to work out, but he calls it exercise, not training. There is freedom in that. It\u2019s apparent in the pictures he takes.\n\nHe\u2019s not sure what comes after he gets his degree. He may become a physician\u2019s assistant or go to work for a clinic that combines sports medicine and performance training.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting Act 2,\u201d DeBoom said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for an Act 2 that will be my book, that will be my story.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tim DeBoom adjusts to new kind of life after triathlons", "title": "Tim DeBoom adjusts to new kind of life after triathlons", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/25/tim-deboom-adjusts-to-new-kind-of-life-after-triathlons/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150425__20150426_C10_SP26RUNTRIp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150425__20150426_C10_SP26RUNTRIp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-25T18:42:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T05:14:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0bf\"", "article_summary": "Nicole DeBoom was on the outward portion of the marathon that day in Kona, Hawaii, running her own race.\n\u201cOnce you have success at Kona, that\u2019s the only race that matters,\u201d DeBoom said.\nBOULDER \u2014 With 3 or 4 miles left in the 2001 Ironman World Championship, Tim DeBoom had a huge lead but was so focused on the sport\u2019s biggest prize that he ran right past his wife without noticing her.\n\u201cGetting there, getting much better,\u201d said DeBoom, who was inducted into the USA Triathlon Hall of Fame last weekend.\n\u201cFor a while I was like, \u2018Oh, great, that will happen to me too, I\u2019ll have something,\u2019 \u201d Tim said."}
