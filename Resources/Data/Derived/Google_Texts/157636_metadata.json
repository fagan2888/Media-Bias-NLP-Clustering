The temporary tattoo was applied by PetSmart employees, one of whom estimated they had spray-painted about 300 dogs within two hours of the festival\u2019s opening.\n\nThe most popular tattoo? A paw print, said Josh Gonzalez, 26, a PetSmart employee.\n\nKeith Plocharczyk, 44, escorted Abby, a husky mix, and Bella, a Chihuahua mix, to the event.\n\nHis third dog, Molly, a Newfoundland, wasn\u2019t able to attend. \u201cShe is getting old; she has bad hips,\u201d Plocharczyk said.\n\nThe event was put on by PetAid, a Denver-based nonprofit that provides veterinary care to low-income pet owners.\n\nPetAid provides a safety net of programs that benefit pets in need, by collaborating with veterinarians and community partners.\n\nLocal and national musical acts such as Nina Storey, P-Nuckle and Digg were scheduled to play on a pair of stages while attendees and their four-legged buddies strolled the grounds, checked out food trucks and beer tents, and enjoyed activities.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pooches have their day at Woof Fest in Denver", "title": "Pooches have their day at Woof Fest in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/17/pooches-have-their-day-at-woof-fest-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140817__080414WoofFest021p1.jpg", "height": 429}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140817__080414WoofFest021p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-17T18:18:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:51:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PHOTOS: Pooches have their day at Woof Fest in DenverWith them was Danger, a 5-year-old dachshund-miniature pinscher mix.\nElia Duhart, 30, and her family were visiting Denver from Colorado Springs when they heard music welling up from the downtown park.\nCivic Center park went to the dogs Sunday, with canines large and small the guests of honor at the first Woof Fest, a celebration of the four-legged.\n\u201cWe came to Denver for a family day and we heard the music and said, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 When we found out, we said we have to go,\u201d Duhart said.\nDogs got tattooed, played in a fenced-off, no-leash area, sniffed bushes and pretty much ignored the live music featured at the event."}
