The 2014 health rankings, a look at all counties across the country, have been released. The annual study shows how one’s county compares with other counties in the same state and how it compares with the state as a whole.

The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, began the study across Wisconsin, but expanded its study to the entire country in 2010. It’s now in its fifth year.

The annual study measures vital health factors which include high school graduation rates, obesity, smoking, unemployment, access to healthy foods, air and water quality, income and more. It takes statistics from every county in America. It shows how health is influenced by where people live, learn, work and play.

This year, Morrison County ranked 80th out of 87 counties in Minnesota for overall health outcomes and 75th for overall health factors. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, 84 counties participated in the survey. Morrison County ranked 80th, 80th and 78th respectively in health outcomes and 68, 78, 76 in health factors. In 2013, it ranked 82nd out of 87 counties in health outcomes and 75 in health factors.

“People think of the clinical reasons for our ranking,” said Morrison County Public Health Director Bonnie Paulsen. “Lots goes into this (study). The community needs to change. People need to look at how to change their community to become healthier. Lots more goes into health than seeing a doctor.”

Health Outcomes

Premature deaths, or the years of potential life lost for those who died before age 75, were measured between 2008-2010. There were 5,929 premature deaths per 100,000 in Morrison County and 5,126 across Minnesota.

In surveys, 17 percent of Morrison County residents said they were in poor or fair health. Across Minnesota it was 11 percent. On average during a 30-day period, people said they had 3.4 poor physical health days compared to the average 2.8 days across the state.

Morrison County residents reported 3.9 unhealthy mental health days in a 30-day period compared to an average 2.6 across Minnesota. Low birth weights came in at 6.6 percent compared to 6.5 percent in the state.

These quality of life statistics placed Morrison County 86th in the state.

Health Factors

Healthy behavior put Morrison County’s ranking at 65th among the state’s 87 counties. Twenty-one percent of adults said they smoked compared to 16 percent of adults in the state. The survey showed 28 percent of adults reported they were obese as compared to 26 percent in Minnesota.

Twenty-two percent of adults reported no leisure time physical activity. The average in Minnesota was 20 percent. This is compared to the statistics which say 41 percent of adults in Morrison County have adequate access to exercise opportunities.

Morrison County residents reported 23 percent drank excessively or participated in binge drinking. That’s compared to an average of 19 percent in Minnesota.

Thirty-seven percent of driving deaths had alcohol involvement in Morrison County as compared to Minnesota’s 32 percent. These statistics were from 2008-2012.

Morrison County ranked 74th in clinical care. Twelve percent of those surveyed said they were uninsured compared to 10 percent in the state. There were 1,749 people for each doctors/physician compared to an average of 1,116 people per doctor in Minnesota.

There were 3,358 people per dentist in Morrison County compared to an average of 1,602 per dentist in the state. Also, there were 2,583 people per mental health provider in Morrison County compared to 766 across the state.

The statistics said 82 percent of Morrison County students graduated, compared to 77 percent in the state. Sixty-one percent of adults aged 25-44 had some college, compared to an average of 73 percent in Minnesota.

The average unemployment for 2012 in Morrison County was 7.2 percent compared to 5.6 percent in the state. The percentage of Morrison County children in poverty was the same as the state’s average – 15 percent.

Violent crime was low, 79 incidences per 100,000 population from 2009-2011 as compared to 234 per 100,000 across Minnesota.

The ranking for social and economic factors put Morrison County at 68.

Morrison County’s physical environment placed the county at 40, better than 50 percent of the state. Air pollution (only by .4 percent) and long commutes were the only two factors higher than the state average. Drinking water, severe housing problems and driving to work alone all had lower percentages than the state average.

“Public Health is working on obesity through the Statewide Health Improvement Program (SHIP) and a Community Transformation grant. Both focus on chronic disease and obesity,” said Paulsen. “The county also strives to decrease underage drinking, teaching better choices for teens and educating young drivers on distracted driving.”

Paulsen said that by changing health factors, people will be able to change the mortality (incidences of death in a population) and morbidity (the incidences of illness in a population) in Morrison County.

Other programs implemented locally to improve the health of residents include the Farm to Table and Farm to School programs, reducing second-hand smoke, promoting active living and vehicle passenger safety awareness.

Paulsen said that it’s important to teach young people healthy choices to improve the health of the county. She also said the study helps her department and the community as a whole see where the county is at and what needs to be done to make improvements.
