A small plane reported missing on Sunday afternoon was found crashed about a mile west of the Telluride Regional Airport at 5:17 p.m. Sunday.

A short time later, San Miguel County Sheriff Bill Masters stated on his Twitter account that there were no survivors.

The three people who died in the crash have not been identified. The single-engine Beechcraft Bonanza crashed into the side of a cliff, according to the sheriff’s department.

“This is certainly not the outcome we were hoping for,” Masters said in a news release issued by his department. “It’s just a terrible, terrible tragedy.”

The aircraft took off from Telluride Regional Airport at 11:20 a.m. en route to Cortez, according to authorities.

Sheriff’s spokeswoman Susan Lilly said the last communication with the aircraft was from the runway on takeoff. She said weather conditions included light snowfall, 1-mile visibility and calm winds at the time of departure.

The search began at mid-afternoon after the plane was reported overdue in Cortez.

The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate beginning Monday.
