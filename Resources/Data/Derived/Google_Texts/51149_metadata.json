In the days leading up to Halloween, the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office wants you to do your research. There are more than 2800 registered sex offenders and violent crime offenders living in the county.\n\n\"I know those houses are everywhere, it's not just one specific area,\" said Macy.\n\nKAKE News is on your side with an easy way to look for offenders in your neighborhood. First, go to SedgwickCounty.org.\n\nClick on the link called 'How Do I', then find registered offenders under 'search'.\n\nFrom there you can even put in your address to find offenders within a quarter mile up to 5 miles away.\n\nIf there are offenders listed in the neighborhood, the website shows a map with pinpoint locations, pictures and exact addresses.\n\n\"We also recommend that you don't let your kids go into someone's house they don't know,\" said Lt. Lin Dehning with the sheriff's office.\n\nWhile the Kansas Department of Corrections restricts offenders from leaving their porch lights on and handing out candy, local law enforcement says it's not realistic to patrol every street on Halloween night.\n\n\"Rather than us trying to go out and deal with the registered offenders, we're trying to give the parents now a good tool that they can use to keep their kids safe from their addresses,\" said Dehning.\n\n\"We care about the safety of our kids, with the world the way it is today we need to be right there with her,\" said Macy.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Halloween is less than a week away and while kids may have costumes and candy on their minds, the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office is reminding parents to be on the lookout for sex offenders.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "Halloween is less than a week away and while kids may have costumes and candy on their minds, the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office is reminding parents to be on the lookout for sex offenders.", "title": "Halloween safety: Law enforcement urges parents to look up registered sex offenders", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Halloween-safety-Law-enforcement-urges-parents-to-look-up-registered-sex-offenders-336975581.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/327/0E6/3270E6EACDF14531AE83DA093C69B1E2", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/D86/F45/D86F4543849A46D98E8434AD14DF1FA1.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Halloween is less than a week away and while kids may have costumes and candy on their minds, the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office is reminding parents to be on the lookout for sex offenders.", "title": "Halloween safety: Law enforcement urges parents to look up registered sex offenders", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Halloween-safety-Law-enforcement-urges-parents-to-look-up-registered-sex-offenders-336975581.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/halloween75.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Halloween safety: Law enforcement urges parents to look up registered sex offenders", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Halloween safety Law enforcement urges, parents to look up registered"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc081\"", "article_summary": "There are more than 2800 registered sex offenders and violent crime offenders living in the county.\nClick on the link called 'How Do I', then find registered offenders under 'search'.\n\"Rather than us trying to go out and deal with the registered offenders, we're trying to give the parents now a good tool that they can use to keep their kids safe from their addresses,\" said Dehning.\nKAKE News is on your side with an easy way to look for offenders in your neighborhood.\nCourtesy: MGN OnlineHalloween is less than a week away and while kids may have costumes and candy on their minds, the Sedgwick County Sheriff's Office is reminding parents to be on the lookout for sex offenders."}
