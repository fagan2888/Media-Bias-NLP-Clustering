Bianco v. Globus Medical, Inc., Case No. 2:12-CV-00147-WCB (E.D. Tex., May 12, 2014) (Bryson, J., sitting by designation).\n\nPrior to Octane Fitness, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit\u2019s legal test for awarding attorneys\u2019 fees in exceptional cases under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 285 required clear and convincing evidence that the case was objectively baseless and brought in subjective bad faith. The Supreme Court rejected both the clear and convincing evidence standard and the two-prong test in Octane Fitness v. Icon Health & Fitness, finding them too restrictive. Rather, the Supreme Court held that an exceptional case is merely one that is distinguishable from others based on the substantive strength of the litigation positions taken or the unreasonableness of the litigation approach.\n\nPlaintiff Bianco sued Globus Medical, alleging, among other things, that Globus wrongly excluded him as an inventor on a family of patents related to an intervertebral fusion device. The district court rejected this claim, finding that Bianco was not a co-inventor. Globus moved for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees relating solely to Bianco\u2019s litigation of the inventorship issue. The district court denied its motion, applying the Federal Circuit\u2019s then-applicable legal test. Less than two weeks later, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Octane Fitness, and Globus moved for reconsideration under the new \u201cexceptional\u201d case test.\n\nThe district court denied Globus\u2019 motion for reconsideration, concluding that Globus waived its right to assert the new, more liberal standard because it had urged the application of the Federal Circuit\u2019s standard, notwithstanding that Octane Fitness was pending at the Supreme Court. While recognizing that a party may not be chargeable with anticipating unexpected changes in the law, the district court stated that the change in Octane Fitness was not unexpected, because the Supreme Court had long since granted certiorari to consider the Federal Circuit\u2019s exceptional case standard.\n\nAs an alternative to waiver, the district court reviewed and denied Globus\u2019 motion, even under the new Octane Fitness standard, explaining that the determination of whether a case is exceptional is a case-by-case, discretionary exercise, and that the Supreme Court explicitly stated that even under the new test, a case presenting exceptionally meritless claims or subjective bad faith might warrant a fee award. The district court retraced its previous analysis rejecting attorneys\u2019 fees based on the objectively baseless and subjective bad faith test, and concluded that Bianco\u2019s inventorship claim was not objectively baseless, despite the ultimate finding that he did not satisfy the requirements of a co-inventor. Rather, a reasonable person could believe that Bianco\u2019s position had a realistic chance of success. Indeed, the district court denied Globus\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the inventorship issue, and the jury found that Globus misappropriated Bianco\u2019s trade secrets, both of which support a finding of non-frivolity. The court further found that Bianco did not bring the inventorship claim in subjective bad faith. Subjective bad faith could not be inferred because the claim was not objectively baseless and Globus\u2019 remaining arguments that Bianco was not a co-inventor and attempted to seek inventorship rights in pending patent applications were misplaced.\n\nBeyond that, the district court found that the totality of the circumstances demonstrated that the claim was not exceptional or distinguishable from other claims with respect to the substantive strength of Bianco\u2019s litigation position. Accordingly, the district court denied attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nPractice Note: Practitioners moving for attorneys\u2019 fees may continue to argue objective baselessness and subjective bad faith, as those factors remains relevant to a finding of exceptionalness even under the Supreme Court\u2019s Octane Fitness standard.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Interpreting recent Supreme Court of the United States precedent that arguably relaxed the legal test for determining whether a case is \u201cexceptional\u201d to warrant an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas denied a request for attorneys\u2019 fees, finding that because the patentee failed to meet either of the prongs of the old, more stringent \u201cobjectively baseless\u201d and \u201csubjectively brought in bad faith\u201d test, the case did not stand out from others.
