Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on whether Scott Walker is right when he says Ted Cruz should not be considered as a 2016 presidential candidate because he\u2019s a \u201cWashington person\u201d: I\u2019ll tell you this; I agree with Governor Walker that Hilary Clinton would make a very poor president. So on that, we are on the same page. And beyond that, you know what, there\u2019s going to be plenty of time to worry about politics going forward\u2026 I like Scott Walker. I think he\u2019s done a good job standing up to unions in his state. What I think the next president should be is someone who is leading the fight for free market principals and the constitution, someone who\u2019s listening to the American people, not listening to the established politicians.\n\n\n\nWhat I think matters is, are they fighting to bring back economic growth, to restore free market principals, to bring back jobs, to bring back the constitution and are they listening to the American people? The greatest frustration people have in this country right now is that Washington politicians aren\u2019t listening.\n\n\n\nCruz On whether Chris Christie is a \u201cbonafide conservative\u201d: Well, they\u2019ll be plenty of time\u2026 I\u2019m not going to do that. I like Chris Christie, I\u2019m glad he was reelected. I think his blunt, brash style is refreshing and I think we need a lot more people in Washington who have the courage to stand up against ObamaCare, against the failed Obama economic policy and turn our country around. We are facing a fiscal and economic cliff and we need real leadership.\n\n\n\nCruz On whether he is going to run for president in 2016: My focus is on the senate. Good try.
