That\u2019s according to a new report that examines how a proposal to lift the state\u2019s minimum wage from its current $8 to $13 by 2017 would affect indicators such as hunger, obesity and psychological well-being among the state\u2019s impoverished families. Ad Policy\n\nCalifornia is one of twenty-seven states that already have a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum, which is currently stuck at $7.25 despite congressional Democrats\u2019 and Obama\u2019s efforts to raise it to $10.10 per hour. In July, the state minimum will rise to $9 and to $10 by 2016, but that\u2019s too slow and too small a hike to have any real impact on the estimated 8 million Californians living in poverty, says state Senator Mark Leno, the bill\u2019s author. And refusing to boost the minimum and then peg it to inflation, as Leno\u2019s bill would do after 2017, is especially an affront to households headed by unmarried women, which make up just 13 percent of the state\u2019s families but 39 percent of those living below the poverty line.\n\nIt\u2019s well documented that a minimum wage that hasn\u2019t kept pace with inflation is particularly bad for women. Nationally, women make up two-thirds of minimum-wage workers and are disproportionately women of color. What this latest report offers is insight into what poverty wages mean for Californians beyond their ability to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads. It points out that the infants of low-income women are more likely to be born prematurely and have low birth weight. Eventually these children are more likely to be diagnosed with developmental delay or chronic health problems such as asthma. Being poor as a child can lead to a shortened life span, even if socioeconomic status improves in adulthood. By raising the minimum wage to $13, an estimated 390 premature deaths could be avoided in the state per year, data analyzed in the report suggests.\n\nA low minimum wage forces many of these families to rely on Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, which expanded to include children as part of the Affordable Care Act. According to one study, around 2 million working families in California are enrolled in at least one public assistance program. That accounts for nearly half the state\u2019s public benefits spending. It\u2019s further proof that keeping the minimum wage low means not only hurting the health of the state\u2019s families, but also shifting the high cost of care away from employers to the public.\n\nLeno\u2019s proposal to raise the wage is in the state Senate\u2019s appropriations committee. A hearing is scheduled for today.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/minimum_wage_protester_ap_img_5-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Dani McClain", "description": "A new study says raising the minimum wage in California could save lives and improve health statewide\u2014good news for the 40 percent of poor households led by single women.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "A new study says raising the minimum wage in California could save lives and improve health statewide\u2014good news for the 40 percent of poor households led by single women.", "title": "Single Moms Take Note: California Considers Raising the Minimum Wage to $13", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/single-moms-take-note-california-considers-raising-minimum-wage-13/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/minimum_wage_protester_ap_img_5.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 975}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T07:52:01+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study says raising the minimum wage in California could save lives and improve health statewide\u2014good news for the 40 percent of poor households led by single women.", "title": "Single Moms Take Note: California Considers Raising the Minimum Wage to $13", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/single-moms-take-note-california-considers-raising-minimum-wage-13/", "image": {"height": 975, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/minimum_wage_protester_ap_img_5.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/minimum_wage_protester_ap_img_5-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "May 23rd, 2014", "sailthru.title": "Single Moms Take Note: California Considers Raising the Minimum Wage to $13", "keywords": "The Nation, Dani McClain, California, Minimum wage, single mothers, Healthcare, affordable care act, medicaid", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 111565, "sailthru.tags": "Poverty,Science and Health,Working Conditions,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "medicaid", "published_time": "2014-05-23T13:59:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T07:52:01+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/dmcclain/"}, "sailthru.description": "A new study says the change could save lives and improve health statewide\u2014good news for the 40 percent of poor households led by single women.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/minimum_wage_protester_ap_img_5-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s well documented that a minimum wage that hasn\u2019t kept pace with inflation is particularly bad for women.\nSignificantly raising California\u2019s minimum wage could save lives and and improve the health of poor women and the children they raise on their own.\nBy raising the minimum wage to $13, an estimated 390 premature deaths could be avoided in the state per year, data analyzed in the report suggests.\nIt\u2019s further proof that keeping the minimum wage low means not only hurting the health of the state\u2019s families, but also shifting the high cost of care away from employers to the public.\nA low minimum wage forces many of these families to rely on Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, which expanded to include children as part of the Affordable Care Act."}
