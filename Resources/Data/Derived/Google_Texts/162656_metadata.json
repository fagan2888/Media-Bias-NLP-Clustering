Most of the passengers were Chinese.\n\nThe debris will be analyzed at a lab staffed by 600 experts that is operated by the French defense ministry.\n\nThe luggage fragment has been sent to a police unit outside Paris that specializes in DNA tests.\n\nIf the serial number on the flaperon confirms that it is from Flight 370, then the laboratory can use sophisticated tools to try to glean more information about the causes of the crash, such as whether its shape corresponds more to a mid-air explosion or a crash into the ocean.\n\n(Reporting by Praveen Menon and Marin Pennetier; Writing by Rachel Armstrong; Editing by Jeremy Laurence and Kim Coghill)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "KUALA LUMPUR/PARIS (Reuters) - Malaysia said on Sunday that airplane debris that washe", "title": "Malaysia says Indian Ocean airplane debris is part of a Boeing 777", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/02/Malaysia-says-airplane-debris-found-Reunion-Island-part-Boeing-777", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/malaysia-airlines-crash_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/08/02/Malaysia-says-airplane-debris-found-Reunion-Island-part-Boeing-777", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/malaysia-airlines-crash_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "KUALA LUMPUR/PARIS (Reuters) - Malaysia said on Sunday that airplane debris that washe", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3a58\"", "article_summary": "KUALA LUMPUR/PARIS (Reuters) - Malaysia said on Sunday that airplane debris that washed up on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion has been identified as being from a Boeing 777, the same model as a Malaysian Airlines plane which vanished last year.\nRepresentatives from Malaysia, the United States, China, France and Boeing are due to participate in a \"verification\" of the flaperon on Wednesday.\n\"We know the flaperon has been officially identified as being part of a Boeing 777 aircraft,\" Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said in a statement.\n\"This has been verified by French authorities together with aircraft manufacturer Boeing, U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Malaysian team.\"\nThe debris will be analyzed at a lab staffed by 600 experts that is operated by the French defense ministry."}
