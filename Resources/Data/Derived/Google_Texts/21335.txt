A Clifton man was arrested in Mesa County on Tuesday night on suspicion of driving about 100 mph drunk with his infant son in the car, the county sheriff’s office said.

Authorities say he was speeding through a 35 mph zone.

Victor Reyes, 25, was arrested on suspicion of several charges, including driving carelessly, driving under the influence of alcohol, child abuse not causing injury, resisting arrest, drug possession and possession of drug paraphernalia.

A patrol deputy spotted Reyes speeding at about 9:30 p.m. in the area of E and 32 roads, the sheriff’s office said.

Deputies say they tracked Reyes’ vehicle to a home where he was arrested.

“The child was uninjured and returned to his mother’s family upon (Reyes’) arrest,” the office said.

Officials say Reyes was also linked to a previous domestic violence incident handled by police in Grand Junction.
