Colby Coash\u2019s campaign committee sent out fliers in his 2008 campaign that said, \u201cColby Coash knows that quality health care isn\u2019t a luxury just for the wealthy, it is a basic human right. Colby Coash will fight to ensure that all Nebraskans have the health care they need.\u201d He also promised to be a progressive in the Legislature.\n\nCoash is a Republican, and last week was among the 21 Nebraska lawmakers to vote against cloture, effectively killing Medicaid expansion, a key provision of Obamacare that is voluntary for states. Expanding the program would have provided insurance coverage for an estimated 54,000 Nebraskans who fall into a coverage gap.\n\nLast week marked the second time Nebraska lawmakers have attempted to get an expansion bill passed, and been stymied by a filibuster that requires supporters to get a super-majority to pass the bill.\n\nThe chairman of the state Democratic Party, Vince Powers, took to Facebook and Twitter to chide Coash, saying, \u201cBeware right-wing Republicans who campaign as progressives as Coash did.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe ended up fighting to keep 54,000 Nebraskans from health care,\u201d Powers said via email.\n\nThis year, voters need to specifically ask candidates whether they support Medicaid expansion, Powers said.\n\n\u201cCoash got elected by misleading voters,\u201d Powers said. \u201cThe moral is that voters must beware of right-wing Republicans who campaign as moderate Democrats.\u201d\n\nCoash responded saying he\u2019s dedicated his career to helping the \u201cneedy, under-privileged, and our most vulnerable citizens\u201d and introduced numerous pieces of legislation to provide more and better health care for Nebraskans. He said while he didn\u2019t support the approach taken in LB887, he\u2019ll \u201ccontinue to fight to ensure that every Nebraskan gets the health care they need.\u201d\n\n\u201cMedicaid was originally designed to help our most vulnerable citizens, most notably the blind, aged, and citizens with disabilities,\u201d he said via email. \u201cAs I noted in my floor speech, this Legislature should focus efforts on reforming our Medicaid system to extend access to critical services for people with disabilities. I don\u2019t believe expanding Medicaid to cover working age Nebraskans is more important than giving access to thousands of people with disabilities waiting for care.\u201d\n\nThis session he introduced LB505, requiring insurance coverage of autism spectrum disorders; LB705, increasing the personal needs allowance under Medicaid for the eligible aged, blind and disabled people living in an alternative living arrangement. And he said he supports LB276, which changes reimbursement provisions under the Early Intervention Act and require a Medicaid state plan amendment.\n\n\u201cMy support of these bills show that I fight for people that cannot fight for themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIn previous sessions, I have supported bills increasing access to cancer drugs, feeding tubes for infants, access to health care for cancer patients, seniors, and persons with disabilities.\u201d\n\nCoash\u2019s Democratic opponent in 2012, Kyle Michaelis, also noted in a letter to a newspaper editor that during their race, Coash\u2019s campaign literature proclaimed, \u201cUnderprivileged Nebraskans need Colby Coash fighting for them.\u201d If that were true, Michaelis said, Coash would vote to expand Medicaid.\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
