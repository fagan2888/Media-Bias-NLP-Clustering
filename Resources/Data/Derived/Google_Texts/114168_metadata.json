Mitch McConnell (R-KY) \u2014 the Senate\u2019s incoming majority leader \u2014 admitted on Monday that Republicans are banking on the Supreme Court to invalidate a key portion of the Affordable Care Act in order to completely undo the law.\n\nSpeaking at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting, McConnell conceded that the new Republican Congressional majority will be unable to significantly alter President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation. But he added that should the Supreme Court strike down the subsidies available to individuals who receive their health care coverage through the law\u2019s federally run exchange, it would constitute \u201ca major do-over of the whole thing.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Obamacare] bears the President\u2019s name, the chances of his signing a full repeal are pretty limited,\u201d he said. \u201cWho may ultimately take it down is the Supreme Court of the United States\u2026 if that were to be the case, I would assume that you could have a mulligan here, a major do-over of the whole thing, that opportunity presented to us by the Supreme Court as opposed to getting the President to sign a full repeal which is not likely to happen.\u201d Watch:\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court surprised many last month when it took up King v. Burwell, a case challenging the government\u2019s authority to provide tax credits in states that have chosen not to establish a health care marketplace and left that task to the federal government.\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case \u2014 mostly Republican operatives or conservative ideologues seeking to gut the law \u2014 are arguing that the ACA never authorized the distribution of subsidies to federally-run exchanges in order to cajole states to establish their own marketplaces. They highlight two places in Obamacare where the subsidies appear to be tied to \u201can Exchange established by the State under 1311\u201d and not the federal government. Thus, according to McConnell, this is merely a case about \u201cwhether the language of the law means what the language of the law says.\u201d\n\nYet Supreme Court precedent dictates that courts are to read federal statutes holistically and that individual provisions should not be read out of context. \u201c[A] reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation,\u201d the Court explained in 2007, as the \u201cmeaning\u2014or ambiguity\u2014of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context.\u201d\n\nThough one provision of the law, if read in isolation, does appear to suggest that only exchanges \u201cestablished by the State\u201d are permitted to provide subsidized insurance plans, another provision of the law provides that any exchange, whether state or federal, \u201cshall be\u201d deemed to be an \u201centity that is established by a State.\u201d Many other sections contradict the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion. Indeed, the law is explicit that it is intended to provide \u201cAffordable Coverage Choices for All Americans,\u201d not just for those Americans who are fortunate enough to live in the right state.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s admission also contradicts one of the central premises of the plaintiffs\u2019 legal argument. They claim that that a Court ruling in their favor would restore the true intent of the law and encourage states to establish their own exchanges. But McConnell argues that the lawsuit would actually \u201ctake\u201d the law \u201cdown.\u201d\n\nUltimately, if the Supreme Court sides with the plaintiffs, economists estimate that 7.3 million people could lose out on $36.1 billion in subsidies by 2016, leading to higher health care premiums and the dreaded \u201cdeath spiral\u201d effect. Under that scenario, the sharp premium increases will push healthy people out of the marketplace, leading to even higher premium increases and a very expensive risk pool full of sicker \u2014 and by definition more expensive \u2014 beneficiaries. The same economists explain that, if five justices decide to gut Obamacare, the resulting premium spikes will render insurance \u201cunaffordable for more than 99 percent of the families and individuals eligible for subsidies\u201d in the states with federally-run exchanges.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "McConnell claimed that he would use the Court to accomplish what Republicans have failed to achieve legislatively: undo the law.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "McConnell claimed that he would use the Court to accomplish what Republicans have failed to achieve legislatively: undo the law.", "title": "McConnell\u2019s Big Admission On The Supreme Court Obamacare Case", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/12/02/3598314/mcconnell-the-supreme-court-could-basically-repeal-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/mitch-mcconnell-e1415555429879.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "McConnell claimed that he would use the Court to accomplish what Republicans have failed to achieve legislatively: undo the law.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/mitch-mcconnell-e1415555429879-321x214.jpg", "title": "McConnell\u2019s Big Admission On The Supreme Court Obamacare Case", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/mitch-mcconnell-e1415555429879.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/mitch-mcconnell-e1415555429879.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-02T14:17:21+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a67\"", "article_summary": "Justice McConnell\u2019s Big Admission On The Supreme Court Obamacare Case CREDIT: AP Photo / Carolyn Kaster, File Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), center.\nSen.
