And even though women have historically proven to live longer lives, the number of men reaching past 100 has been increasing, too.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, the centenarian population in the U.S. has increased by 65.8 percent in the past thirty years. There were over 32,000 people ages 100 and over in 1980; in 2010, over 50,000 people lived past 100.\n\nEngland and Wales has seen a 33 percent increase of the number of people living past age 90. There are about 453,000 people living over age 90, and up to 12,320 people over the age of 100.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the females who tend to reach 100. In 2010, some 82 percent of centenarians were women. In the U.K., less than one in ten people in the 105+ age group are men. The rest are all female.\n\n\u201cWe know that women are more social than men,\u201d Gary Small, professor on aging and director of the UCLA Longevity Center, told U.S. News & World Report. \u201cIf you are social, it may reduce stress levels because you can talk about your feelings and things that stress you out\u2026 If you need a ride to the doctor or you fall, they can take you to the hospital.\u201d\n\nThe majority of centenarians live with other people rather than on their own, usually in nursing homes. And a large number of America\u2019s oldest surviving people live in cities. In 2010, 85.7 percent of people over 100 were living in urban areas.\n\n\u201cLiving in the city, you have a lot more mental stimulation and the symphony and better doctors\u2026 and more social networking,\u201d Small told U.S. News & World Report. He also mentioned better resources and access to transportation, as other reasons why city-living may be beneficial for older people.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan has the highest number of old people living than any other country \u2013 with 1,197 people over 90 for every 100,000 citizens \u2013 followed by Sweden, Italy, and France. The U.S. is 10th on the list.\n\nVarious studies have explored the possible reasons behind people living to 100 or more. Isolation, for example, can have a negative impact on one\u2019s health. The Longevity Project, a book chronicling a study of 1,500 people over eight decades, found that religious women tended to live longer, likely due to the social connection they experienced through their faiths. And those who worry to a moderate extent \u2014 everything in moderation \u2014 lived longer than those who had negative attitudes, a constant sense of dooming failure, and a tendency to be self-critical, according to Leslie R. Martin, the author of The Longevity Project.\n\nResearch has also linked walking to longevity; people who walk more and at a faster gait are more likely to live longer than those who do not walk as fast, according to a University of Pittsburgh study.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "centenarian, old age, longevity", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An increasing number of people are making it past 105, and most of them are female.", "title": "What Does It Take To Make It Past 100?
