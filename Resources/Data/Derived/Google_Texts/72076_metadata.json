Rick Scott dodging questions on MSNBC that had people talking. This week, he went viral again when a video was posted on YouTube of a woman berating the governor while he stood in line for Starbucks.\n\nThe latest video, 47 seconds long, has 1.8 million views and counting.\n\nIn both viral videos, Scott\u2019s answers didn\u2019t satisfy the person questioning him. The difference is the MSNBC hosts firmly but politely ended the interview when Scott wouldn\u2019t address their questions. The woman in the latest video \u2014 former Lake Worth city commissioner and activist Cara Jennings \u2014 yelled and cursed at him.\n\nBetween calling the governor names we can\u2019t print in the paper, Jennings\u2019 criticisms fell into two topics: Medicaid expansion and abortion rights.\n\n\u201cYou cut Medicaid so I couldn\u2019t get Obamacare,\u201d she shouted. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here.\u201d\n\nScott responded by touting the 1 million jobs that have been created in Florida since he became governor. That didn\u2019t satisfy Jennings.\n\n\u201cYou stripped women of access to public health care. Shame on you, Rick Scott! We depend on those services. Rich people like you don\u2019t know what to do. When poorer people like us need services, you cut them.\u201d\n\nBy that time the governor was headed out of the door empty-handed.\n\nMuch of the debate since then has focused on Jennings\u2019 antics and foul language directed toward the state\u2019s chief executive. Even those who agree with the substance of her complaint have criticized her approach.\n\nI posted the question on my Facebook page \u2014 Did she cross a line or did Gov. Scott deserve the berating? \u2014 and the comments were evenly divided.\n\n\u201cCivility is important \u2014 no reason to berate anyone,\u201d said Rachel Sutz Pienta of Crawfordville.\n\nJustin Snyder of West Palm Beach replied back: \u201cPeople are dying. But let\u2019s be nice to the guy doing the killing. #Nope.\u201d\n\nThere were folks who said Jennings was exercising her First Amendment right and taking a once-in-a-lifetime chance to give the governor a piece of her mind.\n\n\u201cHe lives in a bubble of money, not only ignoring what he doesn\u2019t want to hear, but absolutely taking revenge on people who disagree with him. We need more people like her!\u201d wrote former state Rep. Elaine Schwartz of Hollywood.\n\nOthers said Scott deserves respect by virtue of his office, regardless of whether one agrees with his policies. Some folks said it would have been bad form regardless of who was on the giving and receiving end.\n\n\u201cI believe in a time and a place,\u201d wrote Latanya Peterson, who lives in Fleming Island. \u201cShe was out of line, and sad to see that she was a former elected official.\u201d\n\nJennings did a Q&A with a friend for the DailyDot.com website where she talked about what happened before a bystander started recording the video.\n\nApparently things started out civilly but Jennings got upset as she began to feel Scott was deflecting her questions.\n\nLet\u2019s pause here to recap the facts.\n\nScott flip-flopped on Medicaid expansion twice. He was against it. Then he was for it. Now he is against it again. There are real implications for 567,000 uninsured Floridians who remain in the coverage gap because they make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for subsidies to purchase an insurance policy on the health care exchange.\n\nThe number of states expanding Medicaid is now at 31 plus Washington, D.C.; Florida is among 19 mostly in the South that have not. Gov. Rick Scott deserves the credit or the blame, depending on your opinion of Medicaid expansion. He is the governor and he could make it happen if he wanted to.\n\nSame for the controversial anti-abortion bill he signed into law two weeks ago.\n\nIt intends to cut state funding for Planned Parenthood that goes toward things like sexually transmitted disease testing in Jacksonville. I say it \u201cintends\u201d because there is now concern that Florida\u2019s law doesn\u2019t comply with federal standards and may be challenged.\n\nThe state law also puts new restrictions on abortion providers that could cause some doctors to stop performing these services or clinics to shut down.\n\nAgain, you can agree or disagree with the policy, but no one can argue that Scott isn\u2019t responsible for it becoming law.\n\nYou decide for yourself if you think Scott\u2019s policies are right or wrong. Same for deciding whether you think Jennings\u2019 tactics were appropriate.\n\nMy only goal is to shed light on the facts and hold the governor accountable for his actions or inactions. As you know by now, that is difficult with Scott who too often responds \u201cjobs\u201d to each and every question.\n\nI wonder what would happen if the governor just paused and gave a thoughtful, authentic answer to his questioners and critics when he has the chance.\n\ntia.mitchell@jacksonville.com,\n\n(850) 933-1321", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last month, it was viral video of Gov.
