It was very important for Donald Trump to say on national TV that he does not have a small penis.\n\nMarco Rubio earlier in the week made mention of Trump\u2019s small hands. This is a sore subject for Trump.\n\nDuring the debate, the Donald wanted to make sure everyone knows or believes he is in no way under-endowed in the manhood department.\n\n\u201cHe referred to my hands, if they\u2019re small, something else must be small,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI guarantee you there\u2019s no problem. I guarantee that.\u201d\n\nIn the coming days, look for Melania Trump to back up that assertion on the campaign trail.\n\n2. Ted Cruz blamed Detroit\u2019s problems on leftwing politics.\n\nAsked what he would do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and train people to do the jobs, Ted Cruz gave a bizarre, deflecting answer. \u201cDetroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of left-wing policy.\u201d\n\nHuh?\n\nHe went all the way back to Henry Ford and WWII.\n\n\u201cAnd then for 50 years, leftwing Democrats have pursued destructive tax policies, weak crime policies and have driven the residents out.\u201d\n\nBut what would you do to bring back jobs?\n\nCut taxes, eliminate regulation, yada yada.\n\n\n\n3. The Donald repeatedly asserted that the military will \u201cdo as I tell them\u201d even if it\u2019s illegal, a war crime and a bunch of high-ranking military people just said they will not obey illegal orders.\n\nThe Donald just kept repeating that they will do what he tells them. Because they will. They just will.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump bragged about the size of his dick 10 minutes in, and somehow things got worse as the night progressed VIDEO", "author": "Janet Allon", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Donald Trump bragged about the size of his dick 10 minutes in, and somehow things got worse as the night progressed VIDEO", "title": "The 6 most bizarre moments from the cockfight that was the latest GOP debate", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/05/the_6_most_bizarre_moments_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/donald_trump_debate7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump bragged about the size of his dick 10 minutes in, and somehow things got worse as the night progressed VIDEO", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/donald_trump_debate7.jpg", "title": "The 6 most bizarre moments from the cockfight that was the latest GOP debate", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The 6 most bizarre moments from the cockfight that was the latest GOP debate", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Donald Trump, GOP debate, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Here are a few of the more bizarre moments from the GOP debate Thursday night.\n\u201cHe referred to my hands, if they\u2019re small, something else must be small,\u201d Trump said.\nAsked what he would do to bring manufacturing jobs back to America and train people to do the jobs, Ted Cruz gave a bizarre, deflecting answer.\nIt was very important for Donald Trump to say on national TV that he does not have a small penis.\nDuring the debate, the Donald wanted to make sure everyone knows or believes he is in no way under-endowed in the manhood department."}
