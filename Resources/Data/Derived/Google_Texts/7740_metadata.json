How to work out more efficiently. How to manage money better. How to deal with the media in the modern age. In short, how to be a better pro.\n\nThose are most of the lessons being administered by Avalanche staff this week at the team\u2019s development camp to many recent draft choices. Conner Bleackley, the Avs\u2019 first-round draft pick of a couple weeks ago, was one of more than two dozen players getting to know one another in a process that stresses the off-ice aspects of pro life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit different,\u201d Bleackley said. \u201cThey keep the schedule kind of secret, but they\u2019ve got a lot of fun activities planned, it looks like, so it\u2019s exciting.\u201d\n\nThere are no on-ice activities at the camp, which runs through Friday. The Avs, like many NHL teams, feel it\u2019s important for new prospects to get a taste of what to expect if they are to successfully navigate their way to being regular NHL players. It\u2019s not all just classroom lectures, though; in the past, activities such as an outing at a bowling alley have been scheduled. Some teams give cooking classes to players so they can learn to eat better on their own rather than making trips to McDonald\u2019s every day.\n\nFor some, it is their first trips to Denver and some have rarely been to the United States. In that sense, the Avs want to give such prospects a better look at the culture of life here.\n\n\u201cHopefully, we can all be teammates one day. We know not all of us are going to play for the Avs, but it\u2019s good,\u201d Bleackley said.\n\nThe Avs will hold a rookie training camp starting Sept. 8, and most of the prospects on hand this week will take part, at that time on skates. Regular training camp will start not long after that, though a date hasn\u2019t been announced.\n\nBleackley, a native of High River, Alberta, a suburb of Calgary, will be geeked to skate with new Avs free-agent acquisition Jarome Iginla.\n\n\u201cGrowing up, he was a hero of mine,\u201d Bleackley said. \u201cIt will be surreal.\u201d\n\nIginla was in Denver on Monday with his family, looking at houses.\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avs\u2019 development camp makes young players aware of off-ice expectations", "title": "Avs\u2019 development camp makes young players aware of off-ice expectations", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/08/avs-development-camp-makes-young-players-aware-of-off-ice-expectations/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140708__conner-bleackley-avs-070814p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140708__conner-bleackley-avs-070814p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-08T15:12:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:51:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd823b\"", "article_summary": "Those are most of the lessons being administered by Avalanche staff this week at the team\u2019s development camp to many recent draft choices.\nIn that sense, the Avs want to give such prospects a better look at the culture of life here.\nWe know not all of us are going to play for the Avs, but it\u2019s good,\u201d Bleackley said.\nFor some, it is their first trips to Denver and some have rarely been to the United States.\nBleackley, a native of High River, Alberta, a suburb of Calgary, will be geeked to skate with new Avs free-agent acquisition Jarome Iginla."}
