Research indicates low-wage workers lose, on average, 12.5% of their annual income to wage theft.\n\nA recent survey by the Center for Policy Initiatives and SDSU\u2019s Department of Sociology found persuasive evidence of widespread wage theft, labor law violations and widespread discrimination in restaurants throughout San Diego.\n\nThat study found more than three-quarters of restaurant employees surveyed said they\u2019d been victims of wage theft by their employers during the past year, with a third saying it happens regularly.\n\nAn investigation by NBC7News found that, since 2010, hundreds of San Diego companies have failed to pay at least $800,000 in wages, overtime and meal breaks to employees\n\nIn over 60% of the cases where workers attempt collect back pay after winning in court, employers simply close their doors and become \u201cnon-active\u201d, or defunct, to avoid payment.\n\nThe video documents the testimony of three workers brought to the United States on false pretenses, being forced to work seven days a week without pay, mistreated and ultimately escaping with the help of good Samaritans.\n\nAfter finding jobs in the \u201clegitimate\u201d economy, they were victimized again\u2014this time by by employers who refused to pay them for all of the hours they worked. Just like those who engage in human trafficking, employers who commit wage theft target those who they will believe will be most vulnerable: immigrants, women and people of color.\n\n\u201cSilence is bliss for traffickers and abusers,\u201d said one worker, Flor. She described being locked in a factory, escaping, then going to work for an employer who disappeared before payday. \u201cThey know how to manipulate the system,\u201d she said.\n\nThe bill is being heard by the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee.\n\nSpeaker Toni Atkins, along with Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez will participate in an upcoming forum on wage theft, its effect on San Diego, and efforts to strengthen statewide laws specifically SB 588, the anti-wage theft bill.\n\nOrganized by the Center on Policy Initiatives, the event at Paul\u2019s Episcopal Cathedral (2728 Sixth Ave, San Diego) is slated for Saturday August 29th, starting at 10am. While there is no charge to attend, reservations for tickets are being accepted.\n\nPass the Lemonade\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Mashable.com:\n\nAccording to preliminary data from NASA along with information from the Japan Meteorological Administration, July 2015 was the warmest month on record since instrument temperature records began in the late 1800s.\n\nResearch using other data, such as tree rings, ice cores and coral formations in the ocean, have shown that the Earth is now the warmest it has been since at least 4,000 years ago.\n\nDon\u2019t Get Sick. Don\u2019t Be Poor.\n\nWisconsin Gov. and presidential candidate Scott Walker has released his replacement plan for Obamacare.\n\nFrom the Union-Tribune:\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker rebuked both Obamacare and the Republicans who have failed to repeal it in a speech Tuesday that was intended to recharge his campaign and attract some of the anti-establishment wave that has helped Donald Trump overshadow him and other rivals.\n\nWalker\u2019s proposal to repeal and replace President Barack Obama\u2019s health law hews to general conservative ideas for expanding health coverage with block grants to states and a simplified system of government aid to Americans to buy insurance.\n\nBut the plan is missing many key details, including specifics on how he would pay for it.\n\nLos Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik\u2019s take on the Walker plan can be summed up with its headline: Walker\u2019s healthcare plan is perfect, if you want almost no insurance at all.\n\nOne of the extra special features of Walker\u2019s plan is its generous tax credits to the not-poor. Oh, and it replaces Medicare with a voucher system.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who\u2019s also running for president, accused Walker of proposing \u201cObamacare Lite.\u201d And so the GOP health care Wars have begun, according to NewsMax.\n\nDonald Trump is a Meanie\n\nAssemblymember Rocky Chavez, who\u2019s running for US Senate in 2016, has notified the world that he doesn\u2019t agree with GOP front runner Donald Trump on immigration.\n\nFrom the Times of San Diego:\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s comments on immigrants are mean-spirited \u2014 \u201cand not characteristic of the Republican Party or our nation,\u201d said Ch\u00e1vez, who represents the 76th Assembly District including Camp Pendleton, Carlsbad, Encinitas, Oceanside and Vista.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is a world leader in many categories, and it is crucial that we solidify our state as a leader in comprehensive immigration reform; it is clear to me that the ideologies of Mr. Trump will set our nation and our state back many years and damage our society for many years to come,\u201d Ch\u00e1vez said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe Donald\u2019s plan to ship \u2018em all back will cost taxpayers $166 billion, according to an analysis in Politico.\n\nThe $166 billion price tag from POLITICO\u2019s analysis tallied up the actual price tag for Trump\u2019s plan. But those costs don\u2019t even begin to calculate the hit to the economy Trump\u2019s proposal would cause, pro-immigration experts say.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal includes a wealth of ideas meant to restrict the flow of legal immigrants into the United States \u2014 such as a \u201cpause\u201d before new green cards are issued to workers and \u201ccontrol\u201d of the number of low-skilled employees admitted to the country. That may get applause among many conservatives, but experts have long said reducing immigration would diminish the labor pool and ultimately hurt the economy.\n\nIf Only\u2026\n\n\u2026 we had a gossip columnist in San Diego.\n\nThen you would have a place to read about the local one percenter who\u2019s hired a surrogate to carry a child for his second wife.\n\nThe surrogate is one this guy\u2019s two personal assistants, which, when you think about it, is a great skill to be able to add to your resume.\n\nHe will be naming his daughter &***, which is already the name of his youngest daughter from a former marriage.\n\nThe word is &***1 is not too thrilled \u2013 about the name and about the fact that she\u2019ll be having her own daughter at the same time her sister is born.\n\nBut we don\u2019t have a gossip column.\n\nOn This Day: 1848 \u2013 The discovery of gold in California was reported by the New York Herald. 1909 \u2013 First edition of IWW Little Red Song Book published. 1964 \u2013 The first American tour by the Beatles began in San Francisco. The tour would cover 26 cities.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?
