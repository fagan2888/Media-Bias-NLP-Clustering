Specifically, the bill seeks to encourage Republicans in the state legislature to expand eligibility for Medicaid.\n\nOpponents have questioned in the past whether the federal government would keep its promise to reimburse states for most of the startup costs of expansion.\n\nHowever, this piece of legislation guarantees federal reimbursement of 100% of the cost for the first three years and ramping down to 90% after the sixth year.\n\nSenators Warner and Tim Kaine were joined by senators from several other states which have not expanded Medicaid coverage to allow lower-and-middle-income families to access Affordable Care Act coverage, including Maine, Missouri and Wisconsin.\n\nSo far, 32 states have expanded Medicaid. Nineteen states, including Virginia, have not.\n\nIt is estimated that the expansion would grant healthcare coverage to 400,000 low-income Virginians who are currently uninsured, while saving the state more than $150 million in the first three years.", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Senator Mark Warner has introduced a bill aiming at strengthening federal support for Medicaid expansion.
