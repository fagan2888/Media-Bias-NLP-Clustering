However, the survey\u2019s findings on media credibility have generated headlines.\n\nOn the whole, when asked to identify which news source they most trusted \u201cto provide accurate information,\u201d only 5 percent of those polled picked MSNBC. The liberal-leaning network fared even worse among self-identifying independents and moderates, who chose MSNBC just 4 percent and 5 percent of the time, respectively.\n\nIn contrast, Comedy Central\u2019s flagship news satire, The Daily Show, ranked higher with 8 percent.\n\nOf all the networks represented, Fox News earned the mantle of the most trusted name in news. The cable network, which has branded itself as \u201cfair and balanced,\u201d, garnered the most trust overall (25 percent), as well as the highest level of trustworthiness among both Republicans (53 percent) and independents (26 percent).\n\nSome critics, however, have dismissed these numbers as misleading. The New Republic characterized Fox News\u2019 ranking as a product of a polarized audience made up of \u201cthe Republican Party\u2019s most conservative members.\u201d As liberals have more news options, so The New Republic reasons, their trust disseminates equally among networks, while conservatives disproportionately choose Fox News.\n\nGeoffrey Lysaught, vice president of strategic communications at The Heritage Foundation, sees it differently. Too many news networks underestimate their audience, according to Lysaught. In his estimation, the success of Fox News and the failure of MSNBC should be attributed to the American people\u2019s ability to \u201cknow the difference between credible, high-quality reporting and \u2018spin\u2019 presented as news.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new poll reveals more Americans place their trust in Comedy Central\u2019s Daily Show with Jon Stewart than MSNBC.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new poll reveals more Americans place their trust in Comedy Central\u2019s Daily Show with Jon Stewart than MSNBC.", "title": "Comedy Central's Daily Show Tops MSNBC for Trustworthiness", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-06-11-MSNBCtrust-Wegmann.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1hPo0Cr"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A new poll reveals more Americans place their trust in Comedy Central\u2019s Daily Show with Jon Stewart than MSNBC.", "title": "Comedy Central's Daily Show Tops MSNBC for Trustworthiness", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-06-11-MSNBCtrust-Wegmann.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2014-06-11T16:30:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A joint survey by the Brookings Institution and Public Religion Research Institute reveals more Americans place their trust in Comedy Central\u2019s Daily Show with Jon Stewart than MSNBC.\nReleased yesterday, the survey polled more than 1,500 Americans concerning a host of topics ranging from immigration reform to the state of religion.\nIn contrast, Comedy Central\u2019s flagship news satire, The Daily Show, ranked higher with 8 percent.\nOn the whole, when asked to identify which news source they most trusted \u201cto provide accurate information,\u201d only 5 percent of those polled picked MSNBC.\nThe liberal-leaning network fared even worse among self-identifying independents and moderates, who chose MSNBC just 4 percent and 5 percent of the time, respectively."}
