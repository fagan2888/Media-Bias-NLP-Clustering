Hobby Lobby, the Affordable Care Act, and the Constitution.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the second time in three years, Chief Justice John Roberts has saved President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation, his eponymous healthcare law that seems to enjoy more legitimacy at the Supreme Court than among the American people. What is going on here? Is the George W. Bush appointee a secret liberal, or at least a jurist who \u201cgrew in office\u201d like so many before him?\n\nActually no, quite the opposite. He\u2019s the epitome of a small-c conservative, meaning that temperamentally and philosophically he works to preserve the status quo and not rock the boat. His mission isn\u2019t to foment a constitutional revolution or expound some jurisprudential theory, but to \u201ccall balls and strikes.\u201d\n\nYou can see this in his too-smooth background, checking all the right boxes and excelling at the legal craft, but never identifying as an originalist or movement conservative. (For example, he attended the conservative Federalist Society meetings but has said he was never a member.)\n\nYou can see this in his minimalism, the hyper-nuanced approach to resolving cases that frustrate those who would rather throw out unconstitutional laws and announce clear principles than tweak them and live to fight another day. (Recall last term\u2019s record unanimity that papered over severe disagreements and generated concurring opinions that were dissents in all but name.)\n\nYou can also see it in his incrementalism, striking down laws or regulations only when backed into a corner and nibbling at edge of the law before taking a larger bite. (Think of Citizens United and Shelby County, which came only after narrower rulings on campaign finance and voting rights, respectively, and warned Congress to fix the problem so the court wouldn\u2019t have to.)\n\nThis sort of judicial philosophy is really ur-conservatism, in a line of jurisprudence running from Oliver Wendell Holmes through Felix Frankfurter\u2014whom Roberts quoted in Thursday\u2019s King v. Burwell\u2014and Robert Bork. Even Justice Antonin Scalia, nobody\u2019s minimalist and King\u2019s vituperous dissenter, has made his peace with the New Deal\u2019s constitutional warping and refuses to abandon doctrines, like \u201csubstantive due process,\u201d that he himself rhetorically assails.\n\nJurists of this school bend over backwards to uphold legislation, which in recent years we\u2019ve seen not just in the 2012 Obamacare case NFIB v. Sebelius but also the 2005 medical marijuana case Gonzales v. Raich\u2014in which Scalia joined a ruling that allowed the federal government to regulate plants people grow in their own backyards for their own consumption.\n\nAnd when you merge that instinct with the modern penchant to rewrite laws to make them work better, you get King. As my colleague Roger Pilon put it, with Roberts\u2019s opinion, \u201cwe have a perverse blend of the opposing positions of the judicial restraint and activist schools that reigned a few decades ago.\u201d This is the convergence of two unholy strains of judicial agency: liberal activism and conservative pacifism.\n\nActivism, typified by the four Democratic-appointed justices, finds in the Constitution no judicially administrable limits on federal power. Pacifism, a knee-jerk reaction to the activism of the 1960s and \u201970s, argues that unelected judges shouldn\u2019t overturn the people\u2019s laws. Neither approach considers that the Constitution\u2019s structural provisions, as well as the standard canons of statutory interpretation, aren\u2019t dry exercises in political or linguistic theory, but a means to protect individual liberty against the concentrated power of popular majorities.\n\nSo, to avoid upending Obamacare\u2019s operation as he assumes Congress wanted, Chief Justice John Roberts rewrote three parts of it: turning the individual mandate into a tax, reworking the Medicaid expansion, and now finding that \u201cestablished by the state\u201d means \u201cestablished by the federal government.\u201d\n\nAs Roberts instructed at the end of his Orwellian King opinion\u2014or perhaps it was Carrollian, with words meaning whatever he says they mean\u2014\u201cin every case we must respect the role of the Legislature, and take care not to undo what it has done.\u201d Ever the good conservative, the chief justice again attempted to show judicial \u201crestraint.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lesson here for those who think that being a judicial \u201cumpire\u201d entails making hard calls rather than squinting, kicking home plate a few inches, and inevitably finding that the ball crossed the strike zone. They should insist on engaged, principled judges who defer only to the rule of law. Such nominees might be harder to confirm, but at least it would be worth the effort.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Roberts combined two unholy strains of judicial agency: liberal activism and conservative pacifism", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Roberts combined two unholy strains of judicial agency: liberal activism and conservative pacifism", "title": "Justice John Roberts's Obamacare Decision Is a Mess", "url": "http://time.com/3937366/john-roberts-obamacare/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/john-roberts.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/john-roberts.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Roberts combined two unholy strains of judicial agency: liberal activism and conservative pacifism", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Justice John Roberts's Obamacare Decision Is a Mess"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "health, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "supreme court, justice john roberts, john roberts, obamacare, affordable care act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd917b\"", "article_summary": "For the second time in three years, Chief Justice John Roberts has saved President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation, his eponymous healthcare law that seems to enjoy more legitimacy at the Supreme Court than among the American people.\nThis sort of judicial philosophy is really ur-conservatism, in a line of jurisprudence running from Oliver Wendell Holmes through Felix Frankfurter\u2014whom Roberts quoted in Thursday\u2019s King v.
