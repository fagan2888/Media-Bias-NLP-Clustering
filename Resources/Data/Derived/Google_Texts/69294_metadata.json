In January 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a scathing report that put a spotlight on what it called conditions of sexual abuse and harassment by correctional staff at the Alabama\u00eds only prison for women. State officials vehemently disagree with the federal assessment.

At the time, it cost the state $3.49 per meal. Aramark provided the meals for $2.34 each. The difference has saved Kentucky taxpayers about $51 million over the 10-year contract.\n\nBut lawmakers started asking questions about the food service after a 2009 riot at the medium-security Northpoint Training Facility when inmates started a fire that injured several inmates and officers.\n\nAn official Department of Corrections investigation concluded the food was not the primary cause for the riot. But it prompted lawmakers to ask then state Auditor Crit Luallen to investigate the state\u2019s contract with Aramark.\n\nIn 2010, the auditor\u2019s office found billing errors of more than $36,000 that benefited Aramark. The audit also could not confirm that Aramark used proper ingredients or followed food safety standards. An Aramark spokeswoman said the company fully cooperated with the audit and worked with the Department of Corrections to fix the problems.\n\nSince then, Aramark has had issues in other states. Michigan officials put Aramark on notice after finding maggots in some potatoes at a state prison. Aramark spokeswoman Karen Cutler said the company immediately disposed of the potatoes and did not serve them. She said the company has ordered a third-party auditor to visit every facility in Michigan to make sure they meet health and safety standards.\n\nState Rep. Brent Yonts, D-Greenville, was one of Aramark\u2019s biggest critics. He said he received about 30 letters a month from inmates and their families complaining about the food. But since the 2010 audit, Yonts said the complaints have stopped.\n\n\u201cThe problem has been apparently cured. I think that\u2019s because Corrections has done the job they are supposed to have done,\u201d state Rep. Brent Yonts, D-Greenville, said.\n\nAnd State Rep. John Tilley, D-Hopkinsville and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said Aramark seems to have resolved its issues.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have an issue at this point,\u201d he said.\n\nAramark\u2019s contract expires at the end of this year, and Kentucky officials have already put out a request for proposals and hope to decide on a contractor by September. Aramark spokeswoman Karen Cutler confirmed the company would be bidding again for the contract.\n\n\u201cWe have a very strong record of providing state inmates with nutritious meals while saving the Commonwealth and taxpayers millions of dollars each year,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Aramark could be getting some competition. South Dakota-based CBM Managed Services is considering bidding on the contract.\n\n\u201cWe can make this happen and provide a better service and give the state what they are really looking for,\u201d said Shane Sejnoha, CBM\u2019s vice president of operations.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
