We\u2019re happy to have you all here this week for another great program.\n\nWe kicked things off yesterday by opening the expo floor to give our attendees three full days to interact with 580 exhibitors here this week.\n\nWe\u2019ve got 300 speakers and 150 educational sessions that will pique your interest. There are 80 countries from around the world represented here.\n\nWe have retail visionaries and business leaders like Steve Joyce, Mike Ullman, Alex Gourlay, Terry Lundgren, Ken Chennault, Kevin Plank and many, many more. You won\u2019t want to miss a minute of their sessions.\n\nAnd in just a few minutes, General Colin Powell will join us to share his thoughts about leadership in an uncertain world, and the lessons learned from a lifetime of serving our country. Our own NRF Chairman, Kip Tindell, will join General Powell for a conversation that I know we are all looking forward to hearing.\n\nAnd to help everyone stay fueled up and centered, we\u2019ve added some food trucks and free yoga sessions. You might even find some warm chocolate chip cookies and Hershey kisses sprinkled around the building \u2014 so be alert!\n\nLast night we held our second annual Foundation Gala to benefit the NRF Foundation. If you couldn\u2019t join us, you missed an inspiring evening and star-studded event \u2014 think of it as the Golden Globes of Retail, but with Mindy Grossman instead of Ricky Gervais.\n\nI\u2019m proud to report we raised more than $1.6 million \u2014 in one night! Congratulations!\n\nThanks to all of you who joined us last night to celebrate the all-stars in our industry, and help pave the way for the next generation of retail rock stars.\n\nThis is my fifth time at the BIG Show, and it\u2019s far and away my favorite event of the year. The energy, enthusiasm and passion for retail all comes together at the BIG show, and it makes each January something special.\n\nIt\u2019s a great way to kick off the New Year \u2014 by celebrating retail\u2019s successes \u2026 discussing our challenges \u2026 and working together to seize the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nAnd the timing for this meeting makes sense. The month of January is named after the ancient Roman god Janus. Janus was the inspiration for January because he was the god of doorways and transitions \u2026 of beginnings and endings. His image was represented with two faces \u2014 one looking backward to the past and one looking forward into the future.\n\nThat idea captures our goal at the BIG Show. Many of us are still reflecting on 2015 \u2014 what we accomplished, what we learned. But we\u2019re also focused on the year ahead \u2014 what will 2016 bring for the industry? What will it mean for my business? And how can I make the most of it?\n\nMost of us would agree that looking back is critical for a clear-eyed appraisal of the future. Winston Churchill said, \u201cThe farther backward you can look, the further forward you can see.\u201d\n\nSo as I was getting ready for this week, I looked back at what\u2019s changed since my first BG Show. For five years now, we\u2019ve been taking that long walk together through that great corridor here into the North Hall \u2026 . And filling the entire Javits convention center with 35,000 retailers and exhibitors.\n\nEach year, we\u2019re bringing together a more diverse and representative group of retailers \u2014 discount and department stores, home goods and specialty stores, Main Street merchants, grocers, wholesalers, chain restaurants and Internet retailers \u2014 to explore the future and drive innovation.\n\nAnd we\u2019re devoting incredible human and financial resources to advance the industry ... resources that this year for the first time will climb to more than $60 million to create advocacy, communications and education programs that will keep the retail industry competitive.\n\nDid you know that in the past five years, the BIG Show and Shop.org \u2014 and more than 100 other NRF events \u2014 brought together more than a quarter of a million people?\n\nOr that the NRF Foundation has awarded more than 800 scholarships \u2014 worth more than $4.3 million \u2014 to support the next generation of retail stars?\n\nThat we published more than 60 research reports documenting the indispensable role of retailers to the economy, job creation and innovation?\n\nOr helped place 150,000 news articles mentioning NRF in publications here at home and around the world?\n\nThat we conducted more than 5,000 meetings with members of Congress on critical issues like sales tax fairness, data security and labor regulations?\n\nHad 60 million visits to NRF.com \u2014 60 million! \u2014 25,000 social media posts and more than 1 million views of our YouTube videos?\n\nOr that we\u2019ve literally taken the retail show on the road, with our \u201cRetail Across America\u201d campaign here at home, and on international trips around the world \u2026 creating new partnerships, strengthening relationships and promoting retail?\n\nThat\u2019s where we\u2019ve been the past few years. From the beginning, it was our goal to create a more robust and active and influential NRF. But as a smart man once said, \u201cA goal without a plan is just a wish.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why right here, five years ago, NRF\u2019s Board of Directors adopted a strategic plan to change the trajectory of the NRF, and of the image of the retail industry itself. And five years later, it\u2019s clear that the plan we adopted is paying big dividends.\n\nThe plan radically transformed every aspect of NRF, from the organization's mission to our branding and everything in between. It took us back to our roots, as retail advocates and the voice of the retail industry.\n\nWe made substantial investments in programs to advance NRF\u2019s advocacy, communications and education efforts and tell the true story of retail.\n\nPutting advocacy first meant building a more muscular government relations operation to lead our policy efforts. It meant creating a robust, best-in-class communications department to tell our story and promote the retail industry. And building a new research department to analyze policy issues and validate the critical role of retail in our economy.\n\nIt meant reimagining the Foundation, which with last night\u2019s successful Gala has raised nearly $3 million (in just one year!) to promote retail careers. It meant launching the Retail Job Board, which last year posted 95,000 positions and had more than 3.2 million visitors!\n\nAnd, most visibly to all of us here this week, it meant we needed to transform this show. We\u2019ve invested in attendee experiences, added a third day of exhibits and gained exclusive control of the entire convention center \u2026 like the rest of NRF, it would be unrecognizable to an attendee from just a few years ago!\n\nAll of this progress shows that we\u2019ve got a plan, it\u2019s paying dividends and we\u2019re on the right track \u2026 but as Will Rogers said, \u201cYou can be on the right track and still get run over if you\u2019re just sitting there.\u201d\n\nSo we\u2019re not just sitting here \u2026 we\u2019re putting these new programs and resources to good use to achieve our policy priorities.\n\nFor example, last summer NRF played a significant role in winning approval to pursue a trade deal that will open new markets around the globe for the retail industry. We fought tooth and nail to protect thousands of retailers from harmful provisions in the Affordable Care Act. And we won.\n\nWe helped get the latest transportation bill over the finish line. And just before Christmas, we won the extension of dozens of tax laws that are critical for retailers. One of the biggest achievements was winning a permanent extension of depreciation provisions ... which will make it easier, and more affordable, for retailers to remodel and invest in their stores.\n\nWe\u2019ve invested in robust new digital campaigns to help tell our story, and help us spread retail\u2019s message to more people than ever before.\n\nIt\u2019s been an exciting and productive few years. We accomplished a lot. And we learned a lot \u2014 lessons that will drive continued improvements in NRF programs and increase our impact.\n\nWe\u2019ve learned about the importance of storytelling through the success of \u201cThis is Retail\u201d and \u201cRetail Across America.\u201d And we plan to build on that success to provide an even more vivid picture of retail\u2019s vital contributions to our economy.\n\nWe\u2019ve learned that recruiting, engaging and retaining the next generation of retail leaders is critical. And through the NRF Foundation, we\u2019re increasing efforts to make sure that the best and the brightest of the next generation understand the value and the rewards of a retail career.\n\nWe\u2019ve learned that the policy challenges we face won\u2019t be getting any easier ... regardless of who sits in the White House, or controls Congress.\n\nSo we\u2019ll continue expanding our influence in Washington and pushing to advance retail\u2019s top priorities, issues like sales tax fairness, tax reform and patent litigation reform ... and all the others that impact retailers\u2019 ability to compete and do business.\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way in a few years \u2014 our advocacy footprint in Washington matches our economic footprint across our country \u2014 and we\u2019re fighting above our weight class on policy issues. But in spite of all we\u2019ve accomplished, I\u2019m confident that our greatest victories lie ahead.\n\nAt NRF, as we think about the year ahead, our mission is clear: to be the voice of retail on Capitol Hill and wherever the issues take us \u2026 to fight for retailers on the most critical economic and political issues of our time \u2026 and to tell the story of this great industry so all of you can focus on serving customers, creating jobs and driving our economy.\n\nAnd though the retail industry itself is in a constant state of change, NRF\u2019s mission to promote and advance the retail industry has never been more clear \u2014 and our ability to deliver on that commitment has never been more certain.\n\nWith your support, we\u2019re telling retail\u2019s story more powerfully than ever. We\u2019re advocating on retail\u2019s behalf more effectively than ever. And we\u2019re promoting retail\u2019s future more successfully than ever.\n\nWe still have a full two and a half days of BIG Show remaining. I hope you\u2019ll enjoy every minute \u2014 whether it\u2019s on the expo floor, listening to a keynote speaker or at one of our social events. And I hope that after this experience, the Big Show will become your favorite event of the year, too.\n\nOn behalf of the entire NRF team, thank you for the privilege of representing this great industry. We are proud and excited to do what we do for you every day.\n\nThank you for being part of the BIG Show \u2014 and for your support of NRF not just here in New York, but the whole year \u2018round.\n\nEnjoy the rest of the show and have a great week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NRF CEO highlights our efforts to elevate the retail industry.", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"site_name": "National Retail Federation", "description": "NRF CEO highlights our efforts to elevate the retail industry.", "title": "Five years of progress and we're just getting started ...", "url": "https://nrf.com/news/five-years-of-progress-and-were-just-getting-started", "image": "https://nrf.com/sites/default/files/Images/News/CAH_8994.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://nrf.com/news/five-years-of-progress-and-were-just-getting-started", "description": "NRF CEO highlights our efforts to elevate the retail industry.", "card": "summary", "title": "Five years of progress and we're just getting started ..."}, "dcterms.identifier": "https://nrf.com/news/five-years-of-progress-and-were-just-getting-started", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-18T13:57-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "rands@nrf.com", "MobileOptimized": 320, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "viewport": "width=device-width", "dcterms.title": "Five years of progress and we're just getting started ..."}, "article_summary": "We\u2019ve learned that the policy challenges we face won\u2019t be getting any easier ... regardless of who sits in the White House, or controls Congress.\nIt took us back to our roots, as retail advocates and the voice of the retail industry.\nIt meant creating a robust, best-in-class communications department to tell our story and promote the retail industry.\nAnd though the retail industry itself is in a constant state of change, NRF\u2019s mission to promote and advance the retail industry has never been more clear \u2014 and our ability to deliver on that commitment has never been more certain.\nWelcome to Day Two of Retail\u2019s BIG Show!"}
