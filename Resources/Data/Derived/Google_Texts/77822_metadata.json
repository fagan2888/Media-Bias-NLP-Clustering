But they later discovered the fire was part of a domestic dispute, John Reilly, a captain with the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, said in January.\n\nPerez was arrested while in custody in Ventura County jail on earlier charges of battery, vandalism, violation of a domestic restraining order, domestic-spousal battery and illegal possession of a firearm, Reilly said.\n\nInvestigators said a large piece of masonry was thrown through a window on the south side of the building that houses the Planned Parenthood office. An accelerant was later thrown in and a fire was lit. The fire did not spread beyond a small area of an office, but sprinkler water damaged much of the floor, authorities said.\n\nNo one was injured in the fire.\n\nAt the time of the fire, Planned Parenthood was at the center of a heated political controversy after surreptitiously recorded videos were released, allegedly showing anti-abortionists' claims that the group illegally sold fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood officials said the videos were doctored and the allegations were false.\n\nPerez is scheduled to be sentenced May 5.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Oxnard man pleads guilty to Planned Parenthood arson", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/conejo-valley/oxnard-man-pleads-guilty-to-planned-parenthood-arson-2ffde74e-d942-76c3-e053-0100007f2919-375094841.html", "image": {"width": 899, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/V0012437545--165373.JPG", "height": 701}, "type": "article", "description": "An Oxnard man pleaded guilty this week to setting a Planned Parenthood office where his former girlfriend worked in Thousand Oaks on fire.", "title": "Oxnard man pleads guilty to Planned Parenthood arson"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/V0012437545--165373.JPG", "description": "An Oxnard man pleaded guilty this week to setting a Planned Parenthood office where his former girlfriend worked in Thousand Oaks on fire.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Oxnard man pleads guilty to Planned Parenthood arson"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "By John Scheibe of the Ventura County StarAn Oxnard man pleaded guilty this week to setting fire to a Newbury Park Planned Parenthood office where his former girlfriend worked.\nROB VARELA/THE STAR The Planned Parenthood office in Newbury Park where a fire was set in 2015.\nInvestigators said a large piece of masonry was thrown through a window on the south side of the building that houses the Planned Parenthood office.\nPlanned Parenthood officials said the videos were doctored and the allegations were false.\nPerez faces 6.8 years in prison, said Richard Simon, a senior deputy district attorney with the Ventura County District Attorney's Office."}
