A Bayonne man faces a slew of charges after police say he went on a four-day crime spree that included asking two pre-teen girls for a kiss while fondling himself.

Dexter Bell, 24, has been charged with criminal sexual conduct, lewdness, shoplifting, obstruction of justice, aggravated assault, resisting arrest and theft, according to court documents.

Bell made his first court appearance in Central Judicial Processing court in Jersey City via video link from Hudson County jail yesterday. His bail was set at a combined $155,000, court officials said.

Bell’s alleged crimes were committed over a four-day span that began Monday when he stole a cellphone from a woman and posted nude photographs of the woman on Facebook, reports state.

On Tuesday, Bell approached the children’s playground of the YMCA and asked for a kiss from two children, ages 11 and 12, and from two counselors working at the YMCA, documents said.

While asking for the kiss, Bell had his hands down his pants and was fondling himself, documents said.

On Wednesday, Bell asked to use a man’s iPhone, then ran away after grabbing the phone, reports state.

On Thursday, Bell was

arrested after he tried to steal

a set of headphones and a

phone charger from a Metro PCS store on Broadway, reports state.

When stopped by a responding officer, Bell told the officer “F*** you” and fled the store, reports said, adding that Bell was apprehended after a short foot pursuit.

Bell was taken to the Hudson County jail following the incident.
