Indeed, the Avs have been bringing their A-game, though taking it one game at a time, because, of course, the NHL season is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nNow, to be honest, Cliche is pronounced \u201cKleesh,\u201d though to have a clich\u00e9-spewing athlete named Clich\u00e9 is kind of like saying \u201cyou are what you eat.\u201d That being said, our guy Cliche is Canadian (a Canadian hockey player, huh \u2014 I\u2019ll tell you what that is), so to use the vernacular from up there, the phrase \u201cCliche, eh,\u201d is actually pronounced clich\u00e9. So when the French-Canadian says his last name, he has an accent \u2014 but his last name doesn\u2019t have an accent.\n\n\u201cNo accent on the E \u2014 the computer puts it, though,\u201d Cliche told me, which I\u2019m finding it out right now, going back and furiously deleting the accents on all the Cliches like there\u2019s no tomorrow.\n\n\u201cMy favorite clich\u00e9,\u201d Cliche revealed, \u201cis giving it one day at the time.\u201d\n\nI wanted to find out more about my favorite silly-word-named athlete since former Houston Astros infielder Bill Onomatopoeia. So I went to Avs coach Patrick Roy, who said of Cliche: \u201cEvery day, he comes to work. He pushes the other guys.\n\n\u201cWe were looking to have a 13th forward who could play penalty killing and a good defensive role as much as possible. And a right-handed shooter for faceoffs, that would give us some options. When he became available by the Kings, it was a great opportunity for us. It was a great fit, and I\u2019m very happy with him.\u201d\n\nBefore joining the Avs this fall, the 26-year-old Cliche had played in only one NHL game \u2014 he had a cup of coffee, if you will. He\u2019s scored only one goal and has five assists, but Colorado star Matt Duchene gushed about Cliche on Tuesday: \u201cHe\u2019s just a hard-nosed, gritty player, and he\u2019s got more skill than people think too. It\u2019s shocking to me that he only has one goal, because he has had so many great chances. He\u2019s taken some great shots, made some great moves but had the goalie come up big on him. But he\u2019s a guy who\u2019s going to be big in our future.\u201d\n\nTalking about returning to action Wednesday, now that the Olympics are over, Cliche said, \u201cThe break felt good, but I think everybody\u2019s obnoxious about starting again.\u201d A Cliche malapropism\u2014 the way former New York Yankees outfielder Mickey Rivers would use malapropisms as clich\u00e9s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do all right,\u201d Rivers once said, \u201cif we can capitalize on our mistakes.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman: For Avalanche\u2019s Marc-Andr\u00e9 Cliche, it is what it is", "title": "Hochman: For Avalanche\u2019s Marc-Andr\u00e9 Cliche, it is what it is", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/25/hochman-for-avalanches-marc-andre-cliche-it-is-what-it-is/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140225__20140226_B1_SP26HOCHMANp1.jpg", "height": 445}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140225__20140226_B1_SP26HOCHMANp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-25T21:45:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:03:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb57e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMy favorite clich\u00e9,\u201d Cliche revealed, \u201cis giving it one day at the time.\u201dI wanted to find out more about my favorite silly-word-named athlete since former Houston Astros infielder Bill Onomatopoeia.\nThe penalty-killing forward Cliche finally has gotten an NHL chance this season for the Arvada West-gritty Avalanche, which enters Wednesday\u2019s game at 37-16-5, third in the Central Division.\nThe editor asked me Tuesday if my plan really was to write a column about Cliche while using a bunch of clich\u00e9s.\nHe\u2019s taken some great shots, made some great moves but had the goalie come up big on him.\nSo I went to Avs coach Patrick Roy, who said of Cliche: \u201cEvery day, he comes to work."}
