Silicon Valley lures talent D.C. craves\n\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Blame it on heated toilet seats, free daily transport or the uninhibited joy of invention. Silicon Valley and its environs continue to lure the tech talent Washington craves.\n\nThe perks and prestige of Bay Area companies have always served as a powerful draw for young engineers \u2014 incentives the federal government and its community of contractors can scarcely match.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd while the Obama administration has worked to reverse this trend, HealthCare.gov\u2019s pronounced stumbles underscore a public-sector culture that often turns off creative minds, limits ingenuity and fails to attract those hoping to influence the next generation of technology.\n\n( Sign up for POLITICO\u2019s Morning Tech tip sheet)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perception of opportunity,\u201d said Mike McGeary, co-founder of Engine Advocacy, a San Francisco group that helps engage start-ups in public policy. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who majors in computer science at Stanford and says, \u2018I\u2019m going to be a government bureaucrat.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the feds. States and nonprofit organizations also lose promising engineers to the private sector, which the National Science Foundation estimates pulls in 70 percent of computer science and math graduates.\n\nPart of the allure appears obvious on a Google or Facebook campus: three to four times as much pay, on-site amenities like yoga and catered meals, and Wi-Fi-enabled buses that scoop up workers from hipster neighborhoods in San Francisco.\n\nThe government also struggles with less tangible factors, including a Valley perspective that encourages employees to run with ideas and \u201cbreak things,\u201d rather than adhere to protocols and sign-offs. It\u2019s a world of MacBook Airs and coffee shop conversations in the Mission instead of BlackBerrys and solitary cubicles in McLean.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full technology policy coverage)\n\n\u201cThere is not a sense that these are the places to solve cutting-edge problems,\u201d said Alan Davidson, Google\u2019s former public policy director and a visiting scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cGovernment, especially in the IT world, can be very stifling. It doesn\u2019t support risk taking or experimentation.\u201d\n\nAnother aspect has to do with the mind-set of a younger generation that believes tech companies can contribute as much, if not more, to society as public agencies.\n\n\u201cMore and more, people understand that you can innovate and do good in both government and the private sector,\u201d said Nick Papas, a former White House spokesman now with Airbnb, a San Francisco-based start-up that helps people rent out their homes.\n\nA new Freedman Consulting report, commissioned by the MacArthur Foundation and Ford Foundation, examines the flow of technology talent away from the public sector. It attributes the gap to recruitment barriers such as compensation and concludes young engineers need more education in policy matters. Such steps are critical, the study warns, because technology increasingly affects every aspect of society \u2014 from insurance access to privacy rights.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t take drastic actions to improve this tech pipeline,\u201d report co-author Sam Gill said, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have a government that is not really relevant to the governance of the 21st century.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama techies sell startup to NGP VAN)\n\nOthers consider the Silicon Valley vs. Washington dynamic a tired \u2014 and outdated \u2014 story line.\n\n\u201cWhat we are finding is there is a great deal of talent in the country yearning for the opportunity to serve their country,\u201d said Aneesh Chopra, the former White House chief technology officer.\n\nChopra pointed to the Presidential Innovation Fellows program launched last year that enables industry leaders to assist with government projects. He noted new federal initiatives to hire outside traditional recruitment channels, provide more government data to the public and establish prizes for innovative ideas.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The federal government is losing promising experts and engineers.", "title": "Silicon Valley lures talent D.C. craves", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/silicon-valley-washington-dc-technology-obamacare-affordable-care-act-100553.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/11/30/131130_obamacare_site_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Technology (765),HealthCare.Gov (174),Silicon Valley (85),San Francisco (44)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The federal government is losing promising experts and engineers.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0adb\"", "article_summary": "Silicon Valley lures talent D.C. cravesSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Blame it on heated toilet seats, free daily transport or the uninhibited joy of invention.\nSilicon Valley and its environs continue to lure the tech talent Washington craves.\nA new Freedman Consulting report, commissioned by the MacArthur Foundation and Ford Foundation, examines the flow of technology talent away from the public sector.\n( Also on POLITICO: Full technology policy coverage)\u201cThere is not a sense that these are the places to solve cutting-edge problems,\u201d said Alan Davidson, Google\u2019s former public policy director and a visiting scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n( Sign up for POLITICO\u2019s Morning Tech tip sheet)\u201cIt\u2019s perception of opportunity,\u201d said Mike McGeary, co-founder of Engine Advocacy, a San Francisco group that helps engage start-ups in public policy."}
