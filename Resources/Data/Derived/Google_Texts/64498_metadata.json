Even with Medicare payments, Thomson would have to pay about $10,000 a year out of pocket.\n\n(Photo Credit: ABC News)\n\n\"I have 30 pills left,\" said Thomson, 65. \"About seven weeks' worth.\"\n\nIf her pill bottle goes empty, she fears she will die, yet she can't afford the high payments. \"It's like, 'Why is this happening?' and it just all seems so unfair,\" Thomson told ABC News.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb, a global biopharmaceutical company, produces Sprycel.\n\nThousands of cancer patients, even many with insurance, face the same dire decision: Go bankrupt or die.\n\nDr. Hagop Kantarjian, chief of the Lukemia Center at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, is leading a protest by more than 100 cancer specialists demanding pharmaceutical companies lower their drug prices. \"Patients who cannot afford the drugs are forgoing the treatment and dying,\" Kantarjian said.\n\nPharmaceutical companies say it costs on average more than $1 billion to research a new drug and bring it to market, but critics put the costs at less than $90 million.\n\n\"The pharmaceutical industry is the second most profitable industry in the United States, after the oil and gas industry,\" Kantarjian told ABC News.\n\nSprycel and other top-tier cancer drugs cost twice as much in the United States as they do in parts of Europe, China, Canada and the United Kingdom, where the government sets a limit on pricing.\n\nAs the cost of the pills has more than doubled since 2007, the CEOs earned tens of millions of dollars.\n\nThomson said she doesn't believe it's ethical for the pharmaceutical companies to charge so much for the drugs. \"I don't know that you need a gazillion dollars' worth of profit,\" she said.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb said in a statement to ABC News, \"We take great care to price our medicines based on the cost to develop them, the scientific innovation they represent, and the value they deliver to patients and physicians. \u2026 For Sprycel, we have robust patient assistance programs in place.\"\n\nREAD Bristol-Myers Squibb full statement here.\n\nStill, nearly one in five cancer patients can't afford their medication. Thomson applied to a reimbursement support program and she was denied.\n\nShe is now down to 30 pills and has little hope.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Outrage at the Increasingly High Cost of Cancer Drugs", "description": "Outrage at the Increasingly High Cost of Cancer Drugs", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/health/2013/12/18/outrage-at-the-increasingly-high-cost-of-cancer-drugs/", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Prices have doubled in 10 years -- from an average of $5k a month to over $10k.", "title": "Outrage at the Increasingly High Cost of Cancer Drugs"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "cancer, cost, drug, healthcare, medicaid, medicare, perscription, pharma, price, sick, health news, medical news, medical articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Cancer drug prices have doubled in the past decade, from an average of $5,000 per month to more than $10,000.\nThousands of cancer patients, even many with insurance, face the same dire decision: Go bankrupt or die.\nRELATED: Doctors Excited by New Cancer TreatmentPatricia Thomson, a married, working mother whose leukemia is in remission, is one of the many cancer patients struggling to pay for her medication.\nStill, nearly one in five cancer patients can't afford their medication.\nEleven of the 12 cancer drugs the Food and Drug Administration approved for fighting cancer in 2012 were priced at more than $100,000 per year, double the average annual household income, according to a report by the Journal of National Cancer Institute."}
