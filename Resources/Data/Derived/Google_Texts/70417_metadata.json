They also insisted upon \u201cregular order\u201d for approving annual spending bills, meaning the 13 major bills would be considered and voted on separately. That is the way appropriations bills were passed historically, and advocates say it greatly helps reduce the amount of wasteful projects that end up in catch-all omnibus spending bills.\n\nNeither of those goals will advance this year.\n\n\u201cThe president and Senate Democrats have decided they don\u2019t want to pass any spending legislation unless there\u2019s a lot more spending,\u201d said Price, who added that Obama not only wants more money across the board but especially for his favorite agencies that conservatives loathe.\n\n\u201cThe president put out the word that he wasn\u2019t going to sign any piece of spending legislation that didn\u2019t increase spending on his favorite topics, like the IRS and the EPA,\u201d Price explained in an interview with WND and Radio America.\n\nPrice said Republicans have tried to pursue a responsible process that results in less spending.\n\n\u201cThe work that\u2019s been done by the appropriations committees in both the House and the Senate has really been remarkable,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Senate has actually passed a number of pieces of appropriations legislation out of committee. The Democrats haven\u2019t allowed those bills to come to the floor, because it takes 60 votes to get them to the floor. But they passed out of committee, and the vast majority of them in a very bipartisan manner.\u201d\n\nThe chairman claims Republicans got the message from voters in 2014 to get the government\u2019s fiscal house in order. He said President Obama did not listen to voters and is playing hardball once again, leaving the GOP on defense.\n\n\u201cHis constituency wants him to spend a whole lot more money and expand government and expand the ability of government to infringe upon people\u2019s lives,\u201d Price said. \u201cWe simply believe that\u2019s the wrong direction to head, and we will fight as hard as we can to make certain that that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nListen to the WND/Radio America interview with Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga.:\n\nWith Obama and Democrats demanding higher spending, Price said Republicans have reluctantly concluded they need to shelve their more conservative budget blueprint and just try to stop spending from going any higher.\n\n\u201cThe only option really is what\u2019s called a continuing resolution, simply to continue the spending levels at the current fiscal year and extend those into Fiscal Year 2016,\u201d Price said. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll be able to do that because that\u2019s the responsible thing to do, to not spend more on the things that aren\u2019t working but wait until we have an opportunity to work with a group of senators that actually want to solve problems as opposed to just getting in the way.\u201d\n\nPrice hopes to avoid funding all of the next fiscal year at current rates. He hopes at least six Senate Democrats will eventually reach across the aisle to solve the impasse.\n\n\u201cHopefully what will happen is that at least six Democrats will recognize that having the president shut down the government is not a wise thing to do,\u201d Price said. \u201cWe will try as hard as we can to make certain the president isn\u2019t able to shut down the government.\u201d\n\nSince the budget blueprint was approved earlier this year, taxpayer funds for Planned Parenthood have come under fire after a series of Center for Medical Progress videos exposed officials for the the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider callously referring to conducting abortions to preserve the organs of unborn babies for research and alleged profit. They also allege Planned Parenthood has killed babies that survived abortions and that are still moving as technicians cut through the face and harvest brain tissue for its clients.\n\nEarlier this summer, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to bring up an amendment to a highway funding bill that would defund Planned Parenthood. That move would only require a simple majority. Instead, McConnell called a separate vote on defunding Planned Parenthood that needed 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles. That vote failed.\n\nIn recent days, McConnell poured cold water on activists\u2019 hopes of ending taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood this year.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t have the votes to get the outcome that we\u2019d like,\u201d McConnell told WKYT\u2019s \u201cIssues and Answers\u201d program. \u201cAgain, the president has the pen to sign it. If he doesn\u2019t sign it, it doesn\u2019t happen. But, yeah, we voted on that already in the Senate, we\u2019ll vote on it again, but I would remind all of your viewers the way you make a law in this country, the Congress has to pass it and the president has to sign it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s made it very clear he\u2019s not going to sign any bill that includes defunding of Planned Parenthood, so that\u2019s another issue that awaits a new president, hopefully with a different point of view about Planned Parenthood,\u201d McConnell added.\n\nPrice admits the votes will be hard to find, but he\u2019s still prepared to fight for defunding.\n\n\u201cWe need to find whatever avenue is possible \u2013 whether it\u2019s through the continuing resolution, whether it\u2019s through an omnibus bill, whether it\u2019s through any other piece of legislation \u2013 to try to make certain we try to hold the administration to account, yes, but to make certain that Planned Parenthood does not get the resources they currently get, over $500 million a year, to continue this absolutely despicable act,\u201d Price said.\n\nThe chairman said he understands and shares the frustration rising up within the conservative grassroots over sizable Republican majorities in Congress that cannot seem to advance their interests or stop the policies that matter most to Obama. Price said the people need to get loud and demand better government.\n\n\u201cIt means that more political activity needs to occur,\u201d he said. \u201cThe American people need to engage as never before to hold people\u2019s feet to the fire and to hold their representatives and senators to account and to demand of them responsible representative activity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Despite large majorities in the House and Senate,\u00a0House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., says Democrat demands\u00a0for\u00a0much higher spending across the board are forcing Republicans to\u00a0maintain\u00a0current federal spending levels until they can find enough Democrat cooperation to pursue greater fiscal discipline.
