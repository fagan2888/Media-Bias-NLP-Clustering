It also fits right alongside Verizon\u2019s moves towards exploring new markets \u2014 like ways to utilize its LTE network for connected devices.\n\nVerizon will offer the Virtual Visits platform to healthcare providers, health plans, and employers, who will in turn offer apps powered by the technology to their clients. Many consumers likely won\u2019t even know they\u2019re using a Verizon-powered service. The service is also completely carrier agnostic \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re using AT&T or Sprint.\n\nApps using Verizon\u2019s Virtual Visits technology will let consumers request a virtual medical session for acute conditions, like a cold, flu, or sore throat. Doctors can use the platform to electronically send prescriptions to the pharmacies of your choice, and they can also provide referrals if they think you\u2019ll need more direct medical care. Pricing for the virtual visits is up to every provider, but Verizon expects it to cost less than a typical office visit co-pay.\n\nVerizon is competing with several telemedicine outfits, including the newly launched MDLive. Julie Kling, Verizon\u2019s director of mobile health, tells me the platform is different than competitors because it was built specifically to take advantage of mobile devices (others can work on mobile, but require you to be on Wi-Fi). It\u2019s also easier for Verizon to offer a telemedicine service since its cloud infrastructure is already HIPAA compliant to handle sensitive patient records.\n\n\u201cWhen we built this, we initially thought it was going to be health plans who were interested,\u201d Kling said. \u201cBut the Affordable Care Act has changed things \u2026 now providers and hospital systems, are looking for ways to make more revenue.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, even retailers are interested in the service. Many pharmacies already offer clinics on-site \u2014 telemedicine seems like the next logical step.\n\nKling expects doctors to use Virtual Visits in a variety of ways. Some may block off a few hours every day for virtual visits, while others could be virtually on call. Clinicians will have to be trained to properly take advantage of telemedicine, but with just about every medical provider looking find new sources of revenue these days, it likely won\u2019t be too tough to convince doctors to get trained.\n\nGiven that it typically takes new patients around 27 days to schedule an appointment with a doctor (according to the health policy journal Health Affairs), and many people also end up wasting time and money at the ER for acute illnesses, telemedicine services could do wonders to improve the speed and access of healthcare.\n\nVerizon plans to announce its first customers for Virtual Visits in the next few months.\n\nAI.
