And who can use which ones.\n\nIt involves everyone. It\u2019s contentious. It\u2019s emotional. So the media lap it up. And as his manipulators know full well, the controversy invites countless other public figures to weigh in and feed the flames, news cycle after news cycle.\n\nIn yet another executive overreach to redirect public discussion, Obama arbitrarily ruled that every public school receiving federal funds must allow the minute fraction of society who are transgender to use the restrooms of their choice, not their biological genders.\n\nWe\u2019re being played again, folks. Here\u2019s what\u2019s really at stake: Obama\u2019s heir apparent and legacy protector, the 68-year-old Hillary Clinton, is getting shredded in Democratic primary after primary by a 74-year-old socialist, Bernie Sanders. Like Donald Trump in the GOP, Sanders suddenly declared himself a convenient Democrat after a political lifetime elsewhere.\n\nObama would also like to distract you from the slipping new-job creation rates. Obamacare and its artificial state exchanges are crumbling beneath the weight of their own costs and disincentives. And a federal judge last week ruled against a crucial part of that program.\n\nDisturbing reports of the military\u2019s poor readiness mount, including planes being cannibalized for parts to keep half the jets flying. Obama\u2019s sanctions against Russia have failed to change any of its behaviors in Ukraine, Crimea, Syria or the high seas.\n\nAnother special ops member was killed in Iraq, where, according to Obama, there are no U.S. boots on the ground, and anyway, they\u2019re not in combat. ISIS has lost territory but none of its deadly car-bomb punch in urban Iraq. And the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, admits those JV ISIS guys will not be curtailed under this president.\n\nTrump is winning the Republican nomination with a campaign slogan, \u201cMake America great again.\u201d It is, of course, just another empty T-shirt phrase, like \u201cHope and change.\u201d But it\u2019s simple and catchy.\n\nWhat\u2019s the main theme of Clinton\u2019s campaign? Or does she even use a catchy phrase? Correct. There is none. If there were, it would be something like \u201cI\u2019ll be Barack\u2019s third term, only more so.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a risky theme given the latest Reuters/Ipsos Poll. Only 21 percent of Americans believe the country is on the right track, while 68 percent say it\u2019s on the wrong track. You want more of this?\n\nUnlike her husband, Hillary Clinton is a horrible campaigner: stilted, programmed, strident. She shows her sincerity by talking louder. Half the time she\u2019s playing defense against her own words, as in West Virginia, where she previously had reveled in all the coal companies and miners she\u2019s going to put out of work.\n\nAs one direct result, after winning 67 percent of the primary vote there against a real opponent in Obama eight years ago, this time, as the presumptive party nominee, she could capture only 38 percent against Sanders\u2019 51 percent.\n\nWorse for her, 50 percent of women there voted against the first potential female commander in chief. And 43 percent of Sanders voters said they\u2019d jump to Trump in November.\n\nThe Democratic nominating system, of course, is rigged in her favor with unelected superdelegates. Sanders is trying to convince them to defect by earning more popular votes in primaries than she does.\n\nThat\u2019s difficult but not impossible. It\u2019s also mortifying for Clinton. She\u2019s fundraising now, attacking Trump and Sanders, trying to take advantage of the bathroom distraction.\n\nAnd she\u2019s still calling the Justice Department email probe \u201ca security review\u201d despite the FBI director\u2019s repeated contradictions that there is no such thing.\n\nTrump has already pivoted to general election business while she fights a rear-guard action against Sanders. She\u2019s even buying TV ads in Kentucky, once a gimme.\n\nBut the best thing Clinton has going for her in November, polls show, is Trump. Clinton and Trump are both unpopular, disliked and not trusted. For now, the female New Yorker is less disliked than the billionaire New Yorker.\n\nThat might change, given Trump\u2019s media skills. But meanwhile here\u2019s a possible Clinton campaign slogan: \u201cNot as bad as the other one.\u201d\n\nAndrew Malcolm is an author and veteran national and foreign correspondent covering politics since the 1960s.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama\u2019s communications strategists found a perfect tool to distract the public in recent days: bathrooms.
