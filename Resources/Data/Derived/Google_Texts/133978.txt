Regardless of your religious creed, there are plenty of reasons not to sign up for the Mars One mission to the Red Planet.

For a start, Mars has no breathable atmosphere and almost no water.

And if you thought the Arctic air blasting across North America this winter was cold, think again. The average temperature on Mars is minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

But here’s another reason you may not have considered: Such a journey may be deemed sinful — at least if you are Muslim.

That’s the view of a group of imams in the United Arab Emirates, which has reportedly issued a fatwa against Muslims making the “hazardous trip.”

Likening the mission to suicide, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowment said Muslims risked dying for no “righteous reason” and any Muslim making such a foolhardy trip could receive the same punishment as those who killed themselves.

The imams cited various verses of the Koran as evidence that Muslims attempting to start a new life on Mars was out of the question.

“Such a one-way journey poses a real risk to life, and that can never be justified in Islam,” the committee said.
