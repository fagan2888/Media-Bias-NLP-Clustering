Chris Christie.\n\nTerror\n\nThe week kicked off with tragic news out of Libya, where ISIS militants beheaded 21 Coptic Christians. Egypt\u2019s response was swift, a stark and \u201cbothersome\u201d contrast to what our commander in chief did after learning of Kayla Mueller\u2019s execution. Moreover, in their denunciation of the beheadings, the White House failed to mention the victims were Christians, or that the perpetrators, of course, were Islamic extremists. A very important piece on ISIS in The Atlantic came out this week arguing, in part, that the Islamic State is very much Islamic, contrary to what this administration, including former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder, wants to believe, hence their generic summit on extremism this week, sans the Islamic part.\n\nIn related news, the State Department put forth the suggestion that the best way to defeat radical Islamic jihadists is with job opportunities (remember, they have \u201clegitimate grievances,\u201d according to President Obama). After catching must-deserved flak for the comments, the State Department spokeswoman doubled down and said they were just too nuanced for the rest of us simpletons. Meanwhile, the administration has decided they might finally do a bit more to confront the ISIS threat by planning to retake the captured city of Mosul. Too bad they told ISIS what our detailed plans entail.\n\nObamacare\n\nDespite billions of dollars being spent on the Obamacare website, enrollment didn\u2019t pass without at least one major hitch. But if it isn\u2019t the website, it\u2019s the people behind it. The government sent the wrong tax information to nearly 1 million customers, and has had to ask them to hold off on filing their 2014 taxes because of it. Other Americans on the exchange are experiencing yet another \u201cglitch,\u201d namely, that they\u2019ll have to pay back some or all of their subsidies. Ouch.\n\n2016\n\nWisconsin Governor and potential GOP presidential candidate Scott Walker fired back this week at those who questioned his intelligence because he didn\u2019t finish college, saying that only elitists would make such an argument. And not content with Walker punting on an evolution question, the media has apparently left no stone unturned in its search for answers. They also did a lousy job fact-checking an article blaming him for teacher layoffs in the state, given Walker wasn\u2019t even in office at the time. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, is trying to distance himself from the political baggage associated with his last name. His mother, for her part, has given him the OK on a potential 2016 run. On the Democratic side, controversy is already stirring after it was revealed that the Clinton Foundation accepts foreign funds. Just a slight conflict of interest. And I know you\u2019ve all been waiting for Debbie Wasserman Schultz to become \u2026 a senator. Maybe, if Rubio decides to run. Either way, you can be sure liberals will be bringing back the \u201cwar on women\u201d mantra.\n\nImmigration\n\nLate Monday night a federal judge temporarily blocked President Obama\u2019s executive action on illegal immigration by granting a request from 26 states to allow the courts to look its constitutionality before it\u2019s implemented. Conn broke down exactly what you need to know, including an explanation of what the court did, didn\u2019t do, and what happens next. In a follow-up post, he provided analysis of the decision and highlighted five key findings. Sen. Ted Cruz called the injunction against Obama\u2019s amnesty a \u201cmajor victory\u201d for the rule of law, while, predictably, liberals are throwing a tantrum over the \"mean and xenophobic\" decision. The White House isn't sure yet how to respond.\n\nTownhall Exclusives\n\nDaniel Doherty caught up with Rep. Lee Zeldin, who\u2019s one of several freshman representatives to watch this session. And I had the opportunity to speak with Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis, who\u2019s doing everything he can to reform Washington.\n\nGraphics by Townhall Graphic Designer Feven Amenu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics..05/27/2016 0:48:40AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Friday Filibuster: The Problem With Political Dynasties", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/02/20/friday-filibuster-n1959966", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/2/20/23.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Friday Filibuster: The Problem With Political Dynasties", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/02/20/friday-filibuster-n1959966", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/2/20/23.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Friday Filibuster: The Problem With Political Dynasties , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.\nImmigrationLate Monday night a federal judge temporarily blocked President Obama\u2019s executive action on illegal immigration by granting a request from 26 states to allow the courts to look its constitutionality before it\u2019s implemented.\nJeb Bush, meanwhile, is trying to distance himself from the political baggage associated with his last name.\nTerrorThe week kicked off with tragic news out of Libya, where ISIS militants beheaded 21 Coptic Christians.\nAnd I had the opportunity to speak with Florida Rep.
