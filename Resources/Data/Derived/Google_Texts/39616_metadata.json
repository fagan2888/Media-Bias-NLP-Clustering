The Butler County Landfill provided the location to perform the scenarios at.\n\n\"We hope to never see those [accidents] but we always have to try and train and learn those techniques that will help us accomplish our job on those toughest of calls,\" said Captain Frank Williams.\n\nCaptain Williams stressed the importance of the training missions, stating it decreases the time it takes to get accident victims out of crashed vehicles and helps emergency crews work better together when multiple units are dispatched to a scene. When the emergency crews get a chance to slow down and analyze a crash scene in a practice setting, the skills learned makes it so it takes them less time to get help to victims in a real crash.\n\nThe school buses were donated, as were much of the other items used in the mock rescue missions.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Emergency crews in Butler County spent the day performing rescue missions on mock crash scenes to be better prepared for real accidents.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "Emergency crews in Butler County spent the day performing rescue missions on mock crash scenes to be better prepared for real accidents.", "title": "Mock crashes in Butler County used to train emergency crews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Butler-County-emergency-crews-spend-day-training-for-emergencies-275022631.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/CB0/872/CB0872D7B578473583B88CAB2E74739B", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/A3C/170/A3C170833C9546C58CE7F32DB6153259.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Emergency crews in Butler County spent the day performing rescue missions on mock crash scenes to be better prepared for real accidents.", "title": "Mock crashes in Butler County used to train emergency crews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Butler-County-emergency-crews-spend-day-training-for-emergencies-275022631.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/mock+crashes.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Mock crashes in Butler County used to train emergency crews", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Mock crashes in Butler County, used to train emergency crews"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf23\"", "article_summary": "Emergency crews in Butler County spent the day performing rescue missions on mock crash scenes to be better prepared for real accidents.\nThe school buses were donated, as were much of the other items used in the mock rescue missions.\nThere were three different scenarios - an overturned bus, a car that crashed into the back of a bus and a grain hauling truck that flipped over onto an SUV - that crews performed rescue missions on.\nThe Butler County Landfill provided the location to perform the scenarios at.\nWhen the emergency crews get a chance to slow down and analyze a crash scene in a practice setting, the skills learned makes it so it takes them less time to get help to victims in a real crash."}
