This year features excellent ice and water clarity conditions; last year water clarity was poor.\n\nThe Department of Natural Resources reported 4,046 spearing shanties on Lake Winnebago and 380 on the Upriver Lakes.\n\nThe heaviest fish was a 143.9 pounder registered by William Zahringer at the Stockbridge Harbor station. The fish was 75.4 inches in length. Fifty of the fish registered Saturday were 100 pounds or more.\n\nThe systemwide harvest caps are the same as they have been the last two years - 400 juvenile females, 828 adult females and 1,200 males.\n\nThe DNR sold 11,823 licenses for the season, including 11,355 for Lake Winnebago and 468 for the Upriver Lakes. The licenses sales are down 6% from 2013 but fourth highest in history.\n\nSpearers in 2013 registered 567 sturgeon for the entire season, including 261 on the Upriver Lakes.\n\nThe 2013 season featured fair ice conditions but poor water clarity and lasted the full 16 days on Lake Winnebago. Conditions are excellent for spearers this year, including 16 to 18 feet of visibility.\n\nThe fast pace of harvest means harvest caps will likely be reached in the next day or days on both the Upriver Lakes and Lake Winnebago, according to DNR sturgeon biologist Ryan Koenigs.\n\nBernice Young, 78, of Kaukauna was among the successful spearers Saturday.
