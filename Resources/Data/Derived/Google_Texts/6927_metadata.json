As the calendar flips to 2016, Obama\u2019s crack team is determined to dither.\n\nIn response to Iran\u2019s latest provocations \u2013 the firing two ballistic test missiles in contravention of U.N. resolutions and the launching of \u201cunguided rockets\u201d close to U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf -- President Obama came this close to a forceful response, only to falter once again in the red zone. Obama\u2019s foreign policy is like New York Giants football \u2013 commanding the lead until the last two minutes, only to slink home in defeat.\n\nThe White House alerted Congress just a few days ago that it planned new sanctions against 11 individuals and entities from Iran, Hong Kong and the UAE involved in Tehran\u2019s illegal ballistic missile program. But, the Obama administration almost immediately backed off the plan, after it was denounced by Iranian officials as a violation of the nuclear deal. It is, of course, no such thing. According to U.S. Treasury officials, under the nuke deal the U.S. retained the right to impose sanctions on organizations or people tied to Tehran\u2019s missile development or on entities perpetrating international terrorism.\n\nRelated: Why the US Wants New Sanctions Against Iran\n\nIran\u2019s president Hassan Rouhani countered the threatened sanctions by calling for his Defense Ministry to \u201cquickly and firmly continue with its plans to produce different missiles\u2026.\u201d Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan piled on, announcing his intention to make Iran\u2019s missiles even more powerful, claiming that \u201cpeace and security can only be achieved by strength\u201d \u2013 a viewpoint many wish the Obama administration would adopt.\n\nThe bluster apparently stopped the White House in its tracks. No surprise there. Neither in the negotiation of the nuclear agreement, nor in the aftermath, has President Obama and his team showed any spine in confronting Tehran\u2019s bellicose mullahs. Not only did John Kerry et al fail to recover American hostages held by Tehran \u2013 an almost unimaginable lapse \u2013 they also failed to secure even a single gesture of goodwill towards the U.S.\n\nApologists for Obama\u2019s weak-kneed dealings with Tehran are quick to cite President Hassan Rouhani\u2019s need to stand up to the U.S. to appease right-wing factions in his country. We have repeatedly been told that Rouhani pushed for the nuclear deal, and wants better relations with the U.S. In numerous arenas, we have put concern for Mr. Rouhani\u2019s political standing ahead of our self-interest. That was especially true in concluding the nuclear deal, which Donald Trump has called \u201cone of the worst-negotiated transactions I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rouhani Expands Iran's Missile Program Despite U.S. Sanctions Threat\n\nAmong the accord\u2019s several shortcomings is that it contains no effort to restrain Iran\u2019s missile program, which was outlawed by the U.N. Security Council and which alarms analysts convinced Tehran wants the capability of delivering of nuclear warheads. The U.N. passed five resolutions between 2006 and 2010 trying to thwart this ambition.\n\nTehran refused to make limits on its missile program part of the nuclear accord; the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei denounced that possibility as \u201cstupid and idiotic.\u201d When the Joint Comprehensive Plan was announced by leaders of the P5+1 nations, there was no mention of any oversight of Iran\u2019s missile program. That omission contradicted a State Department fact sheet about the agreement which promised that the final accord would include \u201cimportant restrictions on conventional arms and ballistic missiles.\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign minister Zarif described the fact sheet as an attempt by the Obama White House to \u201cspin\u201d the just-signed deal. It seems he was correct.\n\nThe sanctions under consideration by the White House would be allowed under U.N. resolution 1929 passed in 2010, which says that \u201cStates shall take all necessary measures to prevent the transfer of technology or technical assistance to Iran related to such activities,\u201d referring to its ballistic missile program. Targeted are Iranian individuals who work for the Ministry of Defense for Armed Forces Logistics, as well as an Abu Dhabi firm and its Hong Kong affiliate charged with providing key materiel to the weapons effort.\n\nThe threatened White House sanctions reflect concerns that Iran is collaborating with rogue nuclear state North Korea to procure components for its ballistic missile program.\n\nRelated: White House Delays Imposing New Sanctions on Iran\n\nThese are serious developments, but the White House will not treat them seriously for fear of undermining Obama\u2019s legacy nuclear accord with Iran. Pursuant to that deal, Iran recently delivered 25,000 pounds of enriched uranium to Russia. That step was a precursor to Tehran receiving tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief \u2013 money desperately needed by a country dependent on sinking oil revenues. The budget deficit in Iran is likely to be the worst in 37 years as the economy continues to falter.\n\nYet, Tehran bullies the West--and especially the U.S. President Obama seems not to understand or to care that the nuclear deal is far more important to Iran than it is to the U.S. But then, chasing his legacy has always been the top priority for this president.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you\u2019re hoping that the New Year ushers in a new, more resolute foreign policy from", "title": "Obama Reneges Again: Fails to Hold Iran Accountable for Ballistic Missile Tests", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/01/03/Obama-Reneges-Again-Fails-Hold-Iran-Accountable-Ballistic-Missile-Tests", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-nuclear-iaea_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/01/03/Obama-Reneges-Again-Fails-Hold-Iran-Accountable-Ballistic-Missile-Tests", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-nuclear-iaea_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@lizpeek"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If you\u2019re hoping that the New Year ushers in a new, more resolute foreign policy from", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "If you\u2019re hoping that the New Year ushers in a new, more resolute foreign policy from the Obama White House, you\u2019re out of luck.\nThe threatened White House sanctions reflect concerns that Iran is collaborating with rogue nuclear state North Korea to procure components for its ballistic missile program.\nWe have repeatedly been told that Rouhani pushed for the nuclear deal, and wants better relations with the U.S.\nPursuant to that deal, Iran recently delivered 25,000 pounds of enriched uranium to Russia.\nBut, the Obama administration almost immediately backed off the plan, after it was denounced by Iranian officials as a violation of the nuclear deal."}
