They chanted, \u201cIf we burn, you will burn with us.\u201d\n\nShumlin had been scheduled to submit a financing proposal and plan design to the state legislature when it convenes in January. A final plan would then have been submitted to the federal government for approval under state waivers available beginning in 2017 through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nShumlin claimed that after reviewing new cost estimates, it \u201cwas just not affordable.\u201d The plan he considered is similar to one covering state employees and pays approximately 94% of total health care costs.\n\n\u201cPushing for single payer health care when the time isn\u2019t right and it might hurt our economy would not be good for Vermont,\u201d he added.\n\nThe cost estimates were greater than originally anticipated because of slower than expected economic growth, a projected cost of $200 million per year to provide for cross-border commuter coverage, increased Medicaid costs and an estimated $150 million decrease in the amount of federal funding available for the transition.\n\nAccording to the Governor, the new cost estimates would have required an employer-paid payroll tax of 11.5% and a progressive income tax maxing out at a marginal rate of 9.5% for family incomes in excess of $102,000.\n\nShumlin said he would continue to pursue a series of incremental changes in the state health care system to promote quality, cost containment and efficiency. \u201cIf we do these things, we will achieve a significant and meaningful part of the goal we set out for ourselves.\u201d\n\nPOLITICS, NOT ECONOMICS\n\n\u201cThe Governor\u2019s decision is political, not economic,\u201d said University of Massachusetts economist Gerald Friedman. Friedman has worked to help design financing plans for several state single-payer proposals.\n\n\u201cThe new estimated costs for a comprehensive health care plan that would cover all Vermonters that were released yesterday are between $100 and $300 million more than earlier projected by both the Hsiao-Gruber commission and me,\u201d said Friedman. \u201cIt is not clear that these new estimates fully account for administrative savings. The Governor is abandoning Vermont\u2019s single-payer plan because it is slightly more expensive than expected.\u201d\n\nIn the November election, Shumlin, a Democrat, won a bare plurality of the votes. The Vermont Progressive Party, which has five elected state representatives and three state senators, chose not to run a candidate, largely because of Shumlin\u2019s support for Green Mountain Care. His Republican opponent charged at that time that single-payer was \u201cdead\u201d and that Shumlin was \u201cgoing to wait until after the election to tell you.\u201d\n\nAfter the election, Shumlin reassured single-payer advocates that he was still on track to release a financing report in time for the legislature to act in January. Reaction from state health care justice activists to his December 17 announcement ranged from disappointment to outrage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out how we can move forward, and I hope that my legislative colleagues are not hearing that this needs to be the end of health care reform,\u201d said State Representative Chris Pearson, the leader of the legislature\u2019s Progressive Caucus.\n\nDr. Deb Richter, the founder of Vermont Healthcare for All said, \u201cI\u2019ve been at this for 26 years and I knew it was a heavy lift to begin with, but I don\u2019t think this is the death knell of single-payer. I think we\u2019re going to have to move more slowly.\u201d\n\nMartha Allen, President of the Vermont teachers (NEA), reiterated the strong labor support for Green Mountain Care. \u201cI and my fellow Vermont-NEA members \u2026urge the Governor and Legislature to get down to business right now so that all Vermonters will understand that a publicly financed, universally available health care system is better for all of us.\u201d\n\nWE\u2019RE ALREADY PAYING\n\nThe Vermont Workers Center, which led the fight, issued a statement emphasizing that Governor Shumlin has a responsibility to enact a financing plan under the health care act. \u201c[We] remind the Governor that health care is a human right\u2026We all currently pay for our hodgepodge health care system. Moving to a different financing mechanism has nothing to do with raising new money\u2026The Governor\u2019s task at hand was to shift private payments to a more equitable public financing mechanism.\u201d\n\nThey added that they did not believe that the governor \u201cshowed sufficient commitment to identifying alternative public financing mechanisms for a service that is already being paid for by all of us.\u201d They pledged to keep fighting for an \u201cequitable public financing plan for universal health care in our state.\u201d\n\nThe Labor Campaign for Single Payer, at its national strategy conference last summer, resolved that all of labor owes a debt of solidarity to the Vermont health care justice movement.\n\nNow labor can stand with Vermont in the fight to secure the promise of health care for all. Healthcare-NOW! has posted a petition urging the legislature to move forward with the enactment of Green Mountain Care. You can sign it here.\n\nMark Dudzic is national coordinator of the Labor Campaign for Single Payer.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://labornotes.org/sites/dc.lndev.opa.labornotes.org/files/logo_with_slogan.png"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201c[We] remind the Governor that health care is a human right\u2026We all currently pay for our hodgepodge health care system.\nVermont Governor Peter Shumlin announced Wednesday that he was suspending his efforts to implement Green Mountain Care, the 2011 law that makes health care a right for every Vermonter.\nReaction from state health care justice activists to his December 17 announcement ranged from disappointment to outrage.\nNow labor can stand with Vermont in the fight to secure the promise of health care for all.\n\u201cPushing for single payer health care when the time isn\u2019t right and it might hurt our economy would not be good for Vermont,\u201d he added."}
