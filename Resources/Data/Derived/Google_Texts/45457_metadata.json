They're trying to go beyond that.\u201d\n\nPlanning commission members early last month unanimously approved the Penguins' preliminary development plan for the property, owned by the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Sports and Exhibition Authority. But commissioners ruled against the Hill Community Development Corp.'s request to make the agreement a legally binding part of the plan.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Friday claims the decision to approve the plan was \u201carbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion\u201d because it was based on zoning changes that have yet to be adopted by Pittsburgh City Council.\n\nKevin Acklin, who chairs the URA, said the development will trigger revitalization of the Hill District and adjacent Uptown neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cIt is our intention to forge ahead,\u201d said Acklin, who serves as chief of staff to Mayor Bill Peduto. \u201cWe think it's unfortunate that the appeal was filed. We think it is in the best interests of the Hill District and the city to proceed with the agreement in place.\u201d\n\nKamin said the neighborhood group agrees that the development will benefit the city and its residents.\n\n\u201cWe're all for this development,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just don't want it to be railroaded through without paying attention to the agreement. We want a written commitment that the Pens will live by their obligations. \u2026\u201d\n\nCity officials plan to use arena site development to generate funds for redeveloping Uptown and other parts of the Hill District.\n\nPeduto in September proposed a 20-year, tax-increment financing district, which would take a percentage of tax revenue generated by the development and reinvest it in infrastructure and buildings in the neighborhoods.\n\nBob Bauder is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
