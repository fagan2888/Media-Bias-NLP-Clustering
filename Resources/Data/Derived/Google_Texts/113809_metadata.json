Jacksonville has played host to the game for 82 consecutive years. As of right now, the contract has not been extended beyond next year\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cAs Jacksonville continues to revolve as a destination, people want to be here,\u201d said Dave Herrell, city of Jacksonville, sports and entertainment officer. \u201cIt's certainly not just a game, it's an event. It's an entire weekend of activities. \u201c\n\nThe numbers show that once again, the game was a huge win for the city. On the field and in the community, these numbers show why this game is one of the marquee events in Jacksonville.\n\nInside the stadium, it was another packed house. Across the street in RV City fans spent much of the week in Jacksonville, pouring money into the local economy. And for hotels, the numbers were great, with 37,270 total room nights.\n\nAll the weekend-long activities are key to getting people to stay in town longer and spend more of their money locally. This also helps at a time that would otherwise be quiet for the hospitality industry and employees in town.\n\nHerrell says the recent and upcoming upgrades in and around the stadium only help the efforts to keep this game and the economic impact it brings. City council on Tuesday night approved funding for a new amphitheater to be built next to the stadium at EverBank Field.\n\n\u201cWith an event like Florida-Georgia, having those new opportunities coming online is certainly going to add complement, but we are doing it from an event perspective,\u201d Herrell said.\n\nThe city sports council recognizes the impact of having a facility like an amphitheater for events like the Florida-Georgia game.\n\n\u201cWhat they are doing here gives us a facility that creates huge amounts of premium revenue that you can negotiate a deal with different people,\u201d Rick Catlett, president, Jacksonville Sports Council. \u201cYou can bring Navy/Notre Dame in here, you can get an FSU neutral site game. That's the power of what Mr. Khan and the Jaguars are doing.\u201d\n\nThe Gators came out on top this year, beating Georgia 27-3, but city businesses also won, particularly restaurants and hotels. More than 37,000 total room nights were booked, according to Visit Jacksonville. Nearly 140,000 tourists spent the weekend in Jacksonville hotels.\n\n\u201cThe positive results from the annual Florida-Georgia game underscore the importance of this event to our community,\u201d Mayor Lenny Curry said in a news release. \u201cThis event drives economic impact benefits and amplifies our community as a leading destination for major events.\u201d\n\nFlorida-Georgia football game 2015 impact breakdown*:\n\nBusiness sales (direct): $20,340,053\n\nBusiness sales (total): $35,302,992\n\nRoom nights (total): 37,270\n\nTotal visitors: 138,539\n\nTotal local tax receipts: $1,290,581\n\nTelevision ratings: 3.1\n\nTelevision viewership: 5,015,000\n\n*information from CBS Television and Visit Jacksonville\n\nCopyright 2015 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/14/Florida-Georgia-logo--2013-_436427_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Chris Parenteau", "description": "The total impact from this year's Florida-Georgia game was over $35 million this year, a jump of more than $2 million from 2014.", "author": "Chris Parenteau", "og": {"site_name": "WJXT", "description": "The total impact from this year's Florida-Georgia game was over $35 million this year, a jump of more than $2 million from 2014.", "title": "Florida-Georgia game has $35M economic impact", "url": "http://www.news4jax.com/news/local/jacksonville/florida-georgia-has-35m-economic-impact", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/14/Florida-Georgia-logo--2013-_436427_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The total impact from this year's Florida-Georgia game was over $35 million this year, a jump of more than $2 million from 2014.", "title": "Florida-Georgia has $35M economic impact", "url": "http://www.news4jax.com/news/local/jacksonville/florida-georgia-has-35m-economic-impact", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/14/Florida-Georgia-logo--2013-_436427_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@wjxt4", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-12T01:44:38+0000", "robots": "nofollow", "sailthru.title": "Florida-Georgia has $35M economic impact", "sailthru.tags": "Money,Jacksonville,Entertainment,Sports,Gators Football,Bulldogs Football", "fb": {"app_id": 196517170397638}, "keywords": "Money,Jacksonville,Entertainment,Sports,Gators Football,Bulldogs Football", "article": {"section": "Jacksonville", "published_time": "2015-12-12T01:44:38+0000", "modified_time": "2015-12-12T01:44:38+0000", "author": "http://www.news4jax.com/author/chris.parenteau"}, "news_keywords": "Entertainment", "content_id": 166346468, "sailthru.description": "The total impact from this year's Florida-Georgia game was over $35 million this year, a jump of more than $2 million from 2014.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.news4jax.com/photo/2015/11/14/Florida-Georgia-logo--2013-_436427_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page-type": "article"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ef4\"", "article_summary": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - The city released numbers today indicating a $35 million in economic impact from the Florida-Georgia game.\nThe city sports council recognizes the impact of having a facility like an amphitheater for events like the Florida-Georgia game.\nHerrell says the recent and upcoming upgrades in and around the stadium only help the efforts to keep this game and the economic impact it brings.\n\u201cThe positive results from the annual Florida-Georgia game underscore the importance of this event to our community,\u201d Mayor Lenny Curry said in a news release.\nOn the field and in the community, these numbers show why this game is one of the marquee events in Jacksonville."}
