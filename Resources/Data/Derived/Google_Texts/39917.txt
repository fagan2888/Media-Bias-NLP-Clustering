SOUTHLAKE, Texas — DeMarcus Ware joins the Broncos with 117 career sacks and a wealth of knowledge in how to attain optimum performance.

Ware recently sent out an Instagram that showed him laying flat on his stomach and at least 20 jars positioned on his back. A lady with a lighting device was standing over him.

Following a workout Thursday at Impact Performance & Fitness, Ware explained he was going through a therapy called “cupping,” an Eastern medicine technique.

“It is like a jar, and you put a hot fire in there and the heat that’s in there just sucks the skin up in there,” Ware said. “It keeps your pores open and it sucks that bad blood that’s on the surface of your epidermis. The skin. It helps with blood flow. It helps out a lot.”

Although he is two weeks away from turning 32, Ware says he has never felt better. A pass-rushing outside linebacker by trade, he tried to play near 270 pounds — 15 more pounds than usual — as a defensive end last season when the Dallas Cowboys switched from a 3-4 to a 4-3.

The Broncos play a 4-3 but there are enough 3-4 principles to where Ware mostly starts from the stand-up position. Working in the offseason with his longtime personal trainer Kevin Kordish, Ware’s weight is down to 250-255 pounds.

“I feel better than I did the last two years going into the season,” Ware said. “Stronger, faster. I feel flexible.”
