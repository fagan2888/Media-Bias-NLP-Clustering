Well, we\u2019ll find out soon, because Stewart announced Tuesday he\u2019s leaving the seat after 16 years. The comedian hasn\u2019t announced his post-show plans yet, but we can only hope that whatever it is, it involves his style of lancing the inflated egos of the powerful with his sharp wit \u2014 and otherwise mocking the world\u2019s absurdities that other TV news shows ignore. In his tenure at Comedy Central, Stewart was at his best when he used the cloak of comedy to land some punches on deserving targets. Here are the 10 best times Jon Stewart kept it real.\n\nThe most busted name in news\n\nStewart was at his best when he was attacking the innate absurdity of 24-hour news, which means that Fox was far from his only target. His jabs at CNN for being a doofy, self-serious organization that turned news into a sport came to a head during the Boston bombing aftermath. The network flubbed its \u201cexclusive\u201d news of an arrest which never happened.\n\n\u201cOh it\u2019s exclusive, because it was completely f - - king wrong,\u201d he says.\n\nAttack on Bulls - - t Mountain\n\nMaybe no target got as much attention from Stewart as Fox News Channel. You can tell his frustrations with the network had taken a new form when he coined the term \u201cBulls - - t Mountain\u201d during the 2012 election, when the network tied itself in knots to defend Mitt Romney\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cThe turd containment crews have been working overtime,\u201d he says.\n\nStewart versus Cramer\n\nAfter the collapse of the financial market, Stewart took the financial networks to task for failing to predict the fallout. When CNBC host Jim Cramer came on the show, Stewart pinned him to the wall, using Cramer\u2019s own clips against him. Cramer seemed humbled by the lashing; he could barely think of anything to say but to apologize.\n\nThe ObamaCare challenge\n\nStewart\u2019s targets were the absurdities of politics, not any one party. That\u2019s on display in this interview with Kathleen Sebelius, then secretary of health and human services, right after the disastrous ObamaCare rollout.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do a challenge,\u201d he says, pulling a laptop onto his desk. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to download every movie ever made, and you\u2019re going to try to sign up for ObamaCare, and we\u2019ll see which happens first.\u201d\n\nAdvocating the James Zadroga bill\n\nIt\u2019s a rare sight to see Stewart come off the bench and actually advocate for a cause, but when he did it, he went big. His biggest chance to do that was in helping get the James Zadroga 9/11 first responders health bill passed. He called out the hypocritical Republicans who had used 9/11 as a cudgel for other issues but were not acting on this one, and had a panel of first responders on the show to talk about why it was needed. The successful effort earned him comparisons to Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite.\n\nPizza etiquette with Donald Trump\n\nDonald Trump has given Stewart lots of material to work with. But nothing got the comedian more worked up than when Trump took Sarah Palin to a, let\u2019s say, less-than-representative New York pizza place, instead of getting an authentic slice. To top it off, Trump ate his meal with a fork.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump, why don\u2019t you just take that fork and stick it right in New York\u2019s eye.\u201d\n\nGlenn Beck parody\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so ingenious it almost doesn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever,\u201d Stewart says while donning thick glasses and scribbling over a chalkboard in the fashion of Glenn Beck\u2019s paranoid ramblings. This 15-minute parody is pitch-perfect as it unwinds into frantic rantings, revealing the true villain behind it all: Bert of \u201cSesame Street.\u201d\n\nBush versus Bush\n\nAs the conflict in Iraq was ratcheting up and the first Bush term was winding down, Stewart brought on \u201cthe one man we believe who has the insight and cojones to stand up to\u201d the president: a younger George W. Bush. The head-to-head debate was one of the best moments where Stewart and his team used the simple act of video research to reveal political hypocrisy.\n\nThe \u201cWar\u201d on Christmas\n\n\u201cYou might wonder why on this news channel they\u2019re making assertions of fact about a fictional character?\u201d Stewart asks before going off on Fox News\u2019 opposition to the idea of a black Santa.\n\nPost-9/11 return\n\nIt\u2019s easy to still get choked up watching this clip now, even 14 years after the attacks. Stewart opened his first show back on the air with a heartfelt, teary-eyed and stirring message of hope. Coming from him, it means something: The view from his downtown apartment at the time used to be the Twin Towers; after the attacks, he says in the clip, it was the Statue of Liberty. It marked the change in tone for the show, too: After this episode, Stewart started focusing on political topics and guests more, which was how the show really started to shine.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s light, it\u2019s democracy,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve already won.
