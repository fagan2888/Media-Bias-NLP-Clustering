LOS ANGELES — Goalie Semyon Varlamov is scheduled to start against the Los Angeles Kings tonight at Staples Center, and no lineup changes are expected from Thursday’s 4-3 overtime win at Phoenix. The Denver district attorney on Friday filed a third-degree assault charge, a misdemeanor, against Varlamov in his October domestic dispute with his girlfriend. Varlamov was originally facing much more serious charges.

The 16-5 Avs are going into this game a little blind, given that their warmup will be their first opportunity on the Staples Center ice this season. The NBA’s Lakers and Clippers played at home Friday night and this afternoon, respectively, so both teams might encounter bad ice. The Avs practiced Friday afternoon at a suburban rink but could not get that same ice today.

With this 8:30 p.m. MT start, our game story might only be available online at denverpost.com/sports.

Footnotes. This is the first of three meetings between the Avs and Kings. The Avs were 1-1-1 against L.A. last season. The Kings own an all-time lead of 54-50-8-4 against Colorado. . . . The Avs entered the game fifth in the NHL in goals-per-game (3.24) and goals-against (2.14) and San Jose was the only other team in the top five in both categories. . . . Colorado was 7-2 on the road and 2-0 in overtime. The Avs and New York Rangers are the NHL’s only teams to not have gone into a shootout.
