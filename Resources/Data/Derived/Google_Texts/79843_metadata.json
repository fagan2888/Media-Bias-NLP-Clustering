It\u2019s just what she was thinking as she took the oath, or at least we must assume.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable, I guess. The \u201cbecause I can\u201d part and the partisan part have become endemic to the politically driven nature of the office of attorney general.\n\nColoradans, regardless of party, should hope Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, succeeds in a long-shot attempt to stop Coffman, or any other attorney general, from suing on behalf of the state without consulting with the governor.\n\nNow, you might say that Hickenlooper exercises the \u201cbecause I can\u201d clause just like Coffman. Well, there\u2019s a big difference. He\u2019s the state\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nThe attorney general is the state\u2019s chief legal officer. It shouldn\u2019t follow that he or she can sue on behalf of Colorado whenever the urge hits.\n\nUnderstand: Coffman isn\u2019t breaking new ground. Her predecessor did the same. It just so happens that he, too, was a Republican.\n\nHickenlooper has asked the Colorado Supreme Court to put the clamps on the practice.\n\nThe roles could be reversed, and that would be no better. A Democratic attorney general could do his party\u2019s or his donors\u2019 bidding and say he or she was representing all of us. That wouldn\u2019t be true, of course.\n\nHowever, ask the political party, or industries with a stake in a certain matter, say the coal industry fighting President Obama\u2019s directives on reducing greenhouse gases, and the word is, \u201cGo get \u2018em, Cynthia.\u201d\n\nThen-Republican Attorney General John Suthers sued to stop the Affordable Care Act even as the state was expanding Medicaid and as thousands of Coloradans were signing up for low-cost health coverage through http://connectforhealthco.com.\n\nCoffman, meanwhile, has inserted Colorado into three lawsuits supported by energy industries. She joined a Wyoming suit fighting federal rules for fracking on federal lands. So, too, with a North Dakota lawsuit challenging federal clean air rules.\n\nNow Coffman, on our behalf, has joined a suit challenging an Environmental Protection Agency directive to curb air pollution from power plants.\n\nColorado isn\u2019t alone in having this problem. Governors in New Mexico and Michigan say they are committed to meeting the EPA standards. At the same time, Republican attorneys general in those states are suing to block them.\n\n\u201cThe attorney general represents the state and not the governor,\u201d Coffman told the Denver Post. She said her role is to be an \u201cindependent\u201d agent for the state\u2019s interests.\n\nOnce again, this isn\u2019t just a problem associated with a rogue elephant. It could just as easily be a donkey with an independent (read \u201cpartisan\u201d) streak.\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office shouldn\u2019t be red or blue. It should be a neutral hue.\n\nUntil the state Supreme Court rules, however, Coloradans should know that the office holder can and will act according to party dictates, not general consensus. They should vote accordingly.\n\nJohn Young is a Coloradoan columnist who writes about state and local issues.
