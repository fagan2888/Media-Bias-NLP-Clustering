Analysts and investors have been predicting a wave of mergers after the Supreme Court declared the Affordable Care Act - also known as Obamacare - as legal on June 25.\n\nThat decision was widely seen as the most conclusive of a string of legal challenges to the act.\n\nThe law, which was originally passed in 2010, has led to an increase in the number of those with health insurance in the US, plus more pressure on prices. As a result, some fusions have already taken place.\n\nMega-mergers\n\nOn Thursday, St. Louis-based health care provider Centene announced a $6.3-billion bid for fellow insurer Health Net to create a combined company with about 6 million Medicaid members, making it one of the largest in the country.\n\nMedicaid is the state- and federally-funded program for the poor and people with disabilities, which the Affordable Care Act significantly expanded.\n\nOn June 20, Anthem went public with a more than $47 billion cash-and-stock bid for Cigna, which Cigna rejected in a letter sent to Anthem the next day.\n\n\"The wave of consolidation sweeping the (managed care) industry is accelerating as players seek to establish their own market position,\" Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said in a note to investors announcing the Centene deal.\n\nLike other health insurers, the share prices of both companies have hit all-time highs this year and advanced much further than the broader market.\n\nbk/pad (AP, dpa, Reuters)", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "Deutsche Welle (www.dw.com)", "language": "en_GB", "description": "Two major health care providers in the US are set to merge after Aetna bought rival Humana.
