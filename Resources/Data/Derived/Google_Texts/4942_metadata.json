I hate doctors. I hate being sick.\u201d The 60-year-old has been off medications for nearly a decade. He lives with and cares for his 88-year-old mother. (Lauren M. Whaley/CHCF Center for Health Reporting)\n\nThis story originally appeared in the Modesto Bee.\n\nJim Christiansen manages his bipolar disorder by painting, getting massage therapy and going to support groups.\n\n\u201cMy big thing is stay well,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be sick. I hate doctors. I hate being sick.\u201d\n\nThe 60-year-old has been off medications for nearly a decade. He lives with and cares for his 88-year-old mother.\n\nAfter losing his job as a project manager on construction sites in 2001, he turned a childhood pastime of making art into a career.\n\n\u201cYou can be eccentric,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to hide out? Fine. I\u2019m working on art. Once in a while, you stay in bed because you\u2019re a little depressed.\u201d\n\nChristiansen had always been an artist, he said, selling pieces since he was 14. He renewed his membership in the Central California Art Association, won awards for watercolor pieces and started writing the ModestoView art column. He is now on the steering committee for the Stanislaus Artists Open Studio Tour and is currently showing at Gallery Red in Las Vegas.\n\nIn addition to art, he also found support from the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Stanislaus County, around 2001 and taught a course there from 2005 to 2014 that focused on sharing his personal story to help others suffering from mental illness.\n\nAnd while he calls himself an \u201cactivist\u201d for mental health issues, he is careful not to center his life around the issue.\n\n\u201cThere is a tendency to live your life full-time mental health, going to med check, groups, their volunteer meeting discussions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it can be a trap.\u201d\n\nChristiansen is one of the 1.4 million Californians under the Affordable Care Act who recently qualified for Medi-Cal, California\u2019s version of the federal Medicaid program for low-income residents. But he said he doesn\u2019t see a psychiatrist or therapist regularly and only goes to the doctor in an emergency.\n\nIn one manic state several years ago, he recalled, he wasn\u2019t able to stop talking. He recovered from that episode with the help of acupressure. In an earlier extreme case, he smashed the windows of his house; that incident landed him in the emergency room.\n\n\u201cI never want to go back, if at all possible,\u201d he said. His last inpatient experience was in 2005.\n\nEmergency rooms are not the answer, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is no real intensive counseling to emergency care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more baby-sitting, seeing that you don\u2019t kill yourself or mess up somebody else. Then you\u2019re released. Then you\u2019re on your own.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "And while he calls himself an \u201cactivist\u201d for mental health issues, he is careful not to center his life around the issue.\n\u201cThere is a tendency to live your life full-time mental health, going to med check, groups, their volunteer meeting discussions,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMy big thing is stay well,\u201d Jim Christiansen says.\nJim Christiansen manages his bipolar disorder by painting, getting massage therapy and going to support groups.\nI hate being sick.\u201d The 60-year-old has been off medications for nearly a decade."}
