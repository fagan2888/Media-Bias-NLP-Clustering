Niemi reportedly has inside knowledge of the move. \u201cThat\u2019s what started the conversation. They had focus groups with their employees. Their people said, \u2018We\u2019re willing to move. We just want to live the American Dream.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 12 States with the Hottest Housing Markets\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nToyota, which has had its headquarters in California for more than 30 years, calculated that the cost of housing in the Dallas-Fort Worth area is about a third the cost of housing in Los Angeles County. The overall cost of living is about 30 percent cheaper, according to CNNMoney.\n\nDespite the lure of low-cost housing, it\u2019s unlikely that the majority of workers will follow Toyota to the new digs. CEO Jim Lentz has acknowledged that only about a quarter of employees typically stick with companies during a cross-country move, but implied that the total may be higher for Toyota.\n\nToyota\u2019s $300 million Texas headquarters will open in 2017, and will eventually accommodate up to 5,000 workers.\n\nWhile home prices may have been a main driver, the company was likely also motivated by Texas\u2019s lower taxes and a regulatory climate that\u2019s seen as much more favorable to business. The $40 million incentive offered by the state probably didn\u2019t hurt either.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Toyota, which has had its headquarters in California for more than 30 years, calculated that the cost of housing in the Dallas-Fort Worth area is about a third the cost of housing in Los Angeles County.", "title": "The Big Reason Toyota Is Moving 3,000 Jobs from California to Texas", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/15/Big-Reason-Toyota-Moving-3000-Jobs-California-Texas", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/toyota-motor-recall_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/15/Big-Reason-Toyota-Moving-3000-Jobs-California-Texas", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/toyota-motor-recall_1.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Toyota, which has had its headquarters in California for more than 30 years, calculated that the cost of housing in the Dallas-Fort Worth area is about a third the cost of housing in Los Angeles County.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Toyota\u2019s $300 million Texas headquarters will open in 2017, and will eventually accommodate up to 5,000 workers.\nToyota North America made a big announcement in April 2014: It would move its corporate headquarters from Torrance, Calif., to Plano, Texas over a period of a few years.\nDespite the lure of low-cost housing, it\u2019s unlikely that the majority of workers will follow Toyota to the new digs.\nThere was another big factor, too: \u201cIt was really about affordable housing,\u201d Albert Niemi, dean of the Southern Methodist University Cox School of Business said recently, according to the Dallas Business Journal.\nThe overall cost of living is about 30 percent cheaper, according to CNNMoney."}
