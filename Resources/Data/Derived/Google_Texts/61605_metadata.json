Scott Walker \u201cpunting\u201d on an evolution question, blogger Sean Davis passed an entertaining afternoon by asking some of Walker\u2019s outspoken critics what they think \u201cevolution\u201d means, and which version of evolutionary theory they believe is flawless truth beyond all criticism. As the answers \u2014 which could fairly be said to involve a good deal of \u201cpunting\u201d \u2014 proved, the people hassling Walker generally didn\u2019t know much about evolutionary theory themselves.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nLike other forays into politicized science, the Walker flap is about tribalism, not rational debate.\n\nWalker\u2019s critics are sending smoke signals to each other that Walker is Not One of Them \u2014 he\u2019s supposedly a member of a hostile tribe of mouth-breathing religious zealots, feared and fought by Western liberals with far more energy than the actual mouth-breathing religious zealots who want to kill them.\n\nDeclaring \u201cI believe in evolution!\u201d is a tribal identifier that requires zero knowledge of biology. Most of the people who make this declaration could not tell you the title of Charles Darwin\u2019s book, let alone discuss its contents in detail. Failure to declare \u201cI believe in evolution!\u201d when put on the spot sends a different tribal identification signal.\n\nThis is also part of the motivation behind liberals\u2019 savagely attacks on Walker\u2019s education background, which includes a stint in college he did not finish. Given how thoroughly a gang of utterly incompetent but highly-credentialed boobs have wrecked the country over the past six years, and how they\u2019re planning to run a woman who has nothing whatsoever on her resume except credentials \u2014 or maybe an academic whose career was marked with numerous attempts to gain advantage by falsely claiming to be an American Indian \u2014 one would think liberals would know better than to crank up such an elitist campaign this time around. It\u2019s going to be hilarious watching them try to palm filthy-rich corporatist royalty like Hillary Clinton or Elizabeth Warren off as \u201cpopulists\u201d against someone with a biography like Walker\u2019s, or Marco Rubio\u2019s, or especially Ben Carson\u2019s.\n\nThe perfect distillation of this absurdity was former Gov. Howard Dean, both a medical doctor and a shrieking lunatic, insisting that Walker is \u201cunknowledgeable\u201d and unqualified to run because he didn\u2019t get that all-important college diploma. Yes, clearly America needs more sophisticated guidance from Democrats with advanced degrees, such as Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon.\n\nCredentials have value, which is why everyone lists them on their resumes. Credentials are not the only thing that matters, which is why everyone puts other information on their resumes. Americans have gotten a bellyful over vacuous appeals to authority and \u201cshut up, because I said so\u201d arguments over the past few years. They\u2019ve watched a long string of alleged geniuses fall flat on their faces. They\u2019ve heard a procession of powerful people with formidable academic backgrounds explain why lying is acceptable, and the elite should never be held accountable for the failure of their plans. If the right lessons are taken from the utter collapse of managerial liberalism, there will be deep skepticism of the next central planner who thinks \u201cdon\u2019t you realize who I am?\u201d is the only argument he or she will ever need. This might well work to the disadvantage of Republican candidates trying to run from the Senate, or completely outside of politics, because a properly skeptical electorate will want to see hard evidence that presidential aspirants can run a big operation better than Barack Obama. Walker will be among those who can offer such evidence.\n\nTribalism has its place in society \u2014 it can be a lot of fun, as sports fans will happily attest \u2014 but it\u2019s a downright horrible way to select political leadership. Like just about everything else, tribalism goes sour when mixed with compulsion, and that\u2019s what political power is all about. Walker\u2019s answer on evolution amounted to dismissing the question as irrelevant to his job, and he\u2019s right, provided he has no intention of using the coercive power of the State to impose his beliefs on the rest of the nation.\n\nObama, on the other hand, is very happy to use enormous amounts of coercive power to impose his beliefs on the rest of us, including his irrational zealotry for the Church of Global Warming. As Kevin Williamson of National Review points out, Obamacare forces taxpayers to cover a great deal of New Age quackery under the guise of medicine, because such decidedly non-scientific beliefs are fashionable among Obama supporters: \u201cIf you\u2019re a coastal progressive type, people who believe that every word of the Bible is literally true in a natural-history sense are creepy and weird, but when Dr. Moonbeam McEarthgoddess promises to manipulate your mystical energy pathways so that your qi cures your osteoarthritis \u2014 then, bring on the federal subsidies.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t need any more of that, thanks. A chief executive who is humble before the potential of the unfettered American people is what we do need. Such humility is in very short supply among the tribes of the Left.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing new about the Left trying to disguise its ideology as objective truth and present itself as the Tribe of Science. It\u2019s similar to the way earlier collectivists sought to portray resistance to their demands as a form of insanity \u2014 the Soviets, for example, were very big on portraying dissidents as suffering from mental illness, and the American Left took a stab at it, too. Their new mania for \u201cscience\u201d and unquestioning deference to academic credentials is another way of accomplishing the same goal \u2014 obviously in the case of the Walker evolution flap, as the strong implication from those who found his comments unsatisfactory is that he\u2019s a delusional religious fanatic, or at least unduly sympathetic to them.\n\nBeyond its utility as a means of telling people to shut up, because dissent is stupid and crazy, the Tribe of Science idea provides an intellectual framework for breaking down the notion of unalienable rights, which are profoundly troublesome to those who worship the State. Liberals have a great deal of trouble accepting the notion of \u201crights that come from God,\u201d not because they\u2019re irreligious, but because they believe the State should give, take, and redistribute rights as its masters see fit. The concept of rights that every man, woman, and child holds in equal measure \u2014 from the most deserving pauper, to the most \u201cunfairly\u201d wealthy One Percenter \u2014 is infuriating to those who believe equality is something the State imposes, not something it is obliged to respect.\n\nThe Left wants us to accept obedience as the essence of sanity and reason. That\u2019s why the tireless defenders of the whimsical, unaffordable, underperforming mess in Washington are so keen to portray everyone else as crazy and stupid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Like other forays into politicized science, the Scott Walker flap is about tribalism, not rational debate.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Like other forays into politicized science, the Scott Walker flap is about tribalism, not rational debate.", "title": "Attacks On Scott Walker Preview An Elitist 2016 Campaign", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/walker.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/14/the-left-uses-scott-walker-to-position-itself-as-the-tribe-of-science/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Like other forays into politicized science, the Scott Walker flap is about tribalism, not rational debate.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/walker.jpg", "title": "Attacks On Scott Walker Preview An Elitist 2016 Campaign", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, College, Evolution, Howard Dean, obamacare, Scott Walker,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,scott walker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Scott Walker", "published_time": "2015-02-14T14:16:17-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce689\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERLike other forays into politicized science, the Walker flap is about tribalism, not rational debate.\nFailure to declare \u201cI believe in evolution!\u201d when put on the spot sends a different tribal identification signal.\nDeclaring \u201cI believe in evolution!\u201d is a tribal identifier that requires zero knowledge of biology.\nThis is also part of the motivation behind liberals\u2019 savagely attacks on Walker\u2019s education background, which includes a stint in college he did not finish.\nLike just about everything else, tribalism goes sour when mixed with compulsion, and that\u2019s what political power is all about."}
