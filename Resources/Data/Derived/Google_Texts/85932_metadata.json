Their research was presented at the British Thoracic Society\u2019s Winter Meeting, which was held in London.\n\nThe researchers hope that if the test continues to prove successful, it could improve earlier diagnoses of the disease, and boost chances for lung cancer patients to survive in the future. \u201cThis non-invasive test can help identify those who are at greatest risk within adult smokers, and may help target CT screening far more effectively,\u201d Professor Sam Janes of the University College London, an author of the study, said according to the Daily Mail. \u201cOur vision for the future is that smokers could get a test in the GP or pharmacy, swab their mouth or nose, and the sample is then sent off for analysis. The earlier lung cancer is detected the better the outcome.\u201d It\u2019s true that late diagnoses when it comes to many cancers can be severely detrimental, but only about 10 percent of late-diagnosed lung cancer patients will live up to five years after their diagnosis. But there\u2019s about a 50 percent survival rate if people are diagnosed early enough.\n\nCurrently, lung cancer is diagnosed mostly by symptoms \u2014 such as a lingering cough, chest discomfort, shortness of breath, spitting up blood, weight loss, loss of appetite, and general fatigue \u2014 but by then it's often too late. A regular chest X-Ray is not \u201creliable enough to find lung tumors in their earliest stages,\u201d according to LungCancer.org, so the American Society of Clinical Oncologists suggests that smokers and former smokers get annual screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). But if the test and swab proves efficient and accurate, detecting lung cancer might be a lot easier soon.\n\nPreviously, scientists had discovered that pure light generated by a synchrotron particle accelerator was scattered differently by the cells in someone at a higher risk of cancer \u2014 and soon they found that infrared light could reproduce this effect in the lab. In the study, the researchers examined cell samples from 76 smokers, half of whom had lung cancer. Lung cancer tumors can often cause small abnormalities to develop in all the cells in their lungs, mouth, and nose \u2014 often so subtle that it\u2019s hard to tell unless a doctor shines an infrared light onto the cells. These abnormal cells, the researchers found, reflected the light differently than healthy cells.\n\n\u201cTobacco smoke exposure seems to cause a different type of injury to cells in those that go on to develop lung cancer,\u201d Janes said, according to the Daily Mail. \u201cIf we can use this detection system early enough maybe we can spot lung cancer at a much earlier stage or even inform whether an individual is at risk of lung cancer. Our study, using infrared light to examine such cells for the first time, revealed that the cells of smokers with lung cancer could be differentiated from those without lung cancer with an accuracy of 80 percent.\u201d\n\nNext, the researchers plan on taking samples from a larger population, then keeping track of participants over a longer period of time to see who develops lung cancer. \u201cThis research clarifies the need for early screening, as certain forms of lung cancer can only be surgically treated in the earliest stages,\u201d Jane said. \u201cMore needs to be done to reach those in the community who have high risk factors, and encourage early screening to detect lung cancer as quickly as possible. The sooner we can treat, the better the chance of survival for these patients.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "lung cancer test, lung cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers discovered that people who are at a higher risk of developing lung cancer can be warned by taking cell samples from their mouth and nose.", "title": "New Test For Smokers Could Show Lung Cancer Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-lung-cancer-test-shows-smokers-their-risks-disease-313114", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/04/smoker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers discovered that people who are at a higher risk of developing lung cancer can be warned by taking cell samples from their mouth and nose.", "title": "New Test For Smokers Could Show Lung Cancer Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-lung-cancer-test-shows-smokers-their-risks-disease-313114", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/04/smoker.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/04/smoker.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2014-12-04T12:49:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-04T12:49:45-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers discovered that people who are at a higher risk of developing lung cancer can be warned by taking cell samples from their mouth and nose."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecfe\"", "article_summary": "The earlier lung cancer is detected the better the outcome.\u201d It\u2019s true that late diagnoses when it comes to many cancers can be severely detrimental, but only about 10 percent of late-diagnosed lung cancer patients will live up to five years after their diagnosis.\n\u201cIf we can use this detection system early enough maybe we can spot lung cancer at a much earlier stage or even inform whether an individual is at risk of lung cancer.\nBut if the test and swab proves efficient and accurate, detecting lung cancer might be a lot easier soon.\nIn the study, the researchers examined cell samples from 76 smokers, half of whom had lung cancer.\nThe researchers hope that if the test continues to prove successful, it could improve earlier diagnoses of the disease, and boost chances for lung cancer patients to survive in the future."}
