The return, well, that\u2019s another story.\n\nIndeed, the proliferation of wild turkeys nationwide is among the most successful wildlife restoration stories in the history of North America. And here in Colorado, the birds have never been more plentiful, measured at more than 35,000.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean turkeys are easy prey. As hunters making their way into the woods for the spring season that began just before sunrise Saturday will attest, wild gobblers can seemingly vanish in an instant.\n\nThe fortunate few who drew limited licenses this spring will generally look to the Eastern Plains, where habits of the Rio Grande subspecies are easily patterned \u2014 returning to roost in the same trees most nights, feeding in the same fields by day. There\u2019s a reason they are in the minority.\n\nEveryone else \u2014 some 15,000 hunters in the forest and field before the season ends May 24 \u2014 will be doing it the hard way, tracking the more elusive Merriam\u2019s turkey that inhabit about 19,000 square miles of rugged terrain statewide. Consider it a blessing and a curse.\n\n\u201cThese birds (Merriam\u2019s) are movers,\u201d said veteran turkey hunter C.J. Kausel of Green Valley Ranch. \u201cThey\u2019re like mule deer. They move around.\u201d\n\nThe blessing is the widespread prevalence of turkeys. But with so much space to roam, it\u2019s a wonder hunters ever find the birds.\n\nSo where is an overwhelmed turkey hunter to turn?\n\nThe smart money says south. Then west. Statistically speaking, the top producing counties for spring turkeys in Colorado are Archuleta, Mesa, Garfield, Delta, Las Animas, Pueblo, La Plata, Teller, Huerfano and Montrose, more or less in that order. (Yuma actually ties Archuleta, but for Rio Grande turkeys, not Merriam\u2019s.)\n\n\u201cWe may have the best turkey hunting in the state. The mix of ponderosa pine and Gambel oak is the habitat turkeys like,\u201d said Patt Dorsey of Durango, southwest region manager for Colorado Parks and Wildlife. \u201cWe saw tons of wild turkeys this winter. If those big flocks carried over to spring, turkey hunting should be excellent.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little reason to believe Colorado\u2019s southwestern turkey populations would dwindle in the face of such a mild spring. Snowpack in the Four Corners region of the state has already diminished to less than 50 percent of average, offering prime forage and triggering spring mating activity. Similar conditions exist along the New Mexico border to the east, offering strong potential for a promising spring hunt.\n\n\u201cThe report from the property we hunt south of Walsenburg said there were 100 turkeys in the front yard last week,\u201d Kausel said. \u201cThere\u2019s more this year than last year and the weather has been cooperative, so it should be pretty good.\u201d\n\nScott Willoughby: swilloughby @denverpost.com or twitter.com/ swilloughby", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Willoughby: Turkey hunters need to be ready to move with the birds", "title": "Willoughby: Turkey hunters need to be ready to move with the birds", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/11/willoughby-turkey-hunters-need-to-be-ready-to-move-with-the-birds/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T18:36:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T22:14:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fishing, hunting"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd108b\"", "article_summary": "The comeback of the wild turkey in Colorado has been well documented by now.\nIf those big flocks carried over to spring, turkey hunting should be excellent.\u201dThere\u2019s little reason to believe Colorado\u2019s southwestern turkey populations would dwindle in the face of such a mild spring.\nIndeed, the proliferation of wild turkeys nationwide is among the most successful wildlife restoration stories in the history of North America.\n\u201cWe saw tons of wild turkeys this winter.\nAnd here in Colorado, the birds have never been more plentiful, measured at more than 35,000."}
