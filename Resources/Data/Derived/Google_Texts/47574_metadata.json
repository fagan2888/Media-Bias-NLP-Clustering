OK. So here\u2019s where I\u2019m a little bit different: I don\u2019t want people dying on the streets,\u201d he told a CNN town hall on Feb. 18.\n\nAs outraged conservative editorials flooded the Internet the following day, Trump clarified in a tweet that he was referring to the law\u2019s requirement that insurers offer people with pre-existing conditions coverage on the same terms offered to people in robust health.\n\nYet, even though his clarification was logical enough based on the wording of the question he was asked, it\u2019s safe to say that most of the Republican Party\u2019s influential policymakers were hardly assuaged. In their view \u2014 much like the view of the Obama administration \u2014 the individual mandate and coverage guarantee are a package deal: You can\u2019t have the latter without the former, or else people will wait until they are sick to get covered. That would leave the insurance market prone to adverse selection, yielding excessive premiums and the risk of a death spiral.\n\nTrump has eschewed wonkery and position papers, making a pitch that aims for the gut, backed by the candidate\u2019s bravado and little depth of thought. Yet in this case, there\u2019s little doubt that Trump is right, that you can have the coverage guarantee without the mandate, and that the solution could be pretty terrific relative to the ObamaCare status quo.\n\nObamaCare\u2019s Sustainability Problem\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the individual insurance market is not functioning well even with an individual mandate. UnitedHealth (UNH) and Aetna (AET), facing financial losses, have both questioned whether the exchanges are sustainable under current rules.\n\nThe problem with ObamaCare isn\u2019t that insurers participating on the exchanges are making money hand over fist: many are losing large sums. While more competition is a good thing, Trump\u2019s idea of selling insurance across state lines has little or no potential to change ObamaCare\u2019s dynamics because doing so won\u2019t have a major effect on provider costs or on the population that signs up.\n\nThe problem is simple: ObamaCare offers such an unattractive deal to so many millions of people that the exchanges are attracting a pool of customers which is too small, too old and too costly. The logical way to fix the individual insurance market is to start by offering people a deal that makes a lot more sense for their finances.\n\nTo understand how this could work, first consider the example of a couple, age 30, in St. Louis, Mo., with pre-tax income of $40,000 (200% of the poverty level) and a child covered by Medicaid. For this couple, the cheapest silver plan under ObamaCare from Cigna (CI) this year costs about $2,200, which may not be financially feasible, even before their $1,000 deductible and maximum cost-sharing of $4,500.\n\nThe couple could instead buy the cheapest bronze plan for $1,260, but it carries a $13,700 deductible, which means that a trip to the hospital could be financially devastating. Since that\u2019s just the situation that ObamaCare was supposed to fix, it seems beyond the pale to force a couple in this situation to buy coverage or pay a fine of $1,390 \u2014 3.5% of their income. In other words, it\u2019s likely that all the options for this couple are bad, unless they happen to be desperate for health coverage, perhaps because they\u2019re trying to have a second child.\n\nOnce you factor in the threat of a tax penalty for those who go uncovered, the reality is that ObamaCare, which was supposed to be an antidote for inequality, turns out in far too many cases to make inequality worse.\n\nThe chasm between silver and bronze deductibles \u2014 $1,000 vs. $13,700 \u2014 is by design, though clearly a poor one. The architects of ObamaCare decided to attach extra cost-sharing support to silver plans, effectively turning the plans to platinum for low-income beneficiaries. The cost-sharing subsidies work exactly like premium subsidies, paid directly from the government to insurers on a monthly basis, whether or not the policy holder gets medical care.\n\nNo Mandate Required\n\nSimply getting rid of the individual mandate could lead millions of people to drop coverage, sending rates through the roof. But what if, for starters, the government offered that cost-sharing support directly to individuals, instead of paying it out to insurers? If this were done while easing ObamaCare\u2019s age-rating restriction (for bronze plans only) that artificially inflates the cost of coverage for young adults \u2014 a bronze plan costs $1,000 more for a 30-year-old than for a 60-year-old if each earn $25,000 \u2014 the deal offered to this 30-year-old couple would be transformed. They could still get the same level of coverage offered by silver, but if they opted for bronze-level coverage, their policy would cost nothing (vs. $1,260 under ObamaCare today), and they\u2019d have $800 in a Health Savings Account to put toward medical bills (assuming a 4:1 age-rating for bronze). Clearly, no mandate would be needed to get modest-income households to sign up for this kind of coverage.\n\nThis approach resembles the Republican idea of giving people a subsidy and, if they choose catastrophic coverage that costs less, letting them keep what is left over. The problem with GOP plans offered to date is that they make comprehensive coverage a whole lot less affordable for people who really need it \u2014 dramatically so for older people with modest incomes.\n\nKilling ObamaCare Softly\n\nThe potential fallout from taking away coverage that millions are depending on explains why a who\u2019s who of GOP policy wonks has come up with the idea of killing ObamaCare softly \u2014 letting people opt into a Republican vision of health reform and leaving the exchanges to gradually fade away. The only problem is that their idea of a gradual phase-out has zero chance of working.\n\nWhat\u2019s needed is an approach that offers a good deal to the millions who don\u2019t get one under ObamaCare, while continuing to meet the needs of the millions who are happy with their deal. There\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t work and there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t be done without a heavy-handed mandate.\n\nThe keys are giving people much more flexibility over how they use their subsidies; easing age-rating for high-deductible and catastrophic coverage; broadening eligibility to include millions of low-wage, full-time workers that ObamaCare threw under the bus; and creating a level playing field between the middle class who get no help to buy individual market coverage and their peers who get government tax subsidies to buy employer coverage. Lastly, instead of penalizing for not buying coverage, the government could very gradually reduce the level of future health insurance tax subsidies for those who go uninsured, making it a no-win proposition for young invincibles to gamble that they won\u2019t get sick.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Everyone has piled on Donald Trump's comments on ObamaCare's individual mandate, but something he said actually makes sense.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "In what appeared to be another of his jaw-droppers, Donald Trump, who has vowed to\u00a0kill\u00a0ObamaCare and replace it with \u201csomething terrific,\u201d seemingly embraced the law\u2019s most-detes\u2026", "title": "Why TrumpCare Can Be \u2018Terrific\u2019 Without An Individual Mandate", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/commentary/why-trumpcare-wont-need-an-individual-mandate/", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/POL90_trump_022216_Newscom.jpg", "height": 565}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/POL90_trump_022216_Newscom.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "keywords": "donald trump obamacare,donald trump individual mandate", "date": "2016-02-26 05:15:23:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-26T13:15:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-26T05:03:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "ObamaCare\u2019s Sustainability ProblemIt\u2019s clear that the individual insurance market is not functioning well even with an individual mandate.\nNo Mandate RequiredSimply getting rid of the individual mandate could lead millions of people to drop coverage, sending rates through the roof.\nThe logical way to fix the individual insurance market is to start by offering people a deal that makes a lot more sense for their finances.\nThere\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t work and there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t be done without a heavy-handed mandate.\nClearly, no mandate would be needed to get modest-income households to sign up for this kind of coverage."}
