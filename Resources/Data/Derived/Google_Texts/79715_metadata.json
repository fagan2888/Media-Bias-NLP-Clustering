These awards, financed by the Affordable Care Act, are part of a coordinated initiative in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to reduce chronic diseases, promote healthier lifestyles, reduce health disparities, and control health care spending.\n\nThe tribal health program, A Comprehensive Approach to Good Health and Wellness in Indian Country, aims to prevent heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and associated risk factors in American Indian tribes and Alaska Native villages through a holistic approach to population health and wellness. Awardees will use effective community-chosen and culturally adapted public health interventions to\n\nReduce commercial tobacco use and exposure.\n\nImprove nutrition and physical activity.\n\nIncrease support for breastfeeding.\n\nIncrease health literacy.\n\nStrengthen team-based care and links between community resources and clinical services.\n\nHalf of the awards will support tribes directly, and the other half will support tribal organizations to provide leadership, technical assistance, training, and resources to tribes and villages in their Indian Health Service Administrative Areas.\n\nCompared with the general U.S. population, with some regional exceptions, American Indian and Alaskan Native people have higher rates of tobacco use, obesity, and physical inactivity and lower consumption of fruits and vegetables\u2014important risk factors for chronic diseases.\n\n\u201cThe suffering and costs of chronic diseases throughout Indian country are growing,\u201d said Ursula E. Bauer, PhD, MPH, director of CDC\u2019s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. \u201cThese new grants will provide tribes and villages with the resources, tools, training, and know-how they need to help prevent chronic diseases and improve the health and well-being of their people for today and future generations.\u201d\n\nOther new programs announced by CDC will complement and reinforce the tribal health initiative.\n\nState and Local Public Health Actions to Prevent Obesity, Diabetes, and Heart Disease intensifies work in state and large city health departments to prevent obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke and reduce health disparities through community and health system interventions. It is financed by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPartnerships to Improve Community Health supports multi-sector public health strategies to reduce tobacco use and exposure, improve nutrition, increase physical activity, and improve access to chronic disease prevention, risk reduction, and management opportunities. Projects will serve large cities and urban counties, small cities and counties, and American Indian tribes.\n\nRacial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) supports strategies in racial and ethnic communities to improve health and reduce health disparities. It is financed in part by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNational Implementation and Dissemination for Chronic Disease Prevention supports national organizations to help smaller communities and those with limited public health capacity to reduce tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke, improve nutrition, increase physical activity, and improve access to programs for preventing and managing chronic diseases.\n\nPrograms to Reduce Obesity in High-Obesity Areas funds land grant universities located in states with counties that have more than 40 percent prevalence of adult obesity. Universities will work through existing cooperative extension and outreach services in those counties to improve residents\u2019 access to healthy foods and physical activity opportunities, reduce obesity, and prevent and control diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.\n\nChronic diseases are responsible for 7 of 10 deaths among Americans each year, and they account for more than 80 percent of the $2.7 trillion our nation spends annually on medical care.\n\nThe 22 new tribal health program awardees are:\n\nAlaska, Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium\u2014$1,096,303\n\nArizona, InterTribal Council of Arizona, Inc.\u2014 $850,000\n\nArizona, San Carlos Apache Tribal Council\u2014$189,263\n\nCalifornia, California Rural Indian Health Board, Inc.\u2014$788,972\n\nCalifornia, United Indian Health Services, Inc.\u2014$650,000\n\nIdaho, Nez Perce Tribe\u2014$200,000\n\nKansas, Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas\u2014$194,876\n\nMichigan, Sault Sainte Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians\u2014$325,000\n\nMontana, Fort Peck Community College\u2014$317,039\n\nMontana, Montana-Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council\u2014$648,124\n\nNebraska, Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska\u2014$178,493\n\nNew Mexico, Albuquerque Area Indian Health Board, Inc.\u2014$850,000\n\nNew Mexico, Santa Ana, Pueblo\u2014$120,651\n\nOklahoma, Oklahoma City Area Inter-Tribal Health Board\u2014$850,000\n\nOregon, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board\u2014$850,000\n\nOregon, Yellowhawk Tribal Health Center\u2014$199,159\n\nSouth Carolina, Catawba Indian Nation\u2014$199,804\n\nSouth Dakota, Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's Health Board\u2014$650,000\n\nSouth Dakota, Lower Brule Sioux Tribe\u2014$200,000\n\nTennessee, United South and Eastern Tribes, Inc.\u2014 $849,998\n\nWisconsin, Great Lakes Inter-Tribal Council, Inc.\u2014 $850,000\n\nWisconsin, Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians\u2014$200,000\n\nFor more information about CDC\u2019s new programs to advance chronic disease prevention and health promotion, and for state-by-state lists of all new funding awards, visit CDC.gov.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Centers for Disease Control has announced 22 new grant awards in the amount of $11.3 million to reduce chronic diseases in Indian Country.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/05/cdc-awards-over-11m-fight-chronic-diseases-indian-country-157164", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/wellspring-students-running.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "CDC Awards Over $11M to Fight Chronic Diseases in Indian Country"}, "abstract": "The Centers for Disease Control has announced 22 new grant awards in the amount of $11.3 million to reduce chronic diseases in Indian Country.", "dc": {"title": "CDC Awards Over $11M to Fight Chronic Diseases in Indian Country"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/05/cdc-awards-over-11m-fight-chronic-diseases-indian-country-157164", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, Native Health, Obesity, Diabetes, Affordable Care Act", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2014-10-05T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "CDC Awards Over $11M to Fight Chronic Diseases in Indian Country"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde542\"", "article_summary": "Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) supports strategies in racial and ethnic communities to improve health and reduce health disparities.\n\u201cThe suffering and costs of chronic diseases throughout Indian country are growing,\u201d said Ursula E.
