Nevermind Hillary\u2019s perpetual side-stepping and Jeb\u2019s confused exploration. Ted Cruz, my fellow former Canadian (unfortunately I have to claim him) is running for President of the United States.\n\nAs expected, there was a lot of small-government, repeal-Obamacare, and self-pontificating talk. What\u2019s more interesting, however, is how Ted chose to make the announcement \u2014 during a mandatory assembly at Liberty University, a Christian school in Virginia that apparently doubles as a pit stop for Republicans trying to capture the evangelical vote. Cruz prepared for his speech extensively in a stage rehearsal that included kissing practice with his wife.\n\nThis bizarre campaign behavior prompted Jon Stewart to apologize to an old friend last night. \u201cEven the Mitt Romney-tron 3000 didn\u2019t have to practice waving and kissing,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more baffling is that after Cruz railed against the dangers of big government and metadata, he repeatedly asked the literally captive audience to text the word \u201cImagine\u201d or \u201cConstitution\u201d to the number 33733 without explanation. Which begs the question: What planet is Ted Cruz really from? You can\u2019t be Texan after you\u2019ve been Canadian!\n\n[tweet]\n\nFave new thing: @libertyu requires students attend political speech by @SenTedCruz. So much for #liberty \u2014 Jimmy williams (@Jimmyspolitics) March 23, 2015\n\n\n\n[/tweet]", "article_metadata": {"description": "This bizarre Ted Cruz kiss practicing campaign behavior prompted Jon Stewart to apologize to an old friend last night.
