SIGAR previously found that the task force spent $43 million building a single gas station, around 140 times the amount it should have cost, and paid $242 million for mining, oil and gas projects that lacked long-term strategies for sustaining the industries.\n\nRelated: U.S. Pays for Afghan Hospitals \u2013 and Isn\u2019t Sure Where They Are\n\nAccording to Sopko\u2019s letter, a few of the perks of living off-base in rooming provided by military contractor Triple Canopy included queen-size beds, mini-refrigerators and flat screen TVs with DVD players. Some personnel were granted accommodations in \u201cinvestor villas\u201d with \u201cupgraded furniture\u201d and \u201cwestern-style hotel accommodations.\u201d\n\n\n\nFlickr/SIGAR\n\nAs for food, each meal provided by the contractors was required to have at least two entr\u00e9e choices and three side order options, all deemed \u201cat least 3 stars.\u201d In the case of a \u201cspecial event,\u201d Triple Canopy was instructed to provide three course meals.\n\nSopko speculated that the task force\u2019s decision to allow personnel to live off of U.S. bases may have come from Paul Brinkley, former Deputy Undersecretary for Defense and the task force\u2019s first director. Although Brinkley no longer works for the U.S. government and has not cooperated with SIGAR\u2019s request for information, Sopko quotes Brinkley as previously saying, \u201cwherever possible, we avoided depending on the military.\u201d\n\nSopko did not make the larger point which bears repeating here: the Pentagon budget has never been audited.\n\n\n\nFlickr/SIGAR", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The same office in the Defense Department that spent $43 million", "title": "Pentagon Posh: U.S. Spent $150 Million on Luxury Villas in Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/03/Pentagon-Posh-US-Spent-150-Million-Luxury-Villas-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12032015_Kabul_Afghanistan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/03/Pentagon-Posh-US-Spent-150-Million-Luxury-Villas-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12032015_Kabul_Afghanistan.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The same office in the Defense Department that spent $43 million", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The same office in the Defense Department that spent $43 million to build a gas station spent nearly $150 million of taxpayer money on luxurious private villas with private security in Afghanistan between 2010 and 2014.\nSIGAR previously found that the task force spent $43 million building a single gas station, around 140 times the amount it should have cost, and paid $242 million for mining, oil and gas projects that lacked long-term strategies for sustaining the industries.\nSopko speculated that the task force\u2019s decision to allow personnel to live off of U.S. bases may have come from Paul Brinkley, former Deputy Undersecretary for Defense and the task force\u2019s first director.\nRelated: The $43 Million Afghan Gas Station Scandal Blows the Lid Off Pentagon WasteIf employees of the task force, known as the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations (TFBSO), had instead lived on U.S. military bases, \u201cit appears the taxpayers would have saved tens of millions of dollars,\u201d Sopko said in the letter.\nFlickr/SIGAR"}
