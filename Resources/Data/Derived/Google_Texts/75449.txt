LONDON (AP) - Counter-terrorism police in Britain are investigating a stabbing at a London Underground station in which a suspect injured two people with a knife and reportedly said "This is for Syria."

Police arrested a man believed to be 29 years old late Saturday and said they are treating the attack at east London's Leytonstone subway station as a "terrorist incident." They declined to say whether they are looking for other suspects, saying probes are ongoing.

One man suffered serious knife injuries and was in the hospital in stable condition. Another man received minor injuries, while a woman was threatened but not hurt.

A video shot by a witness immediately after the attack shows the suspect lunging at police officers who try to subdue him. The suspect remained in custody Sunday.
