That went pretty much across the board early, certainly including quarterback, whose late-second quarter interception was simply unacceptable, and the offensive line that left him under siege way too often...But while the offense ultimately got it together and bailed them out in a 35-31 comeback victory, all is not positive for the Patriots as they move on to the AFC championship. Because the reason the Patriots' offseason almost began this morning was the same reason that this year was supposed to be different: the defense...They addedand. They saw a few of their high draft picks begin to blossom into stars. They rode the defense to wins - plural - over the course of the regular season.After years of being failed on that side of scrimmage in the biggest moments of the biggest games, the Patriots were supposed to finally have a secondary that could ease the burden on Brady. But Saturday night it sure looked like this is the same old Patriots defense. If not something worse...The defensive units New England fans have griped about for years hadn't given up more than 28 points since a 33-14 loss to Baltimore ended the 2009 season, but the Ravens had hit that mark by the early part of the third quarter, whenfound an uncovered Justin Forsett in the right flat for a 16-yards touchdown...This came one play after Baltimore converted on fourth-and-6 from the Patriots' 36, and marked Flacco's fourth score of the day. It was his 22nd completion in 29 attempts that had gained the Ravens 231 yards in less than 35 minutes...It was the type of performance that supports the QB's claim that he deserves mention among the elite at his position, and for that he deserves credit, though the Patriots made it look way too easy at times...He picked at the Patriots' lack of depth, completing throws to 10 different receivers before the half. And he also picked at what was supposed to be the Patriots' strength, getting the better of Revis on three plays that bore big significance in terms of how this one played out...With Revis in coverage, Flacco hitfor a 9-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter. Then Revis was nabbed on an (albeit questionable) pass interference call to set up another score late in the second. Then Revis was called for holding late in the third, negating what would've been astrip sack...Instead, the Ravens kept the ball with a new set of downs and proceeded to convert another fourth down and run 16 plays for 73 yards en route to the go-ahead field goal with a few ticks more than 10 minutes to go. The other high-profile addition, Browner, spent that series in the locker room as trainers evaluated a knee injury...There were some decent moments, mind you. They held the Ravens to three points on that possession. And minutes earlierrecognized what the Ravens were doing and made an interception near midfield. In the final minutes, sub-package safetypicked off a pass in the end zone to seal the victory...But ultimately the Patriots are still playing because of their offense. Because offensive coordinatorconfused the Ravens by repeatedly using four offensive linemen on one series. Because they duped Baltimore with a trick play that saw receiverthrow a 51-yard TD to. And because Brady's best pass of the day went for a 23-yard score towith 5:13 to go...They won because the offense did its job. Next week it's up to the defense to do the same.With his second-quarter touchdown pass to Amendola, Brady moved ahead of(at least for a few hours) and became the NFL's all-time leader in postseason passing yards...With Saturday's 367, Brady now has 6,791 for his career. Entering today's game against the Colts, Manning has thrown for 6,589.Later in the game, with his scoring strike to LaFell, Brady passedfor the league's all-time high in postseason touchdown passes. The hookup was his 46th...After sitting out the final two games of the regular season, top receiver Edelman and left guardreturned to action for the Patriots. Running backheadlined New England's list of inactive players, but the biggest surprise among the sidelined seven may have been offensive lineman. When healthy, he has been deployed this season as a sixth blocker, and was expected to fill that role with some frequency against the Ravens' dangerous defensive front...For Baltimore, the most noteworthy roster decision was the activation of left tacklethough the Ravens' usual starter was on the bench to start the game.Trailing 14-7 early in the second quarter, Brady took consecutive sacks to push the offense out of field-goal range, and that wasn't the only negative to come out of the sequence. Centerwas injured on the second of those plays, heading directly to the locker room with what was announced as a knee injury...The rookie's emergence in early October helped to settle the early issues experienced by the offensive line, so his loss was significant. In his absence,shifted to center, withtaking the vacancy left by Wendell at right guard. Amendola's touchdown came on the Pats' first series with that alignment.
