Joe Jackson\n\nAn 84-year-old New York City man briefly hospitalized in January after he had a physical altercation with police officers arresting him for allegedly jaywalking is suing the city and the New York Police Department.\n\nAttorneys for Kang Chun Wong, of West 97th Street, filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court Thursday seeking $5 million in damages. The suit said Mr. Wong, who is of Chinese descent, suffered mental and physical injuries, \u201cthe full extent of which are currently unknown,\u201d following the incident on the Upper West Side.\n\n\u201cMy father still is traumatized by the whole event,\u201d his son, Wei Wong, said Friday at a news conference. \u201cHe\u2019s not back to his normal self where he\u2019s\u2026an independent person.\u201d\n\nMr. Wong was lawfully crossing 96th Street on Jan. 19 when he was \u201cgrabbed, pushed against a wall, beaten [and] thrown to the ground causing him to lose consciousness\u201d by NYPD officers, according to the lawsuit.\n\nAfter he was treated at a local hospital for a bleeding head wound, police eventually released Mr. Wong with a desk appearance ticket \u201cfor criminal charges that are without merit,\u201d the lawsuit added.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office later declined to prosecute the case. The NYPD didn\u2019t return a message for comment.\n\nMr. Wong\u2014flanked by attorney Sanford Rubenstein, his son and daughter-in-law\u2014said \u201cI lost my memory and my ribs still hurt.\u201d\n\nMr. Wong speaks Cantonese and his statements were translated by his daughter-in law, Isabella Wong.\n\nHe added he had largely stayed at home for the first two months after the incident: \u201cRight now, when I cross the street it\u2019s very scary. I didn\u2019t want to go out.\u201d\n\nMr. Rubenstein said Mr. Wong\u2019s allegedly heavy-handed treatment is symptomatic of the New York Police Department\u2019s \u201cbroken windows\u201d policy.\n\n\u201cWhen an elderly 84-year-old man ends up needing multiple staples to close up a huge wound in his head because of the issue of alleged jaywalking, it\u2019s simply not right,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a policy appropriate for 2014.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "An 84-year-old New York City man briefly hospitalized in January after he had a physical altercation with police officers arresting him for allegedly jaywalking is suing the city and New York Police Department.", "title": "Man Accused of Jaywalking Sues NYPD", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/08/22/man-accused-of-jaywalking-sues-nypd/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EF687_nyjayw_P_20140822144703.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Man Accused of Jaywalking Sues NYPD", "description": "An 84-year-old New York City man briefly hospitalized in January after he had a physical altercation with police officers arresting him for allegedly jaywalking is suing the city and New York Police Department.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Joe Jackson", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "An 84-year-old New York City man briefly hospitalized in January after he had a physical altercation with police officers arresting him for allegedly jaywalking is suing the city and New York Police Department.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-08-22T18:48:06-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/08/22/man-accused-of-jaywalking-sues-nypd/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-21469", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "An 84-year-old New York City man briefly hospitalized in January after he had a physical altercation with police officers arresting him for allegedly jaywalking is suing the city and New York Police Department.", "title": "Man Accused of Jaywalking Sues NYPD", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/08/22/man-accused-of-jaywalking-sues-nypd/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EF687_nyjayw_P_20140822144703.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-21469", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-22T19:05:03-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Isabella Wong, Wei Wong, Sanford Rubenstein and Kang Wong announce Wei Wong\u2019s lawsuit against the NYPD on Friday.\n\u201cMy father still is traumatized by the whole event,\u201d his son, Wei Wong, said Friday at a news conference.\nThe suit said Mr. Wong, who is of Chinese descent, suffered mental and physical injuries, \u201cthe full extent of which are currently unknown,\u201d following the incident on the Upper West Side.\nI didn\u2019t want to go out.\u201dMr. Rubenstein said Mr. Wong\u2019s allegedly heavy-handed treatment is symptomatic of the New York Police Department\u2019s \u201cbroken windows\u201d policy.\nAttorneys for Kang Chun Wong, of West 97th Street, filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court Thursday seeking $5 million in damages."}
