Earlier this week, he sent the Michigan National Guard to distribute bottled water and other supplies.\n\nThe financially strapped city was under control of a state-appointed emergency manager when it switched its source of tap water from Detroit's system to the nearby Flint River in April 2014 to save money.\n\nFlint, which is about 60 miles (100 km) northwest of Detroit, returned to using that city's water in October after tests found elevated levels of lead in the water and in the blood of some children.\n\nThe more corrosive water from the Flint River leached lead from the city pipes more than Detroit water did, leading to the problems.\n\n\u201cI am asking President Obama to provide additional resources,\" Snyder said Thursday.\n\nOn Friday, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette said he would investigate whether any laws were violated in the crisis. \"No one should have to fear something as basic as turning on the kitchen faucet.\"\n\nThe assistance Snyder has requested could include grants for temporary housing, home repairs and other needs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will review the request and advise Obama.\n\nThe White House said on Friday it would consider Snyder's request. A FEMA spokesman said the agency will give its recommendation to the president as soon as possible. Several Michigan members of Congress on Friday urged Obama to provide the aid.\n\nAlso on Friday, a bipartisan group of leaders on the House energy and commerce committee sent a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency requesting a briefing \"in the coming days\" on the Flint crisis.\n\nSome Flint residents sued Snyder, other officials, Michigan and the city on Jan. 7 in Genesee County court, seeking class action status covering all residents.\n\nOther Flint residents late last year filed a federal lawsuit. Genesee County also has seen a spike of Legionnaires' disease resulting in 10 deaths that may be related to the water crisis, state officials previously said.\n\nSnyder said on Friday he supports the return of more executive powers to Flint Mayor Karen Weaver. Since the city is in receivership, a city administrator is currently responsible for day-to-day operations.\n\n(Additional reporting by Julia Edwards, Jeff Mason and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Bill Trott, Meredith Mazzilli and Bernard Orr)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DETROIT (Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has asked President Barack Obama to", "title": "Michigan governor asks Obama for federal aid in Flint water crisis", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/15/Michigan-governor-asks-Obama-federal-aid-Flint-water-crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/michigan-water_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/15/Michigan-governor-asks-Obama-federal-aid-Flint-water-crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/michigan-water_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "DETROIT (Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder has asked President Barack Obama to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Snyder said on late Thursday that he requested federal aid in Genesee County to protect the safety of Flint residents.\nOther Flint residents late last year filed a federal lawsuit.\nSome Flint residents sued Snyder, other officials, Michigan and the city on Jan. 7 in Genesee County court, seeking class action status covering all residents.\nThe more corrosive water from the Flint River leached lead from the city pipes more than Detroit water did, leading to the problems.\nGenesee County also has seen a spike of Legionnaires' disease resulting in 10 deaths that may be related to the water crisis, state officials previously said."}
