o demonstrate her support for President Barack Obama’s signature piece of healthcare legislation, “Vampire Diaries” actress Nina Dobrev got topless, posting a photo to Instagram of herself with a sign that says “#getcovered".

Bulgaria-born actress Nina Dobrev, known best for her sexy dressing style and red carpet appearances, has taken her top down in support of Obama healthcare law.

The 24-year-old "Vampire Diaries" star stripped down and posed for an Instagram photo as a means of drawing attention to the issue of healthcare.

Dobrev posed topless with a sign reading "#getcovered" in front of her chest.

"Im Canadian. We have healthcare for all. If you dont have insurance go to http://say.ly/cdi6TN2 and #GetCovered, Because w/o it, youre naked," she wrote.

A number of celebrities have shown their support for the healthcare law with the hashtag #getcovered by posting messages, including Kerry Washington, Sarah Silverman, Rosario Dawson, Sophia Bush, Kate Bosworth, Julianne Moore and Shaun White.

But their support was far less revealing than Dobrev’s.
