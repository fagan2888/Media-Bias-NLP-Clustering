Elizabeth Warren gives the same frustrated answer. No. Nope. She is not running for president. She has literally rolled her eyes at the question. She\u2019s offered to \u201cadd an exclamation point.\u201d She\u2019s even signed a letter calling on Hillary Clinton, who leads polls of Democrats by up to 50 points, to run for president.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\nAnd yet there they were on Friday morning, the people who wanted Warren to reconsider. Days before this year\u2019s Netroots Nation conference, the annual gathering of the online left, an Obama campaign veteran launched a draft campaign called Ready for Warren. (The name is a wink at the pro-Clinton PAC Ready for Hillary, which claims to have 2.5 million supporters in its database.) The new group printed \u201cWarren for President\u201d signs and plastered \u201cWarren for President\u201d stickers on free skimmer hats. As activists entered the Cobo Center, which resembles a pile of faded Rubik\u2019s Cubes that have tumbled from a closet, volunteers handed out the goods. There was even a folk song soundtrack, by Jessie Murphy:\n\nAmericans want our next president to be a woman\n\nHey babe, here\u2019s lookin\u2019 at you, Senator Elizabeth Warren\n\nThe planet is warming and the power is shifting\n\nWe will need a leader who won\u2019t stand for all the Wall Street bullshit, the lobbyist grifting\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe reluctant hero never stood a chance. When her applause lines hit, up went the signs.\n\n\u201cThe game is rigged,\u201d said Warren toward the end of her remarks. \u201cWe can whine about it, we can whimper about it, or we can fight back. I\u2019m ready to fight back. Are you ready to fight back on this?\u201d\n\nUp went the signs, up went the chant: \u201cRun, Liz, Run.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSi\u2019down,\u201d Warren chuckled. \u201cSi\u2019down.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut the story was already being told. The signs made it into write-ups by Politico, Huffington Post, McClatchy, and a Washington Post story about how \u201ccracks are beginning to emerge\u201d in the Clinton restoration\u2019s coalition.\n\nThe evidence for a left-wing challenge to Clinton that could defeat her is thin to nonexistent. Defeating Clinton wasn\u2019t even a theme at Netroots Nation, where in 2007 both Sens. Barack Obama and John Edwards clearly outpaced her in support. Anyone who could force Clinton to the left\u2014on Wall Street, on bank reform, on student loans, on inequality\u2014was worth talking about. Not far from where Warren was speaking, a D.C. activist named Edrie Irvine was sporting a Bernie Sanders for President 2016 shirt, and getting into conversations that assumed the Vermont senator could never win.\n\n\u201cI love my Bernie,\u201d said Irvine. \u201cI want him to run not because I expect that he would ever win, but because he would force the conversation in a direction it might not otherwise go.\u201d\n\nThe Warren \u201cpresidential campaign\u201d is a masterful branding and messaging exercise.\n\nThat\u2019s just it. Progressives want to change the party, which means more than choosing a president. (Several Netroots panels featured activists who had moved the Obama administration when it was acting too slowly on issues like immigration.) The institutions that created the online left were birthed by no-chance campaigns. MoveOn was founded in 1998 by Silicon Valley liberals who wanted Congress to stop short of impeaching Bill Clinton. \u201cCensure,\u201d it said, \u201cand move on.\u201d Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 campaign brought in a young generation of activists and techies, spawning some of the data and campaign companies that would elect Barack Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nYet MoveOn lost its first fight. The Dean campaign lost every major primary. The lesson activists took away: Try something. The media, at least, is going to cover a primary threat more than it covers a sui generis student loan bill.\n\nThus the Warren \u201cpresidential campaign,\u201d a masterful branding and messaging exercise. In September 2013, the New York Times wrote an attention-getting profile of Warren\u2019s appeal to progressives, proven by the growing crowds for organizers wise enough to book her. \u201cBumper stickers and T-shirts surfacing in liberal enclaves proclaim, \u2018I\u2019m from the Elizabeth Warren Wing of the Democratic Party.\u2019 \u201d Jonathan Martin reported that those stickers were mass-produced by the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which was founded in 2009 by Adam Green (a veteran of MoveOn and Democratic campaigns) and Stephanie Taylor (a veteran of the SEIU, AFL-CIO, and yes, MoveOn).\n\nIn its early years, the PCCC confounded Democrats, losing a run of primaries and buying ads to pressure red state Senate Democrats who were slow-walking the Affordable Care Act. The Warren brand\u2014earned after the group signed up activists and donors for her nascent Senate bid\u2014is self-evidently a way to move the conversation, whether or not anyone challenges Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that every Democrat who runs for president is forced to say whether they agree with Elizabeth Warren on key issues,\u201d Green told the Boston Globe last year, \u201clike expanding Social Security benefits and more Wall Street reform.\u201d\n\nGreen repeated that point at the Netroots conference, though he hardly needed to. Rep. Dan Kildee, a freshman Democrat from one of the new safe Michigan districts, said it was \u201cclear\u201d that any 2016 candidate had to cop from Warren.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cThe basic premise, that we need to restore some balance in the equation between corporate interests and consumers\u2014that\u2019s what she\u2019s done for a long time,\u201d he said, recalling how he\u2019d cited her when he worked at a think tank. \u201cMore people should embrace it. It cuts across partisan lines. \u201c\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t calling for a primary. The point was getting the next candidate to move where the Netroots crowd wanted her to move.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is going to say these things,\u201d said former Rep. Brad Miller, a North Carolina Democrat who left his seat after a 2011 gerrymander. \u201cWhoever our Democratic nominee is will run as an economic populist. When the pollsters and consultants come back with the numbers, they\u2019ll tell her: Holy crap, you may not have been a populist before, but you are one now! The problem will be credibility, and whether it\u2019s believable coming from someone who has close ties to the financial sector.\u201d\n\nAt the conference, for most attendees, Clinton was credible enough. A Ready for Hillary organizer pointed out that some of the people who applauded when they saw Warren at a nearby hotel were sporting Hillary gear. There was no mass boycott of the main Friday night party, sponsored by Ready for Hillary, held at a downtown music venue called St. Andrews, with the PAC\u2019s bus parked right outside. As guests arrived, they ran into a table loaded with PAC stickers (\u201cI\u2019m ready for Hillary\u201d) and the room-filling pop of KGB, a Motown cover band.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nActivists born in the 1980s; music from the 1960s. Not the ideal metaphor for a Clinton campaign, but it got a PCCC leader tweeting that after \u201cone more margarita\u201d even he, too, would be ready for the Clintons.\n\nI didn\u2019t find a true Clinton critic, actually, until the next night\u2019s after-party. It was hosted by the Alliance for American Manufacturing. (In a Saturday speech, the labor group\u2019s president, Scott Paul, had told activists to nominate \u201ca woman who not only says the right thing but does the right thing.\u201d) At the party, I ran into the last guy who challenged Clinton from the left and lost. Jonathan Tasini, a writer and activist who ran against Clinton in the 2006 New York U.S. Senate race, was at least willing to muse about one of the progressive branding campaigns turning into an actual primary.\n\n\u201cWarren would have the best chance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever [Hillary] opens her mouth, there\u2019s enough people who say: \u2018I just don\u2019t believe her.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut how many Democrats? In 2006, Tasini asked progressives to hold Clinton accountable for backing the Iraq War. She won the primary with 83 percent of the vote. And on this particular Saturday night, the Clinton agita was not too serious. On the way out of the party, Scott Paul spotted me and corrected the record on his quote\u2014the one absolutely everyone interpreted as a call for Warren to run.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The movement to elect Elizabeth Warren president is make believe.", "sailthru.tags": "Elizabeth Warren, Elizabeth Warren 2016, draft Elizabeth Warren, Elizabeth Warren for President, Elizabeth Warren Netroots, Elizabeth Warren Netroots Nation, Elizabeth Warren Democrats.
