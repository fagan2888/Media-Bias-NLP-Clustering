First, nothing. Nothing will happen. No matter how horrendous the shooting happens to be, the National Rifle Association has rendered Congress entirely impotent, ensuring nothing will happen to prevent another would-be gunman from easily purchasing firearms. Not even the cold-blooded murder of 20 kindergarteners or the live on-air murder of two journalists has successfully shaken our political leaders from their NRA-induced torpor. Second, the NRA\u2019s flying monkeys inevitably fan out across the country, disbursing the usual talking points about mental health, arming schoolteachers and outlawing gun-free zones, all as a distraction from the real issue, which is, of course, ridiculously easy access to firearms.\n\nThe mental health issue, in this context, is horseshit. In spite of how often they lean on this particular button in the wake of a shooting, the Republicans haven\u2019t done a damn thing about addressing mental health. Ever. In fact, it was a Democrat, the late Paul Wellstone, who championed the notion of making mental illness a legitimate health matter. It was also a Democratic Congress and a Democratic president who included mental health coverage as an Obamacare mandate \u2014 covering nearly 4 million Americans who previously didn\u2019t have mental health insurance. The Republicans, on the other hand, have voted to repeal Obamacare upward of 60 times, while attempting to block the Wellstone amendment. If they were really concerned about mental illnesses contributing to gun massacres, you\u2019d think there\u2019d be something in the works to mitigate the problem by delivering more medical care to the people who need it the most. Nope. Not a chance.\n\nSo, leave it to Donald Trump to shift an already badly skewed debate from mental illness to, somehow, evil geniuses. Yes, Trump blamed gun massacres on shooters who are \u201cgeniuses in a certain way.\u201d They\u2019re masterminds, he said, who can \u201cbreak the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo matter what you do, you\u2019re gonna have problems,\u201d Trump told NBC News in an interview that aired Sunday. \u201cBecause you have sick people. They happen to be intelligent. And, you know, they can be sick as hell and they\u2019re geniuses in a certain way. They are going to be able to break the system.\u201d\n\nNot only are the shooters geniuses, but there\u2019s really nothing we can do to stop them, said Trump. Gone are Trump\u2019s usual over-the-top superlatives about how he has a \u201cterrific\u201d plan to stop gun violence \u2014 that there\u2019s going to be so few kindergarteners shot when he\u2019s president, our heads will spin. None of that. Trump\u2019s reaction? Oh well. He might be a complete fraud, but he sounds a hell of a lot like a Republican here. It\u2019s frankly worse than Jeb Bush\u2019s unfortunate \u201cstuff happens\u201d reaction. Indeed, Trump went one step further by suggesting that stuff happens and nothing can be done about it because mass shooters are basically Batman villains who can \u201cbreak the system,\u201d apparently using green laughing gas and an entourage of anonymous, masked henchmen.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One-upping Jeb \"Stuff Happens\" Bush, vile front-runner calls mass murderers \"geniuses\" who'll kill no matter what", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s cold-blooded \u201cgenius\u201d: How fatalism on gun violence plays right into the NRA\u2019s hands", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "One-upping Jeb \"Stuff Happens\" Bush, vile front-runner calls mass murderers \"geniuses\" who'll kill no matter what", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s cold-blooded \u201cgenius\u201d: How fatalism on gun violence plays right into the NRA\u2019s hands", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/06/donald_trumps_cold_blooded_genius_how_fatalism_on_gun_violence_plays_right_into_the_nras_hands/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/donald_trump_gun_rally.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One-upping Jeb \"Stuff Happens\" Bush, vile front-runner calls mass murderers \"geniuses\" who'll kill no matter what", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s cold-blooded \u201cgenius\u201d: How fatalism on gun violence plays right into the NRA\u2019s hands", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/donald_trump_gun_rally.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bob Cesca", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Donald Trump, Gun Violence, The National Rifle Association, umpqua community college, Umpqua Community College shooting", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfcca\"", "article_summary": "It was also a Democratic Congress and a Democratic president who included mental health coverage as an Obamacare mandate \u2014 covering nearly 4 million Americans who previously didn\u2019t have mental health insurance.\nThe mental health issue, in this context, is horseshit.\nIn fact, it was a Democrat, the late Paul Wellstone, who championed the notion of making mental illness a legitimate health matter.\nSo, leave it to Donald Trump to shift an already badly skewed debate from mental illness to, somehow, evil geniuses.\nTopics: aol_on, Donald Trump, Gun Violence, The National Rifle Association, umpqua community college, Umpqua Community College shooting, Elections News, News, Politics NewsWhenever there\u2019s a mass shooting, we can count on two things to happen."}
