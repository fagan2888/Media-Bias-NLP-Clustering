The spark has been simmering 14 years now.\n\nThe work to turn it into a roaring flame is just beginning.\n\nJust before Thanksgiving, Ms. Chappell pulled up stakes, said goodbye to loved ones and friends and took a last look at the city that has been home for 21 years. She headed northwest to Colorado.\n\nWaiting for her was the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, and that spark \u2013 to be one of 14 members on the U.S. Olympic Judo team with an opportunity to compete for gold \u2013 started to grow.\n\nTraining, learning, living and traveling to tournaments worldwide is a full-time job.\n\nBut Ms. Chappell plans to attend the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, find a job, and share an apartment with another judo competitor while pushing herself to win enough tournaments to be among the top 14 in the world, which equates to an Olympic Summer Games berth.\n\nQualifying tournaments begin in June.\n\n\u201cBasically, I have two years to win enough tournaments and earn enough points to be ranked in the top 14,\u201d Chappell said.\n\nTo make life even more challenging for Chappell, all of the qualifying tournaments are overseas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be doing a lot of international traveling,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen she and her parents, Curt and Kim Chappell, put pencil to paper to figure out the cost of all this, the figure was over $40,000 per year. No one will be hanging a price tag on Ms. Chappell\u2019s quest for greatness, but no one\u2019s arguing frequent flyer miles will not be welcome.\n\nUntil the decision to move to Colorado, Chappell was a pre-med student at Oklahoma City University. She credits the Chickasaw Nation with funding every penny of her higher education at Oklahoma City Community College and at OCU.\n\n\u201cThe Nation has been great to me and I appreciate it very much,\u201d she said.\n\nHer goal, aside from winning a gold medal as a U.S. Olympian, is to work as a physician\u2019s assistant or physical therapist specializing in sports-related injuries.\n\nShe is a Chickasaw citizen, as is her father, who owns and operates a construction company in the Oklahoma City metro area.\n\nThe petite 21-year-old twisted arms of foes at an Irving, Texas, competition in November. She competed in the 57-kilo division (about 125 pounds). She was ranked No. 1 in the nation two years ago in the 52-kilo weight class (about 114 pounds) but an injury sidelined her for more than a year.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t compete for a year, all your points go away,\u201d she said.\n\nShe does not mind starting over. She has challenged herself and established goals. Each competition is a step toward attaining them.\n\nAside from judo competition, Ms. Chappell\u2019s personal Facebook page shows she is a typical 21-year-old who enjoys friends, family and fun. But her Facebook page also has a serious edge to it when it comes to competition.\n\n\u201cThe price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand and the determination that whether we win or lose, we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand,\u201d she said on Facebook.\n\n\u201cI love competition,\u201d Ms. Chappell said. \u201cIt\u2019s just in my blood. It is a thrill to compete and to succeed at goals you\u2019ve set for yourself.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "21-Year-Old Judo Fighter Aims for 2016 Olympics", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/24/21-year-old-judo-fighter-aims-2016-olympics-152862", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/kayla_chappell.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "21-Year-Old Judo Fighter Aims for 2016 Olympics"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/24/21-year-old-judo-fighter-aims-2016-olympics-152862", "dc": {"title": "21-Year-Old Judo Fighter Aims for 2016 Olympics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "dcterms.date": "2013-12-24T15:13-05:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "21-Year-Old Judo Fighter Aims for 2016 Olympics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd820a\"", "article_summary": "Aside from judo competition, Ms. Chappell\u2019s personal Facebook page shows she is a typical 21-year-old who enjoys friends, family and fun.\n\u201cI love competition,\u201d Ms. Chappell said.\n*This is a Chickasaw Nation Press ReleaseThe desire to be a U.S. Olympic athlete burns hot in the heart of a Chickasaw woman.\nShe credits the Chickasaw Nation with funding every penny of her higher education at Oklahoma City Community College and at OCU.\n\u201cBasically, I have two years to win enough tournaments and earn enough points to be ranked in the top 14,\u201d Chappell said."}
