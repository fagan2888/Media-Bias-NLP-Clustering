The provisional approval of a new trauma center at Aventura Hospital and Medical Center in South Florida means the HCA hospital chain will operate two of the three adult trauma centers in the region, the Miami Herald reports.

The state Department of Health turned down a request for another trauma unit at Jackson South Community Hospital, the Herald reports.

The state also approved two more Level 2 trauma centers in Central Florida, the Orlando Sentinel reports. Central Florida Regional Hospital in Sanford and Osceola Regional Medical Center in Kissimmee also are owned by HCA, according to the Sentinel.

The state has 27 existing trauma centers.
