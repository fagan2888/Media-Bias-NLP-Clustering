(I\u2019ve) hit those kicks a million times.\u201dThe Packers would have won 19-18 with it.Instead, they lost to lowly Detroit, 18-16.\u201cI hate it,\u201d said Crosby. \u201cIt kills me inside. My teammates \u2013 I\u2019m going to make sure they know I\u2019m going to keep working and that they can trust me down the line here.\u201dIf there was one potential area that might have tripped up Crosby, it may have been the turf. Punter Tim Masthay said the area in between the hash marks on the south end of the field was \"chewed up pretty good.\"He hit high on the ball, meaning his plant might have slid in to the kick a little bit.\u201cThe field on that south end was starting to get chewed up a bit, but we\u2019ll look at it, obviously \u2013 how the ball came off,\u201d said Crosby. \u201cMy plant must not have been in the right spot. \u2026\u201cThat side, you\u2019ve got to stick a good plant. It\u2019s a little softer on the south end, here. I felt confident with it, went about my business. \u2026 So I\u2019ve got to learn from it and move on \u2013 but obviously I\u2019m going to be disappointed about this one.\u201cObviously, I feel awful that I let my teammates down.\u201d\n\nMasthay said it was a tricky day for kickers in terms of the wind.\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean, you saw a number of miskicks and punts that were awry,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Crosby\u2019s 44-yard field goal in the first quarter bounced off the left post before going in.\n\n\n\nBut Masthay said Crosby won\u2019t be rattled by this game.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Masthay. \u201cMason is one of the most exemplary Packers I\u2019ve ever seen in my six years. Solid performer, stays composed, great in the locker room. I\u2019ve got not a shred of worry about him. He\u2019ll be fine.\n\n\"Mason's been an excellent performer here and had a good game outside of that one play, so no, there's not going to be any guys in here pointing fingers at Mason. Not at all.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"title": "Mason Crosby on 52-yard miss: 'I hate it.
