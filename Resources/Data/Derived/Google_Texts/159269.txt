In two words, He's baaaack. But then again, did Charlie Crist ever really leave us?

After all, he's the eternal candidate. Crist has run for everything from education commissioner to to attorney general to governor and Senator.

Now, Charlie says he's ready to run again - this time for Congress. That is, if a upcoming redistricting mandated by the Florida Supreme Court shifts the district now held by David Jolly to the south to include his St. Petersburg home. Jolly's running for the Senate seat being vacated by Marco Rubio.

Crist said in a Twitter post: "If the new district map includes my home, I intend on running to serve the people again."

So that brings him back full circle in the realm of PolitiFact Florida. Crist has been somewhat of a "trampoline," with PolitiFact Florida giving him a bunch of flip-flops on the issues. Here's a few:
