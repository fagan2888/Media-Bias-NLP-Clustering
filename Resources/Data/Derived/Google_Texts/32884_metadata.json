(AP) - Tens of thousands of South Dakota residents who buy health coverage individually, including through the federal marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, are facing premium hikes for next year ranging from an average of about 13 percent to as much as 63 percent.\n\nSouth Dakota\u2019s four main individual market insurers confirmed to The Associated Press this week their rate increases for 2016. Insurance company executives cite surging drug costs to many more people than expected racking up large medical bills.\n\nRoughly 73,000 state residents enrolled in individual health coverage in 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Nearly 19,000 South Dakotans have gotten coverage through the federal exchange and paid their premiums, according to federal figures through June 30.\n\nTwo companies that offer plans outside of the exchange, DakotaCare and Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, are hiking premiums dramatically. DakotaCare Chief Marketing Officer Greg Jasmer said next year\u2019s individual market rates are increasing by an average of 63.2 percent, which affects about 4,300 members.\n\nAbout 15,000 Wellmark members who have plans compliant with the health care law face an average rate increase of almost 43 percent for next year, said Chief Financial Officer David Brown. A much larger group of about 36,000 enrollees that have pre-Affordable Care Act plans are seeing an average rate increase of almost 15 percent.\n\nBrown said the 43 percent average rate increase is driven by a sicker enrollee pool than the company anticipated. He said those customers used more prescriptions than anticipated, including high-cost specialty drugs, and nearly a third more people than expected had claims that exceeded $50,000.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we lost market share,\u201d Brown said of the hike, adding that the company has to focus on viability and that it can\u2019t afford to underprice.\n\nWith DakotaCare\u2019s departure from the federal health insurance marketplace, just two firms -Avera Health Plans and Sanford Health Plan - are selling coverage through the exchange. Consumers who use the marketplace are eligible for federal assistance, and open enrollment begins Nov. 1.\n\nBoth Sanford and Avera\u2019s rate increases are for plans on and off the exchange.\n\nJeff Sandene, interim president of Sanford Health Plan, said about 5,000 Sanford members, most of whom get coverage through the exchange, face an average premium increase of about 13 percent next year. As the health care law grows older, insurers get more stability in their pricing - with two years of experience, Sandene said the company is more confident about these rates.\n\nAvera Health Plans Chief Administrative Officer Debra Muller said the organization is hiking rates by an average of 13.7 percent, which would affect about 11,100 enrollees. Muller, like other carrier executives, cited a big surge in drug costs as a factor but said the firm has been able to keep other expenses down.\n\nKelsey Collier-Wise of Vermillion and her husband currently pay about $261 a month through the exchange - a subsidy cuts the cost by more than half. Collier-Wise, executive director of the United Way of Vermillion, said they\u2019re pleased with their coverage through Sanford but still plan to shop around during open enrollment.\n\nAnd even with a potential premium hike, Collier-Wise said the subsidies mean the family can likely stomach the increase. With their daughter also now covered through Medicaid, the family\u2019s health insurance bill has dropped dramatically.\n\n\u201cFor us, the nice thing is that with the subsidy, we\u2019re paying so much less than we were paying prior to the (Affordable Care Act), that the gulf between now and what we used to pay is really huge, so there\u2019s a lot of movement in there that we can probably absorb,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tens of thousands of South Dakota residents who buy health coverage individually, including through the federal marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, are facing premium hikes for next year ranging from an average of about 13 percent to as much as 63 percent.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/23/south-dakota-individual-insurance-rate-hikes-comin/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Tens of thousands of South Dakota residents who buy health coverage individually, including through the federal marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, are facing premium hikes for next year ranging from an average of about 13 percent to as much as 63 percent.", "title": "Big jumps ahead in South Dakota individual market premiums"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tens of thousands of South Dakota residents who buy health coverage individually, including through the federal marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, are facing premium hikes for next year r", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Big jumps ahead in South Dakota individual market premiums"}, "Author": "JAMES NORD", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe34b8\"", "article_summary": "Roughly 73,000 state residents enrolled in individual health coverage in 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nBrown said the 43 percent average rate increase is driven by a sicker enrollee pool than the company anticipated.\nNearly 19,000 South Dakotans have gotten coverage through the federal exchange and paid their premiums, according to federal figures through June 30.\nSouth Dakota\u2019s four main individual market insurers confirmed to The Associated Press this week their rate increases for 2016.\nWith DakotaCare\u2019s departure from the federal health insurance marketplace, just two firms -Avera Health Plans and Sanford Health Plan - are selling coverage through the exchange."}
