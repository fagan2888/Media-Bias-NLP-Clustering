Chris Larson and Lila Bateman.\n\nThey spent 18 months combing through millions of documents and took investigatory testimony from 50 people.\n\nIn conjunction with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in the eastern district of New York, they put together a case that allowed the Justice Department to forge a deal that includes a $4 billion civil penalty and $2.5 billion for consumer relief.\n\nAnd there are more financial institutions that will face similar scrutiny.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not done yet,\u201d Walsh told us.\n\nIn the Colorado foreclosure case, Suthers\u2019 office filed civil lawsuits against two law firms. The lawsuits allege the firms took advantage of homeowners in distress by inflating costs.\n\nBoth the foreclosure and mortgage security cases involve complex financial matters that took significant time and resources to dissect.\n\nIt\u2019s heartening to see Colorado officials pursuing those who helped cause so much financial misery. Perhaps it will serve as a deterrent to others who contemplate similar misdeeds in the future.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado connection to prosecuting fiscal fraud", "title": "Colorado connection to prosecuting fiscal fraud", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/18/colorado-connection-to-prosecuting-fiscal-fraud/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140718__20140720_D3_OP20E_USATTORNEYp1.jpg", "height": 475}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140718__20140720_D3_OP20E_USATTORNEYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-18T15:29:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:51:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2ea\"", "article_summary": "In the Colorado foreclosure case, Suthers\u2019 office filed civil lawsuits against two law firms.\nWe\u2019re referring to the $7 billion Citigroup settlement, which was pursued by Colorado U.S. Attorney John Walsh, and two lawsuits alleging substantial foreclosure fraud filed by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers.\nIn the last week, two such enforcement actions with significant Colorado connections have come to light.\nIn a nutshell, Citigroup knowingly took bad mortgages and packaged them into securities labeled as being of better quality than they were.\nIt\u2019s heartening to see Colorado officials pursuing those who helped cause so much financial misery."}
