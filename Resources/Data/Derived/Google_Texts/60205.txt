Gov. Greg Abbott asked Texans to join European countries in holding a statewide minute of silence Monday at noon to honor the victims of Friday’s Paris attacks.

Here’s what Abbott wrote on Sunday:

“Texas’ solidarity and longstanding relationship with France is well established. When Texas declared its independence from Mexico, France was among the first nations to recognize that independence. We have not forgotten France’s commitment to the Lone Star State and Texas will join with other states and nations tomorrow to honor the victims and condemn the cowardly terrorist attacks. I urge all Texans to hold a minute of silence at noon tomorrow and pray for the victims and families of the despicable attacks that took place in Paris.”

Abbott’s statement comes the day after the European Union called for all of Europe to hold a minute of silence Monday at the same hour.
