Growing up in the boondocks of Northeastern Washington, Thai food was a new exotic mystery to me. I was in my early twenties before I ever even tried my first Thai curry. The amalgamation of flavors was pure bliss: sweet and creamy, no\u2014spicy and crunchy, no\u2014intense but subtle.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to curry, let me explain. First of all, \u201ccurry\u201d is an Anglicized term for an Indian word meaning \u201csauce.\u201d It\u2019s evolved to describe a wide variety of dishes, usually south or Southeastern Asian in origin, which include a richly spiced sauce smothering meat and/or vegetables. The three spices most often included in curry are turmeric, cumin and coriander. These spices are known for being anti-inflammatory and detoxifying, making curry a pretty healthy food for you.\n\nIt never even occurred to me to make curry. It seemed too exotic; the balance between the flavors was too delicate. And so curry was relegated to that upper echelon of foods you only eat when someone else has made them for you. Curry joined the ranks of souffl\u00e9s, Ossobuco, sushi and garlic-mashed potatoes (No? That\u2019s just me? Okay.)\n\nBut I was wrong. Gloriously wrong. It turns out that it\u2019s actually quite simple, and inexpensive, to make a good curry at home. All you really need is a couple cans of coconut milk and a little jar of concentrated coconut paste. Both of which you can find in most major grocery stores. If you live in a city with a international district, all the better. You can probably find even better/more authentic curry pastes for a better price at an Asian market.\n\nI recommend using the Thai Kitchen brand of curry paste. It should set you back $2 or $3. It\u2019s probably a good idea to make a double batch of this stuff. It\u2019s really delicious and even better the next day.\n\nThai Coconut Red Curry\n\nServes 4\n\n2 chicken breasts, cooked and cut into bite-sized chunks\n\n1 Tbsp cooking oil\n\n\u00bd bag of frozen green beans, cut in chunks, or 1 handful of fresh green beans\n\n1 red bell pepper, diced\n\n1, 4 oz, jar of Thai red curry paste\n\n1, 15 oz, can coconut milk\n\n\u00bc cup water\n\n1 Tbsp fish sauce (found near the curry and coconut milk at the store)\n\n2 tsp brown sugar\n\n2 thai red chilies, pierced several times with a knife\n\nIn a large pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add the curry paste and whisk it into the oil until it is all incorporated. Slowly drizzle in the coconut milk and continue whisking until smooth and well blended.\n\nAdd water, fish sauce, brown sugar and chilies and bring to a simmer. Add red bell peppers and green beans and continue to simmer for about 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but not mushy. Add chicken and serve over rice.\n\nVariations:\n\nYou could also make this with firm tofu or beef. I like to roast up a squash and add bite-sized chunks in with the chicken. Adding a can of pumpkin puree with the coconut milk will also give you a nice pumpkin curry. You\u2019re really only limited by your imagination and the contents of your refrigerator or pantry: bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, sweet peas, broccoli, and cauliflower all make great additions to curry.\n\n*Any chili will do. I use habaneros because they are the most common spicy chili in Costa Rica. If you also have a devil tongue, be sure to cut the chili open on your plate and mix it into your dish.\n\nDarla Antoine is an enrolled member of the Okanagan Indian Band in British Columbia and grew up in Eastern Washington State.
