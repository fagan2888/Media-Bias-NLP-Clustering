It's official: Facebook is truly a social media giant.



CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to the social platform Thursday to inform the world of a new record for the site. "For the first time ever, one billion people used Facebook in a single day," Zuckerberg said. On Monday, one in seven of the people on Earth used Facebook.

The 31-year-old CEO used the opportunity to thank Facebook's 1.5 billion monthly active users.

"I'm so proud of our community for the progress we've made," he wrote. "Our community stands for giving every person a voice, for promoting understanding and for including everyone in the opportunities of our modern world."



The site, which launched in 2004, began as an online directory for college students to connect via personal profiles. Shortly after launch, Zuckerberg was a guest on CNBC's "Bullseye" and was asked whether his new site would be "the next big thing."

"When we first launched we were hoping for maybe 400 or 500 people â€¦ so who knows where we're going next?" a young Zuckerberg modestly stated when discussing the magnitude of his site. "Maybe we can make something cool."

11 years and a "cool" 1 billion daily active users later, Forbes ranks Zuckerberg as the 10th richest person in the world with a net worth of $39.4 billion.
