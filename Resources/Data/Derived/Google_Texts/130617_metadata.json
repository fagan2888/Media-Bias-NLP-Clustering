President Obama would then have to deal with the repeal package on his desk \u2014 and while he isn\u2019t likely to sign it, he would have to face the public relations message the Republican Party would send.\n\nAnd of benefit to Republicans: Sending the repeal to the president would strike a sharp contrast between the two political parties at a time when voters will be mulling the next White House selection.\n\n\u201cMy guidance is that\u2019s where members are headed,\u201d said one senior-level Senate Republican aide who\u2019s privy to much of the behind-the-scenes\u2019 discussions, The Hill reported.\n\nAlready, Republicans \u2014 and some Democrats \u2014 seem by and large supportive of undoing smaller aspects of Obamacare that aren\u2019t palatable to the American public, or aren\u2019t translating well from paper to reality. A couple of examples: Both parties seem amenable to restoring the definition of a full-time workweek as 40 hours, as well as repealing the medical device tax, The Hill reported.\n\nBut \u201creconciliation\u201d and a simple majority vote to repeal the entire law is making its way through the minds of Republicans both on and outside of Capitol Hill as a viable tool, The Hill said.\n\n\u201cI think the conference has to decide, and will decide, whether or not the tools ought to be used for things that we know will provide a contrast with the president, that we know the president will not support \u2014 or things that will get us to do a true change in public policy with his signature,\u201d said Rep. Tom Price in The Hill report. He is due to take over Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s job as Budget Committee chairman.\n\nStill, Republicans are strategizing and far from committing.\n\n\u201c2016 is around the corner, so they\u2019re going to be careful of what they\u2019re voting on in the Senate,\u201d said Bill Hoagland, a former Senate Budget Committee staff director, The Hill reported. \u201cIt\u2019s not a foregone conclusion that all Republicans will walk in lockstep together on what comes out of the budget committees.\u201d\n\nBudget reconciliation was last used by Democrats in 2010 to make changes to Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans say they have the will to bring down Obamacare \u2014 and many are eyeing a little-known, little-used budget too called \"reconciliation\" to do so.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Republicans say they have the will to bring down Obamacare \u2014 and many are eyeing a little-known, little-used budget too called \u201creconciliation\u201d to do so.", "title": "GOP looks to little-known budget tool to repeal Obamacare", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/22/gop-looks-to-little-known-budget-tool-to-repeal-ob/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/07/941b619dcff6c62b640f6a706700451f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/07/941b619dcff6c62b640f6a706700451f.jpg", "description": "Republicans say they have the will to bring down Obamacare \u2014 and many are eyeing a little-known, little-used budget too called \"reconciliation\" to do so.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP looks to little-known budget tool to repeal Obamacare"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
