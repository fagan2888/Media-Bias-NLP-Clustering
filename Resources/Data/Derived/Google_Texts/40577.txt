BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) - North Dakota employers will see a reduction in their unemployment insurance tax rates starting in January.

Officials with Job Services North Dakota say the 2015 tax rate schedule will range from 0.10 percent to 9.70 percent. The 2014 schedule that ranged from 0.16 percent to 9.76 percent.

Job Service North Dakota Executive Director Cheri Giesen says more than 66 percent of the state’s employers will receive the lowest rate of 0.10 percent under the new tax rate schedule.

At the same time, officials have announced that the taxable wage base on which employers pay taxes will increase from the current rate of $33,600 to $35,600. North Dakota law sets the unemployment insurance taxable wage base at 70 percent of the statewide average wage.

Giesen says the new 2015 rates will help the state “maintain a stable tax environment for employers while providing a level of tax rate reduction.”
