( David Gorn/California Healthline )\n\nInside the cavernous main building at the Sacramento County Fairgrounds was a beehive of activity. But this was no county fair or concert.\n\nInstead, hundreds of long, reclining dental chairs fill the floor, and 2,000 people wait for a turn. The sound of drilling buzzed the air, and the acrid smell of anesthetic permeated it.\n\nIt was free dental day \u2013 a special program run by the California Dental Association Foundation. \u201cCDA Cares\u201d took over the entire fairgrounds for this event in March, and 300 dentists were busy pumping in Novocain and making lame jokes to captive patients.\n\nAcross the broad hall, there was one station for filling cavities, one for root canals, another for extractions, yet another for dentures.\n\nIt looked like a sort of Dental Disneyland.\n\nRhonda Morse of Sacramento was among the patients. She camped out at the fairgrounds the night before the event.\n\n\u201cGot here at 7 o\u2019clock last night,\u201d she said. \u201cWe slept outside. It gets crowded real fast.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because the need is so profound. Denti-Cal, the state\u2019s program of dental care for low-income Californians, including 5 million children, is in disarray. At a time when millions more have been added into coverage, it\u2019s becoming harder to find dental care. The CDA Foundation estimates that 10 million Californians face barriers to dental care.\n\nMorse knows this first-hand.\n\n\u201cIt takes months to get in, then you get an appointment, and it takes months to get in again,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe said it would have taken her years of appointments to get the dental care she received in a single day at the fair.\n\n\u201cCoverage and access are two different things,\u201d said James Stephens, a Palo Alto dentist and former chair of the California Dental Association who volunteered for the Sacramento event.\n\nThe reason there\u2019s no access, he said, is because so few dentists take Denti-Cal patients \u2014 because they lose money on every one of them.\n\n\u201cFees have been cut in the program so much, they\u2019re not enough to create a viable provider network,\u201d Stephens said.\n\nThat network of providers is even thinner now, he said. So there are fewere dentists to serve even more people who have signed up since the state expanded eligibility rules.\n\nGeorge Maranon, an oral surgeon from Encino, was working on a tooth extraction at one of the fair stations for a 9-year-old boy with diseased gums. He said he\u2019d rather volunteer his time than take Denti-Cal payments.\n\n\u201cThere are Denti-Cal patients who I actually see in my practice for free,\u201d Maranon said. \u201cSometimes dealing with the state in terms of reimbursement can be more expensive than just doing it for free.\u201d\n\nJust to get to the national average for provider rates, California would have to spend three times as much as it does now, at least another $100 million a year, according to Elizabeth Mertz, a dental sciences professor at UC San Francisco.\n\nBeyond inadequate provider rates, there\u2019s another huge challenge in the Denti-Cal system, Mertz said. Half of the state\u2019s kids are in Denti-Cal, and those kids desperately need preventive care.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re talking about taking care of a large portion of the state\u2019s children,\u201d she said. \u201cIf those children grow up with dental disease, they\u2019re going to be adults with dental disease.\u201d\n\nShe said lawmakers could pass a dental health parity law, and that would put preventive dental health services on the same plane as other essential medical care.\n\n\u201cBecause nobody\u2019s made it a priority from the top on down,\u201d Mertz said. \u201cWhen you say something\u2019s essential but you make it optional, that\u2019s not sending the message that it\u2019s a priority.\u201d\n\nThe new director of the Department of Health Care Services, Jennifer Kent, has acknowledged the deficiencies of Denti-Cal and says fixing it is one of her top two priorities. The department is working on a plan now to restructure the program, but state officials haven\u2019t said whether or not that would include a boost in reimbursement rates.\n\nIn the meantime, the next free California Dental Association dental fair will be held in Fresno, in October.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many are covered by Denti-Cal, but reimbursements are so low that few dentists accept the patients.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"State Expands Dental Coverage for Poor \\u2014 But Getting Treatment Is Another Matter\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/05\\/07\\/millions-struggle-to-access-dental-care-in-california\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-07 08:49:40\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-05-07 10:48:52\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":25334,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Dental Care\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/05\\/SOHIMG_1408.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Many are covered by Denti-Cal, but reimbursements are so low that few dentists accept the patients.", "title": "State Expands Dental Coverage for Poor \u2014 But Getting Treatment Is Another Matter", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/05/07/millions-struggle-to-access-dental-care-in-california/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/05/IMG_1429-2-800x1067.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "dental care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In the meantime, the next free California Dental Association dental fair will be held in Fresno, in October.\nIt was free dental day \u2013 a special program run by the California Dental Association Foundation.\nAt a time when millions more have been added into coverage, it\u2019s becoming harder to find dental care.\nMore than 2,000 people received services at a free dental fair held in Sacramento in March.\nDenti-Cal, the state\u2019s program of dental care for low-income Californians, including 5 million children, is in disarray."}
