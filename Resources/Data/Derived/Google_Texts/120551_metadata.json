The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have put together a new publication called \u201cTravelers\u2019 Health: Ensuring Business Travel Is a Productive Asset\u201d filled with eye-opening statistics and advice to protect the health of those who travel on business.\n\nAn estimated 5.1 million United States residents travel outside of the country for business, and according to the CDC, this opens them up to a wide variety of health risks and financial burdens for employers. With only 10 percent of international business travelers receiving pre-travel health care, health problems can drastically threaten the well-being of U.S. travelers.\n\nThe average age for business travelers is 45.9 years old, according to the U.S. Travel Association, and for every 100,000 travels, 50 percent will experience a health problem within a month. In 2013, the direct spending on business travel by both domestic and international employees totaled to $266.5. International traveling alone supported about 1.2 million U.S. jobs and $29.5 billion in wages.\n\nThe CDC warns that, even though business travel remains as a profitable and important component to our business development, it also comes with many health risks. Of the 100,000 travelers each month, 8,000 will need to see a physician and an additional 300 will becomes so ill or injured that they\u2019ll require hospitalization. One person will even die due to a health-related problem abroad, statistics find.\n\nBusiness Traveler's Health Risk Cost Breakdown: CDC Business Traveler's Health Risk Cost Breakdown: CDC\n\nThe average burdening cost of an adult health care payer to treat malaria, for example, is $25,250 along with six to 24 business days lost. Meanwhile, had the business traveler only taken the necessary preventive steps, they would\u2019ve only dug $162 out of their pockets.\n\nCosts are often acquired by the employer. Let\u2019s say you come into contact with hepatitis A. The cost for treatment would be around $2,500, but if the traveler just received two doses of a preemptive hepatitis A vaccine, it\u2019d only cost $300. For a two-week trip, the average business traveler could pay $15 to $370 for medical evacuation insurance, or they could risk going uninsured and pay between $25,000 to $250,000 if they needed to be airlifted to a hospital or the like, which 50 out of every 100,000 travelers will need.\n\nThe CDC\u2019s Travel Health resources have been made available in print, mobile, online, and in eBook format in order to have a \u201ctrusted, in-depth travel medicine reference\u201d on hand.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "business, traveler, health, risk, cdc, estimates, 50000, will, have, health, problems, while", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The CDC released a traveler's medical reference guide in order to encourage preventive treatments, decrease medical costs, and educate the public.", "title": "CDC: Traveling For Business May Put Your Health At Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/business-traveler-health-risk-cdc-estimates-50000-will-have-health-problems-while-abroad-290342", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/traveling-business-could-cause-health-risks-cdc-warns.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The CDC released a traveler's medical reference guide in order to encourage preventive treatments, decrease medical costs, and educate the public.", "title": "CDC: Traveling For Business May Put Your Health At Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/business-traveler-health-risk-cdc-estimates-50000-will-have-health-problems-while-abroad-290342", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/traveling-business-could-cause-health-risks-cdc-warns.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/27/traveling-business-could-cause-health-risks-cdc-warns.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-06-27T14:18:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-27T14:18:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The CDC released a traveler's medical reference guide in order to encourage preventive treatments, decrease medical costs, and educate the public."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec11\"", "article_summary": "Business Traveler's Health Risk Cost Breakdown: CDC Business Traveler's Health Risk Cost Breakdown: CDCThe average burdening cost of an adult health care payer to treat malaria, for example, is $25,250 along with six to 24 business days lost.\nWith only 10 percent of international business travelers receiving pre-travel health care, health problems can drastically threaten the well-being of U.S. travelers.\nMeanwhile, had the business traveler only taken the necessary preventive steps, they would\u2019ve only dug $162 out of their pockets.\nThe CDC\u2019s Travel Health resources have been made available in print, mobile, online, and in eBook format in order to have a \u201ctrusted, in-depth travel medicine reference\u201d on hand.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have put together a new publication called \u201cTravelers\u2019 Health: Ensuring Business Travel Is a Productive Asset\u201d filled with eye-opening statistics and advice to protect the health of those who travel on business."}
