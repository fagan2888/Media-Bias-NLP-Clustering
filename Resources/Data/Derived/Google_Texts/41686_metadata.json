In 2015 America. Did I mention I really like this lady?\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s better: the wounded incredulity in Democratic Party hack* Martha Raddatz\u2019s voice at the very idea of repealing Obamacare, or Love\u2019s calm, confident, matter-of-fact reaction.\n\nNow it\u2019s your turn, racists: Disagree with Mia Love.
