Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) and Peter Roskam (R., Ill.), takes a somewhat unprecedented stand against Erdogan for his anti-Semitic rhetoric, which has caused much concern lately in the Jewish community, but has not been directly addressed by the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cTurkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s continued anti-Israel incitement, including stating that Israel\u2019s defense against Hamas rocket fire is \u2018\u2019barbarism that surpasses Hitler,\u2019 sparks unwarranted anger towards Jews and endangers the Turkish Jewish community and Jews around the world,\u201d the resolution states.\n\nIn a sign of Congress\u2019 growing frustration with Turkey, Erdogan is the only prominent world leader explicitly called to task for his rhetoric in the measure.\n\nThis follows multiple reports that Turkey, a NATO ally, has been harboring as many as 12 Hamas operatives, including a senior leader who is believed to have organized the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teens.\n\nTurkey\u2019s record of anti-Semitism and support for Hamas has not prompted the Obama administration to vocalize concerns. U.S. arms sales to Turkey will also still go forward, according to the State Department.\n\nCongressional insiders say that Erdogan\u2019s anti-Semitism has become an increasing concern on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cPeople are happy to see members taking a stand against now-President Erdogan, who has a long history of inciting anti-Semitism within Turkey and spewing anti-Israel vitriol at every turn,\u201d said one senior congressional aide working on the resolution. \u201cHis controversial statements and support for terrorist organizations like Hamas should, at the very least, call into question bilateral relations between the United States and Turkey.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s most recent conflict with Hamas terrorists has been a driving factor in recent anti-Semitic incidents in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere, lawmakers warned.\n\n\u201cDuring Israel\u2019s July 2014 Operation Protective Edge aiming to stem the rocket fire and terrorist infiltrations by Hamas, Jews and Jewish institutions and property have been attacked in Europe and elsewhere, including attempts to invade a synagogue in Paris, fire-bombings of synagogues in France and Germany, assaults on Jewish individuals, and swastikas spray-painted in a heavily,\u201d the resolution notes.\n\nThe bill has already attracted more than 80 lawmakers\u2014including House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) members Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R., Fla.), Ted Deutch (D., Fla.), and Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.)\u2014and is expected to be taken up by the Foreign Affairs Committee next week.\n\nAnti-Semitism continues to trend upward around the world, predominately in the Middle East and some European countries, according to statistics outlined in the new resolution, which is supported by a diverse group of Jewish groups on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nThe resolution has garnered the backing of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), Christian United for Israel (CUFI), the American Jewish Committee (AJC), and several other pro-Israel organizations.\n\nMore than 25 percent of the global population holds anti-Semitic views, according to a recent poll conducted by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in more than 100 countries.\n\nLawmakers dubbed this \u201ca stunning indicator of the stubborn resilience of anti-Semitic beliefs, even in countries where no Jews reside,\u201d according to the resolution.\n\nHatred of Jews is particularly acute in the Middle East and North Africa, where nearly 75 percent hold anti-Semitic views, according to the ADL study.\n\nThe ADL also found that at least 70 percent \u201cof those around the world who harbor anti-Semitic attitudes have never met a Jew,\u201d according to the resolution. This statistic \u201cshows how deeply embedded stereotypes of Jews that developed over centuries are in the consciousness of many countries and societies.\u201d\n\nHolocaust denial and revisionism also remains prevalent. The ADL found that a majority of those surveyed have \u201ceither not heard of the Holocaust or do not believe it happened as has been documented by factual accounts and recorded by history.\u201d\n\nThe State Department additionally has noted the fear that European Jews are experiencing as a result of increasing hostility from government actors and citizens.\n\n\u201cThroughout Europe, the historical stain of anti-Semitism continued to be a fact of life on Internet fora, in soccer stadiums, and through Nazi-like salutes, leading many individuals who are Jewish to conceal their religious identity,\u201d the State Department wrote in its 2013 International Religious Freedom Report.\n\nIn order to combat this trend, lawmakers are pledging to back Holocaust educational programs in the United States and abroad, as well as to make the struggle against anti-Semitism \u201ca United States foreign policy priority,\u201d according to the measure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New measure seeks to combat rising tide of anti-Semitism", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "More than 80 House lawmakers are pushing to crack down on rising anti-Semitism across the globe following a sharp spike in violent attacks on Jews in the wake of Israel\u2019s most recent conflict with G", "title": "Congress Targets Turkish President\u2019s Anti-Semitism", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/congress-targets-turkish-presidents-anti-semitism/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Recep-Tayyip-Erdogan-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than 80 House lawmakers are pushing to crack down on rising anti-Semitism across the globe foll", "creator": "@Kredo0", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Recep-Tayyip-Erdogan-150x150.jpg", "title": "Congress Targets Turkish President\u2019s Anti-Semitism", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf1f\"", "article_summary": "The bipartisan resolution presents \u201cclear evidence\u201d that anti-Semitism is on the rise around the globe and specifically targets Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for fostering anti-Semitism.\nTurkey\u2019s record of anti-Semitism and support for Hamas has not prompted the Obama administration to vocalize concerns.\nIn a sign of Congress\u2019 growing frustration with Turkey, Erdogan is the only prominent world leader explicitly called to task for his rhetoric in the measure.\nLawmakers dubbed this \u201ca stunning indicator of the stubborn resilience of anti-Semitic beliefs, even in countries where no Jews reside,\u201d according to the resolution.\nCongressional insiders say that Erdogan\u2019s anti-Semitism has become an increasing concern on Capitol Hill."}
