It is I, your El Presidente, reporting to you from atop a falling meteor streaking over the city of Los Angeles!\n\nEl Mayimbe, my old nemesis over at that second rate Latino-themed movie gossip site, Latino Review, has just dropped a massive scoop in a new video. Mayimbe says that Nightwing will appear in the upcoming Superman vs. Batman movie. He claims that a very reliable source told him this, and that the studio is looking to cast a young John Hawkes type for the role and a stunt man who fits the same description and can perform martial arts. In the story, supposedly, Nightwing will have not spoken to Batman for several years due to some kind of falling out.\n\nMy friends, let me apologize for letting El Mayimbe get the scoop on me. The fact is, I did know about this news before El Mayimbe, but I wasn't able to post it online in time because of the Obamacare website. Stupid Obamacare!\n\nNow, keep in mind, this is only a rumor. It may turn out to be true. It may turn out that El Mayimbe is a fat liar. Haw haw haw! It doesn't matter though. What matters is the unique hits and industry credited trade scoops, as we all know.\n\nAs always, comrades, I'll keep you posted on the latest scoops here at Cubano Review and The Outhouse.\n\nSupport our sponsors:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new rumor claims that Dick Grayson will appear in Superman vs. Batman.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "El Presidente", "og": {"site_name": "The Outhouse - The Journalism the Comics Industry Deserves", "description": "A new rumor claims that Dick Grayson will appear in Superman vs. Batman.", "title": "Will Joseph Gordon-Levitt Play Nightwing in Superman Vs.
