Among that group, less than 40 percent receive professional treatment, choosing instead to battle their ailment in silence, often to their detriment and that of others.\n\nBut in the months and years after a young man opened fire on students and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut, President Obama has helped elevate the conversation about mental health to the national stage.\n\nThe current administration has taken several significant steps forward in this area, potentially ensuring that President Obama has found his place as the most progressive executive on mental health issues in the last 30 years. Some of the desired results, however, have not yet come to fruition.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Obama has expanded access to mental health treatment for afflicted Americans as part of an effort to destigmatize this silent killer and prevent future massacres. In February, the president signed into law the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act \u2014 legislation that would improve veterans\u2019 access to mental health treatment \u2014 after it passed through the House and Senate. And earlier this month, First Lady Michelle Obama announced the launch of \u201cThe Campaign to Change Direction,\u201d her attempt to raise mental health awareness among Americans.\n\n\u201cWith President Obama being a prolific figure in our society, this act of stepping out and advocating equal access for all is crucial,\u201d Lanada Williams, licensed psychotherapist and CEO of Alliance Family Solutions Counseling, told ThinkProgress. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve seen that in other administrations.\u201d\n\nWilliams said that while conversations about the lack of access of mental health services have taken place among practitioners, Obama taking the lead on the issue has brought awareness to the stigma of mental illness to a new federal level that will shift national conversation of behavioral health; hopefully, the president\u2019s successor can keep up the momentum.\n\n\u201cHis actions highlight the need for more mental health research and affordability of professional mental health services. Those are two things that we need to keep at the forefront because even with the Affordable Care Act, the stigma is still there in some communities,\u201d she said.\n\nUnder the ACA, mental illness is no longer treated as a preexisting condition, allowing people to receive coverage as they would for treatment for physical ailments. That change has allowed some young people \u2014 many whom were able to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance plan a bit longer under the health care law \u2014 to seek treatment. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the number of people receiving mental health and substance abuse treatment services rose by seven percentage points within a two-year period.\n\nHowever, issues still remain, particularly when one takes access to treatment into account. Many states haven\u2019t been able to keep up with the influx in demand among the mentally ill for treatment. A Mental Health America report released earlier this year designated Arizona, Mississippi, Nevada, and Washington as the lowest ranking states for access to care. In January, nearly 2,600 mental health practitioners went on a week-long strike to combat what they described as Kaiser Permanente\u2019s refusal to hire more psychiatrists, social workers, and therapists.\n\nLisa Ferentz, a licensed clinical social worker, said that the low coverage also remains a hurdle for people who need mental health services. Ferentz, a practitioner with 30 years of experience, told ThinkProgress that solving this particular issue may be out of President Obama\u2019s hands. The current insurance reimbursement system, according to Ferentz, places patients at a disadvantage.\n\n\u201cMany insurance plans are restrictive. There are many people who deserve mental health care resources but who don\u2019t get it because they can\u2019t access them,\u201d Ferentz said. \u201cEven if people want to see me, the level of reimbursement is so low it ultimately discourages them. This has been an issue for years. Many of us who have been frustrated with the insurance companies opt out so what\u2019s left for patients is a small pool of professionals limited in experience.\u201d\n\nFarentz recounted instances when she had to lobby insurance companies to cover her clients\u2019 additional sessions once they reached the threshold outlined in their insurance plan. She said those experiences made her realize why it\u2019s important that insurance providers let those who suffer from mental ailments \u2014 regardless of income level \u2014 choose their therapists and duration of care without worrying about financial burden.\n\nNew York-based attorney Carolyn Reinach Wolf, the director of her firm\u2019s mental health law practice, added that federal laws need to change so that families can have more of an input in how their loved ones with mental illnesses receive treatment. She also called on the mental health care system to be more proactive rather than reactive, stating the need for involuntary commitment of those who pose an imminent danger to themselves and others. \u201cWe have misplaced ideas about how to treat the mentally ill. I\u2019ve seen this through my own clients,\u201d she told ThinkProgress.\n\nKatrina Gay, NAMI\u2019s national spokesperson, places much of the onus on Congress, which has struggled to pass bill that would comprehensively reform the mental health care system since the Sandy Hook massacre.\n\nLawmakers haven\u2019t built consensus around two pieces of legislation that tackle various aspects of mental health treatment problem: Rep. Tim Murphy\u2019s (R-PA) Helping Families in Mental Crisis Act and Rep. Ron Barber\u2019s (D-AZ) Strengthening Mental Health in Our Communities Act. Last year, thousands of NAMI representatives converged on Capitol Hill to lobby their representatives to pass mental healthcare reform to no avail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that the Obama administration has taken action, but Congress as a body has failed to pass legislation and that\u2019s a huge part of this issue,\u201d Gay told ThinkProgress. \u201cPulling one lever in the executive branch is not enough. The administration\u2019s actions have not been replicated in other policy circles on the scale that it should have been. There has been some good attention and that\u2019s meaningful especially when it comes to veterans and young adults. However, health care reform and increasing coverage doesn\u2019t translate into better access.\u201d\n\nDuring his time in office, President Obama has urged Americans to \u201cbring mental illness out of the shadows.\u201d While he\u2019s arguably taken some important steps in that direction, he can\u2019t do it without other lawmakers on the state and national level.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve seen that in other administrations.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve seen that in other administrations.\"", "title": "President Obama Has Elevated The Conversation About Mental Health To The National Stage", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/03/13/3633203/obama-mental-health-care-legacy/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Obama-at-podium1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I don\u2019t think that I\u2019ve seen that in other administrations.\"", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Obama-at-podium1-321x214.jpg", "title": "President Obama Has Elevated The Conversation About Mental Health To The National Stage", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Obama-at-podium1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Obama-at-podium1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-13T08:00:14+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc0bf\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHis actions highlight the need for more mental health research and affordability of professional mental health services.\nHealth President Obama Has Elevated The Conversation About Mental Health To The National Stage CREDIT: AP Photo/Carolyn KasterOne in four adults across the United States suffers from a mental illness \u2014 including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder \u2014 according to the National Alliance on Mental lllness (NAMI).\nAccording to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the number of people receiving mental health and substance abuse treatment services rose by seven percentage points within a two-year period.\nLawmakers haven\u2019t built consensus around two pieces of legislation that tackle various aspects of mental health treatment problem: Rep.
