ESTERO, Fla. - A minor league hockey player in Florida now faces arson charges. Police say he started a fire in his apartment when he tried to burn letters from his girlfriend.

Justin Agosta, 25, was arrested on Dec. 30. Police say he was angry with his girlfriend so he decided to douse letters she gave him with gasoline and light them on fire. Soon, the fire got out of control.

Agosta says he tried to put out the fire with water and a towel but couldn't. Eventually the sprinklers came on and he called 911.

Police put out the fire before anybody was injured. Agosta plays for the Florida Everblades, a minor league team based in Estero, near Ft. Myers. The team plays in the ECHL. They are affiliated with the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League.

Agosta has not missed any of his team's games. He is due back in court on Feb. 1.
