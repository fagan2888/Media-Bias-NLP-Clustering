ClotureClub's Tea party Insult Generator is made using actual insults posted on John Boehner's Facebook page.

House Speaker John Boehner has had a rough week. First, he had to weather a mini-revolt among house republicans. Then, his party’s gambit to defund Obamacare in exchange for avoiding default failed in epic fashion. And then, on top of everything else, Boehner was riddled with abuse on his personal Facebook page from Tea Partiers who felt he had sold them out by compromising.

Luckily, the DC-based website Cloture Club has turned Boehner’s lemons into comedy lemonade by creating an entire Tea Party Insult Generator from these conservative social media rantings. Want to give a liberal, or even worse, a RHINO (republican in name only) a piece of your mind? This insult generator has you covered with instant classics like SPINELESS FASCIST TURNCOAT or LEFTY CONSTITUTION-SHREDDING DEVIL.

Cloture’s diss-maker is far from the first site to help you put democrats down. FightLiberals.com offers some more verbose options, such as “Are you always such an unmedicated, celebrity-adoring hippie, or is today a special occasion?” Sounds like a line from 30 Rock‘s Jack Donaghy.
