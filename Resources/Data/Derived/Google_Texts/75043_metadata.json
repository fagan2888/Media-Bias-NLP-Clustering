Comstock (R-Fairfax). (Jim Barnes/For The Washington Post)\n\nPeople with low incomes who lack health insurance can get medical services at a new free clinic in Chantilly. The Adams Compassionate Healthcare Network, a nonprofit arm of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, formally opened the clinic June 8 with an inaugural ceremony at the ADAMS Sully Center.\n\nAn interfaith team of volunteer doctors and other medical professionals donate their services Saturdays at the clinic, which ADAMS officials describe as \u201cthe first Muslim-organized initiative in Virginia that seeks to meet the comprehensive health-care needs of all qualifying, low-income individuals.\u201d Organizers said the clinic is the first of what they hope becomes a network of free clinics across Virginia and, eventually, in other states.\n\n\u201cAs Muslims, we believe that if anyone saves a life, it is as though they have saved the lives of all of mankind,\u201d said Rizwan Jaka, chairman of the ADAMS board of trustees. \u201cAnd so that is one of the banners that we operate under . . . to help others that are in need, to help save lives. And that is the mission . . . that this clinic was born out of.\u201d\n\nJaka said that the health care network is a multi-faith, multilingual nonprofit organization with volunteers and patients of many different religious and cultural backgrounds.\n\n\u201cEven with the Affordable [Care] Act, there are millions of Americans without health insurance, hundreds of thousands of Virginians without health insurance . . . and it is something that we as private citizens should do to help those who are not covered,\u201d Jaka said.\n\nYahya Alvi, chairman of the health-care network, said that the clinic has provided care for more than 200 patients since it began offering services in November. More than 200 volunteers have donated more than 1,200 hours of medical services valued at more than $100,000 at no cost to patients or the health-care system, he said.\n\nAlthough the health-care network includes specialists in areas such as cardiology, ophthalmology and OB/GYN, the focus is on primary care, said Tariq Aziz, the clinic\u2019s medical director.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got about 30 or 40 primary care physicians who rotate every week, who come in and see patients,\u201d he said. They are usually referred to private offices if they need specialists, he said, \u201cbecause inevitably, they\u2019re going to need some kind of procedures done which are very difficult to coordinate out of the clinic, with it being only open on Saturdays for patients.\u201d\n\nAziz said the clinic also provides support and education in areas such as diet, nutrition, blood pressure and managing medications.\n\nPatients who want to receive services at the clinic need to make an appointment to come in during the week, and bring financial documents for eligibility screening, Aziz said. The clinic is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays for screening, he said.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re eligible, then we see them on Saturdays,\u201d Aziz said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only time we have physicians and providers who come here to see those patients. Because we\u2019re a registered free clinic in the commonwealth of Virginia, [patients] have to meet specific requirements, and with the hustle and bustle of patients on Saturdays, we can\u2019t screen them and get them in quickly.\u201d\n\nAziz said he hopes to be able to expand the clinic\u2019s Saturday hours and begin offering services Sundays, based on the availability of providers and space at the clinic.\n\n\u201cWe have a long way to go,\u201d Aziz said. \u201cThis is only the beginning. We have only scratched the surface of what we feel the vision [is] for the service community and for the patients we are serving. We want to expand our network of physicians, ultimately establish a hospital [and] expand the social services that we provide for the patients.\u201d\n\nThe inaugural ceremony attracted government officials and leaders of religious and civic organizations, including representatives of Muslim, Jewish and Christian congregations; Loudoun and Fairfax county government officials; Loudoun County Sheriff\u2019s Office officials; Scout groups; and members of the Salvation Army.\n\nThe two major party candidates for Virginia\u2019s 10th District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives \u2014 state Del. Barbara J. Comstock (R-Fairfax) and Fairfax Supervisor John W. Foust (D-Dranesville) \u2014 congratulated the ADAMS leadership on the opening of the free clinic.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re serving people, it\u2019s not just their health-care needs you\u2019re serving,\u201d Comstock said. \u201cIt\u2019s to bring God\u2019s mercy to them and, really, to cure the whole person. And we know so often when we have people who are in need in any way, whether it\u2019s health care or needing food, they\u2019re also in need of a community. And what you here are doing is bringing a sense of community, bringing the interfaith community together.\u201d\n\n\u201cHealth care is a basic human right,\u201d Foust said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t matter what your station in life [is], or whether you\u2019re rich or poor or where you live. You should have access . . . to good, quality health care. Unfortunately, many people in this country do not. We\u2019re working and trying to address and solve that problem on the national and state levels. But at the local level, we\u2019re always going to have to have organizations like this clinic.\u201d\n\nJim Barnes is a freelance writer.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "free clinic,", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "People with low incomes who lack health insurance can get medical services at a new free clinic in Chantilly.
