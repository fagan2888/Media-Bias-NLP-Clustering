After all, the makeup of the insurance pools will have a heavy impact on the cost of premiums. A new report shows that those who signed up in ACA plans early in the six-month enrollment period were sicker-than-average.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nExpress Scripts, a pharmacy benefit management service, reports that use of specialty medications was higher among exchange enrollees versus patients enrolled in commercial health plans. Six of the top 10 costliest medications that were used by ACA enrollees were specialty drugs, compared to four in 10 of the costliest medications used by patients on commercial health plans.\n\nHealth-status is key to keeping costs low for insurance companies, and in return, consumers. If only older and sicker people were to sign up, analysts say an adverse risk \u201cdeath spiral\u201d would occur, meaning young and healthy enrollees wouldn\u2019t be there to offset the costs of insuring older and less healthy people. This would cause premiums to spike in years to come, although insurers and experts are reporting double-digit hikes are likely to occur in 2015 due to the reform and inflation.\n\nExpress Scripts also found approximately 43% of exchange enrollees had a plan with Express Scripts in 2013, meaning 57% were uninsured or had a plan that did not provide pharmacy coverage. The proportion of pain medication was 35% higher in exchange plans versus commercial plans, while the proportion of anti-seizure medications was 27% higher in each respective plan.\n\nAntidepressant prescription proportions were 14% higher in exchange plans than commercial plans, but the proportion of contraceptives was 31% lower in exchange plans. More than 6 in every 1,000 prescriptions in exchange plans were for HIV medications, which is four times higher than figures from commercial health plans, Express Scripts reports.\n\nThe survey looked at 650,000 de-identified pharmacy claims from January 1 through February 28 for patients enrolled in public health exchange plans under the law, versus those on commercial plans during the same period.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe ACA mandates that every insurance plan must cover 10 essential health benefits, including prescription drug costs, mental health care and ambulatory services. Customers with pre-existing conditions can no longer be discriminated against by insurers under the law. Ratios for charging older and sicker people versus younger and healthier people also dropped to three-to-one from five-to-one under the 2010 law.\n\nThe White House has reported 7.1 million Americans selected plans on both federal and state exchanges, but health-status and age have yet to be specified. The ACA mandates every individual in the country have insurance by the end of open enrollment period, which ended on March 31, or they will face a fine of $95 a year or 1% of their annual income for failing to comply.\n\nThose who have not been able to complete enrollment have until April 15 to finish the process on Healthcare.gov.\n\nThe survey confirms what many believed about early enrollees, says Julie Huppert, Express Scripts vice president of health-care reform.\n\n\u201cThe hypothesis was that sicker and older people would be the first in line to get coverage,\u201d Huppert says. \u201cThose with chronic and complex conditions would want coverage, so we aren\u2019t surprised that the early enrollment demo skewed older.\u201d\n\nIt still remains to be seen if younger and healthier enrollees signed up toward the second half of the enrollment period, she says. The last demographic breakdown was in mid-March, when 4.2 million enrollees were announced, and 25% were between the ages of 18 and 34, according to HHS.\n\nBut it\u2019s important to remember that being young doesn\u2019t necessarily mean an enrollee is healthy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that you hook the two together\u2014young and healthy\u2014but you will have some young people with chronic conditions,\u201d Huppert says. \u201cBut way of generality, you see the assumption is always made that if you are young, you are healthy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 02:42:36 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "A new report finds that those who enrolled in Affordable Care Act exchange plans early on were sicker than those on commercial health plans.
