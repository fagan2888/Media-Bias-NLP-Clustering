UPDATE: September 27 3:00 p.m.

Bay County Sheriff's officials have released the names of the two bodies found at a Southport home Friday night.

Sheriff's investigations found the bodies of 44-year-old Donna Maria Meredino and 46-year-old John Steve Bowen Friday night.

They arrived after one of Meredino's family members found the bodies and placed a 911 call.

Neighbors say they have heard the two bickering inside the home before, but they also say it's a quiet neighborhood and were shocked to see something like this happen.

Bay Co. Sheriff's Office Public Information Office Ruth Corley said the two didn't have cell phone numbers or any permanent address on record, making it difficult to notify family members.

But they were able to get in touch with some of them.

"We believe that it was not random, we do not believe that anyone in the area or anyone in bay county needs to worry about the safety of their family from what we have so far learned from this crime scene and from the scene at this home," Corley said.

Corley says the autopsies are scheduled for Monday.

Until then Bay Co. Crime Scene Investigators will continue working on this case.
