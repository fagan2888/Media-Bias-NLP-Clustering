Granted, she is a celebrity, and the spotlight will always find her. However, is a report needed on everything?\n\nRemember Taylor Swift before she was Taylor Swift? She was the bright-eyed, bushy-tailed, 14-year-old country songwriter who had a knack for a great hook. We enjoyed her music, her poetry, her talent.\n\nNow Taylor Swift is making news for her outfits, her boyfriends, really anything but her music. Take this article written by The Daily Mail, a UK publication: The big news story appears to be that Taylor Swift is wearing clothes. Bravo. The story behind the story is that she is wearing these clothes at the gym. Who really brings these clothes to a gymnasium, where people actively exercise? If there were as good a time to be caught in yoga pants, it would be at a gym.\n\nInstead, Taylor Swift chooses a white blouse, light blue skirt, and lovely heels. If there is any one piece of clothing that shouldn\u2019t be found at the gym, it\u2019s a blouse. But this is what we\u2019re talking about. Taylor Swift wearing a blouse certainly is not what we would deem \u201cnewsworthy.\u201d\n\nTaylor Swift certainly seems to be taking the media circus well recently. But we are sure that Ms. Swift would agree that it\u2019s a bit silly that a newspaper is wasting ink on the status on Taylor Swift\u2019s outfit.\n\nHere\u2019s another topic found at the top of the news for Taylor Swift, provided by Huffington Post. Wouldn\u2019t you like to know how Taylor Swift feels about red lipstick? Well, we\u2019ll tell you. She feels like her face looks worse without it. Holy cow. Earth has shifted. Taylor Swift likes red lipstick. How about reporting on something with substance, media? The problem is, there is no substance when it comes to Taylor Swift. She hasn\u2019t put out an album or gone on a major tour recently. But we can\u2019t really expect her to keep pumping out record after record, or break up with boyfriend after boyfriend.\n\nSo, if there is no news, don\u2019t try to create the news. That\u2019s what we in the news try not to do, create the news. When the real news happens, we\u2019re here to report on it. So, when Taylor Swift has a real newsworthy moment, we\u2019ll report on it. Until then, rest assured that Taylor Swift is wearing clothes and red lipstick.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taylor Swift seems to be in a constant spotlight for everything she does in her life.
