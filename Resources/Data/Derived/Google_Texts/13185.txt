AIDS.gov Virtual Office Hours is our new social media technical assistance service. Registering for a Virtual Office Hours session gives you one-on-one time with an AIDS.gov social media expert, to ask questions about new media tools, learn strategies that are well-suited to your HIV outreach, and share your organization’s best practices. You can make an appointment just for yourself, or invite other team members who may want to learn about social media.

How can you receive technical assistance during AIDS.gov Virtual Office Hours?

Virtual Office Hours is every Tuesday and Thursday, from 2:00pm – 4:00pm EST.

Please register online for a one-on-one 30 minute session.

After you register, you will be asked to fill out an online intake form to help us better address your social media queries.

Once you complete the intake form, you will receive session confirmation and contact details for your appointment date.

Bring us your your questions, big or small. Want to get started on Twitter? Want to learn how to set goals for your social media efforts and then measure impact? Learn about what others in the community have done? Need tips on creating eye-catching visuals? Virtual Office Hours is here to help!
