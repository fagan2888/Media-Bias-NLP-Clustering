MIGUEL ALMAGAR, CHICHO CALIFORNIA. >>> THIS IS JANET IN LOS ANGELES. MARISSA AND MARASOL WERE A MIRROR OF EACH OTHER. THEIR BEDROOM DRESS SORES WERE LINED WITH COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE LETTERS. THEY WANT THE THE SAME SCHOOL. >> THEY WERE GOING TO SEE THIS ONE. >> Reporter: ONE OF THE FEW TIMES THE TEENS TOOK SEPARATE PATHS IS WHEN THEY BOARDED DIFFERENT BUSES IN L.A. NOW AN UNBEARABLE WEIGHT. THEIR MOTHER ONLY TALKED TO MARASOL WHO IS OKAY. SHE HEARD NOTHING FROM MARISSA. >> Translator: THE PAIN THAT I HAVE IN MY HEART AS A MOTHER, NO, NO, I'M NOT FINE. >> Reporter: IT IS HEART BREAK, WHAT SHOULD BE THE HAPPIEST TIME, THE SEASON OF PROM AND PARTIES AT THEIR SCHOOL WITH GRADUATION AND CELEBRATION WAITING IN THE WING. EACH TIME THE PHONE RINGS, THERE IS AS MUCH ANGUISH AS HOPE. >> IT'S TORTURE BECAUSE YOU WANT TO ANSWER IT TO SEE IF IT'S GOOD NEWS BUT YOU'RE TERRIFIED IT MIGHT BE BAD NEWS. IT'S HORRIBLE. >> Reporter: AND LATE THIS AFTERNOON, THE FAMILY RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE CORONER'S OFFICE ASKING FOR MEDICAL RECORDS, DENTAL RECORDS. THEY ARE PRAYING FOR A MIRACLE, AND THEY ARE NOT ALONE. THE STUDENTS ON THESE BUSES, BRIAN, THEY COME FROM 46 HIGH
