Clarice Navarro of Pueblo and Polly Lawrence of Douglas County are lobbying members of their Republican caucus to be the next assistant minority leader.\n\nThe office is now held by Rep. Libby Szabo of Arvada, who will be resigning as she was selected by a vacancy committee to serve on the Jefferson County board of commissioners. Her resignation date and the caucus election date are not known yet.\n\nLawrence said she worked with the minority leader, Brian DelGrosso, during the election to help pick up three seats that had been in Democratic hands. \u201cI think Brian and I make a great team, raising money, reaching out and identifying candidates and working with our caucus,\u201d she said.\n\nNavarro said she has leadership skills that would help the caucus.\n\n\u201cWe need to be more aggressive in our tactical and political moves,\u201d she said, adding that includes raising money. \u201cWe all need to own a piece of this, especially those of us in safe seats. If we don\u2019t raise the money to win critical races we won\u2019t win back the majority.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Brian DelGrosso,Clarice Navarro,Colorado House,Libby Szabo,Polly Lawrence", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "With Libby Szabo set to resign, Reps.
