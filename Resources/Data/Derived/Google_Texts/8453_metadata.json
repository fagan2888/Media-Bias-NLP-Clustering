In that same time frame, Democrats have evolved across 10 issues: Abortion, sex out of wedlock, extramarital affairs, cloning humans, cloning animals, divorce, suicide, stem-cell research, polygamy and homosexual relations.\n\nWhile Americans across the political spectrum have become increasingly tolerant of issues that were previously deemed \u201cmorally wrong,\u201d 74 percent of those polled believe the country\u2019s moral values are getting increasingly worse. And when asked about the most important issues facing the country, 6 percent pointed to the United States\u2019 moral and ethical decline.\n\nThe polling agency pointed to age differences and political ideology as cause for the divide in which issues are deemed \u201cmorally acceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeep divisions exist among Americans,\u201d Gallup noted, \u201cand clashes over the moral acceptance of certain issues will more than likely continue in the years to come.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "A new survey examining whether the American people view a range of issues as \"morally acceptable\" has found that infidelity is more acceptable among those identifying as Democrats than Republicans.", "title": "Poll: Infidelity more acceptable among Dems than Republicans - Red...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/05/120508_nc_amendment_ap_328-600x325.jpg", "height": 325}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/06/01/poll-infidelity-acceptable-among-dems-republicans/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "published_time": "2014-06-01T13:16:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-01T13:16:29+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82e3\"", "article_summary": "A new survey examining whether the American people view a range of issues as \u201cmorally acceptable\u201d has found that infidelity is more acceptable among those identifying as Democrats than Republicans.\nOver the past 12 years, the poll stated, Republicans have become more accepting of homosexual relations, sex out of wedlock and divorce.\nIn examining the differences between issues Republicans and Democrats find \u201cmorally acceptable,\u201d those identifying with the GOP viewed the death penalty, buying and wearing clothing made of animal fur, and medical testing on animal to be respectable.\nWhile extramarital affairs are largely frowned upon across party lines, the Gallup poll found that 13 percent of Democrats believe married men and women having an affair is morally acceptable, compared to just 1 percent of Republicans.\nAnd when asked about the most important issues facing the country, 6 percent pointed to the United States\u2019 moral and ethical decline."}
