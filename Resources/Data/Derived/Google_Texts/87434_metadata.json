(AP) - Fewer license plates from Canada are showing up in northern Montana as the Canadian dollar continues to weaken and make shopping trips to the U.S. more expensive.\n\nAs of Aug. 31, the U.S. dollar was worth $1.32 in Canadian currency, the strongest the U.S. dollar has been in at least five years.\n\nThe Canadian dollar is tied to the commodity market, unlike the U.S. greenback. So when oil prices began falling this summer, dipping below $40 a barrel for the first time since 2009, the Loonie followed suit.\n\nPatrick Barkey, the director of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Montana, said the drop in oil prices is the second gut-punch the Canadian dollar received, since the price for natural gas is also low.\n\n\u201cOil is just the second shoe to drop there,\u201d Barkey told the Flathead Beacon (http://bit.ly/1UziCR0).\n\nAlready, some of the oil companies in Canada are cutting back. In March, Schlumberger, one of the world\u2019s largest oilfield services and equipment companies, closed its operations in Medicine Hat, Alberta.\n\nIn Montana\u2019s Flathead Valley, that will likely lead to fewer shopping sprees from Canadian buyers because they\u2019ll only search out the essentials for their trip, Donna Townley, an economist at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, said\n\nRestaurants will probably retain business but retail will suffer, if it hasn\u2019t already, she said.\n\nAt the Costco in Kalispell, where Canadian customers make up 10 percent of the total sales, their absence has been noted.\n\nWarehouse manager Greg Gillingham said sales to Canadian customers are down about 30 percent since last December.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a bit of money,\u201d Gillingham said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely affected us.\u201d\n\nBarkey, of the BBER, said not only will it affect retail goods but the construction and real estate industries might feel the sting of fewer Canadians buying or building second homes here.\n\nTownley said businesses catering to Canadians in higher income brackets, such as medical tourism, won\u2019t likely be affected as much, because those visitors have the cash to spend.\n\nSeveral factors still undetermined, such as the upcoming Canadian elections and the U.S. Federal Reserve decisions on potentially increasing interest rates in September, will affect the currency in both nations.\n\nIf the Canadian currency continues to fall, Townley said, investors will sell their Loonies and buy U.S. dollars. And as oil prices continue to fall, speculators go back to the \u201csafe haven\u201d of the greenback, she said.\n\n\u201cWe have no control,\u201d Townley said. \u201cThose speculators dominate the market.\u201d\n\nBarkey said he expects the effects of the low oil prices to hit in North Dakota and eastern Montana as well, considering that oil producers there locked in prices when they were still high.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a delay before many of them saw the full brunt of the price declines,\u201d Barkey said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a delay though.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Flathead Beacon, http://www.flatheadbeacon.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fewer license plates from Canada are showing up in northern Montana as the Canadian dollar continues to weaken and make shopping trips to the U.S. more expensive.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/6/drop-in-canadian-dollar-affects-montana-retail/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Fewer license plates from Canada are showing up in northern Montana as the Canadian dollar continues to weaken and make shopping trips to the U.S. more expensive.", "title": "Drop in Canadian dollar affects Montana retail"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Fewer license plates from Canada are showing up in northern Montana as the Canadian dollar continues to weaken and make shopping trips to the U.S. more expensive.", "card": "summary", "title": "Drop in Canadian dollar affects Montana retail"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "As of Aug. 31, the U.S. dollar was worth $1.32 in Canadian currency, the strongest the U.S. dollar has been in at least five years.\nThe Canadian dollar is tied to the commodity market, unlike the U.S. greenback.\n(AP) - Fewer license plates from Canada are showing up in northern Montana as the Canadian dollar continues to weaken and make shopping trips to the U.S. more expensive.\nAnd as oil prices continue to fall, speculators go back to the \u201csafe haven\u201d of the greenback, she said.\nSo when oil prices began falling this summer, dipping below $40 a barrel for the first time since 2009, the Loonie followed suit."}
