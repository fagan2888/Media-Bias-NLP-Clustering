He was employed several years with Conalco in Columbia. He was a loving husband, a proud father and grandfather. His love of fishing was infectious and he shared it with all he loved.

A car enthusiast, he proudly restored a 1968 Chevelle and enjoyed sharing it with others at classic car shows.

Pleasant; brother, David (June) Beard of Columbia; grandchildren, Tanner Ellis, Taylor Ellis, and Tatum Ellis; and nieces, Toni Malcolm, Leah Bigger, and Lori Stinnett.
