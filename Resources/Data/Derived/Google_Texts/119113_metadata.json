In 2011, it paid 798,411 Medicaid claims worth $425.4 million even though they were missing legally required National Provider Identification (NPI) numbers.\n\nServices provided under the Home & Community Based Services Waiver generated 767,936 claims without NPIs. There were another 4,715 claims with invalid NPIs.\n\nNPI numbers, issued by the federal government, uniquely identify physicians, health plans, suppliers and other organizations that provide health care, and all organizations and individuals covered by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The audit notes that by paying claims without valid NPIs, the state may pay people who have been banned from the Medicaid program and limit \u201cthe success of reviews and fraud investigations.\u201d\n\nThe Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing (HCPF) told the auditors that many of the claims with missing NPIs were associated with \u201catypical\u201d providers, those who were not required to get NPIs. The audit states that the State was \u201cunable to specifically identify\u201d atypical claims. Though the state cited claims associated with transportation as an example of atypical claims, the audit notes that claims for emergency transportation generally would include ambulance companies required to have NPIs.\n\nIn FY 2007, taxpayers provided the Colorado Medicaid program $2.1 million in mostly Federal funds to upgrade the Colorado Medicaid Management Information System to accept NPIs. At the time, the state did not include controls to check that the NPIs were valid. In 2010, the federal Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) required that the state include internal controls to check that NPIs submitted are valid.\n\nHCPF\u2019s response claims that the audit finding relates \u201conly to a technical issue and that the audit does not provide any finding that services were rendered improperly or that payments were made in error.\u201d It wrote that it plans to introduce a new Medicaid Management Information System in 2016 that will comply with the state and federal regulations that were passed in March 2010.\n\nAs HCPF undoubtedly knows, desk audits of internal accounting controls are not designed to detect fraud or \u201cimproper payments.\u201d Malcom Sparrow, a Harvard expert on health care fraud, has testified that state and federal programs that emphasize fast claims payments by automated systems need fraud detection programs that include visiting suppliers and making actual contact with those listed as patients. Otherwise, taxpayers are paying for a system in which \u201cIf you want to steal from Medicare or Medicaid,\u201d all you have to do is \u201clearn to bill your lies correctly.\u201d\n\nFor example, in South Florida in 2007, unannounced visits to 1,581 durable medical equipment suppliers found that 31 percent either did not maintain a physical facility or were not open.\n\nIn 2014, investigators in Washington, DC discovered that the Maryland and District of Columbia Medicaid programs paid the owner of three home care agencies $75 million even though she had been banned from federal health care programs after her nursing license was revoked. One DC home care scam encouraged Medicaid beneficiaries to qualify for Medicaid home care by faking or exaggerating their symptoms and then paid them $200 every two weeks to sign false timesheets used to bill for phantom care.\n\nIn Florida, a $63 million fraud scheme fabricated records for the treatment of severe mental illness from 2004 through 2011. \u201cPatients\u201d at the facilities watched Disney movies, played bingo, and attended barbeques.\u201d\n\nColorado Medicaid has had at least one case of fraud in which it paid $3.8 million to people who continued billing the program after an owner was put on the federal banned list in 2001.\n\nColorado is inviting Medicaid fraud by paying claims without provider identifier numbers. But never fear, the state hopes to start complying with rules passed in 2010 meant to prevent such fraud sometime next year.\n\nLinda Gorman is health care policy center director at the Independence Institute, a free market think tank in Denver.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Colorado is inviting Medicaid fraud by paying claims without provider identifier numbers.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.4.6", "og": {"site_name": "Complete Colorado - Page Two", "description": "Colorado is inviting Medicaid fraud by paying claims without provider identifier numbers.", "title": "Colorado invites Medicaid fraud: Pays hundreds of millions in claims without provider ID numbers", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 849, "identifier": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/subsidy.jpg", "height": 565}, "url": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/2015/05/18/colorado-invites-medicaid-fraud-pays-hundreds-of-millions-in-claims-without-provider-id-numbers/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 221004171379840}, "keywords": "Colorado Department of Health Care Policy and Financing,medicaid fraud,obamacare,", "article": {"section": "Blog note", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-05-18T20:56:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-19T00:01:03+00:00", "author": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/author/admin/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff80\"", "article_summary": "In 2011, it paid 798,411 Medicaid claims worth $425.4 million even though they were missing legally required National Provider Identification (NPI) numbers.\nColorado is inviting Medicaid fraud by paying claims without provider identifier numbers.\nThe federal Health and Human Services Inspector General\u2019s Office recently issued a report finding fault with Colorado Medicaid\u2019s internal accounting controls.\nLinda Gorman is health care policy center director at the Independence Institute, a free market think tank in Denver.\nIn Florida, a $63 million fraud scheme fabricated records for the treatment of severe mental illness from 2004 through 2011."}
