That\u2019s because, thanks to new legislation, guns are now permitted in all 10 of the state-run psychiatric hospitals in Texas.\n\nWhile guns are still banned in state-licensed general and specialty hospitals, that doesn\u2019t include these 10 hospitals because they aren\u2019t officially licensed by the state.\n\nThere are disagreements among officials as to whether new laws simply clarify the rules of previous legislation or establish new parameters. However, the open-carry law enacted at the start of the year, combined with another law that fines state agencies for displaying \u201cno guns\u201d signs, make it clear that state-runs psychiatric hospitals are now legally gun-friendly.\n\nThe hospitals are still discouraging visitors from bringing guns onto the premises, though. Austin State Hospital now has signs up asking visitors to leave guns in their cars or at least voluntarily conceal them.\n\nDemocratic state representative Celia Israel called this an \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of the open-carry legislation, which she opposed from the beginning.\n\nTerry Holcomb, founder and executive of Texas Carry, also considers this an oversight. \u201cNobody would have asked for that,\u201d he said, as reported by the American Statesman. \u201cIt\u2019s not something we ever would have considered. Ever.\u201d\n\nHowever, Republican state rep. Matt Rinaldi doesn\u2019t see this as a problem with legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of the operators of the facilities to ensure that the patients are not around dangerous weapons,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocratic state senator Kirk Watson proposed an amendment to the bill last year that would have added the 10 state-run psychiatric facilities to the exempt list, but the proposal quickly died when Republican senator Craig Estes said that more time was needed to study the issue.\n\n\u201cIt is my goal to neither increase nor decrease anyplace a gun can be carried, so respectfully I move to table,\u201d Estes said.\n\nOpponents of open carry say that state legislators were wary to grant the exemption out of fear of \u201cderailing the open carry bill by slowing it down with amendments.\u201d\n\nTexas is already one of the most gun-friendly states in the nation \u2014 the New York Times called the state \u201cso gun-friendly that it is easier to get into the Capitol in Austin with a firearm than without one.\u201d Another new law kicks in this year to force public universities to allow licensed gun owners to carry their guns on campus.\n\nMental health experts stress that despite the law, it\u2019s important to keep guns away from these hospitals, which house those suffering from severe mental illnesses.\n\n\u201cWhile licensed visitors are legally permitted to carry on our hospital campuses, our patients are being actively treated for psychiatric conditions, and generally it\u2019s best not to expose them to weapons of any kind,\u201d said Carrie Williams, spokeswoman for the Department of State Health Services.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A bevy of new gun laws kicked in January 1.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A bevy of new gun laws kicked in January 1.", "title": "The Unintended Consequences Of Texas\u2019 New Pro-Gun Laws", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2016/01/09/3737766/texas-open-carry-psychiatric-hopitals/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/09105607/shutterstock_25952284-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A bevy of new gun laws kicked in January 1.", "creator": "@linzsports", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/09105607/shutterstock_25952284-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Unintended Consequences Of Texas\u2019 New Pro-Gun Laws", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/09105607/shutterstock_25952284-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/09105607/shutterstock_25952284-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T11:18:35+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/LindsayJeanGibbs"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Justice The Unintended Consequences Of Texas\u2019 New Pro-Gun Laws CREDIT: ShuttershockThis week, Austin State Hospital, a psychiatric facility in Texas, pulled down the \u201cno guns\u201d signs that had long been posted throughout the building.\nThat\u2019s because, thanks to new legislation, guns are now permitted in all 10 of the state-run psychiatric hospitals in Texas.\nTerry Holcomb, founder and executive of Texas Carry, also considers this an oversight.\nDemocratic state representative Celia Israel called this an \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of the open-carry legislation, which she opposed from the beginning.\nThere are disagreements among officials as to whether new laws simply clarify the rules of previous legislation or establish new parameters."}
