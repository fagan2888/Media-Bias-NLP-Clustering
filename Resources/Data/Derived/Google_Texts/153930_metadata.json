If I had any concerns, I wouldn't have joined it.\"\n\nIn 2012, the firm paid $13.5 million to the Petters bankruptcy estate to settle a lawsuit filed by the bankruptcy trustee to recover attorney's fees paid by Petters and his companies. The firm admitted no wrongdoing.\n\nDixon said he chose Fredrikson for his practice in part because of its nearly 20-year history in white-collar defense work and its growth potential with offices in North Dakota, Iowa, Mexico and China.\n\n\"This is a firm that knows who they are and where they are going,\" he said.\n\nDixon's co-chair in the white-collar group is Dulce Foster, another veteran.\n\nFredrikson President John Koneck said the firm believed Dixon's \"unique blend of public prosecutorial and private legal and business experience\" would enhance its group of trial lawyers.\n\nDixon is the latest on a list of former federal prosecutors in Minnesota who took their Department of Justice experience into private practice.\n\nCurrent U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger has spent some of his career as a defense attorney. So have former U.S. Attorney B. Todd Jones and assistant prosecutors Jon Hopeman, Doug Kelley, Earl Gray and Dan Scott.\n\nBut Hank Shea, a former assistant U.S. attorney who now teaches at the University of St. Thomas School of Law School, said Dixon's route to the defense table is different because of his stop at UnitedHealth, where he was responsible for internal investigations into matters such as the False Claims Act and Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He also responded to congressional inquiries for the company and worked on implementation of elements of the Affordable Health Care Act.\n\n\"He was trying to get ahead of issues and problems before they became more serious,\" Shea said. \"Joe, at his heart, wants to make the community better. By going to Fredrikson, he has a greater opportunity to do that.\"\n\nDixon's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as a criminal prosecutor includes supervision of the conviction of automobile mogul Denny Hecker; the sentencing of hedge fund manager Trevor Cook, who went to prison for 25 years for the $165 million fraud he engineered; and the prosecution of former state legislator Loren Jennings for abuse of his office.\n\nBut to those in criminal legal circles, Dixon is perhaps best known for the Petters case and his surgical cross-examination of the former Wayzata businessman who was convicted on fraud charges in 2009 and sentenced to 50 years in prison.\n\n\"In the case of Mr. Petters, who was a tremendous salesman, it was the first opportunity to ask him tough questions,\" Dixon said. \"It was a series of difficult moments where Mr. Petters was forced to reveal his true colors.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The former assistant U.S. attorney is joining the law firm of Fredrikson & Byron.", "title": "Petters prosecutor Joe Dixon moves to Fredrikson law firm", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/petters-prosecutor-joe-dixon-moves-to-fredrikson-law-firm/302860761/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143096564664260.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143096564664260.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The former assistant U.S. attorney is joining the law firm of Fredrikson & Byron.", "title": "Petters prosecutor Joe Dixon moves to Fredrikson law firm", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/petters-prosecutor-joe-dixon-moves-to-fredrikson-law-firm/302860761/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143096564664260.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_143096564664260.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The former assistant U.S. attorney is joining the law firm of Fredrikson & Byron."}, "article_summary": "\"It's no secret that I prosecuted Mr. Petters, and it's no secret that Fredrikson represented Mr. Petters prior to his criminal allegations \u2026 but I have no concerns about Fredrikson,\" Dixon said.\nJoe Dixon III is joining the Minneapolis law firm of Fredrikson & Byron and will co-chair its white-collar practice.\n\"It was a series of difficult moments where Mr. Petters was forced to reveal his true colors.\"\n\"In the case of Mr. Petters, who was a tremendous salesman, it was the first opportunity to ask him tough questions,\" Dixon said.\nCurrent U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger has spent some of his career as a defense attorney."}
