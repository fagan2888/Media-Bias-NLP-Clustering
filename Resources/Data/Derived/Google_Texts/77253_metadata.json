The Russian Defense Ministry said the boat came within 1,600 feet of the Smetlivy destroyer, one of the ships bolstering the Kremlin\u2019s military foray into Syria meant to prop up the regime of dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s War of Words with Turkey Escalates to Nukes and Ethnic Cleansing\n\nMoscow summoned a Turkish military attach\u00e9 over the incident, telling the official of \u201cpotentially disastrous consequences from Ankara\u2019s reckless actions toward Russia\u2019s military continent fighting against international terrorism in Syria,\u201d the Defense Ministry said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are not in favor of tension,\" Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was quoted as saying in response. \"We have always been in favor of overcoming tensions through dialogue rather than conflict.\u201d\n\nThe confrontation on the waves is the latest evidence that tensions between Ankara and Moscow remain high almost a month after the Turkish air force shot down a Russian fighter jet.
