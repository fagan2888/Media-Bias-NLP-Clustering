The House unanimously passed a bill that included a five-year ban on bonuses for senior Veterans Affairs executives in retaliation for what lawmakers say were serious management and medical errors at VA facilities across the country that are treating a flood of returning injured troops. The Senate reportedly is considering less severe restrictions on performance pay.\n\nRelated: IRS Employees Getting $70 M in Bonuses\n\nTop members of the congressional committees with VA oversight are growing increasingly frustrated with the agency because of a rash of incidents ranging from a patient\u2019s death after an altercation with a nursing assistant in Louisiana to a deadly outbreak of Legionnaire\u2019s disease in Pennsylvania to huge backlogs in processing veterans\u2019 claims, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHouse Veterans Affairs Committee members have been sparring with VA Secretary Eric Shinseki over these issues and complaining about a lack of timely response to their questions. Now some of these frustrated lawmakers have decided to hit VA officials where it hurts most \u2013 in their wallets. \u201cVA needs to more directly and explicitly measure each leader\u2019s contributions,\u201d Rep. Mike Michaud of Maine, the top Democrat on the House VA committee, told the Journal. \u201cIf they do not, they will never be able to truly hold themselves accountable to veterans, or the American taxpayer.\u201d\n\nRelated: VA Bureaucrats Nab Bonuses As Veterans\u2019 Benefits Lag\n\nAnother recent scandal at the Environmental Protection Agency has heightened congressional and public attention on the government\u2019s bonus system. A former veteran EPA official pled guilty to scamming the agency out of $900,000 \u2013 including about $500,000 in bonuses \u2013 that he did not deserve. The former official, John C. Beale, collected his salary and bonuses for over a decade while only rarely showing up for work by convincing his superiors that he was working surreptitiously for the CIA or that he had contracted malaria.\n\nScott Monroe, director of human resources in the EPA\u2019s Office of Air and Radiation, who approved Beale\u2019s time cards, informed a superior in a Jan. 12, 2011 note, \u201cJohn Beale has been receiving a retention bonus of 25 percent every year since 1991,\u201d even while EPA policy requires that the agency recertify the bonus annually and reestablish the bonus every three years, The Washington Post reported last week. Monroe wrote, \u201cEPA has no records to show that these re-certifications occurred except for one in 2000.\u201d\n\nRelated: How John Beale Swindled the EPA Out of $1 Million\n\nUnderstandably, retention bonuses and other incentives are crucial tools in the federal government\u2019s efforts to compete with the private sector for talented workers. But many on Capitol Hill have begun to question the standards being used to award these contracts and whether departments and agencies are being rigorous enough in granting generous bonuses.\n\nUnder Office of Personnel Management rules, agencies may pay a retention incentive of 10 percent to 25 percent of an employee\u2019s base salary in order to keep him from transferring to another agency or leaving government \u2013 provided the employees have an evaluation of at least \u201cFully Successful.\u201d\n\nA retention incentive may be paid to an eligible individual in a General Schedule (GS), senior-level (SL), scientific or professional (ST), Senior Executive Service (SES), the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration senior executive service and other agencies.\n\nRecent data on the incentive program is hard to come by. Federal agencies paid out more than $349 million in recruitment, relocation and retention bonuses in 2009, the most recent information provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel management. That was a 22 percent increase from the previous year.\n\nOverall, 45 agencies made more than 43,000 of these payments, or an average of $8,079, according to OPM. The government\u2019s two largest departments, Defense and Veterans Affairs, made the most incentive payments. The Pentagon provided 21,910 payments, while the VA handed out 8,885 in 2009.\n\nThe State Department, which employs diplomats and other highly skilled personnel often working in dangerous locations, paid out the highest average incentive payments, totaling $12,586.\n\nLast fall, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) questioned whether many of the federal government's Senior Executive Service members deserved the bonus payments they were receiving. McCaskill, who chairs a Senate subcommittee on financial and contracting oversight, wrote to the head of the Government Accountability Office, asking the watchdog agency to investigate whether bonuses paid to SES employees involved in contract management are effective tools in reducing costs or improving contract performance.\n\n\"There is ample evidence to suggest that performance bonuses have been issued by government departments and agencies to SES employees as a routine matter of course with little regard to actual performance,\" McCaskill wrote.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The House last week lashed out at the federal employee bonus system in a way that may foreshadow more aggressive scrutiny of the government\u2019s long-standing bonus system for recruiting, retaining and relocating prized employees.
