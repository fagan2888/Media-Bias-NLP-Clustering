Green\u2019s catch as the clocked ran out in the fourth quarter. \u201cBut you don\u2019t get disheartened. You still have a chance to win the game, still.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: FENNO: On Veterans Day, remembering an NFL player who sacrificed everything\n\nAnd so they did, after blowing a 17-0 halftime lead.\n\nBidding to end a three-game skid and remain relevant in the playoff hunt, the Ravens committed three turnovers and managed only 189 yards of offense.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not playing great right now,\u201d Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco conceded, \u201cbut we\u2019re doing the best we can to win.\u201d\n\nThe tense win thrust the Ravens (4-5) into a second-place tie in the AFC North, just one game behind Cincinnati (6-4) in the loss column. It was Baltimore\u2019s first victory since Oct. 6.\n\nFour of the Ravens\u2018 five losses have come by a combined 14 points. It seemed like this one was headed in that direction after Andy Dalton forced overtime with that heave to Green to end the fourth quarter.\n\n\u201cI looked back and saw Green with the ball in his hands and I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Ravens cornerback Corey Graham said.\n\nBut Baltimore persevered.\n\n\u201cThe thing is I\u2019m most proud of is the heart of our guys,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cThey showed the heart of champions. Where this will lead us, we\u2019ll find out.\u201d\n\nWho knows if the Ravens can rebound from their poor start to make the postseason for a sixth straight year? This much is certain: It would have been much tougher if they were 3-6 and tied for last place with Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cThank you, Lord!\u201d shouted James Ihedigbo shouted as he left the field.\n\nFlacco threw two interceptions and lost a fumble, and Ray Rice gained a mere 30 yards on 18 carries. And still, the Ravens prevailed.\n\n\u201cSometimes you have to win by any means necessary,\u201d Rice said. \u201cWinning heals a lot. Now we\u2019ve got to get on a roll to get back where we want to be.\u201d\n\nDespite their comeback, the Bengals lost their second straight overtime game. Dalton went 24 for 51 for 274 yards and three interceptions and was sacked five times as the Bengals lost to Baltimore for the fifth time in six games.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s their turn to lament a run of narrow defeats.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do whatever we can to make one more play, put ourselves in a better position where we can score and have a chance to not let the other team have it,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cAgain, it didn\u2019t happen today.\u201d\n\nAlmost, but not quite. On the last-second throw in regulation, Green positioned himself behind the pack and caught the deflection after it flicked off the hand of Ihedigbo, who earlier had the first two interceptions of his career.\n\n\u201cI was just looking for someone to tap the ball so I could catch it,\u201d Green said.\n\nThe Bengals won the toss before overtime and moved to the Baltimore 33 before Giovani Bernard caught a short pass, reversed field and was tackled for an 11-yard loss on fourth down.\n\nBaltimore then got a pair of first downs before Tucker kicked the winner.\n\nWith 151 yards receiving, Green set a franchise record with his fifth straight 100-yard game. And, making his second start of the season, Cincinnati linebacker Vincent Rey had 13 tackles, three sacks and his first career interception.\n\nBut it all went for naught.\n\nA gusty afternoon proved troublesome for the Bengals. Mike Nugent missed a 42-yard field goal into the wind and Dalton repeatedly overthrew his receivers. In the second quarter, Ihedigbo picked off a high pass and returned it 37 yards to set up a touchdown for a 17-0 lead.\n\nBaltimore mustered only 94 yards in offense before halftime, but took advantage of Bengals miscues to put together scoring drives of 53, 58 and 11 yards.\n\nCincinnati had more penalty yards than total offense (114-102) in the first half, and Dalton was 8 for 21 for 47 yards and an interception.\n\nThe Bengals\u2019 opening possession ended with a failed fourth-and-1 gamble at the Baltimore 47. Flacco immediately went long. Although he underthrew Jacoby Jones, a pass interference call against Reggie Nelson covered 48 yards. On third down, Dallas Clark caught a 1-yard pass in the end zone \u2014 the Ravens\u2018 only first-quarter touchdown since the season opener.\n\nBaltimore quickly got the ball back, and a facemask penalty against Cincinnati\u2019s Chris Crocker contributed to a 58-yard drive that ended with a field goal to make it 10-0.\n\nThings didn\u2019t get better for the Bengals. Nugent shanked a field-goal try to the left, and Ihedigbo\u2019s first interception set up a 7-yard touchdown pass to Torrey Smith.\n\nNotes: Not only did Ihedigbo get two INTs, but he tied with Daryl Smith for the team lead with nine tackles. \u2026 Dalton\u2019s run of four straight 300-yard games ended. \u2026 Baltimore is 9-1 in November home games, beginning in 2008.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They committed three turnovers, blew a 17-point lead and gave up a long touchdown pass on the final play of regulation.
