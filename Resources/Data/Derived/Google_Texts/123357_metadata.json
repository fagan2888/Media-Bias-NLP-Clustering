The investigation appears to be focused on the representations that Cover Oregon made about the status and functionality of its website to officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that parceled out the money to states to build exchanges under President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nFederal officials are seeking all reports, memos and email between Cover Oregon and CMS about the status of the website, as well as communications \u201cin any form\u201d from the state exchange to federal officials that related to funding requests from the state. Investigators also requested internal memos, texts and email sent between the officials overseeing the exchange and those working on the flawed website.\n\nCover Oregon and the Oregon Health Authority, which both received the subpoenas and were asked to testify before a grand jury on June 10, issued a joint statement: \u201cThe agencies take this request seriously and will cooperate fully with federal officials. We will work collaboratively with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office to provide any and all information we have and make any and all staff available to assist.\u201d\n\nThe Oregonian news organization reported that the state\u2019s principal legislative analyst overseeing information technology, Bob Cummings, wrote to Cover Oregon in 2012 outlining his concerns that the health insurance exchange was sending \u201coverly positive reports\u201d to federal officials that were not consistent with the progress of the project. The U.S. attorney's office specifically requested correspondence between Cummings and Cover Oregon officials, as well as email and texts between nine other officials involved in the project. Cummings did not immediately return a call for comment.\n\nWillamette University law professor David A. Friedman, who has been closely following the problems with Oregon\u2019s exchange, cautioned that it was impossible to determine the focus of the investigation at this early stage and noted that grand juries often do not return an indictment.\n\nThe subpoena \u201cis so broad that it is hard to tell if they\u2019re looking for anything specific,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThey may walk away from this, like a lot of grand juries do, and say we\u2019ve done an investigation and there\u2019s nothing here.... What they want to look at is \u2013 did anyone involved with this make any misrepresentations that would lead to a gain, either a corporate, a private or a personal gain?\u201d\n\n[The subpoena] is so broad that ... they may walk away from this, like a lot of grand juries do, and say we've done an investigation and there's nothing here. \u2014 David A. Friedman, Willamette University law professor\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the District of Oregon, which is led by U.S. Atty. S. Amanda Marshall, declined to comment on the investigation.\n\nCover Oregon\u2019s board of directors voted unanimously in late April to jettison the troubled online system that had been built by its primary technology vendor, Oracle. The board determined that the system, which was intended to enroll consumers in private insurance plans, was too faulty and would be too expensive to fix. When the next open enrollment period for Obamacare begins in November, the state will use the federal healthcare exchange, HealthCare.gov, to enroll consumers in private plans. A spokeswoman with Oracle declined comment on the subpoenas.\n\nWith its website inoperable for consumers, Oregon had to rely on paper applications to enroll more than 70,000 customers in private plans. It is one of three states that have abandoned their initial attempts to build a unique system for their state residents. Maryland, which spent $125.5 million building and operating its troubled website, opted to overhaul its system by adopting the successful technology platform developed by Connecticut at a cost of between $40 and $50 million.\n\nMassachusetts decided in early May to scrap the system that had been built by its original contractor, CGI, and develop a new exchange with different contractors at a cost of $121 million. If the new system is not ready by this fall, the state will temporarily enroll consumers through the federal marketplace. (The state had paid CGI about $17 million to build the system that has been largely abandoned.)\n\nThe missteps in Oregon are also being investigated by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, and the fiasco is already a major issue in Oregon\u2019s gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races this year.\n\nOregon Gov. John Kitzhaber, who has been accused of \u201cgubernatorial malpractice\u201d by his Republican opponent, state Rep. Dennis Richardson, ordered an independent review of what went wrong that was released this spring. In a letter to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office this week, Kitzhaber\u2019s general counsel, Liani Reeves, said the governor was supportive of the investigation and \u201ccommitted to a thorough review of Cover Oregon to ensure the appropriate accountability and oversight for the public investment\u201d made in the website.\n\nKitzhaber has also asked the Government Accountability Office to provide a \u201cthorough appraisal of the quality of work done by our technical vendors.\u201d The GAO plans to look at what went wrong in Oregon as well as at other state exchange websites.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "U.S. prosecutors investigate Oregon's failed health insurance exchange", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "The U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Portland has issued subpoenas to Oregon\u2019s health insurance exchange as part of a grand jury investigation into the spectacular failure of the state\u2019s system, which was never able to enroll consumers online even though it spent more than $248 million in taxpayer money on the operation.", "title": "U.S. prosecutors investigate Oregon's failed health insurance exchange", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-us-attorneys-office-probes-oregons-health-insurance-exchange-20140521-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-537d1829/turbine/la-na-us-attorneys-office-probes-oregons-health-insurance-exchange-20140521", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Oregon, Cover Oregon, Oregon Health Authority, Gov.
