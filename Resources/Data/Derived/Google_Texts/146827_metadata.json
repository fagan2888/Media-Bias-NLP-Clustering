That is to say, he failed to drive a message, as the political pros say. So the piece itself is a metaphor for the stalled state of his presidency.\n\nIf Obama was going to invest that much time with Remnick, you\u2019d think he would want a headline about rebooting for the rest of his second term, or displaying new passion on this or that issue, or sticking it to the opposition, or somehow advancing his agenda. Instead, we get a lot of meandering.\n\nRemnick was on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d yesterday, talking about the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d view of Obama. And yet the president never effectively rebutted this indictment, which the editor presents as conventional wisdom:\n\n\u201cHe is said to be a reluctant politician: aloof, insular, diffident, arrogant, inert, unwilling to jolly his allies along the fairway and take a 9-iron to his enemies. He doesn\u2019t know anyone in Congress. No one in the House or in the Senate, no one in foreign capitals fears him. He gives a great speech, but he doesn\u2019t understand power. He is a poor executive. Doesn\u2019t it seem as if he hates the job? And so on. This is the knowing talk on Wall Street, on K Street, on Capitol Hill, in green rooms \u2014 the \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 consensus.\u201d\n\nIn fact, asked what he wants to accomplish in the next three years \u2014 a hanging curve ball of a question \u2014 Obama whiffs:\n\n\u201cI will measure myself at the end of my presidency in large part by whether I began the process of rebuilding the middle class and the ladders into the middle class, and reversing the trend toward economic bifurcation in this society.\u201d Laudable goals, but to \u201cbegin the process of rebuilding\u201d isn\u2019t exactly a rallying cry, nor concrete enough to be measured.\n\nEven Remnick, many thousands of words in, refers to him as the \u201cProfessor-in-Chief.\u201d\n\nEven though Remnick\u2019s goal is to probe Obama the person, it\u2019s hard to understand why, given the vast acreage, he didn\u2019t press more on ObamaCare, given how central that law and its botched rollout is to the legacy that the president discusses.\n\nOne Obama comment that\u2019s gotten some attention has to do with race. But it\u2019s been selectively quoted by some, while the full observation is rather unremarkable. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s some folks who just really dislike me because they don\u2019t like the idea of a black president,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNow, the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because I\u2019m a black president.\u201d That, as Remnick pointed out, is hardly playing the race card. Obama also invokes Martin Luther King and Malcolm X in defending his insistence on speaking out about personal responsibility in the African-American community. The New Yorker piece has also generated headlines about Obama seeming soft on marijuana \u2014 but here too, he straddles the issue. \u201cAs has been well documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life. I don\u2019t think it is more dangerous than alcohol.\u201d The president goes on to say that minorities disproportionately wind up in jail on pot charges.\n\nObama pushes back against the notion that he has failed to impose his will on Congress because he is so hands-off, and the story notes that John Boehner, Mitch McConnell and other GOP leaders declined his invitation to a White House screening of \u201cLincoln.\u201d Obama invokes the \u201cGodfather\u201d in saying, \u201cIt turns out Marlon Brando had it easy, because, when it comes to Congress, there is no such thing as an offer they can\u2019t refuse.\u201d\n\nWhat about his dealings with the media? Inspired about \u201cjournalism telling truth to power\u201d by the movie \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d Obama nonetheless says that \u201ca lot of the tensions that have existed between my White House and the press are inherent in the institution. The press always wants more, and every White House, including ours, is trying to make sure that the things that we care most about are what\u2019s being reported on, and that we\u2019re not on any given day chasing after 15 story lines.\u201d\n\nTo me the real news in the piece is Obama\u2019s embrace of Clintonism, which he once derided as small ball that paled alongside Ronald Reagan\u2019s sweeping vision. Now 44 invokes 42, saying:\n\n\u201cThere were times in our history where Democrats didn\u2019t seem to be paying enough attention to the concerns of middle-class folks or working-class folks, black or white,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this was one of the great gifts of Bill Clinton to the Party \u2014 to say, you know what, it\u2019s entirely legitimate for folks to be concerned about getting mugged, and you can\u2019t just talk about police abuse. How about folks not feeling safe outside their homes? It\u2019s all fine and good for you to want to do something about poverty, but if the only mechanism you have is raising taxes on folks who are already feeling strapped, then maybe you need to widen your lens a little bit.\u201d\n\nAnd, Obama adds, \u201cprogressives sometimes get frustrated with me\u201d over his view that the welfare state had gotten \u201cbloated.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s striking here is that the right views the president as a relentless liberal, the man who pushed through ObamaCare, raised taxes on the wealthy and supports gay marriage (while some on the left see him as perpetuating George W. Bush\u2019s surveillance state). He is, at the very least, a man who loves to give speeches and talk to the likes of the New Yorker. But when given the platform, the president described himself as \u201ca relay swimmer in a river full of rapids\u201d\u2014more buffeted by history than changing it.\n\nYahoo scores Christie interview\n\nYahoo News gets on the board with Chris Christie\u2019s first interview since the bridge scandal erupted.\n\nChristie tells former New York Times Magazine writer Matt Bai that the media explosion has been \u201ccompletely disorienting, like I got hit across the forehead with a two-by-four.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the interesting part, the New Jersey governor telling Yahoo he\u2019s not an angry guy: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t get angry \u2013 everybody gets angry. But they confuse sometimes, if you\u2019re blunt and you\u2019re direct and you just say things the way you see them, that that\u2019s anger. More times than not, it\u2019s not anger with me. It\u2019s just my personality.\u201d And there\u2019s this: \u201cPart of politics is trying to have sharp elbows publicly in order to make a deal privately.\u201d\n\nTough guy image or not, Christie acknowledged the last two weeks has been a searing experience: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody knows what it feels like to have the kind of attention that I\u2019ve had in the last nine days until you go through it. It\u2019s awful. Listen, it\u2019s awful. I can explain to you as vividly as you like, but you won\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nSeahawk\u2019s tirade sparks racism\n\nI was stunned after the Seahawks beat the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman launched into an angry on-air diatribe.\n\nOn the sidelines with Fox Sports\u2019 Erin Andrews, Sherman ranted in front of the camera, even though his team was going to the Super Bowl on the strength of his end-zone deflection of a pass to San Francisco\u2019s Michael Crabtree that wound up in the hands of a Seattle teammate. Even though the two men had been trash-talking, and Crabtree had shoved him after the play, Sherman he came off as rude and a sore winner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the best corner in the game,\u201d Sherman shouted. \u201cWhen you try me with a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that\u2019s the result you gonna get. Don\u2019t you ever talk about me\u2026Don\u2019t you open your mouth about the best or I\u2019m gonna shut it for you real quick.\u201d\n\nBut what happened next was ugly, lots of tweeters throwing the N-word at him and making other racist remarks. Sherman responds on a Sports Illustrated blog:\n\n\u201cTo those who would call me a thug or worse because I show passion on a football field\u2014don\u2019t judge a person\u2019s character by what they do between the lines. Judge a man by what he does off the field, what he does for his community, what he does for his family.\n\n\u201cBut people find it easy to take shots on Twitter, and to use racial slurs and bullying language far worse than what you\u2019ll see from me. It\u2019s sad and somewhat unbelievable to me that the world is still this way, but it is. I can handle it.\u201d\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET). He is the author of five books and is based in Washington.
