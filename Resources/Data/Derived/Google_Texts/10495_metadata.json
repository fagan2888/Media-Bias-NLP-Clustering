He and his wife, Lynne, have retired to a farm in Northeast Mississippi.\n\nThe \u201cWar on Women\u201d is the latest Democrat slogan for winning elections. While it is designed to warn you of Republican attacks on the rights of women, it is, in fact, just another political lie.\n\nPolitical slogans are a lazy person\u2019s substitute for rigorous thought. They are tested in focus groups and polls and are conceived to deceive. When you hear politicians trying to convey an entire story in a few words it is a good idea to listen carefully for what is not being said.\n\nIt used to be \u201cfamily values.\u201d That was a stalking horse for universal health care, gay adoption policies, parental leave and a \u201cliving wage.\u201d\n\n\u201cGun safety\u201d is an old perennial generally avoided on the campaign trail but trotted out at every tragedy. It has nothing to do with handling a gun safely, or even keeping them under lock and key. It\u2019s about taking them away.\n\n\u201cGlobal Warming\u201d survived several Congresses until it became obvious that the globe was not warming so it became \u201cClimate Change.\u201d It is now \u201cGlobal Weirding\u201d blaming every blizzard or heat wave on human activity. Whatever the final clich\u00e9, the goal remains the same \u2013 reducing our standard of living and redistributing wealth from rich nations to poor nations.\n\n\u201cWorking families\u201d is a staple to define the interests of the Democrat base \u2013 namely unions. They spend most of their time and your money on non-working families, but that doesn\u2019t work as a campaign slogan. The main planks in this platform are increasing unemployment benefits and the minimum wage.\n\nThis brings us back to the deceit of the moment, the \u201cWar on Women.\u201d Let\u2019s explore this war and how it started.\n\nThe first shot was fired during an \u201cABC\u201d debate during the 2012 primary when George Stephanopoulos pressed the Republican candidates on whether they supported outlawing birth control. his stunned every Republican on the stage since at no time in their careers had any of them ever proposed such a law, but Stephanopoulos wouldn\u2019t let it go.\n\nSix weeks later the deceit became clearer at a faux hearing staged by he Democrats in the House of Representatives. The sole witness was Sandra Fluke, a Georgetown University student, who demanded that birth control not only be legal, but free. By implication, Republicans threatened that right.\n\nI\u2019ve never understood why any political party would start a war on more than half of the population, but the Democrats seem to think that American women are not very bright. \u201cReproductive Rights\u201d is the primary front in this war and Democrats insist that only they can protect those rights.\n\nCall me old-fashioned, but I was under the impression that reproductive rights were a gift from God who needs no help from politicians.\n\nWhat Democrats really mean by reproductive rights is not the right to have children, but the right to not have children. This argument insults women by implying that all they are interested in is reproduction.\n\nA state senator in Texas is now famous for staging an 11-hour filibuster against a \u201cfetal pain\u201d law. The bill she so dramatically opposed passed three days later with little fanfare, but she caught her train on the fast track to be the Democrat nominee for governor with a trunk of cash from the national abortion lobby. It is telling that her website does not mention abortion. Apparently you can make a name on the issue, but not a campaign.\n\nThe Gosnell murder trial in Philadelphia, which found the abortionist guilty of murder, exposed the filth in his clinic and the fact that abortion clinics are not inspected like other medical facilities. Planned Parenthood actively opposes inspections of abortion facilities and they do so, incredibly, under the guise of protecting women\u2019s \u201creproductive health.\u201d\n\nMost women can see through all of this. They have interests other than reproduction and are perfectly capable of defending their own rights. I expect that, hearing the bogus \u201cWar on Women\u201d battle cry, they will be able to distinguish between cynicism and concern.\n\nJohn Linder can be contacted at: linderje@yahoo.com or on Twitter @linderje.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
