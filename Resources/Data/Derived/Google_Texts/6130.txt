"Community Health of the past would usually have been able to control costs enough to manage through disappointing mix and volume metrics. This time it couldn't. Is the magic gone?" Mizuho Securities USA Inc analysts wrote in a note.

HCA estimated lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings last week, hurt by higher labor costs and less favorable payer mix.

Last quarter, HCA, said benefits from the Affordable Care Act would taper off over the rest of the year.

The signature healthcare law, popularly called Obamacare, covers medical insurance for Americans and has helped in boosting business for various hospitals and insurers as more people avail of insurance. (Reporting By Samantha Kareen Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)
