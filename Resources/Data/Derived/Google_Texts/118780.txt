Months have passed since Jon Stewart’s retirement from Comedy Central’s The Daily Show, and his fans have been left in a state of inexorable despair (even though new host Trevor Noah is coming along well). To the delight of all the Jon Stewart fans out there, including me, the comedian/actor/writer/producer/TV host returned to the satirical news program to sit down with Noah and, just like the old days, he did not pull any punches.

On this past Monday’s episode, Stewart decided to use his time to discuss a topic near and dear to his heart: health care for 9/11 responders. Efficient and affordable care for people who risk their lives in the face of almost certain danger may seem like fair compensation. However, Congress has failed to renew the James Zadroga 9/11 Health & Compensation Act, which provides health benefits for 9/11 responders.

“These first responders, many sick with cancers and pulmonary disease, have had to travel at their own expense to Washington, D.C., to plead for our government to do the right thing,” Stewart told Noah. “Plead!”

Throughout his career Stewart has been an outspoken advocate for the treatment of veterans and 9/11 first responders. Not only has he gone on record to criticize the White House’s proposal to remove veterans from Veterans Administration roles if they have private insurance, but he also took action by breaking a Senate deadlock over a bill that provides 9/11 emergency workers with health care and benefits.

In today’s world, where every politician, actor, or TV personality claims to be a man or woman of the people (as long as those people pledge their support), it’s nice to know some are actually taking action.
