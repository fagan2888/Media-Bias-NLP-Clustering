I guess people with strong political preferences have always had a hard time accepting facts that are at odds with those prejudices; but I do also think that it has gotten worse in modern America thanks to the closed information loop of movement conservatism and the incestuous amplification it brings. You see it in things like the rise of inflation trutherism; you also see it in the inability of many on the right to accept the reality that Obamacare really has covered a lot of previously uninsured Americans.

Anyway, the latest line I’ve been hearing is that the decline in uninsurance isn’t really about the ACA, it’s just the improving economy. Now, the same people who say such things tend to deny that the economy is really improving, too — Obamacare was supposed to be a job killer, so it must be killing jobs. But never mind. What about claims that the improving economy is the real story?

The answer is in two parts. First, the decline in the number of uninsured is too steep, too perfectly timed with the coming of the ACA to make sense in such terms. Uninsurance was rising until late 2013, despite a recovering economy, then suddenly fell off a cliff just as the ACA went into full effect. Not a coincidence.

Second, we are now at a point where a much smaller fraction of Americans are uninsured than we’ve seen in a long time, maybe ever. Even in 2000, with unemployment very low and health costs relatively moderate, Census data show that around 16 percent of Americans aged 18 to 64 were uninsured; meanwhile, the HRMS data, which are consistent with multiple other sources, show uninsurance among that group at about 10 percent, and just 7.5 percent in Medicaid expansion states.

I know this program was supposed to be a dismal failure. But, you know, it isn’t.
