Silvestri Insurance, Inc. storefront, that has served Dyker Heights and South Brooklyn for more than 50 years. He said the insurance premiums is not only putting a bigger dent on the family\u2019s budget, but also consuming resources that would otherwise go to growing their business and paying their employees.\n\n\u201cObamacare is squeezing the middle class. The very wealthy have been able to afford higher insurance premiums and the poor receive generous subsidies, but those in the middle, like the Silvestris, are paying higher premiums for worse coverage they can barely afford. The \u2018Un-Affordable Care Act\u2019 would be more a more apt title,\u201d said Donovan.\n\nNicole Silvestri, who runs the business with her husband, Robert Silvestri, said she thought Obamacare would make coverage better and more affordable, but her family has been dropped by two carriers and our premiums have doubled in six years.\u201d\n\nDonovan said the Silvestris is a textbook example how like families and small business owners around the country, find it ever more challenging to make ends meet as part of today\u2019s middle class. He noted that New York State ranks 49th in the country in business tax climate.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is not just making life difficult for private individuals and family-owned businesses. Today, Health Republic \u2013 the largest Consumer Oriented and Operated Plan (CO-OP) in the country \u2013 will terminate all of its policies, forcing 215,000 New Yorkers to find alternate coverage, including the Silvestris, said Donovan.\n\nDonovan noted that UnitedHealth \u2013 the largest insurance provider in the country \u2013 threatened to pull out of the Obamacare marketplace by 2017. According to the Wall Street Journal, the company has stopped advertising and no longer pays commissions to its brokers \u2013 \u201cIt literally doesn\u2019t want consumers to buy its products,\u201dsaid Donavan.\n\nDonovan said adding insult to injury, a McKinsey report predicts premiums for silver-rated plans in New York State \u2013 the middle-of-the-road option \u2013 will increase by up to 49 percent in 2016.\n\n\u201cHealth Republic is a victim of the foolish logic that is crumbling in front of our eyes. To sustain itself, Obamacare requires young, healthy Americans to pay higher insurance premiums to cover the sick and poor. But young, healthy Americans are already burdened with student loans, rising rents, cell phone bills, and living expenses,\u201d said Donovan. \u201cEven if they purchase the cheapest coverage possible, the sky-high deductibles keep them out of the doctor\u2019s office anyway, undermining the concept of \u2018preventive care\u2019 that is supposed to drive costs down.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Kings County Politics", "description": "Southern Brooklyn Republican Congressman Dan Donovan yesterday blasted President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act after touring a small, family-owned business and learning the\u00a0family of four\u2019s health insurance premiums have increased $25,000 per year.
