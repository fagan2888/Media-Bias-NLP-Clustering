While the delivery of thousands of bottles of Poo-Pourri "before you go" bathroom spray to several hospitals won't solve any pressing supply chain needs, recipients of the unexpected holiday gift said the gesture doesn't stink.

The company that makes the spray said through a statement that they have sent 70,000 two-ounce bottles of their Lavender Vanilla and Vanilla Mint toilet spray to a number of healthcare facilities including Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, MedStar Washington Hospital Center and The Oaks of Louisiana, a skilled nursing facility. Poo-Pourri said it just wanted to say thank you for the "care and dedication" that healthcare workers show to others during the holidays.

Kevin Furhman, chief of operations at The Oaks, said the gift evoked a few giggles, but was appreciated.

"They thought it was nice, and the product itself they felt it was something they could use," said Furhman.

Furhman said they have already distributed the spray, which claims to create an odor-blocking barrier in toilet bowls, to the facility's staff.

Since each two-ounce bottle retails for $9.95, the purveyors of Poo-Pourri claim to have shipped more than $700,000 worth of its odor-killing concoction.

Director of Public Relations for MedStar Washington So Young Pak said they will distribute the bottles donated to them in January, and the arrival of the anti-stink spray will give workers a light-hearted, somewhat comical and well-deserved distraction from the often difficult work they do.

"Healthcare workers across the country deliver unwavering care to the members of their communities every day, and it's nice to have Poo-Pourri recognize them for their efforts."
