All that’s missing from Oregon’s billboard and bus shelter ads is glitter and stickers.

Thought the TV and radio ads were a bit hokey? Check these out:

Cover Oregon sought out visual artists to help them depict the Obamacare health exchange agency’s mission that health insurance should be affordable and accessible to everyone. From Cover Oregon’s website:

Not only did this empower Oregonians to share their view of Cover Oregon and help us create communications that feel true to the communities across the state, it allowed us to put the Cover Oregon marketing dollars right back into the state, and into a population that is historically uninsured.

The ads once again show little about health care accessibility or what Cover Oregon is or does, a common criticism of the multi-million ad campaign promoting Obamacare.

It’s no wonder many Americans don’t even understand that Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are the same thing. Kansas Watchdog reports:

Late night funnyman Jimmy Kimmel had his camera crew take to the streets and ask a few average Americans a simple question: Which do you support, Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act?

The result is clearly humorous, but also a little sad. Watch it here.

Clearly the information campaign on the complicated overhaul of the nation’s health care system is failing some.

Here are the rest of the ads:
