It is definitely that and more just after sunset on April 10 and 11 as Venus hovers near the Pleiades star cluster.\n\nThe delightful pairing of the stellar group\u2014whose bright lights are best noted with peripheral vision rather than stared at directly\u2014and the evening star will take place in the west as night falls. They will be closing in on one another the night of April 10 as well, though they\u2019ll edge a bit closer on the 11th, according to Sky and Telescope.\n\n\u201cLook for the Pleiades just 3 degrees to the upper right of Venus during and after late twilight. That's about two finger-widths at arm's length,\u201d says Sky and Telescope. On Saturday April 11, \u201cThe Pleiades are at their closest to Venus this evening, about 2\u00bd degrees to its right as twilight fades in the west.\u201d\n\nWhile many legends, including in American Indian cultures, peg the Pleiades as siblings, they are that way in scientific circles too, says Earthsky.org.\n\n\u201cIn both myth and science, the Pleiades are considered to be sibling stars,\u201d says Earthsky.org. \u201cModern astronomers say the Pleiades stars were born from the same cloud of gas and dust some 100 million years ago. This gravitationally bound cluster of several hundred stars looms some 430 light-years distant, and these sibling stars drift through space together at about 25 miles per second. Many of these Pleiades stars shine hundreds of times more brightly than our sun.\u201d\n\nThe Pleiades have numerous names in an array of cultures both ancient and modern, though for the most part they are known as the Seven Sisters. The Zuni, according to Earthsky.org, call them the seed stars because their annual appearance signals the start of planting season.\n\nThe group last made headlines in September 2014 when they converged upon the moon.\n\nRELATED: Pleiades: The Seven Sisters Surround the Moon\n\nThree years ago, Venus passed directly in front of the Pleiades, which it does every eight years.\n\nRELATED: Venus Gets With the Seven Sisters\n\nBut seeing Venus resting next to them adds some sparkle to the night. Also adorning the sky this time of year is zodiacal light.\n\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re looking at Venus and the Pleiades this evening, wait around for the sky to get really dark,\u201d says Earthsky.org. \u201cThen look for the mysterious zodiacal light adorning the western sky. You\u2019ll need to wait until around 80 minutes after sunset to see it.\u201d\n\nRELATED: It\u2019s an Equinox Thing: Springtime Zodiacal Light Is Magical at Dusk [Video]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The sky is always magical, eloquent, awe-inspiring\u2014and sometimes downright exquisite.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/10/evening-star-dances-pleiades-159968", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/venus-pleiades-nasa-fred_espenak.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "The Evening Star Dances With the Pleiades"}, "dcterms.date": "2015-04-10T16:25-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/10/evening-star-dances-pleiades-159968", "dc": {"title": "The Evening Star Dances With the Pleiades"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "The Evening Star Dances With the Pleiades"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0a7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cModern astronomers say the Pleiades stars were born from the same cloud of gas and dust some 100 million years ago.\n\u201cWhile you\u2019re looking at Venus and the Pleiades this evening, wait around for the sky to get really dark,\u201d says Earthsky.org.\nIt is definitely that and more just after sunset on April 10 and 11 as Venus hovers near the Pleiades star cluster.\nRELATED: Pleiades: The Seven Sisters Surround the MoonThree years ago, Venus passed directly in front of the Pleiades, which it does every eight years.\n\u201cLook for the Pleiades just 3 degrees to the upper right of Venus during and after late twilight."}
