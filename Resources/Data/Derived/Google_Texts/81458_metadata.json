As for constituents in East San Jose? Not so much. Cory Black fills the blank this time around, leaving the post of district director after just 15 weeks on the job. But in yet another sign that Campos just doesn\u2019t get it, Black was only hired to work on a half-time basis while commuting from San Luis Obispo. Word is Black also continued running his political consulting and lobbyist business on the side, which is just begging for potential conflicts of interests. The only person who appears to remain in the district is a poor secretary who has been instructed to not even say if there is anyone else working in the office. In any other district, residents would be outraged at how Campos runs her shop, but at this point her constituents are so used to being let down that their only hope is that a competent legislator gets elected next year. The frontrunners to date include San Jose Councilman Ash Kalra, former city Vice Mayor Madison Nguyen and county Board of Education president Darcie Green. The last of those three just got engaged, when Green\u2019s boyfriend and personal trainer Rick Alexander proposed on a Jazz Summer Fest stage in between acts. Winning a state Assembly seat has been Green\u2019s lifelong goal, so Fly was surprised when rumblings started popping up that she may be having cold feet about continuing her campaign. One group that would be especially displeased by this is the Latino Caucus, which just gave her its endorsement. But according to a source close to Green, her dream marriage and dream job aren\u2019t mutually exclusive, and the ceremony is expected to be pushed up so she can focus on the campaign.\n\nSend a tip to The Fly\n\nThe Fly is a weekly column written by San Jose Inside staff that provides a behind-the-scenes look at local politics.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.sanjoseinside.com/2015/08/20/assembly-check-nora-campos-loses-another-top-level-staffer/", "news_keywords": "The Fly, Ash Kalra, Cory Black, Darcie Green, Madison Nguyen, Nora Campos, Rick Alexander", "original-source": "http://www.sanjoseinside.com/2015/08/20/assembly-check-nora-campos-loses-another-top-level-staffer/", "og": {"site_name": "San Jose Inside", "description": "Another top-level staffer has left the office of Assemblywoman Nora Campos (D-San Jose), which perhaps comes as a gesture of goodwill to political Mad Libs writers.
