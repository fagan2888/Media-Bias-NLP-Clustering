Though some might not see her as an athlete, she proves that she's capable in her new ad. Screenshot \"Gisele B\u00fcndchen - I WILL WHAT I WANT\"\n\nFirst it was ballerina soloist Misty Copeland. Now, Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen has joined Under Armour\u2019s \u201cI Will What I Want\u201d campaign, where she\u2019s featured in her own new powerful ad.\n\nLast month, Copeland showed us that even though she had all the odds against her, she still made it as a dancer. Now, Bundchen shares her story. The Brazilian beauty might be a supermodel, but she proves in her ad that she is definitely an athlete too. In the video, she shows off her super-fit body as she kicks and punches a punching bag.\n\nAs negative comments pop up on the walls behind her, saying things like, \u201cGisele is just a model\u201d or \u201cshe\u2019s nothing special at all,\" her kicks get even stronger, and the ad ends with a round of strong, repetitive punches. \u201cHaving the strength to tune out negativity and remain focused on what I want gives me the will and confidence to achieve my goals,\u201d she said in a statement, according to Time.\n\nPursuing a modeling career didn\u2019t come easily for Bundchen. She was turned down 43 times from international fashion shows, but she never gave up. The supermodel finally got her big break, and is now considered an icon not only in the modeling industry but in the fitness world too, her profile on Under Armour\u2019s website says.\n\nUnder Armour launched its $15 million women\u2019s campaign in order to attract more ladies to the brand, and so it could compete with other athletic brands like Lululemon and Nike. Not only does Under Armour want more women to buy its products, but it also wishes to inspire women to chase their dreams no matter what challenges come their way. \u201cThis incredibly inspirational initiative serves as a powerful reminder of all the amazing things women can do despite the pressures and criticisms we may encounter,\u201d Bundchen said in the statement.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "gisele bundchen, under armour, super model, campaign, misty copeland", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Supermodel Gisele Bundchen is the newest face of Under Armour's \"I Will What I Want\" fitness campaign.
