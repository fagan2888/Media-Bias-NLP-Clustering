Which governor won national praise for tough leadership handling nine hurricanes? Which governor made his state No. 1 in job creation? Which governor led the fight to stop Obamacare expansion in his state? And which governor laid out a tough plan to destroy ISIS months before the Paris attacks? Jeb Bush.\u201d\n\n\u2014 voiceover of new ad by pro-Jeb Bush group, Right to Rise Super PAC\n\nThe new ad from a pro-Bush Super PAC touts Bush\u2019s record as Florida\u2019s governor, compared to the records of two other governors vying for the GOP nomination: Chris Christie (New Jersey governor since 2010) and John Kasich (Ohio governor since 2011). This ad is among the first attack ads this campaign by Right to Rise.\n\nLet\u2019s examine Bush\u2019s record in each claim.\n\nThe Facts\n\n\u2018National praise for \u2026 handling nine hurricanes\u2019\n\nBush was called the \u201churricane governor\u201d in a 2015 article by the Miami Herald for handling nine hurricanes \u2014 eight of which were in a 14-month span in 2004-05. According to news coverage from around the time, Democratic and Republican leaders praised Bush\u2019s setting up emergency response operations and evacuation plans in the state and getting federal, state and local money to build and improve shelters.\n\nThe record-breaking eight hurricanes during this period \u201cdefined Bush as a steady executive in the face of disaster, the kind of leader he\u2019d like to portray to the rest of the country now that he\u2019s running for president and struggling to impress Republican voters,\u201d the article said.\n\n\u201cHis popularity with Floridians is probably tethered to those moments probably more than any policy,\u201d former Miami Beach Democratic state senator Dan Gelber was quoted in the Miami Herald article.\n\nThe article and others about Bush\u2019s leadership during this time note that he became known as \u201cthe undisputed national leader in emergency management,\u201d even among Bush\u2019s critics. According to a 2004 Associated Press article, Bush\u2019s approval rating soared amid the hurricanes in 2004, and nearly 90 percent of those polled said they approved of his emergency response to the hurricanes. The AP cited a poll in late September that found his approval rating at 62 percent \u2014 a 17-point improvement over the previous month. Nearly 90 percent said they approved of his response to the hurricanes.\n\nClearly, this is quite a specific claim to Bush\u2019s experience and not directly comparable to the other governors. One could imagine a similar talking point for Christie, and the national recognition he gained for his role after Hurricane Sandy. Christie\u2019s ratings also soared then, and he also pushed for his state to receive federal aid. And it\u2019s not exactly fair to compare Bush\u2019s record to Kasich\u2019s in Ohio, a much less hurricane-prone state.\n\n\u2018No. 1 in job creation\u2019\n\nThis is one of Bush\u2019s favorite talking points, for which we previously awarded Four Pinocchios when he made the claim in a campaign ad. His assertion is simply not supported by official Labor Department data.\n\nAs regular readers know, The Fact Checker warns against attributing job creation claims to the decision of one policymaker, as many factors can drive jobs numbers. Plus, there are many ways to cherry-pick jobs numbers to make the point you want to make. (Our Wonkblog colleagues put together this nifty analysis for voters to compare the records of governors accurately.)\n\nLet\u2019s review the numbers again. Bush was governor from January 1999 through December 2006. When he took office, there were 6,709,300 jobs, and when he left office there were 8,033,700 jobs. That is a net increase of 1.3 million jobs, and Florida ranked just behind California (1.45 million jobs) in that overall count of net jobs.\n\nBut as we\u2019ve noted before, the best way to measure job creation is to look at the rate of job growth. Florida is a larger state, certainly much larger than Ohio or New Jersey. When looking at the rate of growth, Florida placed fifth overall during those years at 19.8 percent gain. Nevada (34.4 percent), Arizona (25.9 percent), Wyoming (23.3 percent) and Idaho (22.1 percent) ranked higher than Florida in terms of job growth rate.\n\nMatt Wall of Right to Rise said Florida had the highest number of net jobs three out of eight years of Bush\u2019s terms as governor, in 2002, 2003 and 2004. Those numbers check out, for net job gains. But in growth rates, Florida ranked eighth, seventh and third respectively in those three years. Plus, this method is cherry-picking years to make a point.\n\nThe difference in this ad, however, is the comparison to the other two states. It is correct that neither New Jersey nor Ohio ranked as high as Florida did under Bush in net jobs numbers or in growth rate under Christie\u2019s or Kasich\u2019s terms.\n\n\u201cFlorida led the nation in net job creation under Jeb for several years, a claim neither Christie nor Kasich can make with their states,\u201d Wall said. \u201cNet job creation is one way to measure job growth. And just as you note Florida is a larger state than Ohio and New Jersey, there are states much larger than Florida (e.g. California\u2019s population has millions more people than Florida) yet under Jeb, Florida still led the nation in job creation.\u201d\n\nBut again, this is a perilous, apples-to-oranges exercise. Setting aside that there is no direct connection between a governor\u2019s policy record and raw jobs numbers, the three states\u2019 economies are different from each other, they were over different years, and Christie and Kasich are not yet finished with their gubernatorial terms.\n\n\u2018Led the fight to stop Obamacare expansion in his state\u2019\n\nThis is a curious one. Bush\u2019s term as governor ended two years before President Obama took office, and three years before the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d) was signed into law. So what exactly was Bush\u2019s role?\n\nBush remained a popular former governor when lawmakers in Florida were deciding whether to accept Medicaid expansion under Obamacare. Florida Gov. Rick Scott had planned to agree to Medicaid expansion in February 2013.\n\nThat month, Bush privately met with Florida lawmakers to urge them to oppose the Medicaid expansion, and sources told the National Review that \u201ceveryone was listening to what he had to say, because at the time, no one was entirely sure about how Scott was going to proceed.\u201d\n\nBut the National Review also reported that Bush wasn\u2019t expected to rally against Scott, \u201csince he usually avoids becoming involved in partisan debates and intra-party battles. But within the upper echelons of Florida Republican politics, his opposition to Medicaid expansion is well known, and has been privately cited by Scott\u2019s critics, who hope to kill the governor\u2019s proposal in the legislature.\u201d Bush also said publicly that he had doubts about the expansion.\n\nLooking through the news coverage, Bush appears to have taken more of an advisory role than an active role to \u201clead the fight to stop\u201d Medicaid expansion. We asked Wall about this, who responded: \u201cJeb took an active role by meeting with legislators and encouraging them to reject Obamacare expansion, which they ultimately did, so by definition he led on the issue.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Christie and Kasich have, indeed, allowed Medicaid expansion in their states. Kasich\u2019s campaign noted that the Ohio governor opposed Obamacare exchanges in Ohio, and sued to block Obamacare and call for its repeal.\n\n\u201cThe latest ad from Jeb\u2019s team forgot to check the box for \u2018Which governor is living in the past because he has no new ideas for fixing anything?\u2019 \u201d said Kasich for America spokesman Rob Nichols. \u201cYou only attack those you fear and who\u2019s beating you, so this latest attack by Jeb on Gov. Kasich only reaffirms the governor\u2019s strength in New Hampshire. It\u2019s actually flattering.\u201d\n\n\u2018Laid out a tough plan to destroy ISIS months before Paris attacks\u2019\n\nBush made his major foreign policy speech outlining his plan to counter ISIS on Aug. 11, 2015. He argued for more troops, though he said a \u201cmajor commitment of American combat forces\u201d was unnecessary. This was three months prior to the November terrorist attacks in Paris, for which ISIS claimed responsibility. After the attacks in November, Bush definitively called for sending U.S. troops to combat ISIS.\n\nRight to Rise noted that Kasich released a more detailed plan for ISIS during a speech Nov. 15, after the Paris attacks. But the Kasich campaign refuted this claim, saying Kasich had been rolling out his ISIS strategy since February 2015 (in an informal phone interview with The Washington Post), before his announcement to run for president.\n\nKasich wrote an Aug. 17 op-ed on CNN.com outlining foreign policy and counterterrorism stances, but the plan was not specifically limited to ISIS. Kasich made one reference to ISIS in the op-ed: \u201cAny action that America takes, or suggests, is more effective if it is reinforced by a stronger military and renewed alliances. With these shored-up alliances, a stronger presence in the Western Pacific, a more aggressive allied stance toward Russia, and decisive allied action to eradicate ISIS would all produce better outcomes, as well as give potential future disruptive actors more pause for thought.\u201d\n\nChristie\u2019s campaign pointed to a speech he gave in May 2015, about a month and a half before announcing his run for the presidency. The prepared version does not show an ISIS-specific strategy.\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nThe ad made four claims about Bush\u2019s record. One claim stretched the facts into an apples-to-oranges-to-lemons comparison of jobs numbers; one oddly claimed Bush \u201cled the fight to stop\u201d Medicaid expansion when he appeared to have played more of an advisory role; one made an accurate but very specific claim about Bush\u2019s record handling nine hurricanes in Florida that just isn\u2019t comparable to the other two governors (in contrast, there were eight recorded hurricanes in the eastern Ohio/Ohio Valley region since 1915); and one was accurate that Bush had delivered an ISIS-specific speech months before the Paris attacks (though his specific proposal about committing military troops was not made clear until November).\n\nThis is a highly selective group of comparisons. What if Kasich released an ad saying he was the only governor who helped to balance the federal budget? And Christie released an ad that he was the only governor who prosecuted terrorism cases after 9/11? Those claims also would be (more or less) factually accurate, but completely out of context. Neither Bush nor Christie held federally elected offices, and neither Bush nor Kasich served as United States attorney.\n\nWhile the veracity of claims in this ad run the gamut from accurate to mostly false, on the whole, it earns Two Pinocchios for lacking context and creating a misleading impression for the average viewer.\n\nTwo Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nCheck out our 2016 candidates fact-check page\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new ad by a pro-Jeb Bush Super PAC cobbles together a series of out-of-context claims about Bush's record.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/myhlee", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A new ad by a pro-Jeb Bush Super PAC cobbles together a series of out-of-context claims about Bush's record.", "title": "Right to Rise Super PAC\u2019s series of misleading claims about Jeb Bush\u2019s record", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/01/05/right-to-rise-super-pacs-series-of-misleading-claims-about-jeb-bushs-record/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/files/2016/01/GOP_2016_BUSH-0bedd.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@myhlee"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/01/05/right-to-rise-super-pacs-series-of-misleading-claims-about-jeb-bushs-record/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "jeb bush; right to rise pac; jeb bush ad; three governors; john kasich; chris christie; michelle lee; glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/myhlee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "jeb bush; right to rise pac; jeb bush ad; three governors; john kasich; chris christie; michelle lee; glenn kessler; fact checker; factchecker"}, "article_summary": "The super PAC supporting Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush released an ad comparing the Florida governor to Gov.\nNeither Bush nor Christie held federally elected offices, and neither Bush nor Kasich served as United States attorney.\nAnd it\u2019s not exactly fair to compare Bush\u2019s record to Kasich\u2019s in Ohio, a much less hurricane-prone state.\nRight to Rise noted that Kasich released a more detailed plan for ISIS during a speech Nov. 15, after the Paris attacks.\nThe Pinocchio TestThe ad made four claims about Bush\u2019s record."}
