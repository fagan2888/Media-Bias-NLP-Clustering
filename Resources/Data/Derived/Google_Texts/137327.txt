NEW YORK (AP) â€” Oprah Winfrey's OWN network says the "Man School" is in session, with actor-musician Tyrese Gibson and Rev. Run as the professors.

The network announced Thursday that the two men will star in a prime-time series debuting early next year. It's based on the two friends' book "Man-ology," offering a male perspective on love and relationships.

OWN says the series will feature a studio audience and celebrity guests in a "no-holds-barred relationship throw down."

Gibson, a recording artist, is also known for his acting in "Fast and Furious" and "Transformers." Run, the stage name of Joseph Simmons, was a founder of the rap group RUN DMC and now hosts a home renovation series on HGTV.
