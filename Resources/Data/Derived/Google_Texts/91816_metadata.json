Last Sunday\u2019s episode, \u201cGranite State,\u201d finished with a show record 6.6 million viewers despite having stiff competition from the NFL, the Emmy Awards (where the show won Best Drama), and the series of finale of \u201cDexter.\u201d This follows the record-breaking previous episode, which recorded 6.37 million viewers and the season 5.2 premiere, which scored 5.92 million. AMC reportedly was looking for $300,000 to $400,000 for a 30-second ad spot in the finale.\n\nThe show and the network have also clearly benefited from their partnership with Netflix. Season 5.1\u2019s finale, \u201cGliding Over,\u201d scored a much smaller 2.78 million viewers, but consistently strong reviews and word of mouth persuaded enough people (myself included) to binge watch in the break between half seasons to double that number by the premiere.\n\nThis is clearly a big win for series creator and showrunner Vince Gilligan \u2013 \u201cthe hottest name in television,\u201d as The New York Times just called him. In addition to the just announced police drama \u201cBattle Creek\u201d for CBS, Gilligan is also continuing his relationship with AMC (and the world of \"Breaking Bad\") with the long rumored Saul Goodman spin-off finally confirmed. But the success if \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d might be an even more important victory for AMC, which has now overtaken HBO as the top purveyor of quality adult dramas.\n\nRELATED: BREAKING BAD: BY THE NUMBERS\n\nDuring its mid-2000\u2019s heyday, HBO wore the crown, with shows like \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cThe Wire,\u201d \u201cDeadwood,\u201d \u201cSix Feet Under,\u201d and okay, fine, \u201cSex and the City.\u201d But those shows are long gone, and with the conclusion of \u201cTrue Blood,\u201d only \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d can still be considered to be at the forefront of the zeitgeist. The less said of the train wreck that is \u201cThe Newsroom,\u201d the better.\n\nShowtime has also lost a step now that \u201cDexter\u201d is out of its lineup. With \u201cHomeland\u201d suffering from a brutal case of Second-Season Syndrome (and a season 3 premiere that\u2019s pitted against Walt\u2019s last stand), there\u2019s little sign of them getting back in the game.\n\nAMC, on the other hand is riding high, on its Emmy and ratings victory for the show, as well as the news that \u201cMad Men\u201d would also break its final season into two sections, ensuring two more years of being at the front of cultural conversations. Meanwhile AMC\u2019s other smash hit, \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d can keep shambling along as long as the current zombie fad remains.\n\nIt seems an odd development for a channel that was once just a distribution network for old titles, hosted by George Clooney\u2019s dad. It is worth remembering, though, that HBO was once a distribution network for slightly less-old movies before its reinvention as a television channel for adults.\n\nIt is also worth noting that while HBO\u2019s tent pole shows were either about dealing with the emotional baggage of mortality (\u201cSopranos,\u201d \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d) or the world in a microcosm (\u201cThe Wire,\u201d \u201cDeadwood\u201d), all of AMC\u2019s biggest shows are fundamentally about work and the way we relate to it in the modern age. \u201cMad Men\u201d focuses on the dissonance between the person we pretend to be to succeed and the person we really are. \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d like any post-apocalyptic wish fulfillment fantasy, is about the desire to wipe the slate clean of society\u2019s rules and return to a place where only survival mattered.\n\n\u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d for most of its run, focused on the monster that our jobs force us to become to our families in the \u201calways-on\u201d culture. (\u201cSorry honey, I can\u2019t make your soccer game tonight, I gotta cook some meth.\u201d) It\u2019s grand irony that Walt alienates the very people he aims to provide for with these difficult choices. Every time he leaps from frying pan to fire, he loses a bit of his soul to escape.\n\nAnd while Don Draper and the herd of zombies can certainly take a lot of credit for the network\u2019s success, much of the credit should go to Gilligan\u2019s clockwork engine. It may not have the powerful social commentary of \u201cThe Wire\u201d or the epic scope of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d but \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d has been revealed as a perfect mousetrap.\n\nMany shows over the years have failed in wrapping things up well. The last season of \u201cThe Wire\u201d was its weakest. \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d still receives complaints for its elliptical ending. \u201cDeadwood\u201d had an ending prematurely forced on it. And we all remember the mess that was the end of \u201cLost.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d on the other hand has never slumped. Unless Gilligan totally drops the ball during his last hour, he will have delivered a pulse-pounding and breathless final season with all the relentlessness of the fates in Greek tragedy or Shakespeare.\n\nAs always with this show, we the viewers, are asked to question where our sympathies really lie as we approach the finale. The show has always been an exercise in turning your protagonist into a villain. And seeing how far an audience would follow it. What at first could seem like a Robin Hood sort of story, a moonshiner\u2019s tale, turned into something more like Macbeth.\n\nBut no matter what either of those men have done to deserve their fates, we want Walt to roll into the White Power compound to rescue Jesse like a one man Wild Bunch. We want Walter to get a Samurai\u2019s death and Jesse to at last have some peace, and the real terror is that the ever-perverse Gilligan may not give us what we want.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Regardless of which fate befalls Walter White come 9:00 p.m. on Sunday night, one clear winner will emerge from the massacre in Albuquerque: the AMC network.", "title": "Breaking Bad Finale: AMC\u2019s in the Empire Business", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/27/Breaking-Bad-Finale-AMC-s-Empire-Business", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09252013_JesseWalt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/27/Breaking-Bad-Finale-AMC-s-Empire-Business", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09252013_JesseWalt.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Regardless of which fate befalls Walter White come 9:00 p.m. on Sunday night, one clear winner will emerge from the massacre in Albuquerque: the AMC network.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf497\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d for most of its run, focused on the monster that our jobs force us to become to our families in the \u201calways-on\u201d culture.\nBut the success if \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d might be an even more important victory for AMC, which has now overtaken HBO as the top purveyor of quality adult dramas.\nRegardless of which fate befalls Walter White come 9:00 p.m. on Sunday night, one clear winner will emerge from the massacre in Albuquerque: the AMC network.\nIt may not have the powerful social commentary of \u201cThe Wire\u201d or the epic scope of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d but \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d has been revealed as a perfect mousetrap.\nIn addition to the just announced police drama \u201cBattle Creek\u201d for CBS, Gilligan is also continuing his relationship with AMC (and the world of \"Breaking Bad\") with the long rumored Saul Goodman spin-off finally confirmed."}
