(AP) \u2014 North of the U.S.-Mexico border, a relatively barren stretch of an Arizona highway is lined with road signs that tell drivers how many kilometers they are from their destination \u2014 not how many miles.\n\nThe markers from Nogales to Tucson are a relic of a failed Carter administration pilot program that aimed to convince Americans to adopt the system of measure in use across much of the rest of the world.\n\nThe roughly 60-mile stretch (or about 100 kilometers) is the only continuous highway in the U.S. with metric signs, and it\u2019s the subject of a long-simmering spat over whether they should be changed back to the standard system.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m driving, I definitely can\u2019t do that math,\u201d said Nick Rodriguez, a 24-year-old who lives in Rio Rico.\n\nSome who agree with Rodriguez took a shot at changing the signs four years ago when the state, which oversees them, received $1.5 million in federal stimulus funding.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Transportation at the time said the signs were outdated and needed to be replaced with ones that are brighter and easier to read. \u201cYou get wear and tear on them.

Area business owners said new signs in miles would change the exit numbers they advertise. The highway is measured in kilometers, so road markers and exit numbers would change, they said.\n\n\u201cIt had a lot of opposition because people felt it was something that relates to tourism,\u201d Jim DiGiacomo, president of the Green Valley-Sahuarita Chamber of Commerce, said. \u201cThe hotels and businesses would have to change all of their info.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arizona highway signs in metric units may change", "title": "Arizona highway signs in metric units may change", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Arizona highway signs in metric units may change", "title": "Arizona highway signs in metric units may change", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/04/arizona_highway_signs_in_metric_units_may_change/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/metric-signs-arizona.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Arizona highway signs in metric units may change", "title": "Arizona highway signs in metric units may change", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/metric-signs-arizona.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Astrid Galvan", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ee7\"", "article_summary": "The highway is measured in kilometers, so road markers and exit numbers would change, they said.\nArea business owners said new signs in miles would change the exit numbers they advertise.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsTUCSON, Ariz.
