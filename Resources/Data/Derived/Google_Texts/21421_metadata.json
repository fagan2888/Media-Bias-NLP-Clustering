Why use marijuana for animals? To put it simply, those who've experimented with the drug for their pets say it just works. And in states where it's legal, some companies are leading the way in marijuana- and hemp-based naturopathic medicine.\n\nSeattle-based Canna Companion uses ground-up hemp plants to make capsules, which don't contain delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the more active ingredient in marijuana, according to CNBC. Instead, they contain cannabidiol (CBD), the ingredient most useful for treating pain and other medical problems. Another Seattle company, Canna-Pet, makes similar drugs. By omitting THC, and keeping CBD and many of the other 60 or so cannabinoids in the plant, pet patients can get pain relief without getting high.\n\nNevertheless, these companies are going the safer route when it comes to medical marijuana for pets. Some veterinarians and medical marijuana patients are using the actual drug.\n\nDr. Douglas Kramer, a Los Angeles veterinarian, is one such person, according to the Daily Mail. He tested out the plant on his dying dog Nikita after she had surgery to remove tumors. After ingesting the marijuana, Nikkita lived for six more weeks, and even showed signs of weight gain and less pain.\n\n\"Nikita was wasting away, and she\u2019d stopped eating,\" Kramer told the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association in an article last year. \"I\u2019d exhausted every available pharmaceutical pain option, even steroids. At that point, it was a quality-of-life issue, and I felt like I\u2019d try anything to ease her suffering.\"\n\nCalifornia resident Ernest Misko also tried the drug while experiencing severe back pain. His results were so great that he decided to give his aging cat, Borzo, some \u2014 he was having difficulty walking. After just a few days of using the drug, Misko noted great improvements in Borzo, who was able to walk around a lot better, and appeared to be pain free. \u201cI don\u2019t get high from [marijuana], but the pain goes away. So I tried it on my cat, my 24-year-old cat, who\u2019s feeling better,\u201d Misko told the Journal.\n\nCannabinoid-based drugs have also been used for quite some time in the U.S. Nabilone is one such drug, which is also a synthetic cannabinoid. It's used as an antiemetic for nausea and vomiting and an analgesic (pain killer) for neuropathic pain. It is also used for treating everything from eating disorders to AIDS. Cannabis oils are also used to treat tumors.\n\nFor pet owners convinced that they should give their dogs or cats pot, it's important to be aware that even in medical marijuana-legal states, it's illegal for veterinarians to prescribe or even recommend marijuana to treat patients. Also, the side effects of marijuana are still unclear. Although it's natural, that doesn't mean that ingesting it will cause no harm.\n\nA 2012 study from the Journal of Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care found that marijuana toxicosis cases had quadrupled over the course of five years in dogs, as the number of state medical marijuana registrations increased. Two dogs mentioned in the study even died after ingesting marijuana-infused butter.\n\nSuggesting that pet owners proceed with caution, experts are interested in the possibility of using marijuana in veterinary practice. \u201cMy gut reaction is they do probably provide some therapeutic effect benefit,\" Dr. Dawn Boothe, director of the Clinical Pharmacology Laboratory at Auburn University\u2019s College of Veterinary Medicine, told the Journal. \"But, I'm never going to say there\u2019s enough benefit that marijuana should be given to pets. I\u2019m saying there\u2019s enough justification that we need to study it.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marijuana, pot, pets, dogs, cats", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Medical marijuana has been proven effective not only in humans but also in pets.
