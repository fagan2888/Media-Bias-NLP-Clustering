Ted Cruz and Mike Lee sent a letter Friday asking Health and Human Services secretary nominee Sylvia Burwell to come clean about how she would implement Obamacare if confirmed.\n\n\u201cSo far, Ms. Burwell\u2019s testimony has been less than forthcoming and suggests she plans to follow the lead of her predecessor in blocking Congress\u2019s ability to do proper oversight for the America people,\u201d the senators wrote in a statement. \u201cThe questions we propose in the letter have not only been asked repeatedly, but deal with issues she should have been prepared to answer at her hearings but did not.\u201d\n\nCruz and Lee asked the current Office of Management and Budget director a host of questions about the status of the health care law, asking for her commitment to provide data about the health care exchanges to Congress and the public before confirmed by the full Senate.

The only payment information released by the federal government has comes from House Republicans, who compiled a report in April detailing those who had paid their premiums by April 15, several weeks before many customers\u2019 deadline to pay.\n\nCruz and Lee also asked Burwell whether CMS will spend taxpayer dollars to make risk corridor payments \u2014 commonly considered an insurer bailout \u2014 to insurance companies on the exchanges. A new CMS ruling out Friday indicates that the Obama administration is open to going back on its previous promise to keep the risk corridor program budget-neutral.\n\nBurwell\u2019s approval of an OMB action to exempt Obamacare premium subsidies from the sequester, despite an OMB report which found the subsidies to be applicable to the cost-cutting law, also came under fire. Cruz and Lee requested an explanation of OMB\u2019s legal authority and the agency\u2019s reversal on the issue.\n\nBurwell is likely to be confirmed by the Democratic-controlled Senate, with Democrats hoping to have her approved by Memorial Day.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
