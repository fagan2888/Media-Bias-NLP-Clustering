Graff, who finished his career at Wisconsin as a four-time All-American, dropped a 3-1 decision in double overtime. ( Associated Press )\n\nTyler Graff pulled off a big win on Friday to make his final collegiate match at Wisconsin one where he would wrestle for the national championship. But Saturday, facing Big 10 foe Tony Ramos of Iowa, the Loveland High product dropped a 3-1 decision in double overtime at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.\n\nGraff, who won four state championships for the Indians and was 161-1 in his high school career, caps his stay at Wisconsin as a four-time All-American, just the fourth in Badgers' history. He finished 128-25 in his career.\n\nGraff could not be reached after the match. Former Loveland assistant coach Faren Stroh, who has continued to work with Graff since he departed for Wisconsin, said it was a tough way to end an amazing career.\n\n\"He was heartbroken. That's the dream he's had since he was a little kid,\" Stroh said. \"It breaks your heart to see it and watch that. I feel for him. I still think he went for it, and that's all right.\n\n\"Taking second isn't bad, and there's not too many times you can say somebody was a four-time Division I All-American.\"\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, Graff earned an quick escape point in the second, one that Ramos was able to counter in the third. After a scoreless sudden-victory period, Graff put himself in a great position by riding out Ramos for 30 seconds in the first overtime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in the second, trying to get the winning escape, Graff rolled, and Ramos caught him for the near-fall points. Graff took more shots during the match, but Ramos defended them all well. Graff fended off one good Ramos shot, and was given a stalling warning in the process.\n\nIt was a move where Wisconsin coach Barry Davis said Graff just tried to go with a move he hadn't used on Ramos, but it just didn't work.\n\n\"Well, he might have tried to stand up, but he was trying to get some action going and see how it worked out,\" Davis said. \"He tried something he's been working on and Ramos didn't know about. Sometimes you've got to go with what you feel.\"\n\nIt was the fifth time the two seniors have met on the mat in their careers, with Ramos having won the last four. Among those wins are twice in the Big 10 Championship finals and last year's semifinals at nationals. Graff won their initial meeting, 3-1, in sudden victory.\n\nThe outcome was not what Graff had hoped for, but Davis said his final decision would in no way define the wrestler or the career he had. Davis, who said Graff is like a son to him, hopes he stays around because he's been such a positive influence on the program on so many fronts.\n\n\"Hey, that kid has nothing to be ashamed about,\" Davis said. \"He's been on the national stage four times. I love that kid. I'd do anything for Tyler Graff. He's given us great leadership. He's been the best, in and out of the room, in everything he does.\"\n\nDavis said Graff will continue to train for an Olympic shot, and he hopes to have Graff serve as a volunteer or club coach for the program.\n\nGraff entered the tournament seeded fifth, but he upset top-seeded Joe Colon of Northern Iowa \u2014 whom Graff had lost to twice this season \u2014 with a 6-4 decision in the semifinals.\n\nGraff placed fifth at nationals his first two seasons before battling back to take third last year after the semifinal loss.\n\nHe had two former Loveland teammates in the field with him \u2014 Wisconsin heavyweight Connor Medbery and Josh Kreimier (157) of Air Force. Both of them had been eliminated in the consolation rounds. For Kreimier, a senior, it was his third NCAA berth. For Medbery, it was the sophomore's second trip.\n\nContact Sports Editor Mike Brohard at 970-635-3633 or mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and at twitter.com/mbrohard", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/local/ci_25402074/tyler-graff-falls-finals", "modificationDate": "2014-03-22T21:03:14-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0322/20140322__23rhsncww_TEST~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Brohard \n \n  Sports Editor", "description": "Tyler Graff pulled off a big win on Friday to make his final collegiate match at Wisconsin one where he would wrestle for the national championship.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:25402074:view"}, "startDate": "2014-03-22T21:00:22-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/local/ci_25402074/tyler-graff-falls-finals", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0322/20140322__23rhsncww_TEST~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Tyler Graff pulled off a big win on Friday to make his final collegiate match at Wisconsin one where he would wrestle for the national championship.", "title": "Tyler Graff falls in finals"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Tyler Graff pulled off a big win on Friday to make his final collegiate match at Wisconsin one where he would wrestle for the national championship.", "title": "Tyler Graff falls in finals", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/local/ci_25402074/tyler-graff-falls-finals", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0322/20140322__23rhsncww_TEST~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-22T21:00:22-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2024-03-22T21:00:22-0600", "sailthru.title": "Tyler Graff falls in finals", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Other Local Sports", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Mike BrohardSports", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0322/20140322__23rhsncww_TEST~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-03-22T21:04:40-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland Colorado ReporterHerald local sports"}, "article_summary": "I'd do anything for Tyler Graff.\n( Associated Press )Tyler Graff pulled off a big win on Friday to make his final collegiate match at Wisconsin one where he would wrestle for the national championship.\nGraff won their initial meeting, 3-1, in sudden victory.\nFormer LHS wrestler finishes as 4-time All-AmericanIowa's Tony Ramos, left, celebrates after defeating Wisconsin's Tyler Graff, right, in the 133-pound match in the finals of the NCAA Division I wrestling championships in Oklahoma City on Saturday.\nDavis said Graff will continue to train for an Olympic shot, and he hopes to have Graff serve as a volunteer or club coach for the program."}
