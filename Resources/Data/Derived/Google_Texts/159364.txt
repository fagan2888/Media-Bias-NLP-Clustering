The lineup for D.C's Trillectro music festival was announced Wednesday.

The event takes place Aug. 23 at RFK Stadium Festival Grounds and brings together hip-hop and electro music for one hot, exciting evening.

The headliners include multi-award winner Big Sean and "Harlem Shake" creator Baauer. Many rising stars are also on the bill as well:

Fat Trel follows in the famed footsteps of D.C.'s own Wale and signed to Rick Ross' record label Maybach Music Group, while Migos, who earned fans on the independent hip-hop scene, signed to 300 entertainment under Atlantic Records in June.

Also, from the world of electro-rock, Redline Graffiti gained popularity after appearing at the Capitol Groove Fest in 2012.

DC to BC started Trillectro in 2012 as a means of bridging the gap between two immensely popular musical genres in D.C. The event has grown in popularity very fast and attracted big names for its second iteration last year, including Wale and a DJ set from Salva.

Early-bird tickets are still available for the festival at $49. After that, tickets cost $69. VIP options are also available.
