In a celebration of equality, diversity, and community, the Center For Equality is putting on the 2015 Sioux Falls Pride Festival Saturday, June 20 from 12 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Terrace Park.

Live performances at the festival include music from Darin Kaihoi and Christopher Vondracek and stand-up comedy from local comedian Zach Dresch and the Twin Cities' Funniest Person Of The Year, Jakey Emmert.
