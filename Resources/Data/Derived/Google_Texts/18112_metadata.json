Mike Honda, D-San Jose, shake hands after their first and probably only general-election debate at KNTV NBC 11, in San Jose, Calif., on Monday, Oct. 6, 2014. (John Green/ Bay Area News Group)\n\nIt\u2019s crunch time in the 17th Congressional District. Longtime incumbent Mike Honda is battling to keep his House seat against another Democrat, Ro Khanna.\n\nThey\u2019re both using an army of volunteers to get the word out as the campaign enters its final two weeks. But as time grows tight, the campaigns appear to be targeting different political demographics.\n\nKhanna is attempting to pick off what Democrats he can while trying to get the votes of independents, undecideds and Republicans. Honda is focusing on Democrats with a capital D.\n\nHonda\u2019s been in Congress for 14 years. He\u2019s a stalwart supporter of civil rights, Social Security, the Affordable Care Act, public transportation and math and science education.\n\nAs a result he has the support of the Democratic Party structure. That includes endorsements all the way up to President Barack Obama.\n\nCourtney Cooper of Los Gatos used to live in Honda\u2019s district, but redistricting carved her out.\n\n\u201cWhen I lived in the district, I used to vote for him,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cAlways seemed like an upstanding guy. So I figured, if I can\u2019t give my vote, I can give my time.\u201d\n\nAs a member of the LGBTQ community, the 29-year-old Foothill College student took it to heart when Honda was one of the first elected officials to join the NOH8 campaign against Proposition 8, the 2008 California ballot initiative that banned same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not when it\u2019s popular,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nUsing a database called Vote Builder, Cooper is calling people with a history of volunteering to help get out the vote. Most of those working the phones on this particular night are taking politics and government classes at local high schools and colleges.\n\nHonda tends to mumble in front of a microphone. But put him in front of a group of teenagers working the phone banks and the former science teacher comes alive.\n\nIn a wide-ranging conversation covering everything from his time in the Peace Corps to his favorite books, the 73-year-old connects with this crowd. One high school student asks for advice on what to say to voters who dislike Honda\u2019s positions. He replies the student can speak to her experience.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s how much do you believe in what it is that we\u2019re doing,\u201d Honda said.\n\nLater the same evening, Honda headlined a panel discussion at San Jose City College on sex trafficking. Before an audience of mostly Latino and Asian students, Honda drew a long, historical line between sexual slavery perpetrated by the Japanese during World War II and the activities of ISIS in the Middle East today.\n\n\u201cEliminating human trafficking is not a Democratic or Republican issue,\u201d Honda said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a women\u2019s issue or an international issue. Human trafficking is the pre-eminent human rights issue of our day.\u201d\n\nWhile Honda can campaign on his congressional record, Khanna cannot.\n\nOn a recent, balmy evening, Khanna went door to door in West San Jose. The neighborhood has a Leave It to Beaver quality about it: quiet, leafy streets packed with mid-century ranch homes.\n\nEven for Silicon Valley, this region is more than middle class. Homes here regularly sell for more than $1 million, according to Trulia, an online real estate marketplace.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s more to the district than just Silicon Valley, and there\u2019s more to the district than just high-tech coolness.\u2019 Bill Whalen,\n\nHoover Institution\n\nKhanna uses MiniVan, a smartphone app for a database built under the guidance of Obama for America. The app tells Khanna voters\u2019 names and party affiliations \u2014 or lack thereof.\n\nIt\u2019s dinner time and Khanna knows he has less than a minute to make his pitch, especially if he\u2019s talking to a harried mom with kids at the table. A number of people don\u2019t even bother to open the door \u2014 they talk to Khanna through their kitchen windows.\n\nMost people are polite but noncommittal. Khanna likes to mention he teaches economics at Stanford, but few take him up on it. Voters want to talk about schools and traffic, not the federal budget or foreign policy. So he talks about schools, and when the through-the-window conversation ends, drops a mailer on the welcome mat.\n\nThe 38-year-old intellectual property lawyer from Fremont is Indian-American. He says a year ago it seemed he was only known by the Indian community. But then a handful of high powered tech titans like Marissa Mayer of Yahoo and angel investor Ron Conway started contributing to his campaign. That money helped fund a series of ads giving him higher name recognition. A televised debate with Honda earlier this month helped, too.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a global economy,\u201d Khanna said early in the debate. \u201cChanging. Intensely competitive. And yet, Congress seems to have no real leadership or ideas and is stuck in the past. Dysfunctional. Slow moving.\u201d\n\nBy implication, Khanna is suggesting that Honda lacks vision.\n\nBut Khanna\u2019s political positions aren\u2019t that different from Honda on everything from Social Security to health care.\n\nDemocrats make up 44 percent of the electorate in the district, so how does Khanna convince Democratic voters to turn an incumbent like Honda out of office?\n\nKhanna\u2019s initial strategy stressed his ties to Silicon Valley, but that had limitations, according to Bill Whalen of Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more to the district than just Silicon Valley,\u201d Whalen says, \u201cand there\u2019s more to the district than just high-tech coolness. You ask the average voter in that congressional district how are they doing? Are they better off than they were four years ago, and I don\u2019t think Marissa Mayer\u2019s endorsement really matters that much.\u201d\n\nWhalen, a former speech writer for Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, says that to win, Khanna needs to win over folks who might not normally vote for a Democrat. That is: independents, undecideds, and Republicans. Like a registered Republican Khanna met in West San Jose while canvassing.\n\nWhen Khanna asks the voter whether he\u2019s heard about the race, the man replies, \u201cYou can save it. I\u2019m gonna vote for you.\u201d\n\nThat may not sound like a ringing endorsement, but it does sound like a vote. Internal polls from both camps show Khanna gaining ground in recent weeks. Khanna\u2019s poll shows a dead heat, while Honda\u2019s shows the incumbent holding a 15-point lead. We\u2019ll all know for sure in a couple of weeks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As battle between Democrats enters final weeks, Republican and independent voters may decide outcome.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Honda, Khanna Hustle for Votes in Fight for South Bay House Seat\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2014\\/10\\/20\\/mike-honda-ro-khanna-house-campaign\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-10-20 08:00:25\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-10-21 11:19:03\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":10344232,\"author_id\":\"251\",\"author_name\":\"Rachael Myrow\",\"author_display_name\":\"Rachael Myrow\",\"tags\":[\"17th Congressional District\",\"Ro Khanna\",\"Silicon Valley\"],\"categories\":[\"Politics and Government\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2014\\/10\\/KhannaHonda1.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "As battle between Democrats enters final weeks,  Republican and independent voters may decide outcome.", "title": "Honda, Khanna Hustle for Votes in Fight for South Bay House Seat", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2014/10/20/mike-honda-ro-khanna-house-campaign/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2014/10/RS12663_Courtney-Cooper-lpr-400x400.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@rachaelmyrow"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "17th congressional district,ro khanna,silicon valley", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8eb4\"", "article_summary": "Khanna\u2019s initial strategy stressed his ties to Silicon Valley, but that had limitations, according to Bill Whalen of Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution.\n\u201cEliminating human trafficking is not a Democratic or Republican issue,\u201d Honda said.\nThe app tells Khanna voters\u2019 names and party affiliations \u2014 or lack thereof.\nLater the same evening, Honda headlined a panel discussion at San Jose City College on sex trafficking.\nLongtime incumbent Mike Honda is battling to keep his House seat against another Democrat, Ro Khanna."}
