This is going to be the prevailing narrative of the 2016 race, until a new one comes along. It\u2019s perfectly accurate (for now, anyway), but we should ask just what voters are seeking when they gravitate to outsiders, and what they\u2019re likely to get.\n\nFirst, the latest numbers. A new Marist/NBC News poll of Iowa and New Hampshire shows Donald Trump holding a healthy lead in both states, with Ben Carson coming in a strong second in Iowa and third in New Hampshire; Carson\u2019s rise is not quite as entertaining as the Trump campaign, but it\u2019s nearly as significant. Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders has cut into Hillary Clinton\u2019s lead in Iowa and moved ahead of her in New Hampshire, where the race between the two has been closer for some time now. And a new Economist/YouGov poll shows Trump moving even farther ahead nationally, with his support at 36 percent, followed by Carson at 11 percent.\n\nMost reporters have decided, based not just on poll numbers but also on their conversations with voters and the evidence they gather on the trail, that the state of the race can be explained by the American people\u2019s dissatisfaction with \u201cpolitics as usual.\u201d Fed up with Washington\u2019s gridlock and its inability to solve big problems, voters turn to outsiders who promise to do things like \u201cshake up the system\u201d and \u201cchange the way Washington does business.\u201d These candidates supposedly possess fresh ideas and new perspectives that can turn everything around.\n\nIt\u2019s hogwash. But people never seem to learn.\n\nOn the Democratic side, you can at least make a reasonable case for Bernie Sanders\u2019 brand of outsiderism. Sanders is no political neophyte \u2014 he has held public office for most of the past 35 years, which gives him an insider\u2019s understanding of how the system works. And his argument is a focused one, centered on the influence of big money and how it helps produce and sustain inequality. While tackling that problem is extremely difficult, one could at least imagine a President Sanders making some progress on it.\n\nOn the Republican side though, the two leading outsiders, Trump and Carson, have nothing so specific in mind. They argue that they\u2019ll get things done, Trump through the force of his will, and Carson because he is untainted by politics. Ask either one of them about a specific policy issue, and it quickly becomes clear that when it comes to the issues a president deals with, they\u2019re utter ignoramuses, which is perhaps understandable, if less than reassuring. I\u2019m sure Marco Rubio doesn\u2019t know much about brain surgery, which Carson knows a great deal about, but he\u2019s not running for Brain Surgeon in Chief.\n\nIf you\u2019re a voter attracted to these outsiders, you\u2019d do well to ask yourself: What, precisely, will an outsider do as president that an insider wouldn\u2019t? Would they pursue a fundamentally different set of policies? Not likely \u2014 the policies they\u2019ll pursue will by and large be those of their party. Ben Carson may be a political newcomer, but the policy positions he takes are essentially the same as those of the other Republicans. And any Republican will appoint most of the same people to the thousands of executive branch positions. When it\u2019s out of power, each party maintains what is essentially an executive branch in exile, spread among Washington think tanks and advocacy organizations, waiting to move back into government. It isn\u2019t as though the outsider candidate can fill these positions from somewhere else.\n\nAnd when it comes to things like government gridlock, you have to ask the question again: What is the outsider candidate going to do differently? Outsiders talk about things like \u201cshaking up the system\u201d and \u201cchanging the way Washington does business,\u201d but they seldom get too specific about what those things might mean in practice. What would a shaken-up system look like? For instance, would it mean that Congress would swiftly and efficiently pass a bunch of bills instead of being consumed by bickering?\n\nIf that\u2019s your idea of what the system ought to produce, then electing an outsider president isn\u2019t the way to do it. The way to do it is to give one party control of Congress and the White House, preferably with at least 60 votes in the Senate to overcome filibusters. Then you\u2019ll see the system work.\n\nPresident Obama had that for a time in his first term, and Congress was extremely productive, passing a large economic stimulus, financial reform, health-care reform and a bunch of other stuff you\u2019ve probably forgotten about by now. If you don\u2019t remember that period as one in which the system worked the way it\u2019s supposed to, it\u2019s probably because you didn\u2019t like the particular things Washington accomplished. The real problem you had wasn\u2019t with how smoothly the system operated, but with the substance of what it produced. In fact, Republicans often complain that the Affordable Care Act was \u201crammed down our throats\u201d \u2014 in other words, they think the legislation wasn\u2019t mired in gridlock for long enough (the fact that on Planet Earth it actually passed after more than a year of hearings, debates and negotiations isn\u2019t really the point).\n\nPlenty of voters say they want to get beyond partisanship and just find someone who\u2019ll \u201cget things done,\u201d but that\u2019s not what they really want. Everyone has an agenda. They want some things to get done, but not others. No conservative looked at Obama\u2019s first two years and said, \u201cI don\u2019t like his policies, but I do admire the fact that he\u2019s getting things done, so I\u2019d like him to keep going in the same direction.\u201d When George W. Bush tried and failed to privatize Social Security, no liberal said, \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that he wasn\u2019t able to get things done.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly understandable that Republicans are attracted to outsiders at this particular moment in history. As I\u2019ve noted before, the real source of discontent among GOP voters with their party\u2019s leaders is less about the rift between the establishment and the tea party than it is about the belief that the party\u2019s leaders are ineffectual. They keep promising their constituents that they\u2019ll destroy Barack Obama, repeal the Affordable Care Act and cut government down to size, but they never deliver. So when someone like Trump comes along and says he\u2019ll sweep aside every problem and make all their dreams come true, it\u2019s quite compelling, no matter how removed it is from reality.\n\nBut the truth is that voters of any persuasion don\u2019t want to shake up the system when it isn\u2019t getting things done; they want to shake it up when it isn\u2019t doing the particular things they want. Washington may not be working, but what we really care about is whether it\u2019s working for us.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How the voters are lying to themselves.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "How the voters are lying to themselves.", "title": "The outsider delusion and the fallacy of \u2018getting things done\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/07/the-outsider-delusion-and-the-fallacy-of-getting-things-done/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/15/National-Politics/Images/2015-05-17T042738Z_01_JEY955_RTRIDSP_3_USA-POLITICS-REPUBLICANS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/09/07/the-outsider-delusion-and-the-fallacy-of-getting-things-done/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc10a\"", "article_summary": "On the Republican side though, the two leading outsiders, Trump and Carson, have nothing so specific in mind.\nOutsiders talk about things like \u201cshaking up the system\u201d and \u201cchanging the way Washington does business,\u201d but they seldom get too specific about what those things might mean in practice.\nThey argue that they\u2019ll get things done, Trump through the force of his will, and Carson because he is untainted by politics.\nIf that\u2019s your idea of what the system ought to produce, then electing an outsider president isn\u2019t the way to do it.\nBut the truth is that voters of any persuasion don\u2019t want to shake up the system when it isn\u2019t getting things done; they want to shake it up when it isn\u2019t doing the particular things they want."}
