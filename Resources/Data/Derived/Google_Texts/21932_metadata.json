The change does not apply to medications for sudden infections or illnesses. The head of the Defense Health Agency will maintain and update a list of covered medications, available online or by telephone, and agency will contact eligible beneficiaries about the change, stated the rule, published on Aug. 6 in the Federal Register.\n\nThe change, mandated by the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, aims to save money for the department and TRICARE enrollees by avoiding the higher drug co-payments associated with many prescriptions medications in retail pharmacies. The department estimated that the change will save the government roughly $88 million annually, while TRICARE beneficiaries will save about $16.5 million per year because of cheaper co-payments.\n\n\u201cOn average, the government pays 32 percent less for brand name maintenance medication prescriptions filled in the mail order program or military treatment facility pharmacies than through the retail program,\u201d the interim rule said. Not all prescriptions refilled through the retail program are maintenance medications, Defense noted, but nevertheless there is \u201cpotential for significant savings\u201d by shifting a portion of those TRICARE refills out of retail. In fiscal 2014, 61 million prescriptions for TRICARE beneficiaries were filled through retail pharmacies at a cost of $5.1 billion to the government.\n\nTRICARE beneficiaries can save $44 on a 90-day supply of brand name drugs by obtaining them through the mail rather than retail pharmacies. The cost through the mail for a 90-day supply of non-generic drugs is $16 versus $20 for a 30-day supply in retail pharmacies. There are no co-payments on drugs obtained at military treatment facilities.\n\nClick here for a comparison of prescription drug costs for TRICARE beneficiaries through mail, military treatment facilities, and retail pharmacies.\n\nIn addition to exemptions to the new policy for prescription drugs for acute needs and those covered by other health insurance, other waivers will be granted in \u201cseveral circumstances,\u201d the rule said. For instance, \u201cthere is a case-by-case waiver to permit prescription maintenance medication refills at a retail pharmacy when necessary due to personal need or hardship, emergency, or other special circumstance, for example, for nursing home residents.\u201d\n\nTRICARE prescription drug co-payments reportedly have emerged as a major sticking point in negotiations between House and Senate conferees over the fiscal 2016 Defense authorization legislation. The Senate version of the bill includes provisions that would increase co-payments for certain prescription drugs, while the House bill did not include the hikes.\n\nOn Feb. 1, co-pays for many prescription drugs at retail pharmacies increased by $3. If Congress settles on an increase for fiscal 2016, it will be the third such price hike for TRICARE beneficiaries in the last four years.\n\n(Image via Robert Kneschke / Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kellie Lunney", "description": "Defense says it\\'s too expensive to fill prescriptions at retail pharmacies.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "Defense says it\\'s too expensive to fill prescriptions at retail pharmacies.", "title": "TRICARE Enrollees Soon Will Have to Refill Certain Drugs Via Mail or at Military Facilities", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/defense/2015/08/tricare-enrollees-soon-will-have-refill-certain-drugs-mail-or-military-facilities/119008/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/08/10/081015tricare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Defense says it's too expensive to fill prescriptions at retail pharmacies.", "creator": "@klunney", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/08/10/081015tricare/open-graph.jpg", "title": "TRICARE Enrollees Soon Will Have to Refill Certain Drugs Via Mail or at Military Facilities", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-10T20:15:28Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/08/10/081015tricare.jpg", "sailthru.title": "TRICARE Enrollees Soon Will Have to Refill Certain Drugs Via Mail or at Military Facilities", "keywords": "health care, military pay and benefits, tricare, health care reform, prescription drugs, military health care", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/08/10/081015tricare/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "health-care,military-pay-and-benefits,prescription-drugs,channel-defense,type-story,length-medium,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "Defense says it's too expensive to fill prescriptions at retail pharmacies."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab88\"", "article_summary": "Click here for a comparison of prescription drug costs for TRICARE beneficiaries through mail, military treatment facilities, and retail pharmacies.\nThe Senate version of the bill includes provisions that would increase co-payments for certain prescription drugs, while the House bill did not include the hikes.\nTRICARE beneficiaries can save $44 on a 90-day supply of brand name drugs by obtaining them through the mail rather than retail pharmacies.\nIf Congress settles on an increase for fiscal 2016, it will be the third such price hike for TRICARE beneficiaries in the last four years.\nOn Feb. 1, co-pays for many prescription drugs at retail pharmacies increased by $3."}
