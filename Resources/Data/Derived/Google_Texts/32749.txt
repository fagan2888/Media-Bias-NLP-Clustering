Cruz said, “We were in the midst of a bus tour, 26 counties in six days, enormous enthusiasm, but from what you look, looking at the media, it was a great field test. We would do, at pretty much every event, a press gaggle —by the way, a lot of other candidates don’t do press gaggles. I take questions all the time. Half to two thirds of the questions from the reporters would be about Donald Trump and the latest attack, the latest Tweet. When you go into the town hall, one county, 7,000 people, in one county we had 700 people. 10% of the county came out. Another town with 600 people, 150 came –”

He continued, “But here’s my point, Howie. When we do town halls and actual voters would ask questions, nobody would ask about the silly birther attack nobody would ask about Donald Trump. They ask about the real problems facing this country. How do we defeat ISIS? How do we stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons? How do we protect our Second Amendment or religious liberty? How do we get more jobs?”
