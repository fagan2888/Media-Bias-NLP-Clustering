Burwell. The issue is one of statutory construction about as difficult (i.e.., not) as the one that came before the Court in United Steelworkers of America v. Weber. The Court got it laughably wrong in Weber. The case is important as a demonstration of how easy it is do. Who cares about the meaning of words when one can invoke the spirit as a triumph of the will? Weber shows how easily the Supreme Court can defy the plain meaning of a statute, and how it can be be done again.\n\nIn the timely video below Sharyl Attkisson interviews Rich Weinstein.
