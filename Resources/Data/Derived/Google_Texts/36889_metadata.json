The Rockies would also like to apologize to longtime corporate partner King Soopers, who was not involved in the production of the jerseys. Acknowledging that many fans came to the game for the jersey, rather than disappoint them, we decided to go ahead and hand them out. We have made plans to reproduce the jersey and fans wishing to exchange will be able to do so at a future date (TBD) in September at Coors Field or the Rockies Dugout Stores. In addition, fans exchanging the jersey will receive a complimentary ticket to a future game in 2014 or 2015.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Troy Tulowitzki,uniwatch", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "The Rockies gave away 15,000 Troy Tulowitzki shirt jerseys Saturday to fans at Coors Field.
