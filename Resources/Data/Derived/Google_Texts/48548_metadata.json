Since 2012, unions have waged losing campaigns against right-to-work in Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nReich\u2019s advice? If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, ban \u2019em.\n\nRight-to-work is \u201ca backdoor to destroying unions,\u201d Reich warned, because \u201cno one pays dues, unions have no resources to organize,\u201d and workers get lower pay and benefits as a result.\n\nThis is a common refrain from union bosses, who typically continue bringing home heaps of bacon even as union membership declines.\n\nRELATED: America\u2019s top labor union bosses raked in millions in 2014\n\nReich\u2019s assistant at University of California, Berkeley, where Reich has been paid more than $700,000 over the past three academic years, did not respond to a Watchdog.org request for comment.\n\nUnion bosses were quick to promote Reich\u2019s assertion right-to-work should be banned so Americans cannot hurt themselves by opting not to pay unions.\n\nLabor coalition AFL-CIO told tens of thousands of Twitter and Facebook fans Reich\u2019s video was a \u201cMUST SEE.\u201d\n\nMUST SEE: @RBReich explains why we must \"Strengthen Unions\" http://t.co/jdkug3RY2A;
