Dr. Robert Glatter, spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians said that the Affordable Care Act will likely negatively impact emergency rooms.

“We haven’t seen the data yet, but, there’s a concern among many emergency medical personnel – physicians, nurses – that there will be an increase in the number of patients coming that are newly insured,” Glatter said.

So what can be done to improve emergency rooms? Glatter told D’Auria that emergency departments need more money and more physicians.
