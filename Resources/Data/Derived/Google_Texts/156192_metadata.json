Reporters David S. Fallis and Amy Brittain delivered the numbers along with heartbreaking details from families whose children died while in other people\u2019s care.\n\nAnd whenever I have talked to parents who are exhausted, frustrated and exasperated by the search for quality, affordable child care in the state, it\u2019s obvious that this is a crisis in Virginia.\n\nSeveral thousand people operate in this state\u2019s shadow industry. In most other places \u2014 including Maryland and the District \u2014 the moment you take care of a child in your home who is not your own, you need a license.\n\nBut in Virginia, a day-care provider can have five unrelated children before any kind of regulation or licensing is required. Advocates estimate that nearly 200,000 children in Virginia are being cared for with no oversight.\n\nSure, a small, in-home care setting with an experienced parent can be a tempting alternative to a larger facility. Phrases such as \u201chome setting\u201d and \u201cloving care\u201d and \u201cexperienced grandmother\u201d pepper Craigslist ads. And for the caregivers, an in-home day care can be a viable business with flexibility that also enables a parent to stay home with his or her own children.\n\nBut all too often, it\u2019s all about money. When you hear stories from grieving parents whose children died in these places, their fatal decision was almost always fueled by economics.\n\nFor Christina and Stephen Guralny, who were both serving their country in the Navy, the military child-care facility had a waiting list that was six months long, and they couldn\u2019t afford to put two children in the pricey place where their firstborn had been going.\n\nThat\u2019s when they found This Little Light child care, which was where their 3-month-old son was found dead on his stomach two years ago.\n\nDay care in a state-regulated facility in Virginia costs about $300 a week. But even at those prices, there are only about 364,000 slots in the state \u2014 which is half the number of kids in the state who need care.\n\nTake a look at Craigslist, and you\u2019ll find dozens of unlicensed places for as little as $75 a week.\n\nPlenty of parents have the luxury of turning down anything that doesn\u2019t feel right. But many others do not.\n\nWhen no one is watching, the results can be stomach-turning, as in the home in Bristow that had 23 kids running around the house \u2014 and one 10-month-old dying in her crib in a windowless basement that held nine other cribs. The under-the-table, illegal business was called Little Angels of the World and was described on its Web site as \u201cstate licensed.\u201d The married couple who owned it, Rocio del Pilar Chavez Pacheco and Joan Carlo Barra, received suspended sentences and probation.\n\nThe thing that\u2019s the most disgusting about the way Virginia treats the care of its children as an afterthought? This is the state where some leaders wanted to be all up in a woman\u2019s business when she\u2019s pregnant but takes a hands-off approach once her fetus is a cooing, smiling, crawling citizen of the commonwealth.\n\nState lawmakers who fought to require any woman seeking an abortion to have a government-mandated transvaginal ultrasound are silent when it comes to unregulated child care.\n\nThese caring lawmakers also put a great deal of time and energy into regulating women\u2019s health centers that provide abortions. They passed legislation in 2011 that requires these places to widen hallways, add parking spaces, update ventilation systems and more. This legislation, designed as a run-around to put abortion providers out of business, requires state resources for building inspections.\n\nBut dedicating state resources to regulate small, in-home child-care centers that can help keep families afloat and the state\u2019s economy humming? Nope. They don\u2019t want to do it.\n\nIf Virginia had decided to join the majority of the nation\u2019s states on this issue and give a fig about the way all children are cared for outside their homes, the caregiver who swaddled 1-year-old Andy Ngo might have known that could kill him; the woman who layered extra clothing, a sweatshirt and a blanket on 11-month-old Rick Alan Bodine Jr. would have been taught that overheating an infant like that would be fatal; and the caregiver who had seven children in her home and didn\u2019t have time to check on 7-month-old Finnigan Bales when he stopped breathing wouldn\u2019t have had more kids than she could handle.\n\nCaring for other people\u2019s children is a serious business, not an under-the-table, free-wheeling business, and it deserves a little more care from the state than the corner sandwich guy gets.\n\nTwitter: @petulad", "article_metadata": {"description": "Economics often leads parents to shadowy businesses that may not be what\u2019s advertised.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/petula.dvorak", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Economics often leads parents to shadowy businesses that may not be what\u2019s advertised.", "title": "Virginia\u2019s inadequate child-care regulations put its most vulnerable residents at risk", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginias-inadequate-child-care-regulations-put-its-most-vulnerable-residents-at-risk/2014/09/01/acece8dc-31f2-11e4-9e92-0899b306bbea_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/08/12/Investigative/Images/daycare1407855851.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@petulad"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "child care deaths virginia, unregulated child care in-home, Post series on child-care deaths, Post investigation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/petula.dvorak"}, "eomportal-uuid": "acece8dc-31f2-11e4-9e92-0899b306bbea", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "child care deaths virginia, unregulated child care in-home, Post series on child-care deaths, Post investigation"}, "article_summary": "Sure, a small, in-home care setting with an experienced parent can be a tempting alternative to a larger facility.\nThat\u2019s when they found This Little Light child care, which was where their 3-month-old son was found dead on his stomach two years ago.\nBut dedicating state resources to regulate small, in-home child-care centers that can help keep families afloat and the state\u2019s economy humming?\nState lawmakers who fought to require any woman seeking an abortion to have a government-mandated transvaginal ultrasound are silent when it comes to unregulated child care.\nThis legislation, designed as a run-around to put abortion providers out of business, requires state resources for building inspections."}
