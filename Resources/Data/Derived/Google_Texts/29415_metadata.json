Most of those people qualified for the federal subsidies available to people who are not offered affordable health benefits through an employer and who have household incomes below a certain threshold.\n\nSecurity Health, an affiliate of Marshfield Clinic, has seen the market for health plans sold to individuals and families increase by about 20% since the launch of the federal marketplaces, Anderson said.\n\nNationwide, about 11.4 million people bought or were re-enrolled in health plans sold on the federal or state marketplaces.\n\nIn a teleconference, Kevin Counihan, chief executive officer of the Affordable Care Act Marketplace, said enrollment showed strong growth in the second year.\n\n\"No one is waving a flag of victory,\" Counihan said. \"But we are very pleased with how things went and are looking forward to doing better next year.\"\n\nNumerous features could be added to the marketplace to make it easier for people to compare health plans,.\n\n\"All kinds of opportunities for us to do better,\" he said.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services won't know until later this year how many people who previously were uninsured signed up for coverage this open-enrollment period.\n\nBy one estimate, the number of people 18-65 who were uninsured dropped by 5 percentage points last year.\n\n\"We know that last year it made a major dent,\" Counihan said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Almost 206,000 Wisconsin residents enrolled in Obamacare", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/almost-206000-wisconsin-residents-enrolled-in-obamacare-b99447763z1-292447291.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Almost 206,0000 people in Wisconsin signed up or were re-enrolled in health plans sold on the marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act during the second open-enrollment period.", "title": "Almost 206,000 Wisconsin residents enrolled in Obamacare"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "Almost 206,0000 people in Wisconsin signed up or were re-enrolled in health plans sold on the marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act during the second open-enrollment period.", "site": "@journalsentinel", "card": "summary", "title": "Almost 206,000 Wisconsin residents enrolled in Obamacare"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ff4\"", "article_summary": "Nationwide, about 11.4 million people bought or were re-enrolled in health plans sold on the federal or state marketplaces.\nAbout 85% of the people covered by the company's health plans sold to individuals and families bought their plans through the marketplace, Anderson said.\nStatewide enrollment was in line with Security Health Plan's projections, said Marty Anderson, director of consumer marketing for the health insurance company.\nNumerous features could be added to the marketplace to make it easier for people to compare health plans,.\nSecurity Health, an affiliate of Marshfield Clinic, has seen the market for health plans sold to individuals and families increase by about 20% since the launch of the federal marketplaces, Anderson said."}
