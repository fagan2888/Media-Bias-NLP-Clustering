Prosecutors have argued that Behenna killed the man by shooting him in the head, execution style. Behenna says he shot in self-defense.

Behenna's family has stood by him and now says he has won parole and will be released from Fort Leavenworth on March 14.

Governor Mary Fallin learned about Behenna's parole Wednesday morning and released the following statement:

"I am glad this long ordeal has finally come to an end for Michael Behenna and his family. Michael went to Iraq to serve his nation and to defend liberty both here and abroad. Instead, he found himself mourning the loss of his friends from the inside of a cell. I believe the Army acted appropriately and compassionately in offering him parole." - Gov. Mary Fallin.
