However, going back to school can often be a difficult transition, according to an article from U.S. News & World Report.\n\nOne of the biggest transitions is monetary. Business workers who return to school will not keep the same amount of money they were previously making.\n\nCollege students must also balance work life with the grind of academics. That includes tests, presentations and papers. \u201cGetting back into study mode can be quite a challenge,\u201d Deborah Knox, an MBA admissions consultant, told U.S. News & World Report.\n\nThere are other areas that the report said could be of concern for business graduate students.\n\nTime management. Many students earning their Master of Business Administration degree find themselves having to balance already established work and family life with the rigors of being a graduate student. These can include group projects where meetings and deadlines are not flexible and must be integrated with existing schedules. \u2018There\u2019s just a lot going on. For two years you\u2019re just constantly going,\u201d Fitswa Baffour, who pursued her MBA at the Stern School of Business at New York University, told U.S. News & World Report.\n\nSelf-direction. Unlike the direction given at work, or even in their home life, graduate students in business school must design their own path to success. MBA Prep School founder Tyler Cormney told U.S. News & World Report that students should enter school with a clear plan on what they want to do during their two years in school, down even to what clubs they want to join.\n\nSocial interests. A strong social life \u2013 a connection to the larger business community \u2013 is emphasized at most business schools, meaning that students need to make time for networking with others, joining student clubs and attending business community and recruitment events.\n\nSkills. The final area is perhaps one of the toughest \u2013 honing the bread-and-butter skills needed to be a business leader. Two areas many identify as being problematic are finance and accounting. Jeremy Grace, who works in the MBA program at Rice University, suggested to U.S. News that students could refresh these basic skills by taking a class at a community college or online.\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\nPlease Leave A Comment\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Going back to school can often be a difficult transition.
