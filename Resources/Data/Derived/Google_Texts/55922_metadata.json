He did praise the NHS, which is a source of national pride for many Britons.\n\n\u201cThe NHS is superb and I\u2019ve seen that in my own life in so many different ways,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I believe in choice. I believe in people being able to do what they want to do.\u201d He said he is praying for a safe delivery of the royal baby.\n\nThe NHS, founded in 1948, has become a political issue during the hard fought campaign, with Cameron\u2019s opponents saying he wouldn\u2019t adequately fund it in the coming years if voters return him to 10 Downing Street on May 7.\n\nTerry Hutt poses for the media with a sign that reads \u201cNot ... more >\n\nBritain has a hybrid system: Those with the financial resources to pay for private medical care have the option of seeking treatment under the NHS, which is often free of charge, or through private doctors and clinics.\n\nPatients who choose private care can more easily schedule medical procedures at a time of their choosing and can often avoid crowded hospital wards by paying for private or semi-private rooms.\n\nWilliam and Kate are planning to have their second child at the private Lindo Wing, which is connected to St. Mary\u2019s, a public hospital.\n\nTheir first child, Prince George, was born at the Lindo Wing nearly two years ago. The wing has a separate entrance from the rest of the hospital, making it easier to provide security and a measure of privacy to the couple, who may receive visits from Queen Elizabeth II and other senior royals.\n\nThe public part of the hospital has seen a surgical ward closed to new admissions for the last 11 days because eight patients were found to be carrying a potentially dangerous microorganism.\n\nThe hospital said in a statement Sunday that three of these patients developed infections and have since recovered after treatment with antibiotics. The hospital said a \u201cdeep cleaning\u201d of the ward is underway and enhanced screening is being put in place.\n\nPalace officials have said the baby is due in late April. News reporters, cameramen and some royal fans have already gathered outside the Lindo Wing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Britain's general election fast approaching, almost anything can become political \u2014 even Prince William and his wife Kate's choice of private medical care for the upcoming birth of their second child.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With Britain\u2019s general election fast approaching, almost anything can become political \u2014 even Prince William and his wife Kate\u2019s choice of private medical care for the upcoming birth of their second child.", "title": "David Cameron defends royals\u2019 right to choose birth hospital", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/26/uks-cameron-defends-royals-right-to-choose-birth-h/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/16/Britain_Royal_Baby_5_Things.JPEG-0c85f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/16/Britain_Royal_Baby_5_Things.JPEG-0c85f.jpg", "description": "With Britain's general election fast approaching, almost anything can become political \u2014 even Prince William and his wife Kate's choice of private medical care for the upcoming birth of their second c", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "David Cameron defends royals\u2019 right to choose birth hospital"}, "Author": "Gregory Katz", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "David Cameron, National Health Service, Kate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c80\"", "article_summary": "Prime Minister David Cameron on Sunday defended the royal couple\u2019s choice of private treatment over public care offered by the National Health Service.\nWilliam and Kate are planning to have their second child at the private Lindo Wing, which is connected to St. Mary\u2019s, a public hospital.\nAsked on TV if the royal couple\u2019s decision was disappointing, Cameron said he supports peoples\u2019 right to choose treatment options.\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 With Britain\u2019s general election fast approaching, almost anything can become political \u2014 even Prince William and his wife Kate\u2019s choice of private medical care for the upcoming birth of their second child.\nTheir first child, Prince George, was born at the Lindo Wing nearly two years ago."}
