Loveland police are looking for a man who apparently took a selfie with an iPad that was taken during a burglary more than a week ago.

The iPad and several other items were taken from Premier Gymnastics on East 11th Street on March 1.

On Saturday, a picture of a dark-haired, bearded man with a cigarette clamped in his mouth appeared in Premier’s business iCloud account. Police believe the picture was a selfie taken with the stolen iPad.

“The investigating officer would like to talk to this man to find out what he knows about the burglary and the stolen items,” according to a police release.

Anyone with information about the man in the picture can call Officer Katey McDonald, 970-962-2052, xt 1147.
