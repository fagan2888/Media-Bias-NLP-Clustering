If they dropped health care coverage in its entirety, there would be a $2,000 \u201cfine\u201d per year, for each full-time employee.\n\nAlthough the birth control coverage was built into health insurance coverage, meaning the religious organizations were not paying directly for contraception, many religious groups, specifically Catholic organizations said that they felt they were being asked to violate their religious beliefs or would have to pay \u201cpotentially crippling fines,\u201d which the Supreme Court ruled were really just taxes.\n\nOne group in particular that felt the birth control mandate was a violation of their rights was a group of Catholic nuns in Denver known as the Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged. The group said it didn\u2019t want to provide contraception since it violated the rules of its faith, but said it couldn\u2019t afford the \u201cdraconian\u201d fines either.\n\nAlthough 82 percent of Catholics and 89 percent of Americans overall believe use of contraception is morally acceptable, on Dec. 31, the day before the ACA law went into effect, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a temporary exemption to law for the Colorado nuns.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, also issued an emergency exemption for Catholic-affiliated groups such as the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., and Catholic University.\n\n\n\nBalancing religion and human rights\n\nThough the Obama administration has tried to respect the beliefs of religious organizations in the U.S., and the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a series of appeals in March on whether corporations should have to abide by the contraceptive mandate if it violates the owner\u2019s religious beliefs as well.\n\nThe religious exemptions will also be discussed at that time as well.\n\nBut as the court prepares to debate the contraception mandate, some are wondering if the religious interpretation of a law designed to guarantee preventative health services to millions of women in the U.S. is a slippery slope?\n\nDays after news of the Sotomayor exemption was announced, Politico political cartoonist Matt Wuerker created a piece that hypothesized what may happen if an employer\u2019s religion was used to determine what kind of health insurance their employees received.\n\nFor example, one of the character\u2019s in Wuerker\u2019s cartoon said that because her boss was a celibate Shaker, no sex-related health issues would be covered. Another said that since his employer was a vegan Jainist, nothing related to eating meat was covered, and the last character said that under her employer\u2019s plan, doctors were not covered at all because her boss is a Christian Scientist.\n\nWith eight in 10 people around the world identifying themselves as part of a religious group, and conservative forms of major faiths \u2014 Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism \u2014 becoming \u201cincreasingly prominent and politically salient,\u201d Stephen Hopgood, an associate professor of international relations at SOAS, University of London, says that we\u2019ve begun to see the end of human rights.\n\nThough Hopgood blames authoritarian governments first and foremost for the lack of human rights around the globe, he says that governments that once \u201csought a moral alternative to religious faith\u201d are now becoming \u201cmore intense\u201d in their religiosity. In other words, the more religious freedoms we have, the fewer human rights we are awarded.\n\n\u201cThe language of human rights is a language of protest and resistance, not of authority and discrimination,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a religious world, secular human rights of recent heritage and ambiguous origin increasingly compete with long-standing cultural claims legitimated by traditions and gods. Where strong faith meets human rights, the classic modernizing assumption \u2014 that secular rights trump religion \u2014 no longer holds.\u201d\n\n\n\nAre religious exceptions the beginning of the end for human rights?\n\nHopgood warned readers in a Washington Post OpEd that if the world wants to see progress in civil and political rights, persons in certain parts of the world may have to secede ground in other areas such as social justice and women\u2019s rights.\n\nDeborah Orr, a columnist with the U.K. publication The Guardian, agreed with Hopgood, and said that history has proven religious freedom is tied to the decline in human rights, saying \u201ccommon rights flourished in Britain at a time when religious belief was in decline.\n\n\u201cFor human rights to flourish, religious rights have to come second to them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are all human. We are not all of the same religion, or religious at all. One cannot protect religious rights if they are used as a reason to abuse human rights, human equalities, as so often they are \u2026 People need to answer on Earth to our fellow humans. We can square things with our God, if we have one, when and if that day arrives.\u201d\n\nShe added that while human rights are often mocked as imaginary, such as how can a baby, born of nature, have inherent \u2018rights,\u2019 any more than a newborn rabbit? Human rights are not imaginary, but are instead conceptual.\n\n\u201cThey rest on a single idea,\u201d she said, \u201cthat all humans have a common need for certain conditions if they are to flourish as productive members of society, and that all humans have a responsibility to ensure that everyone attains and maintains those rights.\u201d\n\nIn a joint discussion on the politics of social justice, Heiner Bielefeldt, a professor of political ethics, legal philosophy and philosophy of religion, said that though human dignity is an old idea found in the Bible and Quran, the idea that human rights would be enforceable and something all people are equally entitled to, is new.\n\n\u201cReligious traditions have incorporated a deep yearning for social justice that can inspire the debates of today,\u201d he said, but in reality, \u201creligious communities have not always supported democracy and human rights.\n\n\u201cMy own church, the Roman Catholic Church, was long opposed to human rights in general and religious liberty in particular,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was only in the 1960s that the Catholic Church officially endorsed human rights and religious liberty. This shows that religious communities are part of society and have to undergo the same learning processes that society as a whole has to tackle.\u201d\n\nAnd in the case of Islam, Bielefeldt said \u201cmany Muslims have found ways to reconcile the requirements of religion with a commitment to democracy and human rights.\u201d\n\nHowever, he added that the fact that there are still issues between democracy, human rights and religion, illustrates that some serious questions \u201chave not yet been solved satisfactorily.\u201d\n\nWhether the U.S. government will work to preserve human rights at the cost of some Americans\u2019 religious beliefs remains to be seen. But one thing that is certain is that this debate is far from over.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some cite the religious fight against Obamacare as proof the rule of law may not be as all encompassing or protective of human rights as first thought.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Some cite the religious fight against Obamacare as proof the rule of law may not be as all encompassing or protective of human rights as first thought.", "title": "Dogma Days: Religion Encroaching On Human Rights", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/dogma-days-religion-encroaching-on-human-rights/177477/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Vatican-Pope_Muha.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-01-23T07:32:48-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some cite the religious fight against Obamacare as proof the rule of law may not be as all encompassing or protective of human rights as first thought.", "creator": "@katierucke", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Vatican-Pope_Muha.jpg", "title": "Dogma Days: Religion Encroaching On Human Rights", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: Inside Stories", "tag": "Tad Stahnke", "published_time": "2014-01-22T05:00:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-23T07:32:48-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42e0\"", "article_summary": "Tad Stahnke, director of policy and programs at Human Rights First, told MintPress that blaming religion for a decline in human rights may be a stretch, since religion can be a powerful source to protect human rights \u2014 bringing a sense of justice, fairness and dignity to policies.\nWhere strong faith meets human rights, the classic modernizing assumption \u2014 that secular rights trump religion \u2014 no longer holds.\u201dAre religious exceptions the beginning of the end for human rights?\nOne cannot protect religious rights if they are used as a reason to abuse human rights, human equalities, as so often they are \u2026 People need to answer on Earth to our fellow humans.\n\u201cFor human rights to flourish, religious rights have to come second to them,\u201d she said.\nIs religion affecting our ability to ensure every man, woman and child is afforded their basic human rights?"}
