But even under the new law, Hughes said her care providers had advised her not to enroll in the federal health care exchange yet. It is unclear, they said, how the law will affect HIV care when marketplace coverage begins Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cRight now we get good care, and I\u2019m not interested in having my stuff all shifted around,\u201d she said from her Houston home.\n\nHughes and her husband, Daniel, also HIV positive, receive some health coverage under the Ryan White Care Act, a federal health care program for HIV and AIDS patients. Community advocates expected the Affordable Care Act to provide nearly universal health coverage for HIV patients, freeing up funding from the Ryan White program to cover services beyond primary care.\n\nBut many HIV patients in Texas live below the poverty line and are therefore ineligible for subsidies on the exchange. Add Texas\u2019 decision not to expand Medicaid to cover poor adults, and the bulk of low-income HIV patients are missing out on expanded health coverage.\n\nDena and Daniel Hughes, who have four dependent children, recently started a home repair business and do not know how much they will earn next year.\n\nThe stakes are high. If their income is below $31,590 \u2014 the requirement for a family of six to receive tax subsidies on the federal exchange \u2014 they will rank among the thousands of HIV-positive Texans whose incomes are too low for subsidized private insurance but too high for Medicaid. Roughly 14,000 Texans with HIV used assistance from the Ryan White program to pay for antiretroviral medication in 2011, while nearly 19,000 were not receiving any HIV-related medical care, according to the Department of State Health Services.\n\nDaniel Hughes receives medical care at Legacy Community Health Services, a federally qualified health center in Houston. Katy Caldwell, its executive director, said she had struggled to advise HIV patients about the marketplace with certainty that their health plans would cover all their medications. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people on some complicated drug regimens that you want to make sure people stay on, and it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds,\u201d she said.\n\nReferring to patients living below the poverty line, she added, \u201cOne of the hard things to explain to people is you\u2019re actually too poor to get help.\u201d At Legacy, 58 percent of patients are uninsured.\n\nTexas\u2019 Medicaid eligibility requirements are among the country\u2019s strictest. For a family of six, adults without a disability must earn less than $4,608 per year to qualify for coverage.\n\nBut Gov. Rick Perry has adamantly opposed Medicaid expansion, citing worries about the program\u2019s efficiency.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that Medicaid is a broken system in need of fundamental reform,\u201d Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman Perry, said in an email. She added that \u201cTexas has a proven history of providing services and effective HIV medications to HIV-positive Texans through the HIV-STD Program and the Texas HIV Medication Program.\u201d\n\nKatherine Record, a senior fellow at Harvard Law School\u2019s Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation, directed a project that modeled how health reform would affect HIV patients in Texas. She found that roughly 65 percent of Texans who received assistance from the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, a Ryan White program, would be eligible for Medicaid under the expansion.\n\nBy comparison, \u201cPre-ACA, you could only qualify for Medicaid if you proved you were disabled, which pretty much meant having your HIV progress to full-blown AIDS,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Santiago Estrada, a 53-year-old patient in Abilene, AIDS allowed him to enroll in Medicare, which covers his antiretroviral medication. He said the drugs alone would have cost him $2,000 per month out of pocket.\n\nEstrada visits the Big Country AIDS Resources center in Abilene for care. He says the \u201cwraparound\u201d services the center provides with Ryan White funding, like assistance with nutrition and transportation, are paramount for his well-being.\n\nBetty Sims, the center\u2019s executive director, says the Affordable Care Act could mean big changes for many of her clients\u2019 access to coverage. But for the 48 percent of her clients who live below the federal poverty line, most have never qualified for Medicaid \u201cand are really left out in the cold,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvocates say demand for transportation services ranks highly among the wraparound benefits that Ryan White money could assist with, if more HIV patients had primary care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. For Sims\u2019 clinic and others that serve large rural populations, patients\u2019 lack of access to a vehicle is a significant obstacle to HIV care. \u201cThere\u2019s only one infectious disease specialist in the 19 counties we serve,\u201d Sims said. The center has partnered with infectious disease physicians at Texas Tech University to consult with patients electronically.\n\n\u201cThe Ryan White services that we provide are going to continue to be needed here no matter whether people have access to insurance or not,\u201d Sims said.\n\nOne way states have sought to make the most of their Ryan White money under the new health law is to use the AIDS Drug Assistance Program funds to pay for HIV patients\u2019 insurance premiums, rather than purchasing expensive drugs directly. Because the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover pre-existing conditions like HIV, \u201cin almost every case now it will be cost-effective\u201d to spend the money on HIV patients\u2019 insurance premiums, even if they do not qualify for subsidies, said Ann Lefert, director of policy and health care access at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors.\n\nChristine Mann, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said the agency was looking into such a measure.\n\nMany advocates expect Texas to expand its Medicaid program eventually. But in the meantime, Ryan White funding will continue to shoulder primary care costs for the majority of impoverished Texans with HIV.\n\n\u201cThey call it payer of last resort,\u201d Dena Hughes said of that coverage. \u201cBut for some people, it\u2019s the payer of first hope.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many HIV patients in Texas are ineligible for subsidies on the new federal health care exchange.
