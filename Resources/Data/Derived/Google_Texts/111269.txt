People in the construction trades had a chance to apply for jobs at the Second Annual Construction Careers job fair.

The job fair at the National Center for Aviation training on N. Webb road had hundreds of job seekers.

The Vice President Joe Ontjes for the Wichita area Technical college, which was hosting the job fair, said there are a variety of jobs out there.

"Today we have more than 30 construction companies, hiring managers here to interview hundreds of job seekers for great construction jobs at all levels from entry level labor all the way up to superintendents and site managers."

For the companies it's a chance to tap into a labor force eager to work. Jason Gillig is a project manager for Hutton Construction.

"Just looking for good candidates who are willing to work hard, learn and grow and benefit not just us but the industry in general", Gillig said.

The career fair was a good chance for those in attendance to mingle even for people like Matt Hockett who already had a job in the construction industry.

"Having all the companies that are here in one central location is a great opportunity to network, to put faces to names and just kind of branch out and see what opportunities are in the area," Hockett told KAKE.

The fair ran from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday and will benefit the growth of Wichita due to construction companies gaining more employees to work on projects.
