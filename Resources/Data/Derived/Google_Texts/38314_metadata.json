Companies could charge more for faster delivery. Today was the last day for comments. The issue may sound arcane, but it has apparently struck a chord. More than three million comments have been registered at the FCC. That\u2019s so far.\n\nHari Sreenivasan, in our New York studios, turns to a well-known tech writer and columnist to find out why.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Joining me now is David Pogue, founder of Yahoo Tech.\n\nSo, I know you have done this with sock puppets before, but imagine if you could without the sock puppets, the net neutrality debate. What is it?\n\nDAVID POGUE, Yahoo Tech: Well, net neutrality is this principle, very complicated, very legal, that all Internet traffic should be un \u2014 should be equivalent.\n\nSo, it shouldn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re Netflix or whether you\u2019re some startup. The carriers of your Internet signal, Comcast, Verizon, and so on, should treat it all the same, just in the same way they wouldn\u2019t presume to decide what you can say on your phone call or bill them differently.\n\nSo, since the beginning of the Internet, this is how it\u2019s worked. All Internet traffic is treated and charged the same.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: That\u2019s the status quo.\n\nDAVID POGUE: That\u2019s the status quo.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And the proposed rules would do what?\n\nDAVID POGUE: So, the cable companies and, like, Verizon and Comcast, they are saying, well, wait a minute, Netflix is responsible of 30 percent of all data going on our pipes. Shouldn\u2019t they pay more?\n\nSo, they \u2014 so the FCC has now said, OK, OK, OK, here\u2019s the thing. There are no current rules specifying whether or not there\u2019s net neutrality. It\u2019s just always been. So let\u2019s put some laws down. And we\u2019re going to say is, yes, in general, we\u2019re in favor of all Internet traffic being treated equally.\n\nHowever, you, the Verizons and Comcasts, it\u2019s OK with you to make side deals with the biggest Internet service providers like Netflix and YouTube and to charge them more for the right to have their data go stutter-free and faster. They want to create a faster lane for Internet companies who want to pay more.\n\nAnd that\u2019s very upsetting to many consumer groups, who are saying, well, what that means is, A, we\u2019re going to pay more on our end, the consumers, and, B, what about little interesting startup companies, the next Facebook, the next Twitter? They don\u2019t have the big bucks to pay for the fast lane. You\u2019re going to stifle those startups.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: OK. And so the Verizons of the world are saying what? No, actually, these are the costs that we need to have to make sure the infrastructure survives?\n\nDAVID POGUE: The Verizons are saying, dudes, we\u2019re building out for the next generation. We\u2019re building better towers, faster pipes. We need money, which they really don\u2019t. Verizon\u2019s profit last year was $11 billion. Comcast\u2019s was $8 billion or so.\n\nSo they\u2019re doing just fine. The really interesting thing is we were this close to having net neutrality written into law. So, in 2010, the FCC said, OK, guys, net neutrality, here\u2019s the law. And a district court threw it out, not because they didn\u2019t believe in the principle, but because the FCC itself \u2014 this is where it gets complicated, so I speak slowly.\n\nThe FCC itself years before that had classified Internet providers like Verizon, not as utilities like phone companies, but instead as an information service, like a TV studio or something. Therefore, the court said, so it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t believe in your rule. It\u2019s, you don\u2019t have the jurisdiction to govern them.\n\nYou yourself classified them as not a utility where you would be able to govern them, but as an information service. It\u2019s not your business.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: OK. So if these rules were to change, what\u2019s an example of something that would be different for Joe consumer?\n\nDAVID POGUE: It\u2019s already begun.\n\nSo, Netflix is now paying Comcast, not because it had to, but because it wanted to, for faster delivery, stutter-free delivery of Netflix videos. Netflix didn\u2019t like doing this, but the data showed that Netflix streams were getting slower and slower and slower to people, so they felt they had to.\n\nSo, inevitably, what the answer is higher prices. It\u2019s going to mean we pay more, if these deals, if this FCC rule is permitted to go through.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And there\u2019s also this concern now that some of these people, like Comcast, for example, also own content creators, so they could maybe favor one over another?\n\nDAVID POGUE: This is where it gets even more complicated.\n\nYes, Comcast owns NBC, so what\u2019s to stop Comcast from helping NBC\u2019s signal get through faster and stutter-free and maybe slowing down PBS\u2019 just a little bit?\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Now, that said, Tom Wheeler, the head of the FCC, has said, no, I\u2019m telling you, that is not going to happen. We\u2019re going to write that into the rules. Right?\n\nDAVID POGUE: Right.\n\nSo, Tom Wheeler is the new head of FCC. He is in the guy in charge of writing this stuff. He\u2019s the guy \u2014 this is a big perception problem \u2014 he spent 30 years before this job as chief lobbyist for the telecommunications and cable companies. It\u2019s the fox guarding the henhouse. Or at least that\u2019s how it\u2019s perceived.\n\nBut, yes, he says, no, no, no, no, that\u2019s not going to happen, we promise. We\u2019re for an open Internet, he says. So his argument is we have put this clause in, as long as it\u2019s commercially \u2014 commercially reasonable, these side deals will be permitted, commercially reasonable. But we won\u2019t let anything bad happen, he\u2019s saying. So he\u2019s asking us to trust them.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, during this open comment period, it has been amazing to see hundreds of thousands of e-mails, comments, phone calls to Congress.\n\nAre you surprised? This is a relatively, as you said, kind of a wonkish technology corner.\n\nDAVID POGUE: Part of the problem is that it\u2019s very complicated. It\u2019s very legal, it\u2019s wording, it\u2019s a long history. It\u2019s the way the government works behind the scene suddenly being thrust into the faces of the public.\n\nSo there\u2019s a bad guys/good guys picture that is being painted here. It\u2019s more nuanced than that and it\u2019s more complicated than that. So, Tom Wheeler is not saying you\u2019re going to pay more and the cable companies win. It\u2019s not that simple. But that is how it\u2019s being reduced, right? It\u2019s being reduced to a black hat/white hat situation. It\u2019s more complicated.\n\nI bet many of the people commenting at FCC.gov don\u2019t fully understand the history, the business about classification as a utility, all that stuff. But at center, I can say for sure that if the FCC\u2019s rules go through as proposed, we will wind up paying more, and, yes, the little interesting Internet startup companies will need more money to get into those fast lanes.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, David Pogue of Yahoo Tech, thanks much.\n\nDAVID POGUE: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Net neutrality is the idea that all Internet content should be treated equally in how it\u2019s delivered to consumers -- a concept that is being debated at the Federal Communications Commission.
