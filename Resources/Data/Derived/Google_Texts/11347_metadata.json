It\u2019s this part of the faucet that may be a gathering place for bacteria, the study\u2019s authors note. \u201cAerators are a reservoir for drug-resistant bacteria and a source of infection for patients at risk,\u201d Marisa Luisa Cristina, a lead author of the study, said in a press release. \u201cSafe water is vital to ensuring patient safety where waterborne infections increase morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, compensation claims and prolong hospital stays.\u201d\n\nResearchers from the University of Genova in Italy studied water samples at two hospitals for a year. They tested both cold and hot water from faucets used for hand washing, surgical washing, and washing medical equipment \u2014 and reviewed the growth of bacteria at the faucet head as well as deeper within the water system. They found that the amount of bacteria present in water was 10 times greater when aerators were present, than after they\u2019d been sterilized. The researchers also noted that chlorine levels were often too low, and identified problems with hot water temperatures that were too low to prevent the growth of the bacteria Legionella.\n\nHospital-acquired infections, often referred to as HAI \u2014 or nosocomial infections in medical literature \u2014 have become a serious public health issue in the U.S., and remain a major financial burden on the medical system. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the cost of HAIs in the medical world range between $28.4 to $33.8 billion per year.\n\nThe CDC states that HAIs are often caused by medical devices that are inserted into the body, such as catheters or ventilators. A common form of HAI is a central line-associated bloodstream infection, which occurs when bacteria enter the body through the opening of a central line tube. On top of that, surgical site infections, or infections that occur at the places where the body was cut open for surgery, are another issue. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospital-acquired infections affect hundreds of millions of people per year. Out of every 100 patients in the hospital in developed countries, seven will acquire at least one infection.\n\nHospital infections acquired from contaminated water has also been a common concern for years. \u201cHospitals tend to have large, complex waterworks with low-flow areas that produce stagnation and biofilm formation,\u201d Dr. Tara Palmore said in a commentary that was published alongside the study. \u201c[H]ot and cold water temperatures that are not well regulated may be ideal for bacterial growth\u2026the [study] is valuable in quantifying the frequency, magnitude, and location of the potential hazard to patients from hospital water in their facilities.\" But while tainted hospital tap water may indeed seem scary, it's not as common as other sources of hospital-acquired infections. The most common is actually urinary tract infection, the WHO states.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hospital acquired infection, nosocomial infection, tap water bacteria", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers discovered that tap water flowing through aerators in faucets could actually be contaminated with bacteria, posing a risk for immunocompromised patients.", "title": "Hospital Tap Water Contaminated With Bacteria", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hospital-tap-water-contaminated-bacteria-how-safe-are-you-hospital-acquired-infections-267584", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/21/washing-hands.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers discovered that tap water flowing through aerators in faucets could actually be contaminated with bacteria, posing a risk for immunocompromised patients.", "title": "Hospital Tap Water Contaminated With Bacteria", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/hospital-tap-water-contaminated-bacteria-how-safe-are-you-hospital-acquired-infections-267584", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/21/washing-hands.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/21/washing-hands.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-21T19:13:57-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-21T19:31:43-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers discovered that tap water flowing through aerators in faucets could actually be contaminated with bacteria, posing a risk for immunocompromised patients."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d19\"", "article_summary": "But while tainted hospital tap water may indeed seem scary, it's not as common as other sources of hospital-acquired infections.\nHospital infections acquired from contaminated water has also been a common concern for years.\nA new study published in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology has found that hospital tap water may be filled with bacteria, especially among faucet taps with aerators, while water found deeper in the plumbing system is actually safer.\nOn top of that, surgical site infections, or infections that occur at the places where the body was cut open for surgery, are another issue.\nThey found that the amount of bacteria present in water was 10 times greater when aerators were present, than after they\u2019d been sterilized."}
