He plans to expand his business model into the Atlanta market, starting with a Centennial Park site within the next several months.\n\nHe also owns Chatham Neurology, two veterinary hospitals \u2014 one on Tybee Island and Savannah Animal Care in downtown Savannah \u2014 and plans to open a third on Whitemarsh Island next to Wal-Mart.\n\nHe is not above stopping in the middle of the night to rescue a lost dog on the highway, then keeping it until he can locate the owner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been an animal person my whole life,\u201d Williams said, adding that he has owned more than 100 dogs in his lifetime.\n\nWilliams, who sports long hair and cowboy boots, becomes emotional when recounting his friendship with a homeless man he challenged to escape that\n\nworld and gain a voice others would listen to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid to show my emotions,\u201d Williams said just days after he delivered the eulogy for advocate for the homeless Marvin Heery, who once was homeless himself. \u201cHe was a barometer for the community and it breaks my heart.\u201d\n\nBut Williams is a pragmatist, too.\n\nHis efforts to expand his Urgent Care sites are a reaction to \u201cfilling a niche that needs to be filled\u201d as the result of the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.\n\nHe considers that law to be fatally flawed and poorly implemented, freezing out the people it was designed to help. He said he foresaw the problems three years in advance and reacted.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go into medicine because of money,\u201d he said, adding he has had bad experiences with insurance companies and does not accept insurance payments for his services.\n\nHe prides himself on the service delivery model from his Urgent Care sites.\n\n\u201cPeople are willing to pay for good service,\u201d he said.\u201dWe trying to convey to people we really do care.\u201d\n\nNor is he concerned about how people react to his off-stereotype appearance.\n\nHe said he\u2019s worn cowboy boots \u201cmy whole life,\u201d since age 3.\n\nLikewise, his hair fills a need.\n\nHe works with Locks for Love, a Florida-based non profit that provides hairpieces for financially disadvantaged children suffering from long-term medical hair loss. Williams cuts and sends his own hair for hairpieces in that effort.\n\n\u201cI grow my hair for sick kids,\u201d Williams said, adding he became hooked by the plight of a 6-year-old girl who needed just that to help restore her self-esteem.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "32.083541;-81.099834", "news_keywords": "savannah, georgia, news press, hilton head, south carolina, newspaper, historic district, classifieds, savannah morning news, news, entertainment, local businesses, shopping, midnight, mci heritage, st. patricks day, city guide, savannah area resources", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "Copyright Savannah Morning News, Morris Publishing Group", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/profiles/msms/themes/published/device-icons/widetile.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://savannahnow.com/accent/2014-08-17/savannah-doctor-chooses-his-own-way-confront-lifes-challenges", "title": "Savannah doctor chooses his own way to confront life's challenges", "description": "Dr. Jerry Williams Jr.", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": {"identifier": "@savannahnow", "id": 9164672}}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/profiles/msms/themes/published/device-icons/smalltile.png", "robots": "value", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/profiles/msms/themes/published/device-icons/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "savannahnow.com", "title": "Savannah doctor chooses his own way to confront life's challenges", "url": "http://savannahnow.com/accent/2014-08-17/savannah-doctor-chooses-his-own-way-confront-lifes-challenges", "image": "http://savannahnow.com/sites/default/files/13599757.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-02T10:12:51-04:00", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimized": "width", "__sync_contentCategory": "metered", "keywords": "savannah, georgia, news press, hilton head, south carolina, newspaper, historic district, classifieds, savannah morning news, news, entertainment, local businesses, shopping, midnight, mci heritage, st. patricks day, city guide, savannah area resources", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/profiles/msms/themes/published/device-icons/mediumtile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 1575785529334435}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "He prides himself on the service delivery model from his Urgent Care sites.\nHe also owns Chatham Neurology, two veterinary hospitals \u2014 one on Tybee Island and Savannah Animal Care in downtown Savannah \u2014 and plans to open a third on Whitemarsh Island next to Wal-Mart.\nHis efforts to expand his Urgent Care sites are a reaction to \u201cfilling a niche that needs to be filled\u201d as the result of the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been an animal person my whole life,\u201d Williams said, adding that he has owned more than 100 dogs in his lifetime.\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve never hunted anything I\u2019m not going to eat.\u201dWilliams has opened five 24/7 Urgent Care sites in Chatham County with plans to open at least two more."}
