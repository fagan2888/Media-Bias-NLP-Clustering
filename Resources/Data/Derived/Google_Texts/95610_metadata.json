The absence of a new grant means the elimination of four jobs at Primaris, including program director Jeremy Milarsky, who was named 2014 Health Advocate of the Year in June by the Missouri Health Advocacy Alliance.\n\n\u201cThis is the nature of government grant-funded work,\u201d Milarsky said this morning. \u201cWe thought we had a strong proposal,\u201d but \u201cwe knew this was a possibility.\u201d\n\nPrimaris will have four staff members working as enrollment counselors under a grant from the Missouri Foundation for Health. Other local agencies with enrollment counseling funded by the foundation include Central Missouri Community Action and the Family Health Center.\n\nThe list of 2014 navigator grantees for Missouri includes Missouri Association of Area Agencies On Aging, or MA4, which includes Central Missouri Area Agency on Aging at 1121 Business Loop 70 E. in Columbia. Catherine Edwards, executive director of MA4, said her agency will use its network of area agencies on aging and senior centers to help people learn more about and enroll in health insurance coverage options through the state\u2019s federally run health insurance marketplace.\n\nLast year, more than 150,000 Missourians chose health insurance options through the marketplace. The marketplaces and navigator positions were created under the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in March 2010. A navigator is an individual or organization that\u2019s trained to help consumers, small businesses and their employees look for health coverage and complete eligibility and enrollment forms through the online marketplace.\n\nOthers sharing Missouri\u2019s $1.6 million in 2014 navigator grants include Advanced Patient Advocacy LLC, with offices in Kansas City and Independence; Community Action Agency of St. Louis County Inc.; and National Healthy Start Association, based in Washington, D.C., but with offices in Kansas City, Sikeston and St. Louis.\n\nEdwards said MA4 has established eight regional information centers throughout the state. Additional enrollment and informational events also will be scheduled.\n\nThe open enrollment period for people interested in Health Insurance Marketplace coverage for 2015 will begin Nov. 15. Additionally, Missouri has been selected as one of five states that will allow businesses with fewer than 50 full-time workers to access the Small Business Health Options Program in late October, ahead of the regular open enrollment start date.\n\nEdwards said full details regarding plan options, pricing and which insurance carriers will participate are not yet available, \u201cbut our network is in place and will be prepared to help once details for the 2014 enrollment period are released.\u201d\n\nDespite the group\u2019s focus on senior health and wellness, Edwards said, all services provided by MA4 under the Marketplace program will continue to be available to all Missourians regardless of age.\n\nMeanwhile, Milarsky said the grant announcement that didn\u2019t include Primaris was \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but the Primaris-led coalition \u201cdid meet and exceeds goals\u201d for consumer contact and enrollment under last year\u2019s grant.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5;
