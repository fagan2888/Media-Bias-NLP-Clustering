This August is Boulder's inaugural full Ironman.

(Cookies) are the perfect thing. Who doesn't like chocolate chip cookies?\"\n\nMcNamee and Anderson plan to drive the bike route this weekend to count how many homes they need cookies for. Residents who live and drive along the route are most likely to be affected by cyclists training, McNamee said.\n\nAt Ironman Wisconsin last fall, McNamee said The Cookie Project delivered 3,342 cookies to 557 homes along the course.\n\nIn recent years, there have been some contentious, and some deadly, collisions involving motorists and cyclists in and near Boulder County.\n\nThough the cookies will only attempt to bridge the gap between athletes and the homeowners along the Ironman route, it's a start toward easing the tension more broadly, said Carla Thompson, who's baking cookies to be distributed.\n\n\"There are some cars that when you're riding, they give you a lot of clearance and it's not a problem,\" said Thompson, 48. \"But there are also others that are maybe older, maybe they don't understand why you're on the road. They seem annoyed or frustrated, and I think it's just a nice way to say, 'Hey, we don't mean to be in the way on your roads. But we would like to train here; maybe we can share the road.'\"\n\nThompson, who lives in Highlands Ranch but trains in Boulder, said the cookies might make way for conversations about why cyclists and triathletes enjoy competing and training so much, and why they need to ride on the roads around the county.\n\nIt might also help cyclists better understand the concerns or frustrations of motorists, she said.\n\n\"It seems like a white flag, an olive branch, 'Let's be friends,'\" she said. \"I think if they knew us or were more familiar with what we were trying to accomplish by being on the road, maybe we could begin to develop compassion. It goes both ways; that we would understand that for someone that's not used to driving past a cyclist, that it might be scary for them.\"\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Sarah Kuta at 303-473-1106 or kutas@dailycamera.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-ironman-events/ci_25825612/triathletes-offer-olive-branch-residents-along-ironman-boulder", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta ,  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:25825612:view"}, "startDate": "2014-05-25T09:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "As a way of thanking motorists who live and drive along the bike route for the upcoming Ironman Boulder race, a group of athletes plans to hand-deliver fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies next month.", "title": "Triathletes offer 'olive branch' to residents along Ironman Boulder route", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-ironman-events/ci_25825612/triathletes-offer-olive-branch-residents-along-ironman-boulder", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0523/20140523__25DCAIROw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0523/20140523__25DCAIROw~1_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2014-07-14T10:20:21-0600", "endDate": "2024-05-25T09:00:00-0600", "description": "As a way of thanking motorists who live and drive along the bike route for the upcoming Ironman Boulder race, a group of athletes plans to hand-deliver fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies next month.", "byline": "By Sarah Kuta,", "pubDate": "2014-05-23T18:19:54-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-05-25T09:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Triathletes offer 'olive branch' to residents along Ironman Boulder route", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "news_keywords": "Boulder, Ironman, event, triathlon, swimming, running, cycling, triathlon, colorado, photos, results, news, events", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-ironman-events/ci_25825612/triathletes-offer-olive-branch-residents-along-ironman-boulder", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "As a way of thanking motorists who live and drive along the bike route for the upcoming Ironman Boulder race, a group of athletes plans to hand-deliver fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies next month.", "title": "Triathletes offer 'olive branch' to residents along Ironman Boulder route"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0523/20140523__25DCAIROw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1b4\"", "article_summary": "The 112-mile bike route for Ironman Boulder starts at the Boulder Reservoir, before taking cyclists north through Loveland and south again on Colo. 119.\n( Cliff Grassmick / Camera file photo )Ironman Boulder run, bike routes finalized Ironman officials have released the finalized course maps for the run and bike portions of the race.\nMcNamee and Anderson plan to drive the bike route this weekend to count how many homes they need cookies for.\nResidents who live and drive along the route are most likely to be affected by cyclists training, McNamee said.\nIn recent years, there have been some contentious, and some deadly, collisions involving motorists and cyclists in and near Boulder County."}
