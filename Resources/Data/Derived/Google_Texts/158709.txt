Can I LIVE??? Win!!! A photo posted by Von Miller (@millerlite40) on Feb 20, 2016 at 7:58pm PST

Not long after the Broncos defeated the Panthers in Super Bowl 50, the game’s MVP, Von Miller, took to Instagram to post a few photos from the game and of his teammates.

And then he posted one of Johnny Manziel in his Texas A&M uniform with the message: “I Love you fam! Grind, get back to Johnny all the ags know and love, Grind bro, 2yrs ago they counted me out, 2yrs frm now you can do the same!! Support no matter what! #love @jmanziel2”

Days earlier, the Browns released a statement indicating that they planned to release Manziel following a string of off-the-field incidents that included a domestic assault complaint in Dallas.

Manziel arrived at Texas A&M in 2011, the year Miller was drafted No. 2 by the Broncos. But the linebacker, who was suspended six games in 2013 for violating the league’s policy and was released from its drug program last October, has been vocal about his support for his fellow Aggie.

On Saturday, while in College Station, Texas, for Texas A&M’s overtime upset of Kentucky, Miller reiterated his backing of Manziel, telling The Associated Press that he believes Manziel is on “the right track now.”

“I’m not worried,” Miller said. “I feel like Johnny’s taking care of business. He has adversity. Everybody has been here with adversity. I’ve been here with my own personal adversity. The support that I’m giving him is the support that he’s given me in the past.”
