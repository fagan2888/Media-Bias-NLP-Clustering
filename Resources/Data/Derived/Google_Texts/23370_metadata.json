Schneider described the deal as \u201closing our leverage within the Middle East.\u201d\n\nThe topic might be the first national issue to separate Schneider from Dem rival Supervisor Salud Carbajal, who said he knows \u201cfirsthand what\u2019s in war.\u201d \u201cThe Iran deal achieved \u2026 us not going to war and reducing nuclear access,\u201d he said. (The two conservative frontrunners, Katcho Achadjian and Justin Fareed, dismissed the agreement. \u201cThere was no deal,\u201d Achadjian charged.)\n\nThe Iran deal came up in response to a question about the candidates\u2019 opinion of Congressmember Lois Capps, who has represented the Central Coast for nearly 18 years. Last year, her announcement she\u2019d retire at the end of this term prompted a flurry of candidates to throw their hats in the ring.\n\nOf all 11 candidates in the race, seven attended Thursday\u2019s debate, which was put on by UCSB\u2019s Associated Students Lobby Corps. Four Democrats (Carbajal, Schneider, Jeff Oshins, Bill Ostrander), two Republicans (Achadjian, Fareed), and one Independent (Steve Isakson) were at the table. Next Friday is the last day for a candidate to get in the race.\n\nOstrander has used his campaign to harp on money in politics, and he was almost giddy when asked about Citizens United, the controversial ruling that allows unlimited spending by corporations in federal races. \u201cOh, I love this question,\u201d he began. Ostrander suggested it was the country\u2019s most egregious verdict outside of the Dred Scott decision. He exclaimed he was the only candidate who has not received PAC or super-PAC money, excluding Oshins and Isakson. He criticized Carbajal \u2014 \u201ca nice man,\u201d he conceded \u2014 for his hefty war chest.\n\nCarbajal has raised the most money by far \u2014 $1.4 million \u2014 through the end of last year, the latest official records available. To contrast, Ostrander received $20,317. In a rebuttal, Carbajal said he was \u201c100 percent against\u201d Citizens United and was proud of the broad support his campaign has garnered. \u201cWe need to do everything we can to keep this seat blue,\u201d he said.\n\nSchneider also lamented that it is \u201cinsane\u201d the amount of money candidates need to raise to be considered credible by the establishment in D.C. Through last quarter, she raised $479,183. In a similar school of thought, Oshins warned the audience they would soon be bombarded with ads and TV commercials given the amount of money involved in this race.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the evening, Ostrander, who stood up as he spoke (practically yelling at times), elicited several loud cheers from the audience, many college students yielding Bernie Sanders signs. He snapped at Fareed, who called the Affordable Care Act \u201ca prime example of partisan politics\u201d and \u201cthe largest federal boondoggle in history.\u201d\n\n\u201cThings like that drive me insane,\u201d Ostrander charged, contending Republicans walked away from Affordable Care Act discussions. He called health care a \u201cright\u201d not a \u201cprivilege.\u201d \u201cSure the Affordable Care Act needs improvement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, dammit, get these Republicans involved. What we really should have is universal health care.\u201d\n\nOn health care, Achadjian, who owns a string of gas stations in San Luis Obispo, said the act initially offered \u201ceverything and anything to everyone.\u201d He criticized President Barack Obama for promising people could keep their health care. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d he said. Instead, he called for insurance to be sold across state borders, a position Fareed shared.\n\nFareed also criticized Capps for being one of the Democratic members of Congress who skipped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s controversial speech to Congress last year. And he spoke often of partisan gridlock in DC. \u201cWhat we need to do is reevaluate from a systemic perspective,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nAsked about immigration, Isakson said certainly there is a lot of talk about building a wall at the southern border. \u201cAs an engineer, that doesn\u2019t sound practical to me.\u201d He advocated for secure borders and a path to citizenship for people who have contributed to society.\n\nOshins, soft-spoken and appearing almost apathetic, said he probably will lose in the June election but has made his campaign largely about student loan debt. In talking with people on campuses, Oshins said, he meets some DREAMers, as students without U.S. resident status are known. \u201cIt is just inhumane not to do something about immigration,\u201d he said, noting the refugee crisis in Europe.\n\nAchadjian, who immigrated to the United States from Lebanon in 1971, called for securing the borders \u201cbecause of terrorism\u201d and for heightened security. He said he is willing to help people who are here to make an honest living.\n\nAlso an immigrant, Carbajal moved to the U.S. from Mexico at age 5. He advocated for fixing the \u201cbroken system\u201d to allow people to \u201ccome out of the shadows.\u201d Specifically, he supported a pathway to citizenship with stringent background checks. He also called for secure borders. Carbajal cited studies that indicate immigrants greatly benefit nations.\n\nAdding to that, Ostrader said he has yet to see Caucasians picking vegetables in the fields. \u201cEveryone in this room is an immigrant,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unbelievable to me that there is such hostility, and we look at them as if they\u2019re criminals.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe next debate is set for April 23 at Cuesta College.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://media.independent.com/img/croppedphotos/2016/03/04/03032016_Congressional_Debate_37.jpg", "description": "Seven Out Of 11 In Race For Lois Capps's Seat Take Questions At Ucsb.", "title": "Some Sparks Fly in Third Congressional Debate"}, "verify-v1": "ILofteeXjEGSBFwUf9oRyP4hdhxQ7F35jPp2MwAQrUE=", "y_key": "33d4a6dfbd23f58a", "description": "Seven Out Of 11 In Race For Lois Capps's Seat Take Questions At Ucsb.", "title": "Some Sparks Fly in Third Congressional Debate"}, "article_summary": "Four Democrats (Carbajal, Schneider, Jeff Oshins, Bill Ostrander), two Republicans (Achadjian, Fareed), and one Independent (Steve Isakson) were at the table.\nIn the third debate in the congressional race, seven hopefuls mostly played nice, but they sparred over the Iran nuclear deal, campaign contributions, and the Affordable Care Act.\nThe Iran deal came up in response to a question about the candidates\u2019 opinion of Congressmember Lois Capps, who has represented the Central Coast for nearly 18 years.\nOf all 11 candidates in the race, seven attended Thursday\u2019s debate, which was put on by UCSB\u2019s Associated Students Lobby Corps.\nHe exclaimed he was the only candidate who has not received PAC or super-PAC money, excluding Oshins and Isakson."}
