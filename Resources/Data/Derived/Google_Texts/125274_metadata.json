Scott Walker speaks Saturday at the Club for Growth winter economic conference at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Fla. (Joe Skipper/AP)\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) was wrapping up 45 minutes of talking to the Club for Growth here about economic growth and fiscal reform Saturday morning when a humbling question came hard and fast.\n\nFrayda Levin, a board member of the Club for Growth who moderated a question-and-answer session with Walker, said that after the governor met with top donors in New York last week, \u201cthe feedback was you were not prepared to speak about foreign policy.\u201d What, Levin asked, is he doing to prepare to be president?\n\nWalker, who has struggled to find his footing on foreign affairs, contended that \u201cthe most significant foreign policy decision of my lifetime\u201d was then-President Ronald Reagan\u2019s move to bust a 1981 strike of air-traffic controllers, firing some 11,000 of them.\n\n\u201cIt sent a message not only across America, it sent a message around the world,\u201d Walker said. America\u2019s allies and foes alike became convinced that Reagan was serious enough to take action and that \u201cwe weren\u2019t to be messed with,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Club for Growth, which hosted Walker and five other potential Republican presidential candidates for a three-day summit at a lavish Palm Beach resort, focuses its advocacy on cutting taxes and slashing government spending. But foreign policy bubbled to the surface in the candidates\u2019 remarks, making clear that international affairs has become a key focus for the GOP in the 2016 race for the White House.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), in remarks over dinner here Saturday, said \u201cforeign policy is more complex than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn every corner of this planet, chaos has ensued because this president believes that American involvement is often the cause of our problems rather than the solution to our problems,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nRubio spoke with confidence about his vision for a more actively engaged United States abroad, a contrast to Walker\u2019s more tentative remarks earlier in the day.\n\nWhen Levin, who said she was a supporter of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), questioned Walker\u2019s commander-in-chief credentials, the governor responded by ticking through his recent itinerary of face time with foreign policy luminaries: a breakfast with Henry Kissinger, a huddle with George P. Shultz and tutorials at the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution.\n\nBut then Walker suggested that didn\u2019t much matter.\n\n\u201cI think foreign policy is something that\u2019s not just about having a PhD or talking to PhDs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about leadership.\u201d\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) agrees. He said he, too, has been counseled by some of the party\u2019s leading thinkers on foreign affairs but that it is more important for candidates to articulate a detailed worldview. He challenged reporters to quiz him about any global hot spot.\n\nA couple of hours after Walker\u2019s remark about the air-traffic controllers strike raised eyebrows among some donors in the room, reporters asked Jindal whether he agreed.\n\nIn a veiled swipe at Walker, Jindal said: \u201cWhen it comes to foreign policy, I think it\u2019s important to have a policy vision. I think it\u2019s important to offer specifics and details and answer questions, and I\u2019m happy to do that.\u201d\n\nRoughly 200 wealthy Club for Growth members gathered this weekend at the Breakers, an iconic luxury resort where Bentleys fill the parking lots, to mingle with the presidential contenders and hear them field questions from the stage.\n\nAlthough the group has been a thorn in the side of many Republican leaders, establishment favorite Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor, as well as Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) joined Walker, Rubio and Jindal at the summit.\n\n\u201cIt shows that as an institution we\u2019re, I think, the premier economic advocate for free markets and certainly an organization that has to be factored into a run for president,\u201d said David McIntosh, the Club for Growth\u2019s president.\n\nMcIntosh said the group was unlikely to endorse a presidential candidate but that many of its members are ready to be major donors to the candidates of their choice.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense that 2016 already is going to be a critical year for conservatives, especially economic conservatives, and the appetite for engaging is really quite strong,\u201d McIntosh said.\n\nEconomic and fiscal policies were the predominant focus here, and the likely candidates called for sweeping changes to the tax code, regulatory system and other federal programs.\n\n\u201cThe tax code we have today retards economic growth,\u201d Bush said Thursday night. He suggested he would be open to a flat tax, promising that his eventual plan would provide \u201cbigger and broader tax relief.\u201d\n\nCruz went so far as to say, \u201cWe should abolish the IRS,\u201d which drew hearty applause from the donors.\n\nThe fate of the Export-Import Bank was a hot topic, with all six White House hopefuls breaking with House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) in calling for the elimination of the bank, a federal entity that provides loans to U.S. companies doing business overseas.\n\nJindal challenged Republican leaders in Congress to get over what he dismissively diagnosed as \u201cpost-election stress syndrome\u201d and immediately pass an alternative to the health-care law. Jindal said he had grown impatient with the slow pace of progress since Republicans won the Senate majority and expanded their House majority in November\u2019s elections.\n\n\u201cWhen we say, \u2018We want to repeal Obamacare,\u2019 we mean every single word,\u201d Jindal said. He added, \u201cWhat was the point of getting these majorities if we weren\u2019t even going to try to fight for these principles?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Walker calls Reagan\u2019s breakup of an air traffic controller strike \u201cthe most significant foreign policy decision\u201d of his lifetime.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Walker calls Reagan\u2019s breakup of an air traffic controller strike \u201cthe most significant foreign policy decision\u201d of his lifetime.", "title": "At donor summit, GOP 2016 hopefuls talk foreign policy and fiscal issues", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-donor-summit-gop-2016-hopefuls-talk-foreign-policy-and-fiscal-issues/2015/02/28/deb1d3c2-bed4-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/01/National-Politics/Images/GOP_2016_Walker-0beed-3575.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PhilipRucker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/at-donor-summit-gop-2016-hopefuls-talk-foreign-policy-and-fiscal-issues/2015/02/28/deb1d3c2-bed4-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "club for growth summit, club for growth, club for growth jeb bush, club for growth scott walker, scott walker reagan, scott walker air traffic controllers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP"}, "eomportal-uuid": "deb1d3c2-bed4-11e4-8668-4e7ba8439ca6", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "club for growth summit, club for growth, club for growth jeb bush, club for growth scott walker, scott walker reagan, scott walker air traffic controllers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd421f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think foreign policy is something that\u2019s not just about having a PhD or talking to PhDs,\u201d he said.\nIn a veiled swipe at Walker, Jindal said: \u201cWhen it comes to foreign policy, I think it\u2019s important to have a policy vision.\nBut foreign policy bubbled to the surface in the candidates\u2019 remarks, making clear that international affairs has become a key focus for the GOP in the 2016 race for the White House.\n\u201cThe tax code we have today retards economic growth,\u201d Bush said Thursday night.\nScott Walker speaks Saturday at the Club for Growth winter economic conference at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Fla.
