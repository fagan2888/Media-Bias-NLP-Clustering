But while this form of serotonin is the most popular, it only makes up five percent of the body\u2019s total supply. The other 95 percent, a new study finds, is busy regulating how well your body burns calories through brown fat.\n\nStored around your collarbone are deposits of brown adipose tissue (fat) that help burn energy. Brown fat is scarcer in obese people, and for years researchers have wondered about the mechanism behind the reduction. Recently, a team from McMaster University has found the presence of so-called \u201cperipheral serotonin\u201d makes brown fat less active due to enzyme blockage.\n\n\u201cToo much of this serotonin acts like the parking brake on your brown fat,\u201d said Gregory Steinberg, a professor of medicine and the paper's co-author, in a statement. \u201cYou can step on the gas of the brown fat, but it doesn't go anywhere.\u201d\n\nBrown fat was once believed to be a vestige of evolution \u2014 similar to the appendix \u2014 that helped keep warm other mammals that do not shiver. But several years of research have begun confirming brown fat\u2019s advantages, principally a role in speeding up the body's metabolism. As we age, however, the stores of beneficial brown fat, which burn the \u201cbad\u201d white fat that accumulates on our bellies and thighs, begin to diminish. And depending on our diets, they could stop working entirely.\n\nAs of late, these concerns have multiplied for researchers involved with obesity. In the U.S. alone, more than one-third of adults, or 79 million people, are obese. The annual cost for treating the conditions associated with obesity, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some types of cancer, totals $147 billion in 2008 dollars, the latest year for which data are available. Individually, medical costs for the obese are $1,429 higher than for those of a normal weight.\n\nGiven these concerns, Steinberg and his colleagues wanted to understand how exactly brown fat\u2019s energy burning comes to a halt. Previous work in their lab had shown the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, or Tph1, was overrepresented in lighter mice. Using Tph1 in their follow-up studies, they fed a second group of mice a high-fat diet that was designed to mimic a traditional Western diet. Those with the enzyme mutation produced less serotonin than the normal mice, in turn keeping them healthier.\n\n\u201cWhat we discovered is that if we remove this enzyme either genetically or if we inhibit its activity using a chemical, a drug, the mice have low levels of serotonin and they didn't develop diabetes, obesity, or fatty liver disease,\u201d Steinberg said.\n\nThis finding holds great promise for future weight loss drugs, the team argued. Most of the current options rely on suppressing people\u2019s appetites to achieve a desired amount of weight loss. They also produce severe side effects, including heart complications and risks for depression. Inhibiting the enzyme that triggers energy storage tackles the problem from the other direction, helping to increase the amount of energy people burn normally.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, we think it's a much safer method to work with increasing energy expenditure instead of decreasing the appetite, which involves more risks,\u201d Steinberg said. He and his team are currently at work on a pharmacological approach that could stand in as a substitute for traditional weight loss pills.\n\nSource: Crane J, Palanivel R, Mottillo E, et al.
