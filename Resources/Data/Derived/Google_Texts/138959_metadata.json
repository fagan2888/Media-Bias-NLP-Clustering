We refuse to believe that all those children showing up at our southern border just happen to make that near impossible journey all on their own. We don\u2019t believe that the mindless, wasteful, unaccountable spending orgy by our government has anything to do with good intentions or anything close to the nonsense of \u201csocial justice.\u201d We don\u2019t believe that our president is a Christian. We don\u2019t believe that denying any semblance of security in Benghazi was due to simple ineptitude. We don\u2019t believe the Affordable Health Care Act has anything to do with providing better health care to needy Americans. What we are convinced of is that Obamacare is just another redistribution scam by the scammer in chief and his socialist/commie supporters. We don\u2019t believe that president Obama and his sidekick, Attorney General Eric Holder, were unaware of the Fast and Furious gunrunning scam to Mexican gangs. We don\u2019t believe that the criminal conduct by the IRS was isolated or rare. We don\u2019t believe a government or president can be trusted when they trade a U.S. Army deserter for five dangerous terrorists. We don\u2019t trust or believe in a government that would fail to get our own U.S. Marine out of the criminal Mexican anti-justice prison system. We can\u2019t believe that both Republican and Democratic representatives of we the people of the United States of America would allow our military and national defense to be gutted like it is. We can\u2019t believe that our so-called justice system would allow for the incarceration of good law-abiding citizens for simply firing a warning shot to save their families\u2019 lives, and no one says a damn thing to help him. We can\u2019t believe our government squawks about so many living in so-called poverty when the vast majority of such poor people have cellphones and every imaginable luxury known to man. We are astonished that any organization in America can force the removal of the Ten Commandments from our courthouses or government buildings. We cannot believe that our government continues to send massive economic aid to countries that stand against everything we believe in. We cannot believe anybody is stupid enough to still claim Islam is the religion of peace.\n\n\u201cBut more shocking than all this disbelief and abandonment of logic, common sense and basic national responsibility,\u201d he continued, \u201cis the fact that so many Americans remain in a zombie-like daze of cluelessness to the dangerous, life-threatening conditions increasing all around them on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nNugent tells us the wolf is no longer at the door, but has moved into our living rooms and the beast \u201cis ravenously hungry and doesn\u2019t give a damn what is on the authorized menu.\u201d\n\nHe points out that the November election may be our last chance.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans aren\u2019t exactly the knights in shining armor, but compared to the Democrats, they could very well be the only chance we have,\u201d he said on ridding ourselves of the wolves.\n\n\u201cVampire wolves be gone,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cIt is now or never, America. Are you American enough?\u201d\n\nWell?", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The \u201cMotor City Madman\u201d is at it again, driving liberals insane.
