The requirement comes as part of the Affordable Care Act and will go into effect May 5, 2017. The previous deadline for restaurants to implement this was December 2016, so the new date gives chains an extra five months to get on board.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration announced its calorie-count mandate in 2014, but efforts to institute the rule were stymied by lobbyists for big restaurant chains such as Domino's, as well as wine companies. Some chains, including Subway, have preemptively added calorie counts to their menus in the interim. (McDonald\u2019s was ahead of the curve, adding calories to its menu boards way back in 2012.)\n\nEven beverages will not be spared by the new rule, which includes beer and wine. Proponents of menu-labeling say it will help consumers make more informed choices about what they eat, though studies haven't exactly proven that to be true. Just last year, two studies indicated that displaying calorie counts doesn't necessarily affect what people order \u2014 but it may influence restaurants to offer lower-calorie foods.\n\nEarlier this year, the UK's Royal Society of Public Health proposed a new labeling system that would pair calorie counts on purchased foods with the amount of exercise required to burn those calories off. American researchers have suggested similar measures, arguing that listing the hours of exercise needed to burn off a bacon cheeseburger and fries could be more persuasive than simply including calorie counts.", "article_metadata": {"outbrainsection": "news", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "The long-delayed info will hit a chain near you next year", "author": "Virginia Chamlee", "og": {"site_name": "Eater", "description": "The long-delayed info will hit a chain near you next year", "title": "Chain Restaurants Must Display Calorie Counts as of May 2017", "url": "http://www.eater.com/2016/5/16/11685908/menu-calorie-counts-national-chains", "image": "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIUgSQxi5lT0x1FewdBT2pk1m_g=/0x176:1310x913/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49605021/mcdonaldscaloriesGetty.0.0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The long-delayed info will hit a chain near you next year", "title": "Chain Restaurants Must Display Calorie Counts as of May 2017", "url": "http://www.eater.com/2016/5/16/11685908/menu-calorie-counts-national-chains", "image": {"src": "https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIUgSQxi5lT0x1FewdBT2pk1m_g=/0x176:1310x913/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/49605021/mcdonaldscaloriesGetty.0.0.jpg"}, "site": "Eater", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-05-16", "sailthru.title": "Chain Restaurants Must Display Calorie Counts as of May 2017", "fb": {"app_id": 143972162345360}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "google-site-verification": "ZvsTR4mG6LQds-1bOnir71ybGjhQyVKPLMJNLcoZu08", "sailthru.tags": "general,eater", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/eater", "published_time": "2016-05-16T21:00:03Z"}, "sailthru.description": "The long-delayed info will hit a chain near you next year", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Just last year, two studies indicated that displaying calorie counts doesn't necessarily affect what people order \u2014 but it may influence restaurants to offer lower-calorie foods.\nAmerican researchers have suggested similar measures, arguing that listing the hours of exercise needed to burn off a bacon cheeseburger and fries could be more persuasive than simply including calorie counts.\nSome chains, including Subway, have preemptively added calorie counts to their menus in the interim.\nThis time next year, all U.S. restaurants with 20 or more locations will be legally required to post calorie counts on their menus and menu boards, according to a Reuters report.\nEarlier this year, the UK's Royal Society of Public Health proposed a new labeling system that would pair calorie counts on purchased foods with the amount of exercise required to burn those calories off."}
