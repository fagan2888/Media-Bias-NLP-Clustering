The United Automobile Workers and Fiat Chrysler have reached a new contract for the company\u2019s 40,000 workers. Under the deal \u2014 which will be a template for talks with Ford Motor and General Motors \u2014 the hourly pay of veteran workers will rise from $28 to almost $30 over four years, while pay for new workers will rise from about $16 to $19 to about $29 over eight years. Non-union foreign carmakers in the United States and suppliers are now likely to feel pressure to move closer to the new industry standards.\n\nTherein lies the real power in the new contract: It halts the long downward pull on wages in the auto industry that has persisted even as the industry recovered from the recession. In so doing, it reaffirms the power of unions to use the threat of a strike to demand a fairer share; U.A.W. members at Fiat Chrysler had rejected an initial contract and were ready to walk out, which could have slowed the company\u2019s recent progress.\n\nThere are also broader lessons here for policy makers. The new contract implicitly defines $30 an hour as a decent middle-class wage. That is well above the recent average of $21.08 for most workers, but below the nearly $32 that would be the norm if wages had kept pace with net labor productivity in recent decades. Clearly, unions can lift middle-class wages to a point, but more needs to be done. Higher federal spending on necessary public projects would lift pay by creating jobs; stricter laws on worker classification would ensure that employees are not wrongly denied overtime and benefits. In general, Democrats support such proposals, Republicans don\u2019t.\n\nEqually important, efforts to raise the median wage would strengthen the case for a federal minimum wage of $15. Opponents argue that $15 is not feasible with the average in the low $20s. But if steps are taken to raise middle-class wages to at least $30, a minimum of $15, phased in, would be feasible. Politicians need to follow where the autoworkers are trying to lead: Toward a future of higher pay and rising living standards.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20151026032004, "twitter": {"description": "A new contract helps the efforts not only to improve pay in the auto industry, but to press for a higher minimum wage.", "title": "Auto Workers Point the Way to Higher Pay", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/opinion/auto-workers-point-the-way-to-higher-pay.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003995140"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/opinion/auto-workers-point-the-way-to-higher-pay.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003995140", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/opinion/auto-workers-point-the-way-to-higher-pay.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Auto Workers Point the Way to Higher Pay", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 26, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-10-26", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Automobiles", "published": "2015-10-26", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Editorials,United Automobile Workers,Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV,Factories and Manufacturing,Labor and Jobs,Minimum Wage,United States Politics and Government,Organized Labor,Wages and Salaries,Automobiles", "news_keywords": "Editorial,Cars", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A new contract helps the efforts not only to improve pay in the auto industry, but to press for a higher minimum wage.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A new contract helps the efforts not only to improve pay in the auto industry, but to press for a higher minimum wage.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 26, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "org": "Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV", "slug": "26mon4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151026184604, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/26/opinion/auto-workers-point-the-way-to-higher-pay.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A new contract helps the efforts not only to improve pay in the auto industry, but to press for a higher minimum wage.", "title": "Auto Workers Point the Way to Higher Pay"}, "pdate": 20151026, "des": "Automobiles", "articleid": 100000003995140, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Auto Workers Point the Way to Higher Pay", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "article_summary": "But if steps are taken to raise middle-class wages to at least $30, a minimum of $15, phased in, would be feasible.\nClearly, unions can lift middle-class wages to a point, but more needs to be done.\nThe United Automobile Workers and Fiat Chrysler have reached a new contract for the company\u2019s 40,000 workers.\nPoliticians need to follow where the autoworkers are trying to lead: Toward a future of higher pay and rising living standards.\nThe nearly one million people who work in the auto industry in the United States may soon be getting a nice raise."}
