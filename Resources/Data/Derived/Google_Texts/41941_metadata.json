The briefs were filed in Zubik v. Burwell, in which the High Court will decide whether the Little Sisters of the Poor and other similar ministries can be forced to alter their healthcare plans to offer drugs that violate their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cWe are overjoyed and deeply grateful for the diverse outpouring of support we have received from such a variety of people and groups,\u201d said Sister Loraine Marie Maguire, Mother Provincial for the Little Sisters of the Poor, in a statement. \u201cWe have been serving the elderly poor for over 175 years and are simply asking the government to allow us to continue our life\u2019s work without being forced to choose between our faith and millions in government fines.\u201d\n\nSister Loraine and Sister Constance Veit were invited by House Speaker Paul Ryan to the 2016 State of the Union address.\n\nThe Becket Fund for Religious Liberty represents the Sisters in their case against the Obama administration.\n\nOn November 6, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take up the case of the Little Sisters. The Becket Fund urged the High Court on January 4 to protect the sisters from the $70 million dollars in government fines for refusing to violate their Catholic faith. This is the second time the Sisters have asked the Supreme Court for protection from the Obama administration.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Little Sisters of the Poor Say They\u2019ll Have \u2018Nun\u2019 of Abortion, HHS Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Little Sisters of the Poor Say They\u2019ll Have \u2018Nun\u2019 of Abortion, HHS Mandate", "title": "Little Sisters of the Poor Say They\u2019ll Have \u2018Nun\u2019 of Abortion, HHS Mandate - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Little-Sisters-Button.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-01-23T13:32:26-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/23/little-sisters-of-the-poor-say-theyll-have-nun-of-abortion-hhs-mandate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Little Sisters of the Poor Say They\u2019ll Have \u2018Nun\u2019 of Abortion, HHS Mandate", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Little-Sisters-Button.jpg", "title": "Little Sisters of the Poor Say They\u2019ll Have \u2018Nun\u2019 of Abortion, HHS Mandate - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, HHS mandate, Little Sisters of the Poor, March for Life 2016, U.S. Supreme Court,Abortion, Big Government, Obamacare,Little Sisters", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-01-23T12:08:47-07:00", "section": "Abortion", "modified_time": "2016-01-23T13:32:26-07:00", "tag": "U.S. Supreme Court", "categories": "Big Government,Abortion,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "On November 6, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take up the case of the Little Sisters.\nThis is the second time the Sisters have asked the Supreme Court for protection from the Obama administration.\nThe Little Sisters \u2013 whose ministry is to the elderly poor \u2013 regularly participate in the pro-life march, and this year highlighted their fight against the Obamacare mandate with buttons that read simply, \u201cI\u2019ll have nun of it,\u201d reported the Washington Examiner.\nThe Becket Fund for Religious Liberty represents the Sisters in their case against the Obama administration.\n\u201cWe are overjoyed and deeply grateful for the diverse outpouring of support we have received from such a variety of people and groups,\u201d said Sister Loraine Marie Maguire, Mother Provincial for the Little Sisters of the Poor, in a statement."}
