This was never implemented due to the delay, according to senior director of human resources Ron Mooradian.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically back to business as usual,\u201d Mooradian said.\n\nEmployer mandate brings relief\n\nSenior biblical studies major Clarke Andros, who works at Biola an average of 33 hours a week, is relieved that the the employer mandate is being lifted.\n\n\u201cIt was totally a God thing for me and my wife,\u201d Andros said.\n\nAndros, who has been married for three weeks, explained that he needs the hours to support himself and his wife. He works three on-campus jobs as a student technician for facilities management, a library circulation worker and a TA for biblical studies professor Uche Anizor. He would have had to give up the latter two jobs had the 25 hour limit been imposed.\n\n\u201cI freaked out a little bit \u2014 not very trusting of me, in the Lord. I had worked out a budget that was very specific, hour-by-hour of what I needed to work in a week, for the exact of amount of money that I needed,\u201d Andros said.\n\nAndros explained that the 25-hour limit would have forced him to obtain an off-campus job. As a senior, the one-year delay of the employer mandate was just the amount of time he needed.\n\nMooradian expects to release an announcement regarding student employees during the spring 2014 semester, but he noted that things could change.\n\n\u201cIt seems with the Affordable Care Act that a lot of decisions are being made on the fly,\u201d Mooradian said.\n\nAn Employer\u2019s Perspective\n\nLibrary circulation supervisor April Ray oversees 38 student workers. The effect of the mandate would have been significant, according to Ray.\n\n\u201cWe typically have around four or five people that work twenty hours or more \u2014 I know they have more than one job \u2014 so I know they would go over 25 [hours],\u201d Ray said.\n\nThe delay was a relief for Ray; she stated that it will be a lot less complicated to schedule and hire. Once a student is hired, training takes significant time and energy.\n\n\u201cGiven that training here takes 30 hours, bringing on a new person takes quite a bit of work,\u201d Ray said.\n\nNo decision has been made regarding non-student employees, according to Mooradian.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some talk in the government that they may change the 30-hour limit to something higher,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nBy Jared Dobbs\n\nOther Stories Last proposals of the semester pass Prayer bulletin board and SGA fall semester budget pass.\n\nVirtual tour creates translation possibilities With USC the first to have a multilingual commencement ceremony, Biola implements a multilingual virtual tour.\n\nDiversity department plans for restructuring Funding from SGA supports eight affinity groups, part of reshaping the department currently known as MEPD.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://chimes.biola.edu/static/media/photos/2013/Apr/27/cache/studentjobs_jb_home_banner.JPG", "site_name": "The Chimes | Biola University", "description": "Student employees are relieved to know that the Obamacare mandate has been delayed.", "title": "Obamacare mandate delay hits Biola student jobs"}}, "article_summary": "This was never implemented due to the delay, according to senior director of human resources Ron Mooradian.\nTweet Email Obamacare mandate delay hits Biola student jobsThe Obama administration\u2019s decision this summer to delay implementation of the employee mandate in the Affordable Care Act means that Biola can continue to employ students for more than 30 hours per week without having to offer them health insurance.\n\u201cGiven that training here takes 30 hours, bringing on a new person takes quite a bit of work,\u201d Ray said.\nEmployer mandate brings reliefSenior biblical studies major Clarke Andros, who works at Biola an average of 33 hours a week, is relieved that the the employer mandate is being lifted.\nAs a senior, the one-year delay of the employer mandate was just the amount of time he needed."}
