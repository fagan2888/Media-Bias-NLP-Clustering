She turned the crowd up with her versatile catalogue ranging from her first single \u201cTightrope\u201d to her latest track \u201cYoga.\u201d However, the show\u2019s anchor wasn\u2019t feeling her set list when Mon\u00e1e added a message about police brutality at the end of her performance of \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d\u2013an empowering track that speaks to the #BlackLivesMatter Movement.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes Lord! God bless America! God bless all the lost lives to police brutality. We want White America to know that we stand tall today,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want Black America to know we stand tall today. We will not be silenced\u2026\u201d\n\nIn this case, the always poised \u201cQ.U.E.E.N\u201d singer was silenced, as the camera cut away from her and the anchor tried to talk over her.\n\ndang @TODAYshow, just couldn\u2019t let her finish, huh? love ya @JanelleMonae! #BlackLivesMatter cc: @deray @Nettaaaaaaaa pic.twitter.com/QeGhY5lQGJ \u2014 marla york. (@theseMYtweetz) August 14, 2015\n\nDuring this past week, Janelle has been traveling the tri-state area in support of the Wondaland collective\u2019s new EP, \u201cThe Eephus,\u201d appearing on shows like the Power 105.1\u2019s The Breakfast Club and Hot 97\u2019s Ebro In The Morning Show and even peacefully protesting in Times Square. During both visits\u2013The Breakfast Club in particular\u2013Mon\u00e1e freely spoke out on race relations and became teary eyed while speaking. In regards to the newly released \u201cHell You Talmbout\u201d she said:\n\n\u201cThis song is a vessel. It carries the unbearable anguish of millions. We recorded it to channel the pain, fear, and trauma caused by the ongoing slaughter of our brothers and sisters,\u201d she said. \u201cWe recorded it to challenge the indifference, disregard, and negligence of all who remain quiet about this issue. Silence is our enemy. Sound is our weapon. They say a question lives forever until it gets the answer it deserves\u2026 Won\u2019t you say their names?\u201d\n\nWatch her full performance below.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "NBC was not here for Janelle Mon\u00e1e's message on police and race relations in America during her The \"TODAY\" Show performance.", "og": {"site_name": "MadameNoire", "description": "NBC was not here for Janelle Mon\u00e1e's message on police and race relations in America during her The \"TODAY\" Show performance.", "title": "NBC's The \"TODAY\" Show Cuts Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s Performance Short During Police Brutality Message", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 395, "identifier": "http://d236bkdxj385sg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/janellemonae.jpg", "height": 594}, "updated_time": "2015-08-16T18:02:01-04:00", "url": "http://madamenoire.com/579795/nbcs-the-today-show-cuts-janelle-monaes-performance-short-during-police-brutality-message/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@MadameNoire", "image": {"src": "http://d236bkdxj385sg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/janellemonae-395x450.jpg"}, "description": "SMH.", "card": "summary", "title": "NBC's The \"TODAY\" Show Cuts Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s Performance Short During Police Brutality Message"}, "ob": {"title": "NBC's The \"TODAY\" Show Cuts Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019"}, "robots": "noodp", "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"admins": 100006356380901}, "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Wondaland Records", "published_time": "2015-08-16T11:25:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-16T18:02:01-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "89cYy4uYOnrle-D3H3SPnHJySu32IytBEKjsv1_skZo", "y_key": "637ec967f3cf29ad"}, "article_summary": "We want White America to know that we stand tall today,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe want Black America to know we stand tall today.\nPin this on Pinterest Email this storyJanelle Mon\u00e1e, Wondaland Records boss lady, gave an outstanding performance on NBC\u2019s The TODAY Show Friday (Aug. 14).\nThey say a question lives forever until it gets the answer it deserves\u2026 Won\u2019t you say their names?\u201dWatch her full performance below.\nDuring both visits\u2013The Breakfast Club in particular\u2013Mon\u00e1e freely spoke out on race relations and became teary eyed while speaking."}
