Practo, a digital health company that developed a booking service app for people to use for healthcare appointments has developed a partnership with Uber, according to a company statement.\n\nPracto users in India, Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore who book an appointment on its app will be able to see the closest Uber available when they get a reminder alert for their appointments.\n\nUsers can click the reminder notification and complete the booking process. New users who book their first appointment on the Practo app can use a promotion code for two free rides with Uber through the end of the year.\n\nThe app will inform users how much the estimated fare is and how long it will take Uber to arrive. It will also include the destination address at the start of the trip.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting development because lack of transportation can hinder access to appointments, but Uber\u2019s price tag is not exactly cheap. So although the service may be useful for some, it probably will not solve access issues for everyone.\n\nIn August, Practo raised $90 million in a Series C round. The company\u2019s booking service is only one part of the business. It also has a clinical management platform. At the time of the fundraise, the company said it would use the new funding to bring these tools to 65 more cities in India from its current level of 35 and expand from a presence in three countries to 10.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Practo users in India, Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore who book an appointment on its app will be able to see the closest Uber available when they get a reminder alert for their appointments.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Practo users in India, Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore who book an appointment on its app will be able to see the closest Uber available when they get a reminder alert for their appointments.", "title": "India-based booking service Practo joins forces with Uber", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PractoUber-Creative.png", "updated_time": "2015-11-16T10:44:14-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/11/india-based-booking-service-practo-joins-forces-with-uber/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PractoUber-Creative.png", "description": "Practo users in India, Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore who book an appointment on its app will be able to see the closest Uber available when they get a reminder alert for their appointments.", "card": "summary", "title": "India-based booking service Practo joins forces with Uber - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,digital health, health IT, India, Practo, Uber, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Uber", "published_time": "2015-11-16T08:02:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-16T10:44:14-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Practo, a digital health company that developed a booking service app for people to use for healthcare appointments has developed a partnership with Uber, according to a company statement.\nThe company\u2019s booking service is only one part of the business.\nUber gets name dropped so often in healthcare, it\u2019s probably inevitable that companies would seek to partner with the car service.\nNew users who book their first appointment on the Practo app can use a promotion code for two free rides with Uber through the end of the year.\nThe app will inform users how much the estimated fare is and how long it will take Uber to arrive."}
