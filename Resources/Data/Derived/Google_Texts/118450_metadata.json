Did you notice his torso?\n\n\u2014Preston Sturges, \u201cSullivan\u2019s Travels\u201d\n\nThe year really began in the last days of February, at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. The Scouting Combine is an annual invitation-only event at which more than three hundred of the country\u2019s most promising draft-eligible college football players gather to audition for NFL teams by running, jumping, lifting weights, taking intelligence tests, and sitting down for private interviews, where each one might be asked about almost anything, including his injured shoulder, his bar brawl, his decision to save himself for marriage, and, as had happened the year before with the receiver Dez Bryant, whether his mother was a prostitute. When Eric Mangini led the Jets, he sometimes began a Combine interview by requiring the ten or so people in the room to introduce themselves to the player, after which the coach turned to the player and asked him to repeat all the names he\u2019d just heard. This did not always go over well. LSU\u2019s Dwayne Bowe, now a Chiefs receiver, believed Mangini was trying to humiliate him, and he shut down, producing a lengthy awkward moment that Jets officials still can\u2019t recall without shuddering.\n\nThe Combine was a spectacle that had elements of other spectacles: it was a football screen test; a football beauty pageant; a strongman contest at a football county fair. Jets receivers coach Henry Ellard, a former NFL star, thought back to his own Combine experience and remembered the queasy feeling of standing on display, \u201conly in shorts,\u201d for crowds of men who tugged and pulled at him \u201clike a piece of meat.\u201d Ellard, like most Combine attendees and most NFL players, is black. The majority of the people evaluating the players are white, creating a dynamic the Jets coaches warned me I might find disquieting: \u201cIt looks like a fucking slave auction,\u201d one coach said.\n\nThe Combine was also exactly what the word proclaimed it was: an NFL harvester that winnowed the field of ripe young football players and separated them into wheat and chaff. Two months after the Combine, at the end of April, the threshing would be completed in New York, when two-thirds of the contestants would hear their names called at the NFL draft ceremony. For the players, the Combine loomed the way the MCAT did for their classmates who hoped to become doctors, and most of them prepared just as assiduously. These study sessions were often conducted by agents, who helped the players to have ready responses for just about anything anybody might ask them to do or say.\n\nThe Jets had been preparing too. In Florham Park, after a season spent living in the moment, coming within a game of reaching the Super Bowl, the Jets coaches and team officials had stepped back, evaluated the team, assessed its deficiencies, decided what had kept them from the championship, and then discussed whom they could find at the Combine to deliver them. Defensive coordinator Mike Pettine, for instance, hoped to discover \u201ca bitch-kitty pass rusher.\u201d By this he meant a defensive end or, in a 3-4 alignment, an outside linebacker who would smell a warm quarterback and become an insatiable, unblockable, pocket-infiltrating force of war-daddy bedlam. In other words, a sacking specialist. A fundamental fact of a defensive coordinator\u2019s life was that a sack reduced the chance of the opposing team\u2019s scoring in any drive to 7 percent. For all their reputation as a pressuring defense, the Jets didn\u2019t generate many sacks, leading to the perception that they lacked a real pass rush, were doing it with mirrors. Their basic problem was that there were not many large men capable of accelerating off a mark at high speed and then making a feline curve around the edge of pass protection by dipping their shoulders low enough to the grass that you could imagine them passing beneath a caf\u00e9 table without disturbing the vase of tulips on top before raising a little backfield harm.\n\nAttending the Combine was the University of Wisconsin defensive end J. J. Watt and the Texas A&M outside linebacker Von Miller, and either would have been the answer to Mike Pettine\u2019s (and Rex Ryan\u2019s) prayers. But because the Jets had been the NFL\u2019s third-best team the year before, their position for the seven rounds of the upcoming draft was low\u2014they would pick thirtieth out of the thirty-two teams. Watt and Miller would be drafted by other teams long before that thirtieth slot. So Pettine was looking elsewhere. Pettine had watched cut-ups, collections of film footage on a common theme chosen from various games of the college careers of all the defensive players the Jets scouts and front-office people had graded draft-eligible. In his best moments on film, Temple University\u2019s Muhammad Wilkerson had impressed Pettine as much as any lineman in the draft. He weighed 315 pounds, had arms that were three feet long, and he looked like a Volkswagen when he sprinted. But Pettine worried that on too many snaps, Wilkerson needed \u201ca little gunpowder in his Wheaties.\u201d\n\nFor the coaches and front-office people, the Combine was an industry convention. Downtown Indianapolis teemed with contingents from all the NFL organizations. Everybody knew everybody, and there was a reunion feel. At hotel lobbies and in restaurants and bars, you could hear scraps of conversation particular to the time and place: \u201cYou can\u2019t coach nasty\u201d; \u201cHe\u2019s only six three\u201d; \u201cOptimal hips!\u201d; \u201cJosh McDaniels thinks he invented football.\u201d McDaniels had been hired in 2009 to be the head coach of the Denver Broncos. Only thirty-two and another prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Bill Belichick, McDaniels was then the young NFL coach of the moment. But in December, with the Broncos a 3-and-9 dead horse, he\u2019d been fired, and now there was a different ascendant NFL leader who also happened to be the undisputed king of the Combine\u2014Rex Ryan.\n\nThe combination of his coaching success, his charm, and a star turn in the 2010 season of HBO\u2019s training-camp documentary Hard Knocks as the smack-talking, life-loving profane fat dude with motivating charisma\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s go eat a goddamned snack!\u201d\u2014had earned Ryan first-name recognition out in the world: Rex! For him there were now invitations from the likes of Letterman, Sandler (a movie cameo), and Doubleday (a memoir). His popularity had only increased with Deadspin\u2019s discovery of fetish videos in which Ryan praised the feet of his pretty wife of nearly thirty years, Michelle. Ryan was not only gregarious but also a happily married inamorato! (Around the facility, when the other coaches teased him about this episode, Ryan would retort affably, \u201cI\u2019m the only guy in history who gets in a sex scandal with his wife!\u201d) Within the well-insulated facility, one could still believe that things with Ryan were as they had always been. Out at the Combine, it was clear that much was different.\n\nIn Indianapolis, as soon as Ryan was free of his long schedule of meetings, he was all over town, as he always was at the Combine. Only this time, everybody wanted to join him for a cheeseburger\u2014or lob one at him. He\u2019d given a press conference in which he\u2019d guaranteed a Super Bowl victory for the Jets.\n\nAs for the Jets defensive coaches at the Combine, after hours of asking players to diagram their college base defenses and showing them cut-ups of themselves making good and poor plays on the field\u2014clips chosen to stimulate a revealing discussion, assess the player\u2019s football acumen, and measure his responses to uncomfortable situations\u2014the Jets coaches would gather for a late meal or drinks and conversation. They discussed peekers (a player who so badly wanted to please that every time he made a mistake, he looked to see the coach\u2019s reaction). They discussed various methods used to defend the back of the end zone (a discreet hand to a receiver\u2019s hip to \u201chelp him out-of-bounds\u201d was one). They discussed Stanford defensive players (\u201cBuyer beware!\u201d). The coaches worked together closely year-round, so it was understood that, in the interests of group harmony, they would not discuss politics, religion, or wives. The dating exploits of the unmarried coaches were, however, fair game, and questions arose on the order of what was the appropriate interval of time to let pass after breaking up with a woman before one asked her roommate out.\n\nAnd then there were the ongoing adventures of young Mike Smith. Smitty had been a Ravens linebacker until a severe shoulder injury ended his career. With the Jets, he was still officially a defensive intern, but Pettine deemed him a promising enough coach to lead the Jets outside linebackers. He was a dark-haired Texan with a big, cheerful arm-around-the-shoulder manner, and in a community filled with strong, physical men, there was something sweetly unmenacing about Smitty. The others enjoyed telling Smitty stories in front of him, partly because the stories were so amusing and partly because Smitty\u2019s policy in the face of less than flattering personal history was to smile and tell himself, You just have to take it. A year earlier, Smitty had prepared to celebrate his thirtieth birthday, only to realize on the birthday morning that actually he had just turned twenty-nine. Reporting the oversight to Pettine, Smitty used the word \u201cforgot.\u201d Another day, Smitty\u2019s car was discovered parked at such an angle that it consumed two facility parking spaces, one of them not Smitty\u2019s. When confronted, Smitty claimed all ignorance, said he\u2019d left the car perfectly parked. Smitty was a native of Lubbock, Texas, where the gusts were such that sometimes locals seemed to walk at a forward lean. That explains why, on the subject of his askew car, Smitty ventured this speculation: \u201cThe wind must have blown it crooked.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every year the world's best prospects gather at the Combine to try out.
