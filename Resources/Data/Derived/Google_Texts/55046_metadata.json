Credit: Roy Dabner for the Journal Sentinel\n\nOn the field: Robinzon Diaz's walk-off RBI single delivered a 7-6 victory over the Kansas City Royals at Maryvale Baseball Park on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe Brewers looked like they were going to run away with the game after taking a 4-0 lead in the first inning and chasing Royals starter John Lamb after only two-thirds of an inning. But the Royals came storming back and eventually took the lead in the ninth before Diaz delivered.\n\nMarco Estrada started and went 31/3 innings, allowing seven hits and three runs (all earned) while striking out one.\n\nAramis Ramirez made his first Cactus League appearance a successful one, doubling in three runs on the first pitch he saw and finishing his day 2 for 2 with a walk, those three RBI and a run scored in three innings of work.\n\n\"I feel pretty good,\" Ramirez said. \"It's been awhile since the last time I played a baseball game. It was a little weird in the beginning, but now I've gotten the first one out of the way.\"\n\nCactus juice: Manager Ron Roenicke issued his first challenge of the spring in the first inning Saturday, contending Martin Maldonado was hit by a pitch that was ruled a ball by home-plate umpire Allen Bailey. The umpires conferred, reviewed the play and upheld the ball call in less than 2 minutes. Then in the ninth, with the game tied at 5-5, Roenicke challenged consecutive plays \u2014 a safe call at first base and a rundown between second and third that were both upheld.\n\nThe final tally for Roenicke: 0 for 3.\n\n\"I was (satisfied with the process) except for the first one \u2014 the ball hit Maldy and we had a view that you could see the ball change directions,\" said Roenicke. \"If that's the case, they need to change the call.\"\n\nWeather: 75 and sunny.\n\nScoreboard: Brewers 7, Royals 6.
