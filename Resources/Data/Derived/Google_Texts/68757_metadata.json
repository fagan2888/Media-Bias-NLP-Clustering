She earlier campaigned to keep the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which this bill returns after it was phased out in June. Its expiration was blamed for G-E's plans to move an engine plant from Waukesha to Canada.\n\nSenate Republican Ron Johnson says the bill has other benefits for Wisconsin. Heavier logging trucks be allowed on 12-miles of Interstate 39 south of Wausau. Johnson also said milk haulers will have new rules in which fewer trucks will be needed, cutting costs for dairy farmers and milk consumers.\n\nThe bill does not raise the federal gas tax. It allocates $70 billion more from elsewhere, mainly with a transfer of $53 billion from the Federal Reserve Bank's capital account.\n\nDeer harvest smaller than first reported\n\nMADISON -- State officials now say the number of deer registered in the nine-day gun hunt is 1.5 percent less than first reported.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources said its preliminary numbers from Tuesday over-reported the statewide harvest by almost 3,000 deer.\n\nOfficials said the hunters who shot those deer inadvertently made duplicate registrations in the new computerized reporting system that the state used for the first time this year. The corrected numbers show that Wisconsin hunters killed almost 202,000 deer in the season which ended last Sunday. That's about 2,300 more animals than last year's gun season.\n\nOfficials said about 108,000 does were shot this time around, as well as 94,000 bucks.\n\nMarathon County, which has the state's largest land area, also had the biggest deer harvest with a little more than 8,000.\n\nWisconsin extends run as nation's top cheese-maker\n\nWASHINGTON D.C. -- Wisconsin has extended its lead as the nation's top cheese-maker. New United States Department of Agriculture show that the Badger State pumped out 264 million pounds of cheese in October. That's 3.6 percent more than the same month a year ago -- a much higher increase than the national jump of 1.5 percent.\n\nSecond-place California saw its cheese production drop by five percent in October, to 198 million pounds. Nationally, the USDA said almost 991 million pounds of cheese were made during the month -- about 15 million pounds more than the previous October.\n\nWisconsin accounts for almost 27 percent of that total.\n\nThe Badger State increased its mozzarella production by almost eight percent, and its cheddar output by more than three percent.\n\nReport: No effort to fire workers for sex on state property\n\nMADISON -- When Gov. Scott Walker pushed for changes in the civil service system for state employees, he said the rules made it impossible to fire two workers who had sex on state property.\n\nNow, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports there was no effort to fire the employees. And after they were reprimanded, state Railroad Commissioner Jeff Plale softened letters which documented the punishment from 2011. He also agreed to have the reprimand letter for Elizabeth Piliouras removed from her personnel file.\n\nPlale told the state's largest news outlet he only did what he was told to do by the state's office of employee relations. He says he cleaned up a mess he inherited.\n\nAdministration spokesman Cullen Werwie said the reprimands were consistent with previous cases. He also said the Republicans' proposed civil service changes would make it easier to terminate workers in situations like this.\n\nPiliouras left the agency in 2012. The other person involved, attorney Jeff Wood, is still listed as a railroad commission employee.\n\nAs for the civil service changes, state lawmakers could vote on them as early as next month.\n\nSenate votes to repeal Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood\n\nWASHINGTON D.C.-- There were no surprises from Wisconsin's delegation, as the U.S. Senate votes to repeal key parts of Obamacare and drop federal funds for Planned Parenthood. Both measures were in a single bill that passed 52- to 47 Thursday night.\n\nRepublican Ron Johnson, who ran for office six years on his opposition to the Affordable Care Act, voted in favor of repealing it.\n\nDemocrat Tammy Baldwin, a staunch supporter of Obamacare, voted no.\n\nThe House must still act on the measure, after it passed a different version two months ago.\n\nThe White House says Obama will veto the final version if it gets to him.\n\nJohnson said millions of Americans had their insurance policies canceled after Obama promised that if they liked their health plans, they could keep them. Johnson also said the federal exchange that Wisconsin uses has narrower and fewer choices for health policies.\n\nEarlier in the day, House Speaker Paul Ryan of Janesville promised to unveil a plan next year to \"replace every word of Obamacare.\"\n\nThe GOP controlled House has voted dozens of times to repeal it.\n\nMumps confirmed at UW-Milwaukee\n\nMILWAUKEE -- The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee has confirmed a case of mumps among the student body.\n\nThe Norris Health Center on campus said the case was confirmed Wednesday.\n\nStatewide, 37 cases have been reported in 2015. Mumps is spread from an infected person through coughing, sneezing or contact with saliva. Early symptoms, including fever, headache, muscle aches and fatigue, begin 16 to 18 days after exposure. Symptoms are similar to the flu, but swelling of the cheek and jaw area can be a classic symptom of mumps.\n\nAnyone with a suspected case of mumps should remain home from work or school for five days.\n\nOfficer allegedly stole meds from drug drop-off box\n\nBARABOO -- A Sauk Prairie police officer is free on a signature bond, after he was accused of stealing prescription drugs from a public disposal box at his police station.\n\nMatthew Alt, 38, of North Freedom appeared in Sauk County Circuit Court Thursday, the same day he was charged with misconduct in office, illegally obtaining prescription medicines, and two counts of possessing narcotics.\n\nProsecutors said Alt went to the police station during his time off and emptied a drop-box where people can safely dispose of their expired and unused drugs.\n\nAuthorities seized almost 500 pills from his home. Officials say they were forms of the painkiller hydrocodone.\n\nA preliminary hearing is being delayed while a new judge is sought. To avoid conflicts of interest, all of Sauk County's judges have withdrawn from the case and a special prosecutor has been named.\n\nAlt is on paid leave while an internal Sauk Prairie investigation takes place.\n\nTwo alleged heroin dealers face charges\n\nPLOVER -- A man and a woman are due in court Dec. 14 on charges stemming from a large heroin bust in central Wisconsin. Maurice Harper, 47, and Kendra Trzebiatowski, 19, were stopped on I-39 near Coloma. Authorities said they were returning to Plover from Chicago.\n\nOfficers seized the car, 17 grams of a substance believed to be heroin, and $2,100 in cash. Plover Police Chief Dan Ault said a regional drug unit arranged to have undercover officers buy heroin, and a search warrant was executed at a house in Plover.\n\nThe two suspects had bond hearings this week, but they have not been charged yet. Harper is jailed in Portage County under a $50,000 bond, and Trzebiatowski is free on a $1,000 bond.\n\nProsecutors expect to file charges that include possessing heroin and pot with the intent to sell it, reckless endangerment, and maintaining a drug trafficking place.\n\n- Larry Lee, WSAU, Wausau\n\nMan convicted in drug-related murder of toddler\n\nMILWAUKEE -- A 22-year-old Milwaukee man has been convicted of killing 13-month-old Bill Thao, while firing bullets that were meant to be shot at a neighbor's house.\n\nA jury deliberated for two hours Thursday, before it found Darmequaye Cohill guilty of being parties to reckless homicide and reckless endangerment. He's scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 14.\n\nPolice said the toddler was playing with toys when Cohill and two others fired shots into his house the day after Christmas last year. His ex-girlfriend said the events were triggered by an argument she had with Cohill because he was seeing another woman.\n\nShe made posts on social media which resulted in a rival dealer selling heroin to one of Cohill's customers and the shootings were intended for the rival's house.\n\nOnline court records show that Cohill still has trials scheduled in late January and early February on two other charges -- conspiracy to commit forcible armed robbery, and possessing heroin with the intent to sell it.\n\nVictim in fatal suburban crash was rushing grandchild to clinic\n\nBROWN DEER -- A driver killed in a suburban Milwaukee crash was rushing to get his granddaughter to a medical clinic to resolve allergy problems. The medical examiner's office provided the background Thursday about the death of Dwayne Walker, age 59.\n\nBrown Deer Police said Walker was driving 60- to 90 miles an hour on a business street Tuesday afternoon, when his vehicle hit a block structure at a car wash.\n\nAuthorities say his wife asked her husband to stop the vehicle because the child was vomiting and developing hives. He reportedly said he could keep driving. Officials say the unit hit the cinder-block structure at 75 miles an hour.\n\nNeither the woman nor the child were seriously injured.\n\nMilwaukee man charged with reckless homicide in heroin death\n\nMILWAUKEE -- A 41-year-old Milwaukee man is accused of delivering heroin to a Cedarburg woman who died after using it.\n\nJustin Story was charged Wednesday in Ozaukee County with one count of first-degree reckless homicide.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, 26-year-old Heather Bintzler was found unresponsive and turning blue at a home in Cedarburg in September.\n\nA man at the home told officials that Bintzler had snorted either heroin or cocaine about two hours earlier.\n\nMedical personnel administered Narcan, a drug that can reverse a heroin overdose, but they were unable to revive Bintzler.\n\nOfficials got Bintzler's cellphone and tracked a series of text messages with someone identified as \"Justin S.\" regarding a drug exchange.\n\nMadison school volunteer arrested for sexual assault\n\nMADISON -- A Madison school volunteer is suspected of sexually assaulting a student this week.\n\nPolice say 20-year-old Matthew V.

Four of the children were thrown from the vehicle, which rolled over after hitting a guardrail on southbound Hwy. 51 near Mineral Point.\n\nIt's also possible that 29-year-old Tiana Stewart, of Rockford, Ill. could face criminal charges, depending on what officials learn from the crash investigation.\n\nThose involved in the crash all had been treated and released from hospitals as of Tuesday.\n\nStewart was headed to Iowa from the Chicago area at the time of the crash.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,region,wisconsin,Agriculture,Outdoors,Politics,Crime,accidents", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "New Richmond News", "description": "WASHINGTON D.C. -- Wisconsin House Republicans Sean Duffy and Glenn Grothman were among a small minority who voted against a five-year federal transportation package.\r\nThe House passed the $305 billion compromise 359- to 65 on Thursday, and the Senate later voted 83- to 16 to send it to President Ob...", "title": "Congress passes transportation funding, Obama expected to sign;...", "url": "http://www.newrichmond-news.com/news/region/3896367-congress-passes-transportation-funding-obama-expected-sign-cheesemakers-widen", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.newrichmond-news.com/sites/all/themes/newrichmondnews_theme/images/touch-icon.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON D.C. -- Wisconsin House Republicans Sean Duffy and Glenn Grothman were among a small minority who voted against a five-year federal transportation package.\r\nThe House passed the $305 billion compromise 359- to 65 on Thursday, and the Senate later voted 83- to 16 to send it to President Ob...", "title": "Congress passes transportation funding, Obama expected to sign;...", "url": "http://www.newrichmond-news.com/news/region/3896367-congress-passes-transportation-funding-obama-expected-sign-cheesemakers-widen", "image": "http://www.newrichmond-news.com/sites/all/themes/newrichmondnews_theme/images/touch-icon.png", "site": "newrichmondnews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 274677719346518}, "keywords": "News,region,wisconsin,Agriculture,Outdoors,Politics,Crime,accidents", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newrichmondnews", "tag": "News,region,wisconsin,Agriculture,Outdoors,Politics,Crime,accidents", "modified_time": "2015-12-04T09:25:29-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "WASHINGTON D.C. -- Wisconsin House Republicans Sean Duffy and Glenn Grothman were among a small minority who voted against a five-year federal transportation..."}, "article_summary": "Congress passes transportation funding, Obama expected to sign; cheesemakers widen state's production lead; 10 more Wisconsin news storiesWASHINGTON D.C. -- Wisconsin House Republicans Sean Duffy and Glenn Grothman were among a small minority who voted against a five-year federal transportation package.\nWisconsin extends run as nation's top cheese-makerWASHINGTON D.C. -- Wisconsin has extended its lead as the nation's top cheese-maker.\nThe Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources said its preliminary numbers from Tuesday over-reported the statewide harvest by almost 3,000 deer.\nNew United States Department of Agriculture show that the Badger State pumped out 264 million pounds of cheese in October.\nThe corrected numbers show that Wisconsin hunters killed almost 202,000 deer in the season which ended last Sunday."}
