The complaint alleges Catalist LLC, the Democratic National Committee and more than 300 Democrat campaigns have broken federal election law.\n\nA \u201cprogressive\u201d data and technology vendor based in Washington, D.C., Catalist is backed by the National Education Association, Service Employees International Union and the AFL-CIO and its member unions \u2014 because of its ideological goals and its ties to the Democratic Party.\n\nCatalist founder Harold Ickes is a former deputy chief of staff to President Bill Clinton and an adviser to the Ready for Hillary super PAC. Catalist founder Laura Quinn is a former deputy chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore.\n\nThe company is not shy about its political objectives. Catalist\u2019s mission is to \u201cprovide progressive organizations with the data and services needed to better identify, understand, and communicate with the people they need to persuade and mobilize.\u201d\n\nAFL-CIO Political Director Michael Podhorzer co-chairs Catalist\u2019s board of managers. NEA Political Director Karen White and SEIU Executive Vice President Kirk Adams are Catalist board members.\n\nAs The Washington Free Beacon first reported, Catalist may have frequently violated laws restricting coordination between political committees and outside groups.\n\nIn addition to selling contact list access and related services to Democrat campaigns, Catalist and NGP VAN \u2014 another data firm named in the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust complaint \u2014 work with unions and other activist groups.\n\nCatalist and its various clients share one goal: electing Democrats. SEIU bosses credited Catalist with President Obama\u2019s election and other Democrat victories in 2008.\n\n\u201cCatalist provided data services to SEIU and a substantial majority of the progressive and political communities in the 2008 election,\u201d a 2009 SEIU report explained.\n\n\u201cBecause Catalist users uploaded IDs from much of their voter contact work to the Catalist database, they were able to compile an increasingly more accurate picture of the American electorate,\u201d the report continued.\n\nThe company has provided Democrat campaigns with \u201cexcessive, source-prohibitied, and unreported in-kind contributions,\u201d has exchanged campaign and Democratic Party data \u201cwith soft money groups making independent expenditures\u201d and is \u201cestablished, financed, maintained and/or controlled\u201d by the Democratic Party, FACT asserted in its FEC complaint.\n\n\u201cThis is a politically-motivated filing without merit,\u201d Catalist spokeswoman Amy Weiss said in an email response to a Watchdog.org inquiry.\n\nMaterials from secretive leftist donor network Democracy Alliance obtained by the Free Beacon suggest DA sees for-profit data vendors as a way to skirt campaign finance law. DA and left-wing billionaire George Soros have been Catalist supporters since the company\u2019s 2006 launch.\n\n\u201cMr. Soros and other alliance donors were early investors in Catalist, and many of the groups funded by the alliance now buy data from it,\u201d The New York Times noted in a 2013 story.\n\nAlthough NEA, SEIU and AFL-CIO are not named in the FEC complaint against Catalist, they and other unions have paid the firm $10,473,521 since 2007. Unions also are key donors to DA\u2019s \u201cCommittee on States\u201d project.\n\nUnions have paid Catalist more than $1 million each year since 2009. In 2012 alone, unions paid Catalist $1,753,497.\n\nBased on their annual reports to the U.S. Department of Labor, these labor unions have made payments to Catalist:\n\nAFL-CIO: $3,110,629\n\nNEA: $2,965,542\n\nSEIU: $1,954,600\n\nUnited Food & Commercial Workers: $1,083,500\n\nChange to Win: $840,000\n\nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees: $438,750\n\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters: $80,500\n\nOf the payments to Catalist reported, $590,000 from Change to Win and $188,500 from UFCW were filed as \u201cRepresentational Activities.\u201d In the 26 states without right-to-work laws, unions can take money for representational activities from nonmembers as a condition of employment.\n\nChange to Win is a coalition led by SEIU, whose membership includes hundreds of thousands of public-sector workers. AFL-CIO\u2019s largest affiliates are AFSCME and American Federation of Teachers, which are both public-sector unions.\n\nNEA, the largest labor union in the country, represents public school teachers and had nearly 3 million members as of Aug. 31.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Labor unions have paid Catalist, a consulting firm accused of illegal coordination with hundreds of Democratic campaigns, over $10 million since 2007.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Labor unions have paid Catalist, a consulting firm accused of illegal coordination with hundreds of Democratic campaigns, over $10 million since 2007.", "title": "Unions throw millions at data firm accused of breaking election law - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/HaroldIckesAP.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-25T08:56:57+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/201420/union-illegal-coordination/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Labor unions have paid Catalist, a consulting firm accused of illegal coordination with hundreds of Democratic campaigns, over $10 million since 2007.", "creator": "@jasonahart", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/HaroldIckesAP.jpg"}, "title": "Unions throw millions at data firm accused of breaking election law - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-02-24T04:00:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-25T08:56:57+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "NEA, AFL-CIO, SEIU, Catalist, Michael Podhorzer, Harold Ickes, Ready for Hillary, Service Employees International Union, National Education Association"}, "article_summary": "In 2012 alone, unions paid Catalist $1,753,497.\nBy Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgLabor unions have paid Catalist, a consulting firm accused of illegal coordination with hundreds of Democratic campaigns, more than $10 million since 2007.\nThe complaint alleges Catalist LLC, the Democratic National Committee and more than 300 Democrat campaigns have broken federal election law.\nUnions have paid Catalist more than $1 million each year since 2009.\n\u201cCatalist provided data services to SEIU and a substantial majority of the progressive and political communities in the 2008 election,\u201d a 2009 SEIU report explained."}
