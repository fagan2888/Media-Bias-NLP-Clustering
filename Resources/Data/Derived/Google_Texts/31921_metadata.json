Then came an incredible flurry of touchdowns \u2014 five over the final 125 seconds \u2014 that truly made this a one-of-a-kind, unforgettable football game.\n\nAfter Joe Flacco threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to rookie Marlon Brown with 4 seconds left to give the Baltimore Ravens a 29-26 victory over the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday, the Ravens couldn\u2019t contain their excitement.\n\n\u201cDo you believe in miracles?\u201d cornerback Jimmy Smith shouted as he ran off the field.\n\n\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Ravens kicker Justin Tucker exclaimed.\n\nAnd Jacoby Jones, who took a kickoff back 77 yards for a touchdown during the back-and-forth excitement, said, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even get emotional. It was too confusing.\u201d\n\nBrown\u2019s catch concluded a five-play, 80-yard drive that took only 41 seconds.\n\nBefore that:\n\n\u2014Dennis Pitta, in his season debut following a hip injury, caught a 1-yard, fourth-down pass from Flacco for a 15-12 lead with 2:05 remaining.\n\n\u2014Toby Gerhart, subbing for an injured Adrian Peterson, ran 41 yards to put Minnesota up 19-15 with 1:27 to go.\n\n\u2014 Jones went the distance with the ensuing kickoff to give Baltimore a 22-19 edge with 1:16 left.\n\n\u2014 Matt Cassel threw a 79-yard touchdown pass to Cordarrelle Patterson with 45 seconds to play.\n\nThen the Ravens (7-6) answered with one final salvo.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a game like that before,\u201d Baltimore linebacker Terrell Suggs said. \u201cBesides the Super Bowl, that\u2019s probably the most special win I\u2019ve been a part of. Crazy game.\u201d\n\nBaltimore (7-6) has its first three-game winning streak of the season and the inside track for the second AFC wild card.\n\nMinnesota (3-9-1) lost Peterson in the second quarter with an ankle injury, then dropped a game it appeared to have won. Twice.\n\n\u201cThere were so many momentum shifts in the last couple of minutes, it seemed like the game would never end,\u201d Cassel said.\n\nPeterson, the NFL\u2019s leading rusher and 2012 MVP, hurt his right foot in the second quarter after catching a short pass and being tackled near the sideline by linebacker Arthur Brown.\n\n\u201cWe did X-rays, and it came back pretty clear,\u201d said Peterson, who finished with 13 yards on seven carries. \u201cThe next step is to get an MRI done (Monday) and find out more.\u201d\n\nGerhart gained 89 yards on 15 attempts. Cassel went 17 for 28 yards for 265 yards.\n\nFlacco completed 28 of 50 passes for 245 yards and three interceptions.\n\n\u201cIt was unlikely that we win this game today,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we did.\u201d\n\nThe Vikings took their first lead, 12-7, when Cassel threw an 8-yard pass to Jerome Simpson after an interception by safety Andrew Sendejo. Baltimore then moved to the Minnesota 21 before Vonta Leach was stuffed on a fourth-and-1.\n\nThat appeared huge, but the teams had plenty of time left to run up and down the sloppy field.\n\n\u201cYou think you\u2019ve seen everything and then a game like this happens,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cTo sum it up in one word, it was pandemonium.\u201d\n\nMinnesota went to overtime in each of its previous two games. And then this.\n\n\u201cThese losses, you don\u2019t practice this hard to come up short,\u201d coach Leslie Frazier said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough for our guys, it\u2019s tough for our staff, it\u2019s very disappointing. You practice and work as hard as we do to get wins, and you\u2019ve got to be able to make those plays to get those wins.\u201d\n\nBefore the game and in the first quarter, small tractors with plows and workers with shovels tried to clear the snow, to no avail. After the snow let up, tractors moved it from between the hash marks and shovels cleared the yard lines.\n\nThe wet football and messy field had an immediate impact. Flacco underthrew his receiver and was intercepted by Chad Greenway to end the opening possession, and the Vikings\u2018 second drive ended when Gerhart fumbled. The ball was recovered by safety Matt Elam at the Minnesota 25, and Flacco slipped and skidded for 22 yards before passing to Ed Dickson for a 1-yard touchdown.\n\nIt became apparent early that scoring would be difficult, and more so for the Vikings after Peterson left. So Frazier kept his offense on the field on a fourth-and-3 at the Baltimore 38. The Vikings converted to set up a 39-yard field goal by Blair Walsh \u2014 a kick that followed a good deal of preparation by holder Jeff Locke, who used a towel to clear the placement spot.\n\nWalsh added a 40-yarder in the third quarter after Cassel completed a 19-yard pass to Greg Jennings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joe Flacco threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to rookie Marlon Brown with 4 seconds left to ice Baltimore's 29-26 victory Sunday.
