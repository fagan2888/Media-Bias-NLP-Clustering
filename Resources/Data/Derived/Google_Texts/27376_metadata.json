Now all he has to do is put on a red cape.\n\nIt became painfully clear that it will take Superman to save this Colorado Buffaloes season. Arizona State became the third straight Pac-12 opponent to ground them into buffalo burger, chewing them up just as the meager crowd did the buffalo burgers served in the Sun Devil Stadium concession stands.\n\nThe Sun Devils humiliated Colorado, 54-13, bringing back nightmarish flashbacks of 2012. The only difference is Saturday night revealed a glimpse at possibly a bright future.\n\nLiufau, the true freshman who led Bellarmine Prep in Tacoma to last year\u2019s Washington state title game, showed signs of belonging with a lot of peach fuzz thrown in. In his first series, he entered in the first quarter and led the Buffs (2-3, 0-3 Pac-12) on an 11-play, 80-yard scoring drive.\n\nHe hit 5-of-6 passes for 64 yards, culminating in a 10-yard slant to Nelson Spruce for a touchdown.\n\nUnfortunately, it only made it ASU, 25-6.\n\n\u201cThe way I\u2019d like to look at the rest of the year is we took a redshirt off a young man that we think is very talented, we think is very bright, we think is an excellent leader,\u201d first-year coach Mike MacIntyre said. \u201cWe\u2019d like to be able to hopefully play him the rest of the year \u2014 if he plays good.\u201d\n\nThe way the season had gone, Liufau couldn\u2019t stay too comfortable on the bench. Junior Connor Wood entered the game having hit only 37 percent of his passes in two Pac-12 blowouts. Saturday he hit rock bottom. He went 0-for-4 and when he threw an interception right to cornerback Lloyd Carrington while running out of bounds, it was time to change the offense\u2019s direction.\n\n\u201cConnor\u2019s has done some good things for us and I really, really like Connor but he hasn\u2019t had a winning grade in four games now,\u201d said MacIntyre who said Liufau is the new starter. \u201cI felt it was time to make a little bit of a change there just like I would at any position.\u201d\n\nFrom the start of spring, Colorado\u2019s staff loved the 6-foot-4, 210-pound Liufau. They loved his accuracy, poise and speed but they didn\u2019t want to use him too soon. Now they\u2019re using him before it\u2019s too late.\n\nHe wound up 18-of-26 for 169 yards but he also threw two interceptions, was called for intentional grounding from the end zone for a safety and lost a fumbled snap.\n\n\u201cI felt like I left a lot of plays out there,\u201d Liufau said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really take care of the ball. I threw two picks, had a safety and a fumble. That hurts the team a lot.\n\n\u201cEven though coming in as a backup, that\u2019s unacceptable. I let the team down.\u201d\n\nMacIntyre did have a choice. Senior Jordan Webb, last year\u2019s starter, was cleared to play from a torn ACL in the spring. But MacIntyre said Webb would only play if Wood had to sit out a play or two due to injury or getting his helmet knocked off.\n\nAlso, for the second time in three weeks, the offense forgot it had the nation\u2019s second-leading receiver in yards per game. Paul Richardson didn\u2019t catch a pass until the third quarter. It went for one yard. He finished with four for 39 yards but this offense had all the spark of a soggy firecracker.\n\n\u201cWe tried to throw the ball to Paul Richardson early and often,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThey were doubling him early and often.\u201d\n\nDefensively, that rebuilding job will take longer than expected. The progress from two opening wins over Colorado State and Central Arkansas has been erased by horses when stepping up in class.\n\nStanding 115th nationally in total defense entering the game, the Buffaloes will be knocking on the door of the national basement. ASU (4-2, 2-1) had 392 yards at halftime before emptying the bench. It finished with 532 yards. It scored four touchdowns and a field goal in its first five possessions.\n\nIn three league games, Colorado has been outscored 155-46.\n\n\u201cI think we match up physically pretty well,\u201d said linebacker Addison Gillam who had four tackles, almost nine below his average. \u201cIt\u2019s just not being in the right place.\u201d\n\nWith the season starting to reel out of control, Colorado may get a break Saturday when it hosts Charleston Southern, an FCS school that\u2019s replacing the flooded-out Fresno State game from Sept. 14.\n\nWhile MacIntyre will use every trick to keep his players\u2019 heads up, what\u2019s he doing for his own? Even in his inaugural 1-12 season at San Jose State in 2010 he didn\u2019t get beat this bad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to blame players or I\u2019m not going to blame coaches,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cI\u2019m going to say it\u2019s a process. It\u2019s truly a process. I wouldn\u2019t be here if we didn\u2019t have a long way to go.\u201d\n\nThat process won\u2019t necessarily get any easier, regardless of the opponent.\n\nAfter all, Charleston Southern is 7-0.\n\nJohn Henderson: jhenderson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnhendersondp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mike MacIntyre takes red shirt off Colorado QB Sefo Liufau", "title": "Mike MacIntyre takes red shirt off Colorado QB Sefo Liufau", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/12/mike-macintyre-takes-red-shirt-off-colorado-qb-sefo-liufau/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131013__sefo-liufau-buffsp1.jpg", "height": 420}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131013__sefo-liufau-buffsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-13T01:08:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T10:39:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb3f6\"", "article_summary": "The progress from two opening wins over Colorado State and Central Arkansas has been erased by horses when stepping up in class.\nIt became painfully clear that it will take Superman to save this Colorado Buffaloes season.\nAlso, for the second time in three weeks, the offense forgot it had the nation\u2019s second-leading receiver in yards per game.\nHe hit 5-of-6 passes for 64 yards, culminating in a 10-yard slant to Nelson Spruce for a touchdown.\nEven in his inaugural 1-12 season at San Jose State in 2010 he didn\u2019t get beat this bad."}
