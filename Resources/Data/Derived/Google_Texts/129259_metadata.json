The company\u2019s online business hasn\u2019t grown fast enough to make up the difference.\n\nEven as the broader stock market posted strong gains over the past year, shares of the New York-based company have plunged nearly 50 percent. Wall Street analysts aren\u2019t sure if the business will ever recover.\n\n\u201cThe consumer has changed and we haven't kept pace,\u201d CEO Jim Chambers, who joined the company in August, said during the company\u2019s latest earnings conference call. \u201cWe need to turn this company inside out. Frankly, I'm not sure if it's inside out or upside down, I just know that to win, we need to change.\u201d\n\nRelated: 11 Celebs Who Have Dieted for Dollars\n\nAmericans spend roughly $66 billion annually on diets and low calorie products such as sodas. But when it comes to the actual process of dieting, many chose to do it on their own. Only 1 in 10 dieters works with a formal program, a trend evident in Weight Watchers\u2019 financials.\n\nThe company is expected to report results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013 next month, but Wall Street\u2019s expectations for the company are low. Analysts expect double-digit revenue declines in the next two quarters and declines in profit. During the three months ended September 28, attendance at meetings plunged nearly 15 percent to 9.5 million, continuing a trend that began in 2011. The company\u2019s North American meetings business reported revenue of $163.7 million, down 13.7 percent on a year-over-year basis. Sales at WeightWatchers.com rose 1 percent to $125.5 million.\n\nIn announcing those results, Chambers also warned, \u201c2014 will be a very challenging year.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe meetings business used to be their big money-maker,\u201d says Kurt Frederick, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, adding that he expects the declines to continue for at least the next few years. \u201cThey have a lot of challenges.\u201d Frederick has a \u201cneutral\u201d rating on Weight Watchers stock.\n\nWall Street analysts aren\u2019t convinced yet that Chambers can help the company combat the surging growth of apps such as MyFitnessPal, which has 40 million users. These programs enable users to keep track of the calories they consume and some also work in conjunction with activity bands, the increasingly popular wearable gadgets that track physical activity.\n\nA Weight Watchers spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment for this story, but Chambers told analysts that, despite the \u201ceasily understandable appeal\u201d of weight-loss apps, the company did not think they would solve the obesity epidemic.\n\nRelated: Why Obesity Will Kill More of Us Than We Thought\n\nThat may be, but Weight Watchers\u2019 more traditional rivals have also been eating its lunch, even as they\u2019ve experienced some troubles of their own. Nutrisystem (NASDAQ: NTRI) is in the midst of a turnaround and Medifast (NYSE: MED), another publicly traded diet company, expects 2014 to be better than last year as it shutters underperforming diet centers and converts other locations to franchises.\n\nUnder CEO Dawn Zier, Nutrisystem, which is based in Fort Washington, PA, has begun a push into retail stores that appears to be paying off. It tested selling prepared healthy meals last year in Walmart stores and plans to do a similar trial this year at Target. Shares of Nutrisystem have surged 65 percent over the past year.\n\nIn an interview, Zier argued that diet programs such as Nutrisystem could be competitive in the changing marketplace. \u201cIf it were easy (to lose weight), we would all be thin,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cNot everyone thinks they can do it on their own and be successful.\u201d\n\nWhile admitting that the diet apps are useful, Weight Watchers has said that people are more successful at losing weight if they work in a structured program. That\u2019s a view backed up by dieticians. \u201cMobile apps seem to be engaging people for short periods of time but unless they provide tips for behavior change, feedback on change, more incentives for change they tend to not provide long-term motivation,\u201d says Connie Diekman, former president of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, in an email. \u201cDiet programs that include personal meetings foster longer term changes. The inclusion of mobile apps in diet programs seems to serve as an aid to change and keeping people involved yielding more weight loss.\u201d\n\nWeight Watchers' Chambers has tried to woo customers by making its program easier to use as it continues to cut costs and \u201creimagine\u201d its core offerings. It recently announced Simple Start, a two-week long program aimed at people starting their diets that enables them to choose from a suggested menu of healthy foods.\n\nWeight Watchers is also trying to encourage companies to offer its programs to their employees as part of their benefits. Companies are eager to control their health care expenses and the costs associated with obesity are staggering \u2013 $147 billion annually, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nColin Watts, the head of Weight Watchers Health Solutions \u2013 the company arm aimed at businesses \u2013 noted during a recent industry conference that Weight Watchers expects the business to grow from $75 million in revenue to $318 million in 2018.\n\nWeight Watchers, though, will need to increase its appeal to consumers as well.\n\nUnfortunately, much like dieting, that is easier to talk about than to do, especially given that Weight Watchers is competing against apps that serve a similar function at little or no cost. The pioneering weight loss company needs to change with the times or else growth will become increasingly hard to find.\n\nThis article has been updated to correct Nutrisystem's retail availability and testing plans.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Weight Watchers, which has helped millions of people shed unwanted pounds over the past five decades, has been doing some slimming down of its own \u2013 and not the healthy kind.", "title": "The Flabby Business of Shrinking Waistlines", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/03/Weight-Watchers-and-Flabby-Business-Shrinking-Waistlines", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/01102013_trillion_weight.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/03/Weight-Watchers-and-Flabby-Business-Shrinking-Waistlines", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/01102013_trillion_weight.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Weight Watchers, which has helped millions of people shed unwanted pounds over the past five decades, has been doing some slimming down of its own \u2013 and not the healthy kind.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Only 1 in 10 dieters works with a formal program, a trend evident in Weight Watchers\u2019 financials.\nWeight Watchers, though, will need to increase its appeal to consumers as well.\n\u201cThey have a lot of challenges.\u201d Frederick has a \u201cneutral\u201d rating on Weight Watchers stock.\nColin Watts, the head of Weight Watchers Health Solutions \u2013 the company arm aimed at businesses \u2013 noted during a recent industry conference that Weight Watchers expects the business to grow from $75 million in revenue to $318 million in 2018.\nWeight Watchers is also trying to encourage companies to offer its programs to their employees as part of their benefits."}
