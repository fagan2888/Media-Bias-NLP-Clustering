Colorado added to its 2015 recruiting class Saturday when Regis Jesuit offensive lineman Tim Lynott committed to the Buffaloes, Rivals.com reported.

Lynott, a 6-foot-4, 295-pound guard, had scholarship offers from a number of major programs, including Oregon, UCLA, Arkansas and Kansas State. He is ranked as a four-star prospect by several recruiting services.

Lynott is Colorado’s fifth verbal commitment for the 2015 class.

A commitment is non-binding until a player signs a national letter of intent.

Lynott announced he is verbally committing to play football at the University of Colorado Saturday via Twitter. “I’m proud to say I’ve decided to stay home and play football for the University of Colorado! #GoBuffs,” he tweeted.

Lynott is rated a four-star recruit by ESPN, Rivals and Scout. He is the fifth verbal commitment for CU’s 2015 class.
