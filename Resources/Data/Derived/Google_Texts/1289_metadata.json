But whether they turn out to be the norm or the exception won't be known until October.\n\nThe federal agency in charge of Obamacare revealed on Monday afternoon details of many of the Obamacare insurance plans requesting premium rate hikes of 10 percent or more for 2016.\n\n(Tweet this)\n\nThe data, which can be accessed at RateReview.HealthCare.gov. includes exactly how much more an insurer wants to charge next year, and the justification for that increase.\n\nBut information about lesser price increases being proposed, or even proposed price decreases, were not released.

More than 329,000 current Blue Cross Blue Shield Customers are in those or similar plans now.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield, in its rate filing wrote, \"The main driver of the increase in the proposed rates is that the actual claims experience of the members in these individual ... policies is significantly higher than expected.\"", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "The federal government disclosed proposed rate increases of 10 percent or more for Obamacare health insurance plans.", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health insurance, CMS, premiums", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Many of the proposed rate increases of 10 percent or more for Obamacare health insurance plans have been revealed.", "title": "Will these big Obamacare rates get approved?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/01/will-these-big-obamacare-rates-get-approved.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/06/24/101785774-479745177.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many of the proposed rate increases of 10 percent or more for Obamacare health insurance plans have been revealed.", "creator": "@_DanMangan", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/01/will-these-big-obamacare-rates-get-approved.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/06/24/101785774-479745177.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "Will these big Obamacare rates get approved?", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, Health Insurance, Politics, US: News, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-06-01T18:29:47-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2015-06-02T13:36:42-0400", "tag": "US: News"}, "pageNodeId": 102723185, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "article_summary": "There are some eye-popping proposed Obamacare rate increases for next year.\nThe federal agency in charge of Obamacare revealed on Monday afternoon details of many of the Obamacare insurance plans requesting premium rate hikes of 10 percent or more for 2016.\nBoth plans sold on government-run Obamacare exchanges and ones sold off those exchange are included on RateReview.HealthCare.gov.\nMore than 329,000 current Blue Cross Blue Shield Customers are in those or similar plans now.\nRead MoreGOP Obamacare 'fix' has big risksA check of the site for Georgia found that Aetna HMO plan sold on HealthCare.gov is seeking a 15.57 percent increase in its monthly premiums."}
