"The president and First Lady continue to be appreciative of the respect that the White House press corps has shown their daughters and the privacy that's been afforded them even in a pretty competitive media environment," White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters aboard Air Force One.

According to The Wrap, the elder Obama daughter, who turns 16 next month, has been working on "Extant," a CBS sci-fi drama starring Halle Berry.

The website quoted a source on the set saying Malia Obama "helped with computer shop alignments and the director also let her slate a take."

In the series, Berry plays an astronaut who returns to Earth after spending a year alone in outer space.

The New Yorker reported earlier this year that Malia was an aspiring filmmaker.

Spielberg is a prominent supporter of the presidentâ€™s and a top donor to Democratic causes.

The president and first lady spent Father's Day weekend at a vacation home in Palm Springs outside of Los Angeles.
