HOUSTON, Feb. 14 (UPI) -- Fire investigators said they found evidence of accelerant used in an early morning fire at an Islamic center in Houston and are trying to determine if the arson was a hate crime.

Fire officials said the fire at the Quba Islamic Institute began about 5 a.m. Friday and leveled a building on the Islamic center's grounds that was to be used as a storage facility for an upcoming renovation project. The mosque was not damaged and no one was injured.

Ahsan Zahid, assistant imam at the institute, said some items on the grounds were also vandalized. He said the fire started at the back of the building and moved through the 3,000-square-foot building that was being used to store computers, monitors, lights and everything else they planned to use in the renovations.

"The fire was so destructive that it completely destroyed our building - everything that was in the building and even the roof is falling in," he said on a video posted to Facebook.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations called for state and federal investigators to monitor the situation.

"Given the unprecedented level of anti-Muslim rhetoric in our society, it would only be prudent to investigate a possible bias motive for this apparent arson attack," Ruth Nasrullah, a spokeswoman for the organization, said.
