Scott Walker is accustomed to harsh criticism. Usually it comes from his political left \u2013 workers angry about union busting, environmentalists angry about giveaways to energy companies \u2013 and not from the political right.\n\nBut on Wednesday, after news broke that Walker had fired a new social media director apparently to placate the Iowa Republican Party, the heaviest incoming fire came from his right flank.\n\nRelated: Scott Walker Is Stealing Christie\u2019s Playbook\n\nThe employee in question, Liz Mair, is a well-known and respected operative who has worked for Walker before as well as for the Republican National Committee. Shortly after her hiring was announced, though, tweets she\u2019d posted earlier this year criticizing political events in Iowa, including the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary status, were dug up. It wasn\u2019t long before state party officials, including Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann, were insulting her on the record as \u201cshallow and ignorant\u201d and calling on Walker to give Mair \u201cher walking papers.\u201d\n\nMair announced her resignation early Wednesday morning.\n\nA top political strategist for Walker, Rick Wiley, said in a statement, \u201cWe accept those who have a variety of viewpoints on issues but what we ultimately must have is absolute respect for people across the country. Our American Revival is an organization formed to promote bold reforms across the country and we\u2019re going to continue advocating for those ideals.\u201d\n\nThe backlash from conservatives, though, over the Mair decision has been swift. Writing at The Federalist, Sean Davis went after Walker for what may seem a pattern of concessions designed to help him secure victory in primary voting next year. (Walker has changed his views on federal ethanol mandates, which are popular in corn country, and has changed his stance on immigration, bringing him more in line with Iowa\u2019s heavily conservative caucus goers.)\n\nRelated: The Foreign Policy Minefield for Scott Walker and Other GOP Hopefuls\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough that Walker flip-flopped on ethanol to gain the favor of the ethanol lobby,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNow he and all the other candidates are apparently required to run all their staffing and contractor decisions by the head of a party that\u2019s only delivered the state to Republicans once in the last 30 years.\u201d\n\nDavis actually saved most of his bile for Iowa\u2019s Republican Party officials. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even a fight about policy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTech vendors and social media staffers have no say whatsoever when it comes to advising a presidential candidate on policy. That\u2019s not how campaigns work. This farmland fatwa is especially absurd given the record of Iowa Republicans when it comes to picking presidents. They\u2019re straight-up awful at it.\u201d\n\nWriting on the National Review website, Jonah Goldberg described Walker\u2019s apparent termination of Mair as a bad omen. \u201cIf Walker is the guy I hope he is (I\u2019ve been a booster), he won\u2019t just have to take on his enemies, he\u2019ll have to take on his friends, too\u2026 Isn\u2019t that the point of the anti-establishment movement on the right?\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI get that Walker needs to win Iowa and that staffers aren\u2019t more important than the candidate. But principles are. If Walker didn\u2019t want a critic of the Iowa caucuses on his payroll he shouldn\u2019t have hired one. But he did. And throwing her under the bus for this suggests not only that he\u2019s got some problems getting ready for prime time, it also suggests he can get rolled by the Iowa GOP establishment. What happens when he gets to Washington?\u201d\n\nRelated: GOP 2016: Scott Walker Has the Lead, Jeb Bush Has the Money\n\nThe ultra-right wing website Twitchy linked to a dozen tweets by well-known conservatives blasting Walker\u2019s decision.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Dave Weigel wrote that the loss of Mair not only deprives Walker of her and her team\u2019s experience, but sets up an unfortunate comparison with at least one of his GOP challengers.\n\n\u201cThe hire of Liz Mair was supposed to connect Walker to a network of journalists, bloggers, and influencers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cInstead, Walker ended up stoking a mini-crisis in the must-win caucus state, and ending the crisis by giving those influencers their third fresh example of him buckling under Hawkeye pressure. The contrast with Jeb Bush, who's been telling crowds that he won\u2019t change his stances on Common Core or immigration, does no good for Walker.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Wisconsin Gov.
