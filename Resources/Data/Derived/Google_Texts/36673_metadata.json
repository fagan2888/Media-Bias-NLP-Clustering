And there are powerful forces behind both tendencies. But those forces can be fought, and the place to start fighting is within yourself.\n\nWhat am I talking about here? \u201cDerp\u201d is a term borrowed from the cartoon \u201cSouth Park\u201d that has achieved wide currency among people I talk to, because it\u2019s useful shorthand for an all-too-obvious feature of the modern intellectual landscape: people who keep saying the same thing no matter how much evidence accumulates that it\u2019s completely wrong.\n\nThe quintessential example is fear mongering over inflation. It was, perhaps, forgivable for economists, pundits, and politicians to warn about runaway inflation some years ago, when the Federal Reserve was just beginning its efforts to help a depressed economy. After all, everyone makes bad predictions now and then.\n\nBut making the same wrong prediction year after year, never acknowledging past errors or considering the possibility that you have the wrong model of how the economy works \u2014 well, that\u2019s derp.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a lot of derp out there. Inflation derp, in particular, has become more or less a required position among Republicans. Even economists with solid reputations, whose professional work should have made them skeptical of inflation hysteria, have spent years echoing the paranoia of the goldbugs. And that tells you why derp abides: it\u2019s basically political.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt\u2019s an article of faith on the right that any attempt by the government to fight unemployment must lead to disaster, so the faithful must keep predicting disaster no matter how often it fails to materialize.\n\nStill, doesn\u2019t everyone do this? No, and that\u2019s where the cheap cynicism comes in.\n\nTrue, the peddlers of politically inspired derp are quick to accuse others of the same sin. For example, right at the beginning of the Obama administration Robert Lucas, a Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago, accused Christina Romer, the administration\u2019s chief economist, of intellectual fraud. Her analysis of fiscal policy, he declared, was just \u201ca very naked rationalization for policies that were already, you know, decided on for other reasons.\u201d\n\nIn general, anyone practicing some kind of Keynesian economics \u2014 an approach that, among other things, correctly predicted quiescent inflation and interest rates \u2014 is constantly accused of just looking for reasons to expand government.\n\nBut derp isn\u2019t universal. There\u2019s also plenty of genuine, honest analysis out there \u2014 and you don\u2019t have to be a technical expert to tell the difference.\n\nI\u2019ve already mentioned one telltale sign of derp: predictions that just keep being repeated no matter how wrong they\u2019ve been in the past. Another sign is the never-changing policy prescription, like the assertion that slashing tax rates on the wealthy, which you advocate all the time, just so happens to also be the perfect response to a financial crisis nobody expected.\n\nYet another is a call for long-term responses to short-term events \u2013 for example, a permanent downsizing of government in response to a recession.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: if you look at what Ms. Romer and many other Keynesians had to say, none of those telltale signs were present. They advocated deficit spending as a response to a severe downturn, not a universal elixir, and the measures they called for, like infrastructure spending and budget aid to state governments, were designed to be temporary rather than a permanent expansion (and the 2009 stimulus did, in fact, fade away on schedule.)\n\nSo derp isn\u2019t destiny. But how can you \u2013 whether you\u2019re a pundit, a policy maker, or just a concerned citizen \u2013 protect yourself against derpitude? The first line of defense, I\u2019d argue, is to always be suspicious of people telling you what you want to hear.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThus, if you\u2019re a conservative opposed to a stronger safety net, you should be extra skeptical about claims that health reform is about to crash and burn, especially coming from people who made the same prediction last year and the year before (Obamacare derp runs almost as deep as inflation derp).\n\nBut if you\u2019re a liberal who believes that we should reduce inequality, you should similarly be cautious about studies purporting to show that inequality is responsible for many of our economic ills, from slow growth to financial instability. Those studies might be correct \u2014 the fact is that there\u2019s less derp on America\u2019s left than there is on the right \u2014 but you nonetheless need to fight the temptation to let political convenience dictate your beliefs.\n\nFighting the derp can be hard, not least because it can upset friends who want to be reassured in their beliefs. But you should do it anyway: it\u2019s your civic duty.\u2610", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150608032105, "twitter": {"description": "Beware those telling you what you want to hear.", "title": "Fighting the Derp", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/08/opinion/paul-krugman-fighting-the-derp.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003724613"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "PaulKrugman", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/08/opinion/paul-krugman-fighting-the-derp.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003724613", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/08/opinion/paul-krugman-fighting-the-derp.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Fighting the Derp", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 8, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Inflation (Economics),Economics (Theory and Philosophy),Presidential Election of 2016,Republican Party,United States Politics and Government,Income Inequality", "CN": "paul-krugman", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Paul Krugman", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbLarge-v7.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By PAUL KRUGMAN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Beware those telling you what you want to hear.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-thumbStandard-v5.jpg", "description": "Beware those telling you what you want to hear.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 8, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-06-08", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Income Inequality", "published": "2015-06-08", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "08krugman", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150608161002, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/08/opinion/paul-krugman-fighting-the-derp.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/12/opinion/krugman-circular/krugman-circular-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Beware those telling you what you want to hear.", "title": "Fighting the Derp"}, "pdate": 20150608, "des": "Income Inequality", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/paul-krugman", "tagline": "Macroeconomics, trade, health care, social policy and politics.", "uri": "/column/paul-krugman", "display-name": "Paul Krugman", "identifier": "paul-krugman", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003724613, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Fighting the Derp", "col": "Op-Ed Columnist", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaac0\"", "article_summary": "Inflation derp, in particular, has become more or less a required position among Republicans.\nFor example, right at the beginning of the Obama administration Robert Lucas, a Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago, accused Christina Romer, the administration\u2019s chief economist, of intellectual fraud.\nBut how can you \u2013 whether you\u2019re a pundit, a policy maker, or just a concerned citizen \u2013 protect yourself against derpitude?\nI\u2019ve already mentioned one telltale sign of derp: predictions that just keep being repeated no matter how wrong they\u2019ve been in the past.\nFighting the derp can be hard, not least because it can upset friends who want to be reassured in their beliefs."}
