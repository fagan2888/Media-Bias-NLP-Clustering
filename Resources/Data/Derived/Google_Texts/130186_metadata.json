Four years after she gratuitously surrendered Ted Kennedy\u2019s Massachusetts Senate seat to Scott Brown (and, in the process, almost tanked the Affordable Care Act), Democrats\u2014brilliant strategists that they are\u2014decided to hand Coakley the Massachusetts gubernatorial nomination to blow as well. The former state attorney general did so in November, and now the overwhelmingly Democratic Commonwealth of Massachusetts\u2014which gave us Thanksgiving and gay marriage and kinda-sorta-health-care-for-most-people\u2014is being led by a Romney Republican who\u2019s balancing the budget by slashing funds to early-childhood education.\n\nTo address a $1.8 billion budget gap, Gov. Charlie Baker signed the state\u2019s $38.1 billion budget last week, with $162 million in line-item vetoes. Among the most controversial of these vetoes involves $17.6 million in cuts from grants to expand full-day kindergarten throughout the state. (Massachusetts, shockingly, does not have universal full-day kindergarten. Some communities pay for it with cobbled-together grants; in other municipalities, parents pay not-insignificant tuitions ranging from $950 to $4,650 a year.) There is now a mere $1 million in the program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nState Sen. Eric Lesser, a Democrat from Longmeadow, told me he has received more calls about the kindergarten budget cuts than any other item vetoed. \u201cThese were grants that were aimed at enhancing kindergarten access in high-poverty urban areas,\u201d Lesser said. In the city of Springfield alone, he said, \u201cIt would represent as much as a million dollars in cuts and require significant layoffs of teachers and paraprofessionals who help so much in the early years.\u201d\n\nHe went on, \u201cIt\u2019s a step in the wrong direction especially when you see so many other areas of the country like New York and D.C. and Connecticut expanding their early childhood education, and it will do lasting damage to the state\u2019s ability to be competitive.\u201d Lesser said that when the Legislature meets next week, it will try to find ways to reverse the kindergarten-grant cuts. The Massachusetts House numbers 125 Democrats to 35 Republicans, and 34 out of the Senate\u2019s 40 members are Democrats (cough, Martha Coakley), so an override is not a huge stretch.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Think progressive Massachusetts has good early-childhood-education access?
