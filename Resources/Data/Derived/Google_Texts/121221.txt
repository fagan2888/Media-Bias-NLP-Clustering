Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson briefly practiced with the team Sunday but will not make the three-game Canadian trip that begins Monday at Calgary, coach Patrick Roy said.

Johnson, who will be eight weeks out from knee surgery Monday, will remain in Colorado and skate at the practice facility.

However, the Avs will add a 22nd player on their charter in forward Jesse Winchester, who has suddenly recovered from post-concussion symptoms.

Winchester has not played the entire season, since suffering a concussion in a preseason game at Calgary, but said he emerged from a dark, depressing place about 10 days ago and is “feeling great.”

Roy said Winchester will participate in Monday’s morning skate and possibly play on the fourth line against the Flames. Winchester signed with the Avs as an unrestricted free agent last summer.
