A big-rig crashed near the Foster City Boulevard on-ramp, Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2014, causing the oil spill, according to the CHP.

The westbound lanes of the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge reopened Tuesday afternoon after being closed for about four hours because of a major collision and oil spill, according to the California Highway Patrol.

The crash happened at 8:56 a.m. when a big-rig carrying dry cement collided with two box trucks and two other vehicles in the westbound lanes of state Highway 92 near the Foster City Boulevard on-ramp, spilling diesel fuel onto the road, according to the CHP.

Officers started turning around westbound drivers at the bridge toll plaza in Hayward shortly after the crash. Two westbound lanes of the highway were reopened at 12:53 p.m. and the remaining two were reopened by 1:07 p.m., according to the CHP.

The driver of the big-rig was injured, but the CHP did not immediately disclose the driver's condition.
