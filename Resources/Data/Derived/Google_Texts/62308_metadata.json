Chan School of Public Health in Boston, said in a school news release.\n\n\"Our study suggests that insurance expansion is likely to have a large and meaningful effect on diagnosis and management of some of the most important chronic illnesses affecting the U.S. population,\" Salomon added.\n\nIn conducting the study, researchers looked at data from more than 28,000 people aged 20 to 64. All had participated in the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999-2012.\n\nThe investigators also relied on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office about the potential effects of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nInsured people were much more likely than uninsured people to receive a diagnosis for a chronic disease, including diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, the study said.\n\nEven if uninsured Americans were diagnosed with a chronic disease, those with insurance were more likely to have their condition under control, the study found. Those with insurance had better levels of blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol, the findings showed.\n\nThe study was published in the September issue of Health Affairs.\n\nThe researchers said the findings indicated that the U.S. health care system must be ready to provide high-quality care for increasing numbers of Americans being diagnosed with chronic diseases.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has more about the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/public-health-information-30/misc-insurance-news-424/more-americans-diagnosed-with-chronic-disease-under-affordable-care-act-703064.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/Images/editorial/exam_18247.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "More with insurance may lead to better treatment of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes", "title": "Obamacare Likely to Spur Rise in Chronic Disease Diagnoses: Study"}, "description": "More with insurance may lead to better treatment of high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd10c\"", "article_summary": "In conducting the study, researchers looked at data from more than 28,000 people aged 20 to 64.\nEven if uninsured Americans were diagnosed with a chronic disease, those with insurance were more likely to have their condition under control, the study found.\nInsured people were much more likely than uninsured people to receive a diagnosis for a chronic disease, including diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, the study said.\nThe researchers said the findings indicated that the U.S. health care system must be ready to provide high-quality care for increasing numbers of Americans being diagnosed with chronic diseases.\nAll had participated in the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999-2012."}
