He spoke about the farm crisis and how it relates to John Deere.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of John Deere and, look what we need in this country, we need jobs and we need to be able to export without being taxed to death. You know we take products with no tax, we send our product over there and they tax us to hell because we have people who don't know what they're doing. John Deere however is a great company, it's gonna do just fine,\u201d said Trump.\n\nJohn Deere was just named to the Forbes magazine list of America's Best Employers, ranking 38th of 500.\n\nTrump eventually arrived in Indianola where he spoke with students about business and education.\n\nHe didn't provide many details, but said his priorities, should he run would, include building up the military, reaching a new deal over nuclear weapons in Iran, and repealing ObamaCare.\n\n\"I would end ObamaCare and replace it with something terrific for far less money for the country and the people,\" Trump said. \"I would absolutely end it and replace it with a much better plan that is much less expensive. ObamaCare is a disaster.\"\n\nTrump will also hold a meet and greet in Ankeny at 6:00 p.m. You can RSVP for the event on the Polk County Republicans of Iowa Facebook page.\n\nTrump announced in March that he was launching a presidential exploratory committee.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "41.366309;-93.565278", "description": "INDIANOLA, Iowa -- Real estate developer and reality TV star Donald Trump was late to his speaking engagement at Simpson College in Indianola Wednesday morning.
