Federal authorities are demanding obedience, in complete disregard of religious conscience \u2014 and in a free society, the answer is no,\u201d Bush continued.\n\nThe former Florida governor did not mention the divisive issue of same-sex marriage in his speech, but focused heavily on the Affordable Care Act. He specifically referenced a group of nuns that fought the birth control mandate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m betting that when it comes to doing the right and good thing, the Little Sisters of the Poor know better than the regulators at the Department of Health and Human Services,\u201d Bush said. \u201cFrom the standpoint of religious freedom, you might even say it\u2019s a choice between the Little Sisters and Big Brother. And I\u2019m going with the Little Sisters.\u201d\n\nHe also played up the liberal penchant for pushing their agenda while portraying \u201creligious Americans as intolerant scolds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stories vary, year after year, but the storyline is getting familiar: The progressive political agenda is ready for its next great leap forward, and religious people or churches are getting in the way. Our friends on the left like to view themselves as the agents of change and reform, and you and I are supposed to just get with the program,\u201d Bush said, according to Politico.\n\nLiberty University, which was started by Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell, has become a major campaign ground in 2016. Sen. Ted Cruz launched his campaign there in March.\n\nBush has not yet announced his candidacy and only made a playful reference to his lofty presidential ambitions, according to the Washington Post.\n\nBush mentioned meeting Jonathan Falwell, a Lynchburg pastor who is the son of Liberty\u2019s founder and the brother of its current president, during his speech.\n\n\u201cHis dad used to be president, then his brother became president. Somehow \u2014 I don\u2019t know what it was \u2014 we really hit it off,\u201d Bush joked. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s in store for you Jonathan, but I\u2019m pulling for you, man.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Former Florida Gov.
