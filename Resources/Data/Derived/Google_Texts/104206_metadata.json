( Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images )\n\nObamacare is throwing the agricultural industry into a tailspin. Farm labor contractors who must now offer their workers health insurance are complaining loudly about the cost in their already low-margin business.\n\n\u2018No, no, no. My margin is 10 percent. And I have to increase expenses 10 percent? Well, that doesn\u2019t work.\u2019 Jesse Sandoval, farm labor contractor\n\nSome are also concerned that the forms they must file with the federal government under the Affordable Care Act will bring immigration problems to the fore: about half of the farm labor workforce in the U.S. is undocumented.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be some repercussions to it,\u201d says Jesse Sandoval, a farm labor contractor based in Stockton. \u201cI think there\u2019s going to be some things that cannot be ignored.\u201d\n\nSandoval came to an educational conference for farm labor contractors \u2014 essentially staffing agencies for field workers \u2014 held at the San Joaquin County Agricultural Center in Stockton last fall. Men with broad shoulders, wearing denim jackets and cowboy hats, sat in the audience, listening to lectures on a litany of laws and rules regulating their industry, including Obamacare\u2019s employer mandate.\n\nLast year, employers with 100 or more full-time employees had to offer health insurance to their workers or pay a stiff penalty. This year, employers with 50 to 99 full-time employees must comply.\n\nSandoval has about 100 workers on his payroll. When farmers need a crew to pick cherries or pumpkins or asparagus, they call him to send the workers. He needs to offer insurance this year, and he\u2019s smarting at the price tag. At $300 a month per employee, he\u2019s looking at a $30,000 monthly bill.\n\n\u201cYeah, no. No, no, no,\u201d Sandoval says about absorbing that into his budget. \u201cThe numbers aren\u2019t there. My margin is 10 percent. And I have to increase expenses 10 percent? Well, that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nSo, like a lot of contractors, he\u2019s passing the bill onto the farmers, who in turn are passing the bill onto the farmworkers. Under the Affordable Care Act, employees can be asked to contribute 9.5 percent of their income toward health premiums.\n\nBut for farmworkers who pick oranges or peaches for $10 an hour, that\u2019s still too much.\n\nAgostin Garcia says the two contractors he works for near Fresno offered him insurance directly. But when he saw the price tag, he turned them both down.\n\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019m the only one in my house who works. There\u2019s five of us in the family,\u201d he says in Spanish. \u201cIt just wouldn\u2019t work. Either I pay for health insurance, or I pay the rent and utilities.\u201d\n\nGarcia says only a fraction of his co-workers have signed up for coverage. He says when farm labor contractors hand out packets explaining the coverage, the page where workers reject it is right on top.\n\n\u201cI think they do it intentionally,\u201d Garcia says. \u201cThey comply with the laws, by saying, \u2018I offered.\u2019 But they know that nobody\u2019s going to accept it, they know that nobody\u2019s going to pay those amounts.\u201d\n\nThe cost isn\u2019t the only thing about Obamacare stressing people out in the ag industry. Some are worried about immigration problems. Employers have to file new health care forms with the IRS for all their workers, whether they accept the insurance or not.\n\nKaya Bromley, an attorney who advises employers in the farming industry about the Affordable Care Act, says the health law will make it harder for contractors to turn a blind eye when workers give them fraudulent documents.\n\n\u201cNow that there\u2019s more transparency because of all of the reporting, I think we\u2019re going to have a lot more data on how many illegal or undocumented workers we have,\u201d she says.\n\nAmong the contractors she consults for, Bromley has seen a range of quasi-legal and even illegal strategies to sidestep the health law.\n\n\u201cI have heard of employees who are choosing to opt out because they want to fly under the radar. I have also heard of employers who are urging the opt-out or at least encouraging it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I warn all of them that they are going to be in big trouble.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s still early. There\u2019s been no enforcement yet. The feds haven\u2019t made an example of anyone, Bromley says, and so employers are ignoring the fact that they could face penalties that run several thousand dollars per employee.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge. And no one\u2019s talking about the enormity of it,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen it plays out, and the penalties start getting assessed, that\u2019s when people will start having religion about it.\u201d\n\nFarm labor contractors say they\u2019re stuck in a Catch-22. The Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t cover undocumented immigrants, but contractors will get fined if they don\u2019t offer them coverage. Contractors aren\u2019t supposed to hire undocumented workers, but the president and Congress can\u2019t agree on what to do about the massive number of immigrants living and working here illegally.\n\nHow are contractors supposed to comply with the new health care law when the feds are deadlocked over how to update the immigration system?\n\n\u201cOur government, all they do is talk about it. They don\u2019t fix anything, they make everything worse,\u201d says Golinda Vela Chavez, who helps run a labor contracting company in Salinas.\n\nHer company started offering their employees insurance last year, at no cost to the workers, and she says, still, more than half of them turned down the coverage.\n\nThis year, the company has to start filing the paperwork with the IRS and she says it\u2019s been a nightmare.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t try to help you, they want to get you,\u201d she says. \u201cThey implement all these things, because they want to get you!\u201d\n\nOfelia Reyes just wants peace of mind. She\u2019s has been harvesting nectarines and tying grapevines in fields near Fresno for 20 years. She recently had a breast cancer scare. None of the contractors she works for have offered her insurance.\n\n\u201cNo, never. No one\u2019s ever offered me anything,\u201d she says in Spanish. \u201cAll they say is, \u2018Hurry up! Your ladder is waiting for you. Your co-workers are already over there.\u2019 That\u2019s how we live.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not just cost.
