Instead of getting fired, the official was promoted.\n\nRelated: Fed Workers Get Handcuffed Over Porn Problem\n\nOf the two EPA workers discovered watching porn on government computers at work, one was said to have been on sex sites two to six hours a day over the course of two years.\n\nLike the first employee, these EPA workers were not fired for their offenses and instead were put on paid administrative leave\u2014with each making around $120,000 a year, according to the IG.\n\nThe revelation sparked outrage by lawmakers last year and even inspired a legislation entitled TK that proposed a ban on federal workers watching porn on government property.\n\nNow, lawmakers are going a step further and demanding that the employees be fired.\n\n\"It is well past time someone is held accountable for these management failings,\" said Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT). \u201cWe have a duty and obligation to the American taxpayer to fire the people who are abusing the system.\"\n\nEPA Acting Deputy Administrator Stanley Meiburg said the officials weren\u2019t fired because the agency has been waiting for the conclusion of the U.S. attorney\u2019s investigation into the alleged misconduct.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time federal employees have been busted watching porn on the job. Last year, a Federal Communications Commission worker was caught watching up to eight hours of porn each week at work, the Washington Examiner reported. At the time, he defended himself, telling auditors that \u201che often does not have enough work to do and has free time.\u201d\n\nOf course, most departments have guidelines against inappropriate behavior, but Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) the sponsor of the Eliminating Pornography from Agencies Act says they aren\u2019t doing a good enough job enforcing the rules.\n\n\u201cWhile there are rules in place at most agencies to ban this kind of unprofessional and unacceptable workplace behavior, it continues to take place. There is absolutely no excuse for federal employees to be viewing or downloading pornographic materials on the taxpayers\u2019 dime,\u201d Meadows said.\n\nBut even with if Meadow\u2019s bill becomes law, it would be at agencies\u2019 discretion to decide whether to terminate an employee for committing this kind of offence.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Lawmakers grilled officials of the Environmental Protection Agency Thursday about why", "title": "Lawmakers Question Why EPA Porn Watchers Haven\u2019t Been Fired Yet", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/01/Lawmakers-Question-Why-EPA-Porn-Watchers-Haven-t-Been-Fired-Yet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03312014_Computer_Chains.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/01/Lawmakers-Question-Why-EPA-Porn-Watchers-Haven-t-Been-Fired-Yet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03312014_Computer_Chains.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Lawmakers grilled officials of the Environmental Protection Agency Thursday about why", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The revelation sparked outrage by lawmakers last year and even inspired a legislation entitled TK that proposed a ban on federal workers watching porn on government property.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time federal employees have been busted watching porn on the job.\nThere is absolutely no excuse for federal employees to be viewing or downloading pornographic materials on the taxpayers\u2019 dime,\u201d Meadows said.\nNow, lawmakers are going a step further and demanding that the employees be fired.\nRelated: Fed Workers Get Handcuffed Over Porn ProblemOf the two EPA workers discovered watching porn on government computers at work, one was said to have been on sex sites two to six hours a day over the course of two years."}
