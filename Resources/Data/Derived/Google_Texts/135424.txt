Hundreds of years before Jesus Christ is believed by many to have walked the Earth, prehistoric farmers left their footprints in the Sonoran desert near what is now Sunset Road and I-10. And in several weeks, all traces will be wiped away by new construction.

During a recent archaeological excavation that is part of the requirements for the upcoming Sunset Bridge Improvement Project, investigators unearthed the oldest footprints that have been found to date in Southern Arizona, according to the project's head archaeologist Ian Milliken.

The footprints date to 800 to 500 B.C.E. and were likely preserved when an ancient flood washed sands over the area, Milliken said.

All told, there are more than 100 footprints, coming from men, women, children, even dogs â€“ indicating that prehistoric people from this area had domesticated canines, he said.

Scientists have taken samples of the dirt to determine what used to grow in the farm fields, most likely corn and squash, he said.

But time marches on, and with the impending road project, the county is offering an opportunity for the public to view the site before it's gone. The media got a special tour Saturday in advance of the public opening.

Public tours will be offered every 30 minutes between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. on the following dates:

Sunday, Jan. 24

Friday, Jan. 29

Saturday, Jan. 30

Sunday, Jan. 31

Friday, Feb. 5

Saturday, Feb. 6

Sunday, Feb. 7

The site is on the west side of I-10 at the intersection with Sunset Road. A fenced dirt parking lot is at the southwest corner of the intersection, and access to the area requires a short walk over uneven terrain, according to a media release. Participants must wear close-toed shoes and should also wear sunscreen and hats and bring water.

An app with a 3-D model of the site will soon be available at www.archaeologysouthwest.org, ensuring the footprints will be preserved long after the road project has taken over.
