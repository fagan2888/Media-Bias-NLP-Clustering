Gov. Pat McCrory made a special stop at Camp Lejeune on Thursday where he promised our service men and women that they will be taken care of after life in the military.

McCrory says through programs like NC Works and the North Carolina Military Pipeline, his goal is to get veterans into good jobs after their service. The governor said military members are hardworking and dedicated, and that many have skill sets beneficial to the workforce.

Staff Sergeant Alton Walden said he has a job lined up after he gets out of the Marine Corps thanks to programs like this.

"The community is representing the governor very well. I believe that they are showing they appreciate what we do, that were not just laying down our lives for anything," says Walden. "Of course that's what we do, however they're compensating us by making sure we have jobs when we get out."

NC Works has been bridging the gap between veterans and jobs for years, but the North Carolina Military Pipeline is now also accessible to all military veterans, regardless of time served.
