After slamming Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) for defending himself against claims that he has exploited Benghazi to aid his reelection campaign, MSNBC anchor Ed Schultz continued with his favorite form of political slander on the May 2 edition of The Ed Show. Schultz called on Graham to apologize for blasting the administration’s “scumbags,” and promptly began ranting about the GOP.

“This is who they are,” Schultz asserted as he segued to his cell-phone poll question of the day. As is his habit, the wording was so over-the-top as to be funny, albeit perhaps not in the way that Schultz intended it. “Are Republicans angrier than two black labs fighting over a toy?” he asked as his producers rolled video of two dogs fighting over a chew toy. [See video below. MP3 audio here.]

That is a little more restrained than other classics like, “Are conservatives the new Confederates?” [August 28, 2013] and “Are Republicans happy to see Detroit go bankrupt?” [July 21, 2013], but it’s still a sign that ol’ Ed is hardly someone to turn to for elevating political discourse in cable television.

Day after day Schultz’s poll questions pound the same tired MSNBC mantra: conservatives and Republicans are racist homophobes who hate – and are dangerous to – America:

• Get your cell phones out. Are Republicans voting against Syria because they hate President Obama? Text A for yes text B for no to 67622. [September 5, 2013]

• Is the Christian conservative campaign against Obamacare dangerous for America? Text A for yes, B for no to 67622. [August 17, 2013]

• Tonight’s question: Will the Republican Party ever treat gay Americans as equals? Text A for yes, text B for no to 67622. [June 30, 2013]

• Tonight’s question are conservatives ignoring racism in America? Text A for yes text B for no to 67622. [June 29, 2013]

The Washington Free Beacon recently released an amusing montage of Ed Schultz viewer polls including classics like, “Is the almighty dollar Republicans’ true religion?” You can watch that here.
