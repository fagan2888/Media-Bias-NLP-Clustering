Amarillo residents love to dine out, and have many choices. Off the top of our head, we know of at least eight restaurants in Amarillo (and there are more than eight) that feature menus with an international flavor \u2014 not just hamburgers and french fries.\n\nThere are Asian restaurants, Italian restaurants and Mexican restaurants, to name a few.\n\nAre these restaurants racist in nature? Of course not.\n\nYes, but there\u2019s a difference, some might say. Pageants limiting participants to race, heritage or nationality are exclusionary \u2014 and therefore racist.\n\nAre they? Or are these pageants a celebration and recognition of different cultures/groups?\n\nThese pageants are not promoting one group of people over another any more than a restaurant.\n\nThese pageants recognize the talent and beauty of a specific group, and are not meant to belittle similar traits among other groups.\n\nThis is what some are not getting, and it isn\u2019t pretty.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Editorial, Opinion, Amarillo Latina, Mitzy Gonzalez", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "Ironic isn't it, how something about beauty can become ugly?
