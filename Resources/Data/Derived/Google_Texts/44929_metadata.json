The connector would send someone from one of its 34 community partner agencies to his home to help, he was told.\n\nSo far, Hamili hasn\u2019t heard back.\n\nHawaii lawmakers plan a briefing Wednesday to look into problems related to the Hawaii Health Connector services.\n\nHawaii Health Connector would not answer questions on Wednesday about technical problems. Instead, the connector\u2019s public relations firm sent a news release reporting nearly 20,000 people had logged onto their website on the first day, that operators took 1,257 calls and 1,181 residents completed applications. Hawaii residents also are frustrated because the connector website has no information on the 95 medical plans that will be offered beginning Jan. 1, as Hawaii Health Connector previously advertised. Spokespeople forwould not answer questions on Wednesday about technical problems. Instead, the connector\u2019s public relations firm sent a news release reporting nearly 20,000 people had logged onto their website on the first day, that operators took 1,257 calls and 1,181 residents completed applications. \u201cWe are certainly sensitive to the fact that many folks are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to enroll in health coverage,\u201d said Coral Andrews, Hawaii Health Connector executive director. \u201cEach individual and small business scenario is unique, so it is paramount that multiple scenarios must be tested to assure accuracy of plan and price information.\u201d Reg Baker, chief operating officer for the Hawaii Medical Assurance Association, said the IT infrastructure supporting the Hawaii Connector is massive and complex, with many moving parts that interface with systems locally and on the mainland. HMAA isn\u2019t participating in the Obamacare network but rather will compete privately in the marketplace, as it has for 25 years, he said. \u201cIt is disappointing but not a big surprise that the Hawaii Connector is not currently working as expected,\u201d Baker said. Andrews directed applicants to contact one of the connector\u2019s partner agencies to sign up in person and learn about options. Watchdog.org tried to contact some of the partner agencies Wednesday, including Li\u2019s Translation services, the agency listed for residents living near the state Capitol, in downtown Honolulu, in Kalihi and other nearby areas. No one answered the phone throughout the day, and there was no way to leave a message. Watchdog could find no information about the company on the Internet. The owner is using a Hotmail account as the official email for the company. Hawaii Health Connector also wouldn\u2019t answer questions Wednesday about Li\u2019s Translation Services, a company that will be trusted with applicants\u2019 personal, medical and financial information.\n\nHamili\u2019s company provided health care for its full-time employees as is required under Hawaii law, but when Hamili was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and given just 30 days to live two years ago, the couple had to lay off workers, and their small business medical plan with Kaiser Permanente was terminated.\n\nHamili and his wife re-applied for individual coverage with Kaiser; she was granted coverage, but he was turned down because of the pre-existing condition.\n\nHamili\u2019s cancer is in remission, but he has undergone costly treatment and rehabilitation therapy.\n\nReach Malia Zimmerman at Malia@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Part 13 of 97 in the series Obamacare By Malia Zimmerman | Watchdog.org HONOLULU \u2014\u00a0Leon Hamili\u00a0has no medical coverage.
