He crunched the numbers for two hypothetical scenarios of people who may apply for Obamacare and who have fluctuating income.\n\nQ. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a single, 27-year-old who works at a pizzeria. At the time you apply for Obamacare, you\u2019re making $15,900 a year. Halfway through 2014, you land a job as a graphics artist that doesn\u2019t have benefits, but you double your salary to $31,800. Thrilled by your change of fortune, you forget to update the federal insurance website. What financial impact will that have?\n\nA. Someone who works half a year at $15,900 and half a year at $31,800 will end up with an annual income of $23,850.\n\nHis insurance would cost $3,125, for which the government would advance him a subsidy of $2,598.\n\nOnce he got the better job and boosted his annual earnings, he\u2019d no longer qualify for the $2,598 subsidy. Instead, he\u2019d qualify for a subsidy of only $1,559.\n\nSo he ended up receiving an extra $1,039 in subsidy. (That is $2,598 minus $1,559.)\n\nIn this income range, anything up to $1,500 has to be paid back through the annual tax filing. Since his undeserved $1,039 fell below the cap, he\u2019d have to pay it all back \u2014 either coming out of the refund (if it\u2019s big enough) or through a check sent to the feds.\n\nQ. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a single, 27-year-old auto body mechanic who makes $30,000, with no insurance from your employer. Your boss has been talking about cutting everyone\u2019s hours, so when you apply for Obamacare, you estimate your 2014 income will drop to $15,900. However, your boss never makes good on his threats, so your income stays at $30,000. How does that play out?\n\nA. In this case, the income number you plugged into the application results in a subsidy of $2,598.\n\nCome tax time, you have to tell the government you actually made nearly double that. As a consequence, it lowers the subsidy for which you qualified, dropping it to just $614.\n\nThat means you received $1,984 more in subsidies than you ultimately were entitled to.\n\nHowever, there is that $1,500 cap on how much someone in your income range would have to pay back. So that $1,500 would come out of your refund, if it were large enough. If it weren\u2019t, it would go on your tax bill.\n\nBecause of the cap, however, you end up getting $484 in undeserved subsidies that you don\u2019t need to pay back.\n\nBoth scenarios show the financial consequences of not informing the government of any large swing in income.\n\nMcDevitt says recipients of Obamacare subsidies will fare best if they update their income quickly. \"Otherwise, they\u2019re going to have a rude surprise,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'health-news','obamacare'", "title": "Obamacare tax pitfalls: Two scenarios for those whose income changes", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare tax pitfalls: Two scenarios for those whose income changes\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/11/obamacare_tax_pitfalls_-_two_scenarios_for_those_whose_income_changes.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/11/doctors-st-petersjpg-6f26040c258b3968.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11649915\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-17T12:04:26Z\", \"author\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"health-news\",\"obamacare\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/11/13773211-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@OBrienLedger", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Accountant William McDevitt, of East Brunswick-based firm Wilkin & Guttenplan, gives seminars about the Affordable Care Act to groups of attorneys and physicians.
