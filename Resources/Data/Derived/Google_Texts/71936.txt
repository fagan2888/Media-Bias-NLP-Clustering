LINCOLN (AP) â€” The makers of Dorothy Lynch salad dressing are celebrating their product's 50th anniversary by sponsoring a series of tailgating events leading up the first Nebraska game.

The tailgating events will all be held at Hy-Vee grocery stores in the Lincoln area on Friday evenings starting at 6.

The events will feature Greg Sharpe, who calls Nebraska football games on the radio, and a variety of football food made with Dorothy Lynch.

Fans will also have a chance to win a pair of tickets to a Nebraska home game and enter a drawing to win four skybox tickets to the Nov. 1 Purdue game.

The next event will be held Friday at the Hy-Vee at 70th and Pioneers Boulevard.
