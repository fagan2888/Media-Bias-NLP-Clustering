She and Flavia Pennetta won Monday to set up a matchup of 30-somethings who have known each other since they were 8.\n\nVinci beat Camila Giorgi 6-4, 6-2 in 67 minutes. Moments later, rain started pouring down, stopping all matches at Flushing Meadows for 4\u00bd hours.\n\nThe delay couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for Pennetta, who came back to the court to seize momentum and clinch a 6-2, 7-6 (3) victory over 21st-seeded Simona Halep.\n\nAmerican wild card Alison Riske forced a third set against Daniela Hantuchova, but the veteran pulled away for a 6-3, 5-7, 6-2 victory.\n\nHalep had set point on her serve, trying to send the match to the third, when the skies opened up. Once they resumed, the 83rd-ranked Pennetta won three straight points to even the second set at 5-5.\n\nHalep promptly broke again, but she couldn\u2019t serve out the set this time, either. Then the 31-year-old Pennetta dominated the tiebreaker for her first Grand Slam quarterfinal since 2011.\n\nVinci had never made a Grand Slam quarterfinal before this tournament a year ago, when she was 29. Now Vinci has done it in consecutive U.S. Open trips. She lost to another countrywoman, doubles partner Sara Errani, in the quarters in 2012.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that I\u2019m not young. I\u2019m 30. But it can be a strength, because I have a lot of experience,\u201d Vinci said. \u201cAgainst a player like Camila, who is very young, it can be an advantage for me \u2014 and I think it was on the court today.\u201d\n\nErrani, the top-ranked Italian woman, was upset by Pennetta in the second round this year while seeded fourth. No matter, the country will still have a representative in the women\u2019s semifinals for the second straight time.\n\nBefore last year, that hadn\u2019t happened once in the Open era, which began in 1968.\n\nGiorgi, a 136th-ranked qualifier, was trying to reach her first major quarterfinal at age 21. In her third-round upset of sixth-seeded Caroline Wozniacki, she crushed the ball on point after point, with 46 winners and 45 unforced errors.\n\nShe jumped to a 4-1 lead in the first set Monday, but Vinci stayed poised and patient. Vinci, who had never faced the younger Italian before, started attacking her forehand, and Giorgi\u2019s mistakes mounted. She finished with 35 unforced errors to 20 winners.\n\n\u201cThe problem wasn\u2019t the opponent,\u201d Giorgi said. \u201cThe problem is that I wasn\u2019t myself on court today.\u201d\n\nVinci is one of only two players seeded in the top 10 left in her half of the draw, along with No. 2 Victoria Azarenka.\n\nAzarenka\u2019s meeting with 13th-seeded Ana Ivanovic was postponed Monday because of the rain. So was the Williams sisters\u2019 doubles match.\n\nRafael Nadal and Roger Federer were each still scheduled to play later Monday, though there was more rain in the forecast.\n\nArthur Ashe Stadium is finally getting a roof, the U.S. Tennis Association announced last month. But that won\u2019t happen until 2016 at the earliest. For now, rain delays are the reality at Flushing Meadows.\n\nIf Nadal and Federer win their fourth-round matches \u2014 whenever they\u2019re actually completed \u2014 they\u2019d meet in a quarterfinal of 29 combined Grand Slam titles. The great rivals have met 10 times at major tournaments, but never before the semis.\n\nThe potential matchup in the quarters is a byproduct of Federer falling to a seeding of No. 7. His match with 19th-seeded Tommy Robredo was moved to Louis Armstrong Stadium. It was the first time since the fourth round in 2006 \u2014 also because of rain \u2014 that Federer played on the Open\u2019s No. 2 court. Fans immediately lined up outside Armstrong to attempt to land a seat.\n\nThe second-seeded Nadal is still scheduled to face No. 22-seeded Philipp Kohlschreiber on Ashe to start the night session.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Roberta Vinci will face a fellow Italian in the U.S. Open quarterfinals for the second straight year.", "Author": "Rachel Cohen", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Roberta Vinci will face a fellow Italian in the U.S. Open quarterfinals for the second straight year.", "title": "U.S. Open 2013: Roberta Vinci gains quarterfinals, will face countrywoman Flavia Penneta", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/2/us-open-2013-roberta-vinci-gains-quarterfinal-roun/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/02/us-open-tennis_harr-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/02/us-open-tennis_harr-1.jpg", "title": "U.S. Open 2013: Roberta Vinci gains quarterfinals, will face countrywo", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "description": "Roberta Vinci will face a fellow Italian in the U.S. Open quarterfinals for the second straight year."}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Roberta Vinci, Camila Giorgi, Simona Halep"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07c7\"", "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 Roberta Vinci will face a fellow Italian in the U.S. Open quarterfinals for the second straight year.\nNo matter, the country will still have a representative in the women\u2019s semifinals for the second straight time.\nVinci had never made a Grand Slam quarterfinal before this tournament a year ago, when she was 29.\nOnce they resumed, the 83rd-ranked Pennetta won three straight points to even the second set at 5-5.\nThen the 31-year-old Pennetta dominated the tiebreaker for her first Grand Slam quarterfinal since 2011."}
