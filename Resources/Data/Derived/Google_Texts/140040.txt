Washington (CNN) Facing a key test in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Jeb Bush called himself a "joyful warrior" and took some shots at the people standing in his in way in the first-in-the-nation primary: Donald Trump and Marco Rubio.

Bush said Monday that "everyone else runs away from the bully," but that he would keep fighting Trump.

"I'm a joyful warrior," Bush told CNN's Dana Bash. "There is a difference between just sitting back and watching someone try to hijack a party that I believe will allow people to rise up again."

He made his case earlier Monday on Twitter, tweeting "@realDonaldTrump, you aren't just a loser, you are a liar and a whiner. John McCain is a hero. Over and out."
