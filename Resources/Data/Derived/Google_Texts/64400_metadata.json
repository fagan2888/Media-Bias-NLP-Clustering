Governor Robert Bentley caused political shockwaves when he said he was at least open to the idea.\n\nThat guarded endorsement isn\u2019t winning a lot of support in the state House and Senate.\n\nBut a proposal to insure more than 250-thousand Alabamians is not getting anywhere.\n\n\u201cWe must take real steps to reverse the trouble health trends that have occurred in our state.\u201d\n\nAlabama Governor Robert Bentley has made it clear that he wants to make sure citizens in his state get quality affordable healthcare, as long as it has nothing to do with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe ACA just celebrated its fifth anniversary. One hundred and seventy one thousand Alabamians are getting coverage through the federal program.\n\nOne of the most important provisions of the Affordable Care Act is the expansion of Medicaid, which provides health coverage to low-income families. It\u2019s a joint federal and state funded program that provides health care for more than 60 million low income Americans. A family of four earning 30-thousand or less or an individual making 15-thousand or less are eligible for this program.\n\nHowever Alabama is one of 19 states that opted out of Medicaid. Critics call it a flawed system and many want a new plan in place. That prompted Bentley to say, maybe in his State of the State earlier this month.\n\n\u201cBut we cannot allow federal bureaucracy and the extremely flawed patient protection affordable care act, to derail our efforts,\u201d Bentley says. \u201cTo make sure Alabamaians have good quality healthcare, especially the poorest and the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nLetting states Opt-out of the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion leaves millions of Americans without coverage, it also costs taxpayers money due to outrageous costs of emergency services if they get sick.\n\nState lawmakers worried about the cost of the program.\n\n\u201cHow do you pay for it?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s state senator Cam Ward. He and many other conservative lawmakers are working with the Governor to try and expand Medicaid. However, Ward says this issue is out of his and the legislature\u2019s hands. He\u2019s challenging the voters to make up their mind about Medicaid.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t hear the clamoring from the voters,\u201d Ward says \u201cI get people from time to time that want it, typically a lot of mental health advocates who are going to have their benefits increase as a result of this. We\u2019re just not hearing people say, \u2018Yes I want to raise taxes to increase Medicaid.\u2019 That\u2019s just something you don\u2019t hear.\u201d\n\nThis is how Medicaid expansion works under the affordable car act. The Federal Government pays one hundred percent of the total cost up to 2016. At that point, states including Alabama will have to cover ten percent of the cost. A study in 2012 by health care economists at the University of Alabama at Birmingham says this could be a money maker. The report suggests the state would gain almost $1 Billion in tax revenue.\n\nSo why aren\u2019t GOP lawmakers lining up to support the plan? Democratic State Representative Craig Ford has a one word answer to Republican opposition. That word is Obama.\n\n\u201cAnd they said it\u2019s too good of an opportunity to provide healthcare to the people in their state,\u201d Ford says. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing more than just a political ploy on the Republican Party here in Alabama. Just to say that if it has anything to do with Obama or federal, they don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it.\u201d\n\nTennessee tried a similar approach and ended up with the same result. Governor Bill Haslam attempted to create a program called \u201cInsure Tennessee\u201d which needed legislative approval. Haslam called a special session to help create the law but the measure died in a senate and welfare committee.\n\nThe bill could have insured more than 220-thousand low-income Tennesseans\u2026\n\n\u201cThe biggest complaint and concern that you heard about the law was that it was some way, too similar or too closely-connected with the affordable care act.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Dave Boucher, the political reporter for the Tennessean, the state\u2019s biggest newspaper.\n\n\u201cThe republicans in the south, live in states where the President is extremely unpopular and anything that could get them tagged as someone who supports the president\u2019s plans, could certainly hurt them in a reelection bid,\u201d Boucher says.\n\nWard and Ford both argue the state has bigger fish to fry in the state, like the $700 million dollar budget shortfall the state is in right now. Governor Bentley proposed a tax increase of more than a half billion dollars to plug the holes in the state\u2019s coffers.\n\nFord calls it a \u201ctravesty\u201d that Alabama is not a part of the Medicaid Expansion under the affordable care act.\n\n\u201cThey treat the federal government like a one night stand. We\u2019re a taker state. For every dollar we send to DC, we get three and a half dollars back. The roads that we\u2019re driving on today are 90 percent paid for by federal funds. You can\u2019t pick and choose what you want from the federal government and unfortunately they\u2019re trying to do that and they\u2019re hurting our people in Alabama for not providing them healthcare coverage but unfortunately, people are buying that argument.\u201d\n\nUntil the Alabama Legislature can come to an agreement for the voters to decide on how to proceed and pay for it, both sides believe the murky waters of Medicaid expansion will get deeper.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "The current state legislation session is underway and one topic that seems to be getting a cold reception is Medicaid expansion.
