He will have a magnetic resonance imaging test on Monday back in Denver, but there is fear Irving suffered some form of ligament damage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember how it happened,\u201d Irving said as he hobbled out of the Gillette Stadium visitor\u2019s locker room on crutches. \u201cNot a good break. Not a good day.\u201d\n\nIrving\u2019s knee was in such severe pain that several members of the Broncos\u2019 medical team had to help him get dressed.\n\nLamin Barrow, a rookie fifth-round draft pick from LSU, finished the game at middle linebacker during the rare plays when the Broncos\u2019 employed their base defense. Steven Johnson could also start in Irving\u2019s place next week at Oakland, although the third-year linebacker missed his second consecutive game Sunday because of an ankle injury.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how they play it this week,\u201d said Barrow, who waited with Irving in the locker room after every other player had dressed and left for the busses. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m just praying for Nate. Hopefully, it\u2019s not as bad as it looks right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 Nate Irving to miss time with serious knee injury", "title": "Broncos\u2019 Nate Irving to miss time with serious knee injury", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/02/broncos-nate-irving-to-miss-time-with-serious-knee-injury/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141102__SP03FBNBRONX__2A15307xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141102__SP03FBNBRONX__2A15307xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-02T19:10:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:35:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Nate Irving suffered a serious right knee injury in the second half of the Broncos\u2019 loss to New England.\nHe will have a magnetic resonance imaging test on Monday back in Denver, but there is fear Irving suffered some form of ligament damage.\n\u2014 The Broncos will have to play without their starting middle linebacker for awhile.\nLamin Barrow, a rookie fifth-round draft pick from LSU, finished the game at middle linebacker during the rare plays when the Broncos\u2019 employed their base defense.\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember how it happened,\u201d Irving said as he hobbled out of the Gillette Stadium visitor\u2019s locker room on crutches."}
