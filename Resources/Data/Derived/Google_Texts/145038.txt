When websites started reporting that Drake, the YOLO guy, got an emoji tattoo, it sounded … pretty believable, I think (it’s not confirmed that the tattoo is on his arm).

Out of all the emoji Drake (or Drake’s friend with a now-famous arm) could meld into his body as one with his soul and his smooth smooth skin, the hands praying (or high-fiving?) is among the best.

If anyone can make emoji tattoos “a thing,” it’s Drake. And just in case that happens, here are some tattoo suggestions for celebrities:

DMX

What better way for DMX to get over his fear of the Google than by getting a tattoo of the floppy disk emoji? An homage to all things past and ancient, while still embracing the new.

Miley Cyrus

For Miley, the shocking thing here is not the emoji tattoo, but where she’d get it. This one, embedded underneath each fingernail.

Al Gore

ManBearPig. That is all.
