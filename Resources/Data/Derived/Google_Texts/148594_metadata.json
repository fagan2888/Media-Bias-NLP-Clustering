Concerns were similar a month ago, when a winter storm hit just as people were traveling for Thanksgiving.\n\nWhile much of the East awoke to unusually warm temperatures on Friday, the storm was causing pre-Christmas travel worries from Chicago and Detroit to Boston and New York. In New England, communities were planning for a bit of everything \u2014 snow, sleet and rain \u2014 but were most concerned about the threat of freezing rain.\n\nThe National Weather Service predicted that parts of Maine could get more than a half-inch coating of ice, which would make roads treacherous and cause widespread power outages.\n\n\"The best advice for everyone is just to really pay attention. With every few hours, we're going to get better information,\" Maine Emergency Management Agency spokeswoman Lynnette Miller said Friday.\n\nFreezing rain snarled traffic in Oklahoma. Police in Oklahoma City blamed at least one traffic death on the weather. Forecasters said up to a half-inch of ice could accumulate across the middle of the state, from the Texas border in the southwest to the Missouri border in the northeast.\n\nThe Wisconsin Department of Transportation said Interstate 90/94 was ice-covered from Tomah and Mauston. The state was bracing for significant snow, sleet and ice.\n\nThe weather service issued a flash flood watch from Arkansas northeastward through parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, with up to 4 inches of rain projected.\n\nWhile the Midwest and Plains were preparing for ice and snow, residents down South were concerned about tornadoes, which forecasters said were possible this weekend even though they are uncommon this time of year. The area most threatened stretched from central and northeastern Texas through Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and southeast Missouri, where 80 mph wind gusts and flash flooding were possible.\n\nTom Kines, an AccuWeather meteorologist, said a northern cold front clashing with warm, humid air from the South is causing the unsettled weather.\n\n\"I think there's a high likelihood there will be severe storms with hail and damaging wind\" in parts of the South, Kines said. \"Whether or not there's tornadoes, that's tough to say, but I will say the conditions are right.\"\n\nWeekend temperatures could surpass 70 degrees in Nashville this weekend and approach that in New York City, as well, Kines said. But by Sunday night, the storm will be hammering the Northeast, where residents could be treated to a rare winter thunderstorm.\n\nKansas City, Mo., was bracing for freezing rain this weekend followed by 6 inches of snow.\n\nIf there is a silver lining, it's that Christmas happens mid-week this year, said AAA spokeswoman Heather Hunter.\n\n\"When a holiday falls on a Wednesday it gives travelers more flexibility of either leaving the weekend before, or traveling right before the holiday and extending the trip through the following weekend,\" Hunter said.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "Holiday travelers in the Midwest and parts East and South are keeping a leery eye on a band of foul weather stretching across the nation's...", "title": "Sleet, Snow and Tornadoes Snarl Start of Holiday Travel Period | If there is a silver lining, it's that Christmas happens mid-week this year. | National | Boise Weekly", "og": {"site_name": "Boise Weekly", "description": "Holiday travelers in the Midwest and parts East and South are keeping a leery eye on a band of foul weather stretching across the nation's...", "title": "Sleet, Snow and Tornadoes Snarl Start of Holiday Travel Period", "url": "http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/sleet-snow-and-tornadoes-snarl-start-of-holiday-travel-period/Content?oid=3027836", "image": "http://www.boiseweekly.com/binary/343d/Cover1-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Holiday travelers in the Midwest and parts East and South are keeping a leery eye on a band of foul weather stretching across the nation's...", "card": "summary", "title": "Sleet, Snow and Tornadoes Snarl Start of Holiday Travel Period"}, "oid": 3027836, "fb": {"app_id": 147773095298810}, "keywords": "Boise Weekly, Boise, Idaho, Boise online newspaper, Boise Idaho newspaper, Boise news, Boise arts, Idaho arts, Boise music, Boise entertainment, Boise calendar, Boise events, Boise dining, Boise Idaho news, Idaho politics, Idaho entertainment", "google-site-verification": "Cj6vU11_Cy6mgp0wvU_VpDONKhVZTCcHXO2BSYJfYHw", "verify-v1": "wytIU1RJHwcGDuN851dweJU4//2C5LKX+qnG2FSiOLM=", "thumbnail": "http://www.boiseweekly.com/binary/343d/Cover1-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "boise weekly, boise, idaho, boise online newspaper, boise idaho newspaper, boise news, boise arts, idaho arts, boise music, boise entertainment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd69ab\"", "article_summary": "If there is a silver lining, it's that Christmas happens mid-week this year, said AAA spokeswoman Heather Hunter.\nKansas City, Mo., was bracing for freezing rain this weekend followed by 6 inches of snow.\nConcerns were similar a month ago, when a winter storm hit just as people were traveling for Thanksgiving.\nIn New England, communities were planning for a bit of everything \u2014 snow, sleet and rain \u2014 but were most concerned about the threat of freezing rain.\nWeekend temperatures could surpass 70 degrees in Nashville this weekend and approach that in New York City, as well, Kines said."}
