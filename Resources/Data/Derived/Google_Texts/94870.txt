A Louisville woman was hospitalized after she apparently was accidentally shot by her 2-year-old son at their home in south Louisville on Friday.

The toddler apparently obtained his mother's gun at their home in the 500 block of Evelyn Avenue, said Louisville Metro Police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley. Police got the call about 6 p.m.

Smiley said the mother's injuries are considered non-life threatening. The child has been placed with his grandparents, she said.

Officials aren't sure yet how the child got access to the gun.
