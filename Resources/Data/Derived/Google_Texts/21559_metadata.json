The ad does a good job of explaining in lay terms how the new focus on population health management means that \u201cinstead of receiving care that\u2019s isolated and intermittent, patients receive care that\u2019s continuous and coordinated, much of it outside the traditional hospital setting.\u201d It spotlights Mount Sinai\u2019s \u201ctremendous emphasis on wellness programs\u201d; its Mobile Acute Care Team, which treats patients at home for certain conditions that otherwise would land them in the hospital; and its Preventable Admissions Care Team aimed at averting readmissions by providing both medical care and help with nonmedical factors that impact health and access to care, like housing and literacy. Not a lot there that hospital leaders don\u2019t already know, of course, but you\u2019ve got to admit, the headline\u2019s a grabber.\n\nWHAT THE HECK IS XENOTRANSPLANTATION? It\u2019s the process of transplanting organs from one species to another, and it could mean that eventually inside some human being will beat the heart of a pig. The hope is that being able to use organs from nonhuman species will make up for the tragic shortage of human organs now available for everything from lung to liver transplants. Xenotransplantation has gotten a big financial boost from biotechnology executive Martine Rothblatt, whose daughter might one day need a lung transplant and whose goal is to create an unlimited supply of transplantable organs. MIT Technology Review\u2019s Antonio Regalado reports that \u201cU.S. researchers have been shattering records in xenotransplantation\u201d by keeping a pig heart alive in a baboon for 945 days and by achieving \"the longest-ever kidney swap\" between those two species, lasting 136 days. The research is extremely costly and it\u2019s a big leap from pig-baboon transplants to those in which the recipient is a human being. But here\u2019s hoping.\n\n\n\nBIG MAC NOT SO HOT IN CLEVELAND. At least not at the Cleveland Clinic, which on Sept. 18 will usher McDonald\u2019s off its premises. Is it part of a trend? Since 2009, six other U.S. hospitals have bid McDonald\u2019s adios. National Public Radio\u2019s Allison Aubrey reported Wednesday for \"All Things Considered\" that the move is part of Cleveland Clinic's\u2019 efforts to promote a culture of wellness among employees and patients. McDonald\u2019s protests that it has added healthful items to its menu, but others note that burgers, fries and soda remain the top sellers. They also make for a pretty inexpensive meal, so the Cleveland Clinic says it will look to replace McDonald\u2019s with a vendor that serves both healthful and affordable food.\n\nDON\u2019T PANIC, BUT ICD-10 STARTS IN JUST 40 DAYS. The American Hospital Association has put together a handy, dandy checklist for hospital leaders to share with their coding transition teams to make sure everything is ready to go on Oct. 1. It\u2019s divided into three sections: Check Internal Systems, Verify External Partner Readiness and Consider Financial Protections. It\u2019s worth a look even if you\u2019re pretty confident you\u2019ve got all your ducks in a row.\n\nI HATE TO GIVE AWAY AN ENDING, but I can\u2019t resist sharing these words of wisdom that closed an article in last Sunday\u2019s New York Times Magazine by Lisa Sanders, M.D. She\u2019s quoting a fellow physician, Robert Kavaler: \u201cForty-five percent of the time, a patient is in your office for nothing. Fifty percent of the time, it\u2019s for the usual stuff. It\u2019s that 5 percent of the time, when someone has something weird that you have to be alert for. Because if you miss it, that\u2019s when something bad can happen.\u201d Sanders writes the \u201cWell\u201d blog on the Times\u2019 Web page and the \u201cDiagnosis\u201d series that runs periodically in the magazine. Each installment focuses on one individual with an unusual or hard-to-pinpoint condition. The article takes you from the time the symptoms first manifest themselves to the process by which clinicians figure out exactly what\u2019s ailing the patient and how to treat him or her, often including wrong assumptions and misdiagnoses along the way. They always make for fascinating reads.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Editor Bill Santamours picks of interesting stuff you may have missed in the news this week.", "csrf-token": "JjoXtpLWW1OLH2rdlJQhagacdyfGYWsk/7OmvGsER2o=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/2015/WeeklyReading_190x127.jpg?1448315758", "description": "Editor Bill Santamour's picks of interesting stuff you may have missed in the news this week.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hospitals' Goal: Empty Beds; Pig-Hearted People?
