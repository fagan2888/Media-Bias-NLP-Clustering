How does he come up with a probability like that? By using an indicator that\u2019s helped predict midterm elections in the past \u2014 namely, the president\u2019s job approval on election day \u2014 and then running simulations a la Nate Silver for various different approval ratings to see how many seats the GOP could expect to gain (or even lose).\n\nThe result: Democratic seppuku.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s 55/45 right now, which means Obama\u2019s approval rating could rise as high as 49 percent and the GOP\u2019s low-end expectation would still be six seats, flipping the chamber. According to Gallup\u2019s latest job approval figures today, O\u2019s back to 46 percent \u2014 the highest he\u2019s been in ages but still a number that could plausibly produce a double-digit pick-up for Republicans. In fact, just to put in perspective for you how heavy a lift this is for Democrats, here\u2019s RCP\u2019s graph of Obama\u2019s job approval for the past two and a half years, since July 2011:\n\nThe only time he reaches 50 percent is right after election day 2012. He managed to stay above water for a few months afterward, during his post-election honeymoon period, but he was break-even at best before then and, starting with the Snowden revelations last summer, lately it\u2019s been nothing but a steady decline. All of which is to say, barring an amazing turnaround for ObamaCare or some sort of unforeseen crisis a la Christie\u2019s handling of Hurricane Sandy, there\u2019s no reason to expect O\u2019s job approval to soar over the next nine months. It would defy more than two years of precedent. There\u2019s no historical reason to expect it either; there was a rash of articles last year after Obama\u2019s numbers started to crumble noting that once a second-term president\u2019s job approval lands in the crapper, it usually doesn\u2019t make it out again. Maybe O\u2019s rating will inch up a bit, or maybe it won\u2019t once the next round of ObamaCare chaos begins. Given that he\u2019s had a ceiling of about 48-49 percent since mid-2011 (again, except for his election honeymoon), which way would you bet? Follow the link up top and scroll down to Trende\u2019s bell-curve graph of likely Democratic losses and you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a greater than 80 percent chance that they lose six seats or more. In theory, at least: In practice, it may be that O\u2019s low approval rating makes a blue-state Senate race surprisingly tight but doesn\u2019t quite push the Republican challenger over the top against the Democratic incumbent.\n\nOne more thing. Trende\u2019s last piece of election forecasting noted that the 2016 Senate cycle looks to be as difficult for Republicans as this one is for Democrats, meaning that the GOP needs to pile up wins this November to buffer itself against heavy losses two years from now. According to that forecast, Democrats would have a better than even chance of retaking the Senate in 2016 if the GOP wins eight seats or fewer this time even if a Republican takes the White House in 2016. That means the GOP needs to win nine this year to be somewhat safe, and according to Trende\u2019s table above, that could require an Obama approval rating of around 44 percent on election day. Obama\u2019s approval rating today, per the RCP average: 44.4 percent. Hmmmmmmm.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Oh my.", "title": "Odds of GOP taking back the Senate: 80+ percent?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/02/20/odds-of-gop-taking-back-the-senate-80-percent/", "image": {"width": 333, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/st.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-21T00:21:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-20T23:15:49+00:00"}, "keywords": "approval, model, monte carlo, Obama, rating, republican, Senate,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba3e\"", "article_summary": "Odds of GOP taking back the Senate: 80+ percent?\nMaybe O\u2019s rating will inch up a bit, or maybe it won\u2019t once the next round of ObamaCare chaos begins.\nObama\u2019s approval rating today, per the RCP average: 44.4 percent.\nThat means the GOP needs to win nine this year to be somewhat safe, and according to Trende\u2019s table above, that could require an Obama approval rating of around 44 percent on election day.\nThe Senate\u2019s 55/45 right now, which means Obama\u2019s approval rating could rise as high as 49 percent and the GOP\u2019s low-end expectation would still be six seats, flipping the chamber."}
