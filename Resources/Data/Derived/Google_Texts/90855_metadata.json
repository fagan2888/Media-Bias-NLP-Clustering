Horowitz says instead of top-down, publicity-seeking groups like the onetime Moral Majority, Lane is building a \u201cground-level\u201d network of believers, working \u201cmostly behind the scenes.\u201d\n\nBut are politicized evangelicals a big deal or a blip? The recent feuds over gay marriage and \u201creligious freedom restoration\u201d bills suggest the latter. And consider this reality check in the latest National Congregations Study directed by Duke University sociologist Mark Chaves. A detailed survey of 1,300 local congregations showed white evangelicals are by far the category least involved in political activism in comparison with Catholics, black Protestants, moderate and liberal \u201cmainline\u201d Protestants and non-Christian groups. That\u2019s the Religion Guy\u2019s gut impression from decades on the Godbeat.\n\nAs Times columnist Nicholas Kristof observes, \u201cin liberal circles, evangelicals constitute one of the few groups that it\u2019s safe to mock openly.\u201d Still, beyond the liberal bubble reporters and politicians may sense that when evangelicals do sound off on public policy they reflect the outlook of a substantial grass-roots constituency, whereas Catholic or \u201cmainline\u201d Protestant officials often seem to speak more for themselves than for their large memberships.\n\nBlogger Sarah Posner downplays evangelicals\u2019 impact because they\u2019re \u201csplintering in different directions.\u201d To her, David Lane is part of the \u201cpander-by-praying\u201d segment of \u201cChristian nation\u201d enthusiasts that\u2019s in decline. In Religion News Service, political scientist Tobin Grant asserts that evangelicals are so unorganized and divided they cannot \u201cform a national movement capable of making a difference in the election.\u201d\n\nNotre Dame historian George Marsden looks at U.S. evangelicalism as a purely religious rather than political force and similarly finds a \u201cbewilderingly diverse set of movements and sub-movements\u201d that results from \u201cdecentralization, competitive free enterprise, populist demagoguery, and encouragement of personal readings of Scripture.\u201d To him it\u2019s quite remarkable \u201cthat the movement is as coherent as it is\u201d with a shared religious \u201ccore message.\u201d\n\nHe writes that in a package of eight articles to define and assess evangelicalism in Fuller Magazine. The magazine is published by Fuller Theological Seminary, one of the world\u2019s largest clergy training schools. The articles label Fuller itself as \u201copen evangelical,\u201d meaning openness to various segments of evangelicalism and to some advanced scholarly thinking unwelcome among more conservative \u201cevangelicals\u201d and hardline \u201cfundamentalists.\u201d However, the school is more conservative than seminaries of the \u201cmainline\u201d Protestant denominations that supply so many Fuller students.\n\nThe magazine notes that British church historian D. W. Bebbington, now at Baylor University, has proposed four traits that define evangelicalism: \u201cconversionism\u201d or belief that individual lives need spiritual change, \u201cactivism\u201d in evangelism and missions, \u201cbiblicism\u201d or very high regard for the Bible\u2019s authority and \u201ccrucicentrism\u201d or stress on Christ\u2019s atoning sacrifice on the cross.\n\nThe Religion Guy would add to that broadly traditional substance in doctrine and morals.\n\nNeither Bebbington nor the Religion Guy inserts politics into the definition. For one thing, this movement is not narrowly American but a huge and growing force around the globe. For instance, Fuller enrolls nearly 1,000 overseas students. Church historian Charles Scalise writes -- foreign correspondents take note -- that \u201cevangelicalism, when inclusive of Pentecostal and charismatic Christians, may emerge as one of the two or three largest Christian traditions in the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With an unusually scrambled Republican presidential campaign heating up, \r\nand with so many pious candidates, the usual media thumbsuckers about \r\nevangelical Protestants and 2016 are already appearing.\r\n\r\nYes, again.\r\n\r\nSomehow, political reporters remain more fascinated with this predictably \r\nRepublican bloc than non-Hispanic Catholics who will be the biggest \r\nreligious \u201cswing vote\u201d (as usual), \u00a0or Jews, whose lockstep loyalty to the \r\nDemocrats could be eroded by President Obama\u2019s foreign policy.\r\n\r\nJason Horowitz of The New York Times portrayed evangelical clout in the \r\nperson of David Lane\u00a0 of the American Renewal Project.
