Oregon First Lady admits to sham marriage for green card\n\nposted at 10:01 am on October 11, 2014 by Jazz Shaw\n\nThere are quite a few of us who have made more than one trip down the wedding aisle. (Hey\u2026 sometimes things don\u2019t work out.) Such is the case with Oregon First Lady Cylvia Hayes, currently planning her fourth set of nuptials to Democrat Governor John Kitzhaber. Nothing illegal about that of course\u2026 except that she failed to mention marriage number three to the Governor (or anyone else) until reporters brought it to light this month. The reason for the secrecy becomes readily apparent when you hear that her brief marriage was to an 18 year old immigrant who needed a green card and paid her for the honor of her hand.\n\nOregon first lady Cylvia Hayes admitted Thursday she illegally married an Ethiopian immigrant because she needed money and he needed help to stay in the United States. Hayes said she married 18-year-old Abraham Abraham in 1997 during a \u201cdifficult and unstable period in my life.\u201d She said she was ashamed and embarrassed by the marriage, and for that reason, she never disclosed it to her current fiance Gov. John Kitzhaber. \u201cThis is the most painful part for me,\u201d she said. \u201cJohn Kitzhaber deserved to know the history of the person he was forming a relationship with. The fact that I did not disclose this to him meant that he has learned about this in the most public and unpleasant way.\u201d\n\nIt seems that this took place in 1997, so the statute of limitations has run out on this particular crime, but her \u201chusband\u201d (until their \u201cdivorce\u201d in 2002) may still have his status revoked and be sent back to Ethiopia, assuming anyone in Immigration can be bothered to look into it.\n\nNow, I can predict what some critics may say when they first hear of this story. Why is this news? It\u2019s not the Governor who did this, he allegedly didn\u2019t even know about it until this week, and why are we chasing after wives or girlfriends anyway? In response, Mark Krikorian at National Review points out that the First Lady isn\u2019t just a fiancee.. she\u2019s a player in the political game of thrones in her own right.\n\nCylvia Hayes, Oregon\u2019s \u201cFirst Lady\u201d (Democrat governor John Kitzhaber\u2019s girlfriend), has confessed to engaging in immigration fraud by entering into a sham marriage, for money, with an Ethiopian teenager in 1997 to enable him to get a green card. Hayes isn\u2019t just the governor\u2019s squeeze; she\u2019s a political consultant who\u2019s \u201ctaken an active role in . . . developing the governor\u2019s energy and environmental policy.\u201d\n\nThis is clearly an alternate theory of immigration reform, but Krikorian notes that this actually isn\u2019t the first time that Democrat politicians have engaged in such shortcuts to \u201ccorrect the broken immigration system.\u201d I hadn\u2019t even heard about one of them in my own back yard, but Empire State assemblywoman Gabriela Rosa recently plead guilty of essentially the same crime. She paid $8K to \u201claunder\u201d her status via marriage after emigrating from the Dominican Republic.\n\nThere has been plenty of push-back against President Obama by Democrats who are frustrated that he hasn\u2019t used the phone and the pen to issue a broad amnesty order before leaving office. Clearly they are missing the signals from these folks who have found clever ways around the barriers inherent in the system. And if there is a clear signal from Washington that there is little interest in prosecuting such violations, what incentive remains to stop doing this?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Skirting the law", "title": "Immigration reform?
