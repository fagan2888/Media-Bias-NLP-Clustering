One unnamed official has been quoted as saying: \u201cThe doctor failed to disinfect the instruments before using them again.\u201d Further, over 80 women were reportedly operated upon within a five to six hour period in the government-run Nemi Chand hospital in the Pendari area of Bilaspur.\n\nAccording to Amar Singh Thakur, chief health officer for the Bilaspur district, \u201cThe deaths were due to septic shock.\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised a \u201cthorough investigation and action on this unfortunate tragedy.\u201d\n\nWhy does India sterilize women (and men) in such large numbers? That is because the country is suffering from vast overpopulation. In 2011, the census had passed the one billion person mark which makes India second only to China in terms of population. By 2025, India is projected to be the world\u2019s most populous country.\n\nHere\u2019s why. The birth rate remain higher than the death rate; the fertility rate is still very high due to early marriage and the universal practice of marriage. Add to that, poverty, illiteracy, (including illiteracy about or resistance to birth control), the cultural preference for boys\u2014and as many boys as possible (to take care of their aged parents), as well as the illegal migration from Bangladesh and Nepal\u2014and India has a major problem to solve. Overpopulation also taxes the economy and leads to unemployment as well as the overutilization of resources such as land areas, water, forests, etc.\n\nThe Indian government chose to deal with this crisis by offering families money if they elected vasectomies or tubectomies. Hence\u2014sterilization camps. Interestingly, in 1952, India was the world\u2019s first country to start a family planning program.\n\nWomen tend to suffer the most from efforts to control population growth and are lured to participate in one-day sterilization drives. According to the United Nations, India has the world\u2019s third-highest female sterilization rate after the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg News, Kerry McBroom, director of the Reproductive Rights Initiative at the New Delhi-based Human Rights Law Network, argues that what happened at the Nemi Chand hospital is due to \u201cno accountability in the system. The most appalling and terrifying thing is that it is so commonplace in India for women to suffer these surgeries\u201d under poor conditions.\n\nIn 2012, Human Rights Watch charged that the use of \u201cnumerical targets\u201d (in terms of patients sterilized) contributed to a \u201ccoercive environment.\u201d In other words, district health workers are threatened with salary cuts or dismissals if local targets are not met.\u201d To the extent to which women are under-valued and male children over-valued\u2014by both men and women; and the extent to which women are only valued for their child-rearing capacity\u2014little will change.\n\nFive women remain in critical condition after the sterilization surgeries. Eight families are grieving the loss of their wives, mothers, daughters, and sisters.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dozens of Women Dead, Injured After Mass Sterilization Clinic Infection in India", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Dozens of Women Dead, Injured After Mass Sterilization Clinic Infection in India", "title": "Dozens of Women Dead, Injured After Mass Sterilization Clinic Infection in India - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/11/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-11-at-111208-AMpng.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2014/11/11/dozens-of-women-dead-injured-after-mass-sterilization-clinic-infection-in-india/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dozens of Women Dead, Injured After Mass Sterilization Clinic Infection in India", "title": "Dozens of Women Dead, Injured After Mass Sterilization Clinic Infection in India - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/11/11/Screen-Shot-2014-11-11-at-111208-AMpng.png", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "China, Universal,National Security,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "National Security", "tag": "Universal", "published_time": "2014-11-11T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "National Security"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "According to the United Nations, India has the world\u2019s third-highest female sterilization rate after the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.\nFive women remain in critical condition after the sterilization surgeries.\nThe most appalling and terrifying thing is that it is so commonplace in India for women to suffer these surgeries\u201d under poor conditions.\nWomen tend to suffer the most from efforts to control population growth and are lured to participate in one-day sterilization drives.\nIn 2011, the census had passed the one billion person mark which makes India second only to China in terms of population."}
