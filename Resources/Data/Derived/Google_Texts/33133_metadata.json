(AP) - Garrett Brown didn\u2019t look back during his 75-yard punt return for a touchdown on Saturday.\n\nHe waited until after the game.\n\nThat\u2019s when the Air Force speedster looked back and remembered how close his highlight-reel return came to never happening.\n\n\u201cI mean, I almost fair caught it,\u201d Brown said, with a grin.\n\nHis punt return for a touchdown was the Falcons first in six years, and it was just a small part of 63-7 lopsided Air Force win over Morgan State.\n\nNate Romine went 4 for 7 and threw for 119 yards and two touchdowns. D.J. Johnson had 82 yards and a touchdown on the ground, and Benton Washington added 62 yards rushing and a TD for the Falcons, who saw 16 different players carry the ball for a total of 394 yards.\n\nRoland Ladipo added an interception return for a touchdown, the Falcons first in three years.\n\n\u201cAny time you score nine touchdowns in a game you feel pretty good afterwards,\u201d Romine said. \u201cThis is kind of a blueprint of who we are \u2014 a run-first team.\u201d\n\nAfter five consecutive rushing attempts on the opening drive, Romine threw his first touchdown since 2013, an easy toss to Jalen Robinette for a 26-yard score. And later, in the second half, he connected with Alex Ludowig on a 35-yard score.\n\nOn both throws, his receivers had badly beaten the Bears coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nerve-racking when they\u2019re that wide open,\u201d Romine said. \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018Oh don\u2019t want to ruin this one.\u2019 But you kind of just get it to them and it turned out to be a pretty good play.\u201d\n\nThat was about it for Romine\u2019s arm.\n\nHe didn\u2019t complete a pass on the offense\u2019s second and third drives as D.J. Johnson capped a 75-yard drive with a 3-yard score, and Benton Washington finished a 55-yard drive with a 13-yard touchdown.\n\nHe then watched on the sideline as Brown\u2019s punt return put Air Force up 28-0 with 8:35 left in the first half.\n\nThe lead only snowballed from there.\n\nThe Falcons went on to outscore Morgan State 35-0 in the second half. Shayne Davern, Timothy McVey and Scott Hester each had rushing TDs, and Ladipo had a 22-yard pick-six, the Falcons\u2019 first since 2012.\n\nBy the end, Air Force\u2019s 63 points was its most since beating Nicholls State 72-0 on this date in 2009. But that still didn\u2019t seem to impress coach Troy Calhoun.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one day, that\u2019s all it is,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more, no less. It\u2019s one game.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Morgan State of the Football Championship Subdivision looked depleted. Ten of its players were ruled academically ineligible \u2014 the biggest of those being speedy running back Herb Walker Jr., who rushed for a school-record 1,408 yards and 15 touchdowns last season. It was also the first time the Bears football program had ever played in the thin air of Colorado.\n\nMoses Skillon, who coach Lee Hull wouldn\u2019t name as the official starter until Saturday, carried much of the load. He threw for 142 yards, rushed for another 35 yards, and capped the Bears only scoring drive with a 2-yard run in the waning seconds of the second half.\n\n\u201cAir Force is a great team and if you come here short-handed, this is what is going to happen,\u201d Hull said.\n\nAir Force is now 9-0 in season openers under Calhoun, and 20-0 all-time against FCS opponents and has won eight straight home games dating back to 2013.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Garrett Brown didn't look back during his 75-yard punt return for a touchdown on Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Garrett Brown didn\u2019t look back during his 75-yard punt return for a touchdown on Saturday.", "title": "Air Force runs over Morgan State, 63-7", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/5/air-force-runs-over-morgan-state-63-7/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/9bec1c3cee532f27810f6a7067007d4c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/9bec1c3cee532f27810f6a7067007d4c.jpg", "description": "Garrett Brown didn't look back during his 75-yard punt return for a touchdown on Saturday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Air Force runs over Morgan State, 63-7"}, "Author": "BRENT W.
