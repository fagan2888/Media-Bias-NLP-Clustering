Created through Enrollment Advisors\u2019 recent acquisition of HighRoads\u2019 employer technology division, DirectPath empowers employers to experience significant return on their benefits investments through increased employee participation, management of the evolving regulatory environment and reduced costs through efficient benefits plan management technology.\n\nDirectPath works with Fortune 1000 organizations with tens of thousands of employees spread across multiple offices. Companies like Pitney Bowes, Inc., a leading provider of informed mail and messaging equipment, have been leveraging DirectPath services and technology for more than 10 years.\n\nMary Bradley, director of health care planning at Pitney Bowes, said, \"Our company\u2019s heritage is deeply rooted in innovation, and we are always looking for new ways to enhance our benefits performance. Having had a great experience working with HighRoads, we are excited to continue our relationship with the newly formed DirectPath to further increase employee engagement and reduce health care costs.\u201d\n\nWith the advent of the Affordable Care Act and the pending Cadillac Tax, large employers across the country are looking for effective ways to migrate employees to high deductible health care plans, while simultaneously educating employees on how they can maximize their own spending under the new plans. In fact, a new report authored by DirectPath and best practice insight and technology company CEB found that nearly 90 percent of large organizations are taking steps to reduce health care coverage costs.\n\nTo contain health care costs while improving quality, it is imperative that employers\u2014and their employees\u2014have a thorough understanding of their options. When examining DirectPath\u2019s customer base, Nucleus Research found that greater cost savings come when employers promote an active strategy to annual employee open enrollment, versus a passive, self-service approach.\n\nWith DirectPath, 90\u201399 percent of all employees experience an individual, confidential benefits education and enrollment. Of those employees, 58\u201369 percent go on to participate in consumer driven health plans (CDHPs) or health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), with a 706 percent increase in program enrollment year over year. This has been proven to save employers as much as $1.5 million. Additionally, DirectPath\u2019s benefits plan management technology provides measurable cost savings through reduced errors, time and consulting fees. One DirectPath customer, a global aerospace and defense company with 96,000 employees, saved $3.7 million in productivity gains and eliminated non-strategic consulting fees using this technology.\n\n\u201cNot only are health care costs rising, but the landscape is very complex for employers and employees alike thanks to new regulations, fees and plan structures,\u201d Bart Yancey, CEO of DirectPath, said. \u201cWith our compliance technology and individualized approach to benefits engagement, DirectPath gives large employers the people and technology they need to ensure they maximize their health care spend and dramatically streamline processes. We are truly the direct path to savings.\u201d\n\nFor more information on DirectPath\u2019s services, visit directpathhealth.com.\n\nAbout DirectPath:\n\nDirectPath is an industry leader in strategic employee engagement and health care compliance for Fortune 1000 employers.
