A little.\n\nAs a deadline approaches for people to sign up for medical insurance under President Barack Obama\u2019s healthcare law, some insurers and state-run online marketplaces are giving shoppers an extra week to pay their first premiums. The shift to early January from the end of December provides a short grace period for insurers and shoppers to work through any errors in the new policies caused by technology problems dogging enrollment since it opened on October 1\u2026 Aetna Inc, which is selling health insurance on exchanges, or marketplaces, in more than a dozen states, will allow consumers to pay premiums as late as January 8. The Connecticut exchange, Access Health CT, said some shoppers can pay as late as January 7. The Vermont exchange and Covered California have announced similar extensions while Maryland requires payment by January 15. Cristine Vogel, a Navigant Consulting associate director who has health insurers and providers as clients, said that the grace period is a way for insurers to keep their members at a time when confusion about coverage is expected.\n\nThat\u2019ll avert lapses in coverage for people who see the doctor early next month, not realizing that their first payment was already due by New Year\u2019s Eve. Remember, though, according to one expert who spoke to Charles Ornstein about this, insurers can probably expect only half of their customers to have paid up by the December 31st deadline. Even if another 25 percent manage to make payment during the grace period, you\u2019re still looking at thousands of people whose coverage will lapse in January. That\u2019s a political disaster for HHS in the making. Uncle Sam will have to do something about it. But what?\n\nBob Laszewski says insurers are telling him that only about 20 percent of \u201cenrollees\u201d have made their payments so far. And that\u2019s not all:\n\nAs of this week, the 834 transaction error rates (enrollments sent from the government to the health plans) are better than they were in October and early November but are still running in the 5% to 10% range\u2013\u2013a place they have been for a number of weeks now. The Obama administration has still not built the reconciliation computer system needed to clean up the remaining enrollment data issues between HealthCare.gov and the health plans. The health plans have been told to expect an electronic file in the next few days, containing what the feds think are the health plan\u2019s enrollments through November. The plans will then have to figure out how to reconcile the two lists and then fix the problems. Many plans will have thousands of enrollments to reconcile. There will be another such file coming in January for the December enrollments with likely tens of thousands of more names to reconcile. That means that any December errors will have to be fixed before people can be covered, thereby creating additional customer service issues until the files can be cleaned up.\n\nWe know there\u2019s already a backlog of tens of thousands of applications in some of the state exchanges, but we don\u2019t know \u2014 as usual \u2014 how bad it is at the federal level. That\u2019s another incentive for insurers to grant a grace period for people who miss their payments: If their enrollment is voided due to nonpayment and they\u2019re forced to re-enroll, not only is there a chance they\u2019ll sign up with a different insurer, it\u2019s more paperwork for their current insurer even if they decide to stick with them. And thanks to President Bumblefark\u2019s botched website and delayed deadline for enrollment, more paperwork in late December/early January is something insurers simply can\u2019t afford.\n\nExit question: Is it possible that some people out there don\u2019t yet understand that they\u2019re expected to pay at all? I\u2019m tempted to say no: When you shop on the exchange, the premiums are listed right there in front of you. If anything, the greater risk is that people are paying too much attention to the pricetag and overlooking the fact that their new deductibles might be higher than expected and their provider network smaller than expected. On the other hand, if I\u2019ve learned one thing from blogging polls over the years, it\u2019s that you should never underestimate the stupidity of the very low-information voter. Could it be that there\u2019s someone out there who\u2019s so stupid that he/she thinks insurance in the age of Obama Claus is free? Exit answer: Yes.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Sweet, bro.", "title": "Surprise: Insurers begin granting grace periods to pay first month of premiums on new ObamaCare plans", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/12/surprise-insurers-begin-granting-grace-periods-to-pay-first-month-of-premiums-on-new-obamacare-plans/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-12T20:31:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-12T19:25:10+00:00"}, "keywords": "grace period, insurance, insurers, month, Obama, ObamaCare, payment, premiums, sebelius,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0103\"", "article_summary": "The health plans have been told to expect an electronic file in the next few days, containing what the feds think are the health plan\u2019s enrollments through November.\nEven if another 25 percent manage to make payment during the grace period, you\u2019re still looking at thousands of people whose coverage will lapse in January.\nThe Obama administration has still not built the reconciliation computer system needed to clean up the remaining enrollment data issues between HealthCare.gov and the health plans.\nCristine Vogel, a Navigant Consulting associate director who has health insurers and providers as clients, said that the grace period is a way for insurers to keep their members at a time when confusion about coverage is expected.\nThe Connecticut exchange, Access Health CT, said some shoppers can pay as late as January 7."}
