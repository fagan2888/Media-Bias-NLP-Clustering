Using their contacts in East Palo Alto, they helped create a new educational coding experience: StreetCode Academy, which launched this past November. StreetCode Academy is a program of nonprofit Live in Peace, where both Cosman and Barhoumi are working.\u201cWhat we realized from CodeCamp is that it\u2019s not enough to have a coding summer camp or a coding class. None of those things by themselves are enough. What you need is an ecosystem,\u201d Cosman said.Unlike CodeCamp, StreetCode will last throughout the school year and beyond. Cosman thinks a long-term technical experience will give EPA students the tools to stay in the area in which they grew up. The StreetCode team met with executives from Google, Facebook and other top companies in the area, along with some of their EPA students, where the executives advised the group of ways they can prepare to apply and receive internships at their companies.\u201cI think that East Palo Alto has a lot to offer Silicon Valley because it\u2019s got this great culture and great community focus,\u201d Cosman said. \u201cThe things that we\u2019ve seen our students do using technology have been very different than what Silicon Valley has done.\u201d\n\nOne example of a CodeCamp prodigy is Daniel Chatman, an East Palo Alto native. Through the creators of Live in Peace, an organization that teaches students how to play different instruments as a means to keep them focused, Chatman met Cosman and Barhoumi and decided to enroll in CodeCamp. His decision not only opened career doors for Chatman, but it also inspired him to create a website called Ambition Spotlight, where he highlights the creative work of people in East Palo Alto and beyond \u2014 a LinkedIn for people with atypical career paths.\n\nCosman is graduating from Stanford in June and plans to continue working with his students in East Palo Alto for the foreseeable future.\u201cWe\u2019re not just a couple of Stanford students making another nonprofit in East Palo Alto,\u201d Cosman said. \u201cBecause that happens a lot, and frankly, they\u2019re kind of sick of it. We\u2019re in this for the long haul.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "A Stanford senior studying computer science decided to put his education to what he considers a worthy cause: teaching East Palo Alto students how to code.", "title": "StreetCode Academy teaching East Palo Alto students how to code - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/StreetCode_EPA.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-24T10:15:03+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/02/19/streetcode-academy-east-palo-alto/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "technology", "published_time": "2015-02-19T16:29:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-24T10:15:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Stanford senior studying computer science decided to put his education to what he considers a worthy cause: teaching East Palo Alto students how to code.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/StreetCode_EPA.jpg", "title": "StreetCode Academy teaching East Palo Alto students how to code - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Cosman is graduating from Stanford in June and plans to continue working with his students in East Palo Alto for the foreseeable future.\u201cWe\u2019re not just a couple of Stanford students making another nonprofit in East Palo Alto,\u201d Cosman said.\nA Stanford senior studying computer science, Rafael Cosman decided to put his education to what he considers a worthy cause: teaching East Palo Alto students how to code.\nUsing their contacts in East Palo Alto, they helped create a new educational coding experience: StreetCode Academy, which launched this past November.\nWhat you need is an ecosystem,\u201d Cosman said.Unlike CodeCamp, StreetCode will last throughout the school year and beyond.\n\u201cThe things that we\u2019ve seen our students do using technology have been very different than what Silicon Valley has done.\u201dOne example of a CodeCamp prodigy is Daniel Chatman, an East Palo Alto native."}
