Jeb Bush, at the National Urban League Conference.\n\nShe preceded Bush on stage and used the moment to seize his campaign slogan, \u201cRight to Rise,\u201d and give it her own spin to attack the governor before he could speak.\n\nAccording to Clinton, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can credibly say everyone has a right to rise and then say you\u2019re for \u2026 repealing Obamacare. People can\u2019t rise if they can\u2019t afford health care. They can\u2019t rise if the minimum wage is too low to live on. They can\u2019t rise if their governor makes it harder for them to get a college education. And you cannot seriously talk about the right to rise and support laws that deny the right to vote.\u201d\n\nShe topped it all off by saying, \u201cThe opportunity gap that America is facing is not just about economic inequality, it is about racial inequality.\u201d\n\nThe AFL-CIO publishes an annual report called Executive PayWatch. According to the most recent report, in 2014 the average pay for a CEO at a Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 company was $13.5 million. At the same time, average take-home pay of nonsupervisory workers was $36,134. So on average, per the AFL-CIO, CEO earnings were 373 times greater than worker income.\n\nAnyone can email companies and the Securities Exchange Commission through the AFL-CIO website to express their outrage at this presumed unfairness.\n\nMeanwhile, Hillary Clinton\u2019s newly released tax returns show that she and Bill earned $139.1 million between 2007 and 2014, an average of $17.4 million per year. In 2014, the power couple earned $20 million in speaker fees \u2013 553 times that aforementioned average worker salary, 50 percent greater than the CEO ratio.\n\nThough some might believe that the Clintons\u2019 speeches are more valuable to the U.S. economy than the management of our largest corporations, it seems that even the AFL-CIO (which has poured millions into the Clinton Foundation) might be having second thoughts. So far Clinton hasn\u2019t won the endorsement of the huge and powerful union.\n\nClearly, Mrs. Clinton knows something about rising in America.\n\nBut is there anything in her path to wealth that\u2019s relevant to the minority Americans whose interests the National Urban League allegedly represent?\n\nHer message to the Urban League: No minority has a prayer without Clinton controlling your health care, your school, deciding what you should be paid and protecting you from racism.\n\nYou, too, can have a career in politics and rake in $20 million in speaking fees by convincing half the country that their only path to a decent life is through you.\n\nRon Haskins of the Brookings Institution notes four trends impeding upward mobility in America: family breakdown, declining work rates among males, failing public schools and increasing demand for higher education and skills.\n\nThese problems are uniformly made worse by the political world Hillary Clinton loves and gets rich in. The teachers unions that support her promote moral relativism in public schools and fight school choice. The work rate for young black males is under 50 percent, largely due to the minimum wage Hillary Clinton loves. The gross inefficiencies of government health care are emerging, and reports of increased premiums under Obamacare are widespread \u2013 CBS Moneywatch reports several insurers proposing rate increases of 51 percent in 2016.\n\nDespite left-wing rhetoric about voting discrimination, black voter turnout in the last presidential election exceeded white turnout.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Clinton\u2019s love affair with the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, which receives $500 million in taxpayer funds and performs around 330,000 abortions annually. According to ProtectingBlackLife.org, which pulled data from the 2010 census, 78 percent of Planned Parenthood abortion factories are in minority neighborhoods. This speaks to Clinton\u2019s particular concern for black lives and black families.\n\nPolitical power may have made Hillary Clinton rich. But it is making America, particularly minority America, poorer.\n\nHere\u2019s a news flash for Republicans. Black America is not monolithic. The left-wing National Urban League may still buy Clinton\u2019s failed big-government utopia. But there are millions of churchgoing conservative black Christian Americans looking for real change.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2015/08/mega-rich-hillarys-solutions-hurt-the-poor/", "site_name": "WND", "type": "article", "description": "Hillary Clinton just spoke, along with Republican presidential contender and former Florida Gov.
