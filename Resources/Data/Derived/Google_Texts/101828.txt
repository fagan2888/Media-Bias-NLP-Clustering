State university system Chancellor Marshall Criser III is making the rounds at the Capitol this week, including a presentation at today’s Senate Education Committee meeting to talk about performance funding.

The 12-university system has asked the Legislature to allocation $50 million in new money to reward schools for meeting various goals, although Gov. Rick Scott’s budget proposal only included $40 million.

Whatever the final amount, it will be divided among the universities using 10 different criteria worth a maximum of 50 points. Universities must earn at least 26 points to get any new funding. Those that earn 25 point or less risk losing 1 percent of their 2014-2015 base funding; That money would then be redistributed to the other high-scoring schools.

We have received a copy of the projections, and the three schools expected to lose money are Florida Atlantic University, University of West Florida and New College of Florida. New College President Donal O'Shea said previously that he is one Pell grant recipient away from getting the extra point needed to avoid a penalty.

The highest-scoring and highest-earning school, according to the projections, is the University of Florida, which would receive $11.7 million for its 42 points. Second place is the University of South Florida, which stands to receive $8.9 million for 37 points.

The three low-performing schools would all lose varying amounts of money, based on calculating 1 percent of their normal allocation from the state. FAU would be docked $1.4 million, UWF would lose $675,595 and New College would be $172,720 poorer.
