But the price of just one plan is falling: while that\u2019s great for people who want to purchase that one plan, it\u2019s not necessarily good news for the neediest Obamacare customers. (RELATED: Report: Obamacare Subsidies Could Fall For Low-Income Customers Seeking Cheapest Plans)\n\nThe benchmark plan is the second-lowest cost silver plan available on the Obamacare exchanges. It\u2019s how subsidies get calculated \u2014 the federal government bases the amount of subsidies it doles out partially on the cost of the insurance available. Because silver-rated plans are the most popular, more insurers are offering silver plans in Obamacare\u2019s second year \u2014 after all, many insurers shied away from the exchanges until they knew how it was going to work.\n\nThe insurers who attracted the most customers during the first year are generally hiking their rates; new insurers are generally joining and trying to entice sign-ups to switch over with lower rates. And nothing\u2019s stopping the lowest-cost insurers from doing the same next year, hiking their prices after they attract some customers.\n\nBut the drop in benchmark plans sparks more than just administrative hassles: it lowers subsidies. That\u2019s only beneficial if the cost of premiums is dropping across the board \u2014 and they\u2019re not.\n\nThe least expensive bronze plan, the cheapest offerings on the exchanges, are rising by 2.7 percent in the 48 cities, according to Kaiser. The plans are popular amongst young people, who are vital for the health of the exchanges \u2014 and anyone else who can\u2019t afford the higher premiums of a silver plan. The effect will be pushing people towards the one lowest-cost silver plan \u2014 which will undoubtedly change next year as well.\n\nIf the benchmark plan is the only one to change, that makes things more expensive for anyone receiving subsidies who doesn\u2019t want that one plan. According to Kaiser, the average rate hike for a 40 year-old on the least expensive bronze plan is 2.7 percent when subsidies are disregarded. But when last year\u2019s larger subsidies and this year\u2019s lower ones are considered, the effective rate hike is 3.1 percent instead.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just the least expensive option available on the exchanges \u2014 it says nothing about the increase in a customer\u2019s chosen health plan. Kaiser\u2019s only run the numbers on the least expensive bronze and silver plans in big cities \u2014 the plans that customers bought this year have larger rate hikes and those outside of the cities may have different experiences altogether.\n\nObamacare customers will be best served by switching plans \u2014 they\u2019ll see much higher increases if they stay in a given exchange plan year to year, according to a study from Avalere Health. The new normal for Obamacare customers, apparently, will be that those who want to keep their costs down will only be able to keep their health care plan for a year.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Nothing about Obamacare will be simple this year", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Kaiser Family Foundation updated a study Tuesday finding that the cost of the one plan Obamacare subsidies are based on are is falling ever so slightly in some cities -- meaning subsidies are shrinkin", "title": "Your Obamacare Premiums Might Not Fall, But Your Subsidy Probably Will", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/11/your-obamacare-premiums-might-not-fall-but-your-subsidy-probably-will/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-10T081837Z_1_LYNXNPEAA90A0_RTROPTP_4_CHINA-APEC-OBAMA-e1415746870771.jpg", "height": 269}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nothing about Obamacare will be simple this year", "title": "Your Obamacare Premiums Might Not Fall, But Your Subsidy Probably Will Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/11/your-obamacare-premiums-might-not-fall-but-your-subsidy-probably-will/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-10T081837Z_1_LYNXNPEAA90A0_RTROPTP_4_CHINA-APEC-OBAMA-e1415746870771.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-11 18:54:10", "sailthru.title": "Your Obamacare Premiums Might Not Fall, But Your Subsidy Probably Will", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare,subsidies", "sailthru.description": "Kaiser Family Foundation updated a study Tuesday finding that the cost of the one plan Obamacare subsidies are based on are is falling ever so slightly in some cities -- meaning subsidies are shrinkin", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2014-11-10T081837Z_1_LYNXNPEAA90A0_RTROPTP_4_CHINA-APEC-OBAMA-e1415746870771.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "(RELATED: Report: Obamacare Subsidies Could Fall For Low-Income Customers Seeking Cheapest Plans)The benchmark plan is the second-lowest cost silver plan available on the Obamacare exchanges.\nThe effect will be pushing people towards the one lowest-cost silver plan \u2014 which will undoubtedly change next year as well.\n4377218Kaiser Family Foundation updated a study Tuesday finding that the cost of the one plan Obamacare subsidies are based on are is falling ever so slightly in some cities \u2014 meaning subsidies are shrinking while other premiums aren\u2019t.\nThe report finds a less substantial decrease in the cost of one specific plan on Obamacare exchanges in just 48 cities than Kaiser had predicted earlier this fall, a 0.2 percent decrease instead of a 0.8 percent fall.\nBut the price of just one plan is falling: while that\u2019s great for people who want to purchase that one plan, it\u2019s not necessarily good news for the neediest Obamacare customers."}
