One week after Peyton Manning came down with the stomach flu, star receiver Emmanuel Sanders missed Saturday\u2019s practice with flu symptoms.\n\nCoach John Fox said he expects Sanders to travel with the team on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIllnesses are common this type of year,\u201d Fox said.\n\n\n\nSanders appeared under the weather on Friday. He didn\u2019t improve and was excused from activity. He has a decent window for recovery since the Broncos don\u2019t play until Monday night in Cincinnati. Andre Caldwell sits behind Sanders on the depth chart. Rookie Cody Latimer has been cleared from the concussion protocol, but has yet to find a niche in the offense as he learns behind veteran receivers.\n\nSanders boasts 89 catches for 1,261 yards and seven touchdowns, all career-highs in his first season with the Broncos.\n\nPeyton Manning practiced on a limited basis and remains listed as questionable on the injury report. \u201cHe looked good,\u201d Fox said, explaining that Manning\u2019s reps have been similar to a normal week. Linebacker Brandon Marshall (sprained foot) and offensive tackle Paul Cornick (right turf toe) were ruled out for the game. Marshall said Saturday his foot continues to improve. He still might sit out the final game next week to assure he heals for the playoffs, though no decision has been made.\n\nIn all, six Broncos are listed as questionable on the injury report: Manning (thigh), running back Juwan Thompson (hip/knee), Ryan Clady (thigh), Will Mongtomery (knee), Kayvon Webster (shoulder) and Sanders (illness).", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/12/20/emmanuel-sanders-misses-practice-flu-like-symptoms/31654/", "type": "blog", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/11/emmanuel-495x351.jpg", "site_name": "First-and-Orange", "title": "Emmanuel Sanders misses practice with flu-like symptoms"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "creator": "@troyrenck", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/12/20/emmanuel-sanders-misses-practice-flu-like-symptoms/31654/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/11/emmanuel-495x351.jpg", "title": "Emmanuel Sanders misses practice with flu symptoms", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Brandon Marshall,Emmanuel Sanders,Paul Cornick,Peyton Manning"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda1a\"", "article_summary": "One week after Peyton Manning came down with the stomach flu, star receiver Emmanuel Sanders missed Saturday\u2019s practice with flu symptoms.\nIn all, six Broncos are listed as questionable on the injury report: Manning (thigh), running back Juwan Thompson (hip/knee), Ryan Clady (thigh), Will Mongtomery (knee), Kayvon Webster (shoulder) and Sanders (illness).\nPeyton Manning practiced on a limited basis and remains listed as questionable on the injury report.\nCoach John Fox said he expects Sanders to travel with the team on Sunday.\nSanders boasts 89 catches for 1,261 yards and seven touchdowns, all career-highs in his first season with the Broncos."}
