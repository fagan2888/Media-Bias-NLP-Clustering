Seattle Mariners lefty Roenis Elias on Saturday kicked off a string of five consecutive sinister starters facing Colorado through Wednesday. They still have to face lefties James Paxton, Clayton Kershaw, Brett Anderson and Alex Wood.\n\nElias started the string with an omen. The lefty struck out seven Rockies in the first three innings Saturday, including the side in the third, and the Mariners left behind the Rockies in an easy 7-2 victory at Safeco Field.\n\nThe Rockies are just 6-26 against southpaws.\n\n\u201cThe level of our struggles against left-handers is a little perplexing,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.\n\nColorado is hitting just .249 against lefties, compared to .272 against right-handers. The Rockies (59-83) have won three games in a row just once since the all-star break in July. The Mariners (69-74) snapped Colorado\u2019s two-game mini-streak.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a challenge for us. We haven\u2019t hit them,\u201d Weiss said of lefties. \u201cAll kinds. Power guys, crafty guys. It\u2019s all been a struggle. We need to solve it.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies sent the minimum to bat through four innings against Elias (5-8). Only Cristhian Adames got a hit, a single in the fourth, before DJ LeMahieu hit into a double play. And Wilin Rosario walked in the fifth inning.\n\nIn the third, Kyle Parker, Tom Murphy and Brandon Barnes struck out on 14 total pitches from Elias.\n\nThe Rockies struck out 14 times Saturday, eight against Elias. He K\u2019d seven of the first nine Rockies he faced.\n\n\u201cHe threw strikes early and then was able to put us away,\u201d said Murphy, the Rockies rookie catcher who made his major-league debut. He went hitless but scored in the fifth. \u201cThat\u2019s a recipe for success.\u201d\n\nThe Mariners, in turn, found little trouble from Rockies lefty Yohan Flande. Robinson Cano hit a home run that seemed to orbit the sun before it bounced off the second-deck facade in right field to lead off the second inning.\n\nNelson Cruz lined home Kyle Seager, who doubled, in the third. And Jesus Montero homered to straight center field just over Barnes\u2019 jump at the wall in the fourth.\n\nFlande (3-3) left after 3 innings \u2014 the shortest outing of his career \u2014 having allowed six hits, with a 4-0 deficit. His relief, former starter David Hale, allowed a home run to Franklin Gutierrez in the fifth.\n\nBut the Rockies rallied some in the sixth when LeMahieu and Nolan Arenado small-balled two runs in on a fielder\u2019s choice and a sacrifice fly.\n\n\u201cReal good slider. He was getting to the back foot of our right handed hitters,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good arm.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies have the unlucky disadvantage of playing in a division with two all-world left-handers in the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 Kershaw and the San Francisco Giants\u2019 Madison Bumgarner. Of the Rockies\u2019 25 losses against lefties this season, five have come against those two.\n\nAn interleague series against the Mariners might have provided something fresh. But the Rockies are now 4-15 against American League teams (with right-handers or left) \u2014 the worst interleague mark in baseball.\n\nColorado kept close with stellar defense from right fielder Carlos Gonzalez (a full-extension, backhanded, diving catch sliding from grass to dirt to put out Cruz in the fourth) and third baseman Arenado (a quick-hop back-hand pick-up at his toes to put out Mark Trumbo in the fifth).\n\nBut Cruz blasted a two-run home run in the seventh off Hale \u2014 Cruz\u2019s major league-leading 41st homer of the year \u2014 to put the Mariners ahead by five runs.\n\n\u201cWe had a hard time making contact early. We punched out seven times the first turn through the order,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cTheir lefty was electric.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Not much \u201cleft\u201d for the Rockies in loss to Mariners at Seattle", "title": "Not much \u201cleft\u201d for the Rockies in loss to Mariners at Seattle", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/12/not-much-left-for-the-rockies-in-loss-to-mariners-at-seattle/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150912__BBORockiesMarinersp3.jpg", "height": 451}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150912__BBORockiesMarinersp3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-12T21:47:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T02:48:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Seattle Mariners lefty Roenis Elias on Saturday kicked off a string of five consecutive sinister starters facing Colorado through Wednesday.\nThe lefty struck out seven Rockies in the first three innings Saturday, including the side in the third, and the Mariners left behind the Rockies in an easy 7-2 victory at Safeco Field.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a recipe for success.\u201dThe Mariners, in turn, found little trouble from Rockies lefty Yohan Flande.\nThe Rockies struck out 14 times Saturday, eight against Elias.\nBut the Rockies are now 4-15 against American League teams (with right-handers or left) \u2014 the worst interleague mark in baseball."}
