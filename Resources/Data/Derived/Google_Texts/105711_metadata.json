But not for long, if the Obama administration gets its way in curtailing a test that flags prostate cancer before it spreads.\n\nThe administration wants to penalize doctors who routinely order the PSA blood test. Under a proposed policy, those doctors will get demerits for being considered over-spenders, while doctors who skip the test will be rewarded with a high \u201cquality\u201d rating from the government \u2014 and be paid more.\n\nThe Obama administration claims less care is better. That\u2019s double-talk. An editorial in the current issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association points to a sudden, disturbing drop in prostate-cancer detection since 2011, when the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended against using this simple test.\n\nWorse, the journal predicts more prostate-cancer deaths due to the drop.\n\nThe task force \u2014 16 government appointees \u2014 tried to argue that the test does more harm than good. Some men with high PSA scores undergo retests and biopsies only to find out they don\u2019t have cancer. Or they endure the side effects of radiation and surgery even though their cancer is slow-growing and not life-threatening.\n\nThe task force claims the test\u2019s \u201charms\u201d outweigh the \u201cbenefits.\u201d Not so fast. Of course it\u2019s distressing to get a call that you need to get retested because of a high PSA score, but that \u201charm\u201d is nothing compared to being told you have cancer that could\u2019ve been caught and stopped years earlier.\n\nWomen go back to their doctors all the time for repeat mammograms. It beats dying of breast cancer.\n\nMale patients aren\u2019t pushed into biopsies or treatment on the basis of a single abnormal PSA score anyway, explains Dr. John Williams, a New York urologist. Doctors also consider a patient\u2019s age, his prostate\u2019s size and other factors.\n\nIn truth, the Obama administration is more concerned with cutting care than preventing cancer deaths. Guided by that warped philosophy, the task force told women in their 40s not to get mammograms, and advised women 50 and over to settle for a mammogram every two years, instead of annually.\n\nThe task force\u2019s crass calculation was that 1,900 women in their 40s have to be screened to save one life. Not worth it, they said.\n\nFortunately, cancer physicians and patient-advocacy groups rebelled against that nickel-and-diming. That was in 2009. They need to mobilize again to defeat the assault on prostate-cancer screening.\n\nEven without these new proposed penalties on doctors, the task force\u2019s misguided opposition to PSA tests already has caused thousands of avoidable deaths, according to David Penson, a urological surgeon at Vanderbilt University. Many doctors stopped the test, allowing cancer to spread undetected.\n\n\u201cThis is a warning,\u201d says Dr. Anthony D\u2019Amico of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. \u201cIt is likely that men will develop more advanced prostate cancer before it is diagnosed and be less likely to be cured.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the JAMA editorial warns of advanced prostate-cancer deaths \u201cassociated with the decline in PSA screening that has occurred following the USPSTF recommendation.\u201d That\u2019s proof the task force is dead wrong.\n\nWho in their right mind would consider skipping this test to be a sign of \u201cquality\u201d care?\n\nBut it\u2019s part of a pattern. Obama\u2019s signature health law awards \u201cquality\u201d points to the hospitals that spend the least per senior, even though these are the hospitals where seniors are least apt to survive an illness.\n\nDr. Ezekiel Emanuel, the Obama administration\u2019s health-policy architect, says he has no desire to live beyond 75, so he\u2019s forgoing all treatment, including PSA tests. He\u2019s entitled.\n\nBut the rest of us who value life, including our own, need to know the facts.
