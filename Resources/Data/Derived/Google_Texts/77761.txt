As the Iroquois Nationals get set for the 2014 FIL World Lacrosse Championship, which starts on July 10-19 in Denver, Colorado, ICTMN is profiling each of the 27 players during the tournament for fans who want to know a little bit more about each player on the Nationals’s roster.

Marty Ward, Cherokee, is head coach of the Florida Southern College lacrosse team in Lakeland, Florida, where he is in his fourth season with the Moccasins.

According to Florida Southern College’s web site, Ward was a two-time All-American goalkeeper at Limestone College from 2004-2007, holds the Limestone record for saves in a career (515), and still ranks second all-time in wins (32) and saves per game (14.31).

This is not Ward’s first trip to the lacrosse championships. In 2006, he was the starting goalkeeper for the Nationals, helping the team finish fourth overall at the tournament. Ward was also an assistant coach for the Nationals's U-19 Program that won bronze at the 2012 Federation of International Lacrosse U19 World Championships in Turku, Finland.

Ward, who is the only Native American head coach of a US college lacrosse program, appreciates how his culture plays a central role in his life.

“My heritage has helped me embody the kind of man, the kind of husband, the kind of son, the kind of brother that I want to be,” Ward told CherokeePheonix.org. “It’s made me find myself a little bit…understand that I give thanks to everything, every day.”
