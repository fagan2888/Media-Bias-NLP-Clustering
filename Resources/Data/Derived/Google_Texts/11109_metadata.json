In the U.S. territory Puerto Rico, there may be hundreds of thousands of Zika infections and perhaps hundreds of affected babies, she added.\n\nFauci said it appears the first Zika vaccine candidate is on target to enter initial clinical trials in September.\n\nSchuchat declined to forecast the number of Zika infections that could occur in the United States. While she said she did not expect large outbreaks in the continental United States, \"we can't assume we're not going to have a big problem.\"\n\nSchuchat said Zika is likely to be a problem during much of a pregnancy, not just not just during the first trimester as previously believed.\n\nAs Brazil prepares to host the Olympic games in August, the CDC has recommended that pregnant women avoid traveling to the country.\n\n\"We also want people to know that travel to the area may lead to 'silent' infections or infections with symptoms, and that following infections, it's very important to take precautions during sex not to spread the virus,\" Schuchat said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has said there is a strong scientific consensus that Zika can cause microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with small heads that can result in developmental problems, as well as Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that can result in paralysis, though proof may take months or years.\n\nBrazil said last week it has confirmed more than 1,046 cases of microcephaly, and considers most to be related to Zika infections in the mothers.\n\n(Reporting by Timothy Gardner, Jeff Mason and Clarece Polk; Editing by Will Dunham)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Zika, linked to numerous cases of the birth defect microcephaly in Brazil, is spreading rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-04-12 20:05:49 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Zika, linked to numerous cases of the birth defect microcephaly in Brazil, is spreading rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean.", "title": "U.S. Officials Warn Zika 'Scarier' Than Initially Thought", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-officials-warn-zika-scarier-than-initially-thought_us_570c39e4e4b01422324a023e", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/570c3a5e2e00002d00950fe8.jpeg?cache=hdx6buehis", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HPLifestyle", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/570c3a5e2e00002d00950fe8.jpeg?cache=hdx6buehis", "height": 1000}, "description": "Zika, linked to numerous cases of the birth defect microcephaly in Brazil, is spreading rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "U.S. Officials Warn Zika 'Scarier' Than Initially Thought"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-11 20:05:49 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_570c39e4e4b01422324a023e", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "healthy-living", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "zika,zika virus,mosquitoes,mosquito zika", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "tag": "zika,zika virus,mosquitoes,mosquito zika", "published_time": "2016-04-11 20:05:49 -0400", "modified_time": "2016-04-11 23:31:34 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "Schuchat declined to forecast the number of Zika infections that could occur in the United States.\nIn the U.S. territory Puerto Rico, there may be hundreds of thousands of Zika infections and perhaps hundreds of affected babies, she added.\nBrazil said last week it has confirmed more than 1,046 cases of microcephaly, and considers most to be related to Zika infections in the mothers.\nWhile she said she did not expect large outbreaks in the continental United States, \"we can't assume we're not going to have a big problem.\"\nZika, linked to numerous cases of the birth defect microcephaly in Brazil, is spreading rapidly in Latin America and the Caribbean."}
