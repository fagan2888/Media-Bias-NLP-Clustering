Schultz said the farm, which grows organic fruits and vegetables, has succeed because of ideals that Sanders had made part of his campaign: quality public infrastructure and public education.\n\nSanders\u2019 candidacy, Schultz said, \u201cis so historic.\u201d\n\nFor an hour and 10 minutes, Sanders addressed a litany of social, economic and political issues that have been common themes in his policy proposals. Sanders called on raising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour and bringing back jobs that have been lost to foreign competition through international trade agreements. He blasted Republican lawmakers\u2019 efforts to pare down campaign finance regulations \u2014 calling out Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker specifically \u2014 and said the Supreme Court\u2019s controversial Citizens United decision should be overturned.\n\n\"This is a campaign of the people, by the people and for the people,\u201d Sanders said, which prompted a standing ovation \u2014 something that occurred with regularity at the rally.\n\nIf elected, Sanders said he also would seek to expand access to health care and make tuition free at public colleges in the United States. Those were the two big issues on the mind of Sarah Prather, a Wausau mother who said she was attending the rally to show her support for Sanders. Prather said she likes Sanders' proposal to make tuition at public colleges more affordable. Prather also said the country's health care system needs further reform \u2014 beyond the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and she likes more publicly funded models, such as Canada's.\n\nPrather said those changes would not happen should Clinton, the former secretary of State, be elected.\n\n\"I am very liberal and believe that we need a lot of changes, and I don't think anyone else is going to be making any of the changes that I want to see,\" Prather said. \u201cHillary Clinton is pretty much just a Republican saying she's a Democrat. I don't see her as very liberal as all.\"\n\nSanders ended the rally with a clear call to action, telling attendees that if enough people vote for him, he can become the Democratic nominee for president: \"If voter turnout is high, we will win,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nDoors opened shortly before 11 a.m., and Sanders took the stage just after 2 p.m. The event drew 1,800 people, according to Sean Wright, who manages The Grand. The theater's 1,200 seats were filled, while a separate overflow area was prepared to hold hundreds more, Wright said.\n\nMany of attendees stood outside for hours in the cold. One was Lori Hepp, 52, of Wisconsin Rapids, who was first in line to see Sanders Sunday morning. She left Wisconsin Rapids at 4 a.m. and was standing outside the theater by 5:20 a.m., when temperatures were hovering around 30 degrees.\n\n\"I wanted to be here,\" Hepp said. \"I wanted to be up close.\u201d\n\nThe crowd in front of the theater grew quickly throughout the morning, winding through the 400 Block toward the Jefferson Street Inn and long Jefferson Street.\n\nGiven the cold temperatures, Malarkey's Pub, across the square from The Grand, opened early to accommodate rally attendees. The pub was offering a $6 breakfast burrito, coffee and Bloody Marys, according to co-owner Tyler Vogt.\n\n\"People can warm up their hands and get something to eat,\" Vogt said.\n\nWhile polls \u2014 and delegate counts \u2014 show Sanders is unlikely to beat Clinton nationally, recent polling suggests he could prevail in Wisconsin\u2019s presidential primary on Tuesday and is especially favored in northern Wisconsin. A Marquette University Law School poll released within the last week found 49% of likely Democratic voters in the state support Sanders, while 45% support Clinton.\n\nThe margin of error in that poll was at 5.8 percentage points \u2014 larger than Sanders\u2019 lead statewide \u2014 but other polls also put Sanders ahead of Clinton in Wisconsin.\n\nSanders also is especially favored among Democrats in northern and western Wisconsin, where the Marquette poll found he has support from 54% support of likely voters versus 42% for Clinton \u2014 the widest margin in the state.\n\nStill, Clinton has secured substantially more delegates than Sanders to clinch the Democratic nomination, which requires obtaining 2,383 delegates. Clinton to date has 1,712 delegates compared to Sanders\u2019 1,011. Wisconsin offers Democrats 96 delegates.\n\nSanders and Clinton have been crisscrossing the state ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary. Both were in Eau Claire Saturday for separate events. Sanders will be in Janesville, Green Bay and Milwaukee on Monday. Clinton will make a campaign stop Monday in Milwaukee with her husband, former president Bill Clinton.\n\nRepublicans also are campaigning hard in the state, including in central Wisconsin. Donald Trump was in Rothschild Saturday for a town hall that drew at least 1,200 people to the Central Wisconsin Expo and Convention Center. His main challenger, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, held a rally in Rothschild earlier in the week and made a campaign stop Sunday evening in Wausau with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.\n\nFollow Jonathan Anderson on Twitter: @jonathanderson", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "<p>WAUSAU, Wis.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Economic inequality, political corruption and unfair laws are hampering the middle class, but there is a singular way to resolve those ills, Bernie Sanders <a...", "author": "TEGNA", "og": {"site_name": "WCSH", "description": "WAUSAU, Wis.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Economic inequality, political corruption and unfair laws are hampering the middle class, but there is a singular way to resolve those ills, Bernie Sanders said Sunday afternoon in Wausau: Vote for him.", "title": "Bernie Sanders goes after votes in Wisconsin", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2016/04/04/635952974595617255-WDH-Bernie-Sander_1364809_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.wcsh6.com/news/nation-now/bernie-sanders-goes-after-votes-in-wisconsin/118606393", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.wcsh6.com", "description": "WAUSAU, Wis.\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Economic inequality, political corruption and unfair laws are hampering the middle class, but there is a singular way to resolve those ills, Bernie Sanders said Sunday afternoon in Wausau: Vote for him.", "title": "Bernie Sanders goes after votes in Wisconsin", "image": {"src": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2016/04/04/635952974595617255-WDH-Bernie-Sander_1364809_ver1.0_640_360.jpg"}, "site": "@WCSH6", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 179811695390925}, "keywords": "nation-now", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1280"}, "article_summary": "A Marquette University Law School poll released within the last week found 49% of likely Democratic voters in the state support Sanders, while 45% support Clinton.\nThe margin of error in that poll was at 5.8 percentage points \u2014 larger than Sanders\u2019 lead statewide \u2014 but other polls also put Sanders ahead of Clinton in Wisconsin.\nOne was Lori Hepp, 52, of Wisconsin Rapids, who was first in line to see Sanders Sunday morning.\nStill, Clinton has secured substantially more delegates than Sanders to clinch the Democratic nomination, which requires obtaining 2,383 delegates.\nHe blasted Republican lawmakers\u2019 efforts to pare down campaign finance regulations \u2014 calling out Wisconsin Gov."}
