Reports of 100-year floods were coming out of Boulder and Lyons to the north. A colleague and I were walking a few blocks to a nearby restaurant for a breakfast meeting. As we walked, a man who appeared to be homeless stepped out from the side of a building. He was standing in the downpour, drenched from head to toe. Looking at both of us, he asked, \u201cMay I have your umbrella?\u201d\n\nOur reactions were startlingly different. I grabbed the handle of my umbrella more tightly and tried to frame my response. In the very same instant, my colleague handed her umbrella to the stranger \u2014 who thanked her politely. We walked on, sharing one umbrella, and entered the restaurant for our meeting.\n\nAs we looked out the window, dry and cozy, we saw the man making his way slowly down the street in a wheelchair. My colleague\u2019s umbrella was providing him with shelter from the deluge \u2014 at least for the time being.\n\nShould philanthropy be instinctive or strategic?\n\nI was stunned by my colleague\u2019s instinctive generosity \u2014 her willingness to expose herself to the elements in order to provide protection for a complete stranger. I thought that I had witnessed true philanthropy, a term that derives from the Greek philos anthropos, or love of humanity.\n\nAt the same time, I was disappointed with my own instinctive response. After all, philanthropy is my profession. I regularly donate money, food and clothing to homeless shelters and food banks but, in that moment \u2014 where the stranger asked for precisely what he needed, and I had the capacity to help \u2014 should I have said yes to his direct request?\n\nIn sharing this experience, I\u2019ve received a wide range of responses. Some say my colleague\u2019s generosity reflects true philanthropy. Others say that my instinct to keep myself dry and to provide for the disadvantaged in more thoughtful, strategic ways is the better approach and ultimately helps more people.\n\nUpon reflection, I\u2019ve concluded that both approaches are equally correct. One provides a short-term solution to an immediate problem for one person. The other provides broader solutions for a community of people in need. Aspects of each approach may well produce the best outcomes.\n\nThis thought-provoking experience reminded me of another story, where two men arrive at a riverbank to discover a number of people drowning. One man jumps into the water to rescue as many people as possible. The other runs upstream along the shore to discover how they fell into the water in order to prevent additional victims. Good philanthropy requires both types of responses: instinctive and strategic.\n\nSoon, many of us will gather around the Thanksgiving table with family and friends to indulge in an abundance of delicious food and to give thanks for our many blessings and freedoms.\n\nThis setting presents a perfect opportunity to tell the \u201ctale of two umbrellas\u201d \u2014 and discuss your reaction to these questions.\n\n\u2022 How would you have reacted to the man in the rain?\n\n\u2022 Is one approach better than the other?\n\n\u2022 Would you have reacted differently if he asked for money?\n\n\u2022 What is our responsibility to help others in need?\n\n\u2022 How can we be more kind in our day-to-day interactions with people less-fortunate than us?\n\n\u2022 As the holidays approach, should we set aside a portion of our \u201cgift purchase\u201d money for each other to be contributed to a common \u201cfamily and friends\u201d cause that will improve the lives of others?\n\n\u2022 What philanthropic behaviors do we aspire to? How can we serve as models for our children and grandchildren?\n\nAs we approach the Thanksgiving table, let us be grateful. But let us also recall that 50 million people in the United States regularly go hungry, including one of five children. What can we do to share our abundance with others? How can we do it most meaningfully and effectively?\n\nBruce DeBoskey is a Colorado-based philanthropic strategist working with The DeBoskey Group to help businesses, foundations and families design and implement their philanthropic initiatives.
