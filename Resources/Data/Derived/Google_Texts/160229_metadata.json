He\u2019s been thinking about them. At least that\u2019s the impression a visibly frustrated Obama and the first lady gave in their Barbara Walters interview.\n\nThe Obamas\u2019 interview Friday with Barbara Walters left me with one takeaway: They\u2019re looking forward to the end of the president\u2019s term. And to be honest, who can blame them?\n\nOf course, neither President Obama nor first lady Michelle Obama stated that explicitly. They didn\u2019t say they have a \u201ccount down the days until we\u2019re outta here\u201d calendar in their bedroom. And I\u2019m not saying the president is throwing in the towel.\n\nBut the Obamas\u2019 tone reminded me of when you\u2019ve already decided to break up with the person you\u2019re dating, though you haven\u2019t told the other person yet. Sure, you\u2019re still going through the motions, but one foot is already out the door. I think the Obamas are ready to break up with us\u2014and especially with Congress.\n\nI first noticed it when Walters asked the president about his post-White House plans. He didn\u2019t offer the usual clich\u00e9d answer, something like: \u201cI haven\u2019t even thought about that because we have so much work to finish.\u201d\n\nInstead, when Walters asked whether he would still be active in politics after his presidency, Michelle jumped in with a resounding \u201cno!\u201d Sure, she was laughing, but there\u2019s often truth to our humor. The Obamas then discussed the impact moving away from Washington, D.C., could have on their younger daughter, Sasha, in a way that made clear it wasn\u2019t first time the subject had been broached.\n\nBut to me the most telling remark came when Walters asked whether the first lady would have made a better president than her husband. The president laughingly responded that Michelle would have been superior, though he added: \u201cBut she\u2019s smart enough to know that she might not want to go through the process.\u201d The first lady echoed that thought, saying her husband has a level of a \u201cpatience\u201d and \u201ccalm\u201d that most, including her, do not possess.\n\nYou could detect from them an underlying sense of frustration and almost acceptance that things likely would not improve much for the rest of Obama\u2019s second term. And that feeling is understandable. Just look at how Obama\u2019s fortunes have changed since he took office in 2009. He won the Nobel Peace Prize within the first year. His No. 1 legislative priority, Obamacare, became law in March 2010. And the United States\u2019 image worldwide improved considerably in his first two years in office.\n\n\n\nBut the economy was still sputtering in mid-2010, causing Obama\u2019s approval numbers to slide and the Republicans to take control of the House and make gains in the Senate that November. Since then we have seen the president fight congressional Republicans tooth and nail on seemingly every issue, from raising the debt celling to confirming his nominees and even picking the day he could deliver an address to Congress.\n\nAnd all along the right has kept up a constant drumbeat of baseless personal attacks against him. Among the claims: that Obama was born in Kenya\u2014recently reasserted by Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s father\u2014that he\u2019s a Muslim, that he\u2019s a socialist, and that he\u2019s \u201cpalling around with terrorists.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse, some congressional Democrats, in an \u201cEt tu\u201d moment, even turned on him, refusing to support his proposal to close Guantanamo Bay and universal background checks for prospective gun purchasers.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the Obamacare website rollout fiasco. His approval rating is now at an all-time low\u2014not a good place to be if you want to convince Congress to support your legislative initiatives.\n\nAt this point, a successful second term for Obama would simply be thwarting congressional Republicans from gutting food stamps and other social programs that help less fortunate Americans.\n\nBut the bigger question is: Why would anyone want to be president in this political climate? You either have to be a masochist or have an acute Messiah complex. In 2012, it seemed as if many Republicans had both, with Michele Bachmann, Rick Santorum, and Herman Cain all claiming that God had told them to run for president. (In their defense, they could have been right. Maybe God was bored and wanted some laughs.)\n\nLet\u2019s be brutally honest. If a Republican wins the presidency in 2016, the payback from Democrats will be vicious. I\u2019m talking about something out of a Quentin Tarantino movie. And if a Democrat wins, especially Hillary Clinton, we can expect to see more of what Obama has been made to endure. That translates into more gridlock in Washington, which is bad for the rest of us.\n\nFuture presidents can forget legislative achievements. Instead, he or she should resolve just to enjoy free dinners and unlimited limo service while marking time until their term ends, freeing them to rake in the millions with a book deal and speaking fees.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "TheDeansreport"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli, Barack Obama", "publicationDate": 201312021045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Post-presidency plans?
