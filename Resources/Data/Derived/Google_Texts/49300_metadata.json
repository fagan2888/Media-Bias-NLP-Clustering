But he still polls in low double digits in some key primary states, which means top tier candidates have to be wondering where his supporters will go if and when he calls it quits.\n\nRelated: How Trump Could \u2018Run the Table\u2019 If He Beats Cruz in Iowa\n\nCarson, a deeply religious man, has connected with voters to whom a candidate\u2019s faith is important. Despite Trump\u2019s claims about loving the Bible, there is only one candidate left in the top tier of GOP hopefuls who can credibly claim to be as religious as Carson: Trump\u2019s chief rival, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nIt\u2019s far from clear how much of Carson\u2019s support might move to Cruz if the retired doctor leaves the race, but with the Texan closing the gap between them, Trump has a strong interest in keeping that number as low as possible.\n\nThat\u2019s probably why Carson adviser Armstrong Williams saw the hand of the Trump campaign in an interview that former Carson campaign manager Barry Bennett and former spokesman Doug Watts gave Politico on Thursday.\n\nDespite constant assertions that he has no formal connection to the Carson campaign, Williams, a conservative talk show host, has long held the role of de facto spokesman for Carson. So it was no surprise when Williams jumped on Facebook Friday morning to hurl accusations that Bennett and Watts were working on the billionaire\u2019s behalf.\n\nRelated: Trump Wins Few Fans Among the Elite at Davos\n\nWatts and Bennett, by all accounts, clashed repeatedly with Williams and, in the end, with Carson himself, over strategy and tactics. In the interview, they advised Carson to quit the campaign and endorse current national frontrunner Donald Trump instead.\n\n\u201cThe unmitigated gall of Barry Bennett and Doug Watts: To attempt to curry favor with the Trump campaign by delivering Dr. Carson's campaign infrastructure on a platter is nothing short of amazing,\u201d Williams wrote on Facebook.\n\nHe went on to say that while they were instrumental in helping the Carson campaign last year, the two are now \u201cbetraying\u201d the candidate. He accused them of sidling up to the Trump campaign in hopes of finding new work.\n\nHe concluded, \u201cBut just to make it extra clear: neither Bennett nor Watts has any influence whatsoever over who Dr. Carson may ultimately endorse in the primary should the occasion arise.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump\u2019s Big Weakness in Iowa, and What He Plans to Do About It\n\nWilliams, as a Washington Post piece published late Friday morning revealed, turned out to be right that there was a strong Trump-related reason why at least one of Carson\u2019s former advisers was calling for a Trump endorsement from Carson.\n\nBennett, the Post\u2019s Robert Costa reported, has taken on an advisory role with the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cI believe Trump is going to win and it\u2019s important that his campaign is ready for everything that is coming,\u201d Bennett told Costa. \u201cI\u2019m here to do what is needed. I\u2019m not being paid and I\u2019m going to be mostly focused on getting my business back up and running.\u201d\n\nBy taking on Bennett, the Trump campaign may have scuttled any chance of gaining the actual endorsement of Carson, but it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019d have received it anyway. To the extent Bennett helps Trump divert even some Carson voters to the Trump camp, it\u2019s a savvy move by the Trump campaign.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Amid cries of betrayal, a former Ben Carson campaign manager takes an advisory position with Donald Trump and calls on his former boss to leave the race and endorse the mogul.", "title": "Trump Looks to Gain from Carson Campaign Meltdown", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/22/Trump-Looks-Gain-Carson-Campaign-Meltdown", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03182013_ben_carson_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/22/Trump-Looks-Gain-Carson-Campaign-Meltdown", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03182013_ben_carson_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Amid cries of betrayal, a former Ben Carson campaign manager takes an advisory position with Donald Trump and calls on his former boss to leave the race and endorse the mogul.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "To the extent Bennett helps Trump divert even some Carson voters to the Trump camp, it\u2019s a savvy move by the Trump campaign.\nHe accused them of sidling up to the Trump campaign in hopes of finding new work.\nThat\u2019s probably why Carson adviser Armstrong Williams saw the hand of the Trump campaign in an interview that former Carson campaign manager Barry Bennett and former spokesman Doug Watts gave Politico on Thursday.\nHe went on to say that while they were instrumental in helping the Carson campaign last year, the two are now \u201cbetraying\u201d the candidate.\nDespite constant assertions that he has no formal connection to the Carson campaign, Williams, a conservative talk show host, has long held the role of de facto spokesman for Carson."}
