We respect employees' rights to engage in legally protected activities and will not to prevent the participation of any employees who choose to join.\"\n\nThursday's strike in Pittsburgh is also expected to include employees working in other industries such as fast-food, home care and nursing home facilities, plus faith leaders, students, families and community members, as part of a global effort for a $15 minimum wage, according to the SEIU.\n\n\"We are striking in protest of UPMC's unlawful interference with our union rights so that we can have a seat at the table to make UPMC truly responsive to hospital workers, our patients and our community,\" said Nila Payton, a receptionist at UPMC Presbyterian. \"Pittsburgh is a city of people who stand up for ourselves and the raises we won are only a first step in holding UPMC accountable to our city.\"\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/upmc-workers-plan-thursday-strike-demand-15-hour-right-unionize", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/upmchitn.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center employees plan to walk off their jobs on Thursday to protest the hospital's alleged harassing of workers who want to form a union and to call for an immediate hike of the system's minimum wage to $15 an hour, according to the Service Employees International Un", "title": "UPMC workers plan Thursday strike, demand $15 an hour, right to unionize"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/upmchitn.png"}, "description": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center employees plan to walk off their jobs on Thursday to protest the hospital's alleged harassing of workers who want to form a union and to call for an immediate hike of the system's minimum wage to $15 an hour, according to the Service Employees International Un", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "UPMC workers plan Thursday strike, demand $15 an hour, right to unionize"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "University of Pittsburgh Medical Center employees plan to walk off their jobs on Thursday to protest the hospital's alleged harassing of workers who want to form a union and to call for an immediate hike of the system's minimum wage to $15 an hour, according to the Service Employees International Union.&#13; In March, UPMC said it would increase the minimum starting salaries for entry-level positions to $15 an hour by January 2021.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\"It has come to our attention that some UPMC employees have been approached to join a national initiative to walk off the job tomorrow,\" said UPMC in a statement.\nWe respect employees' rights to engage in legally protected activities and will not to prevent the participation of any employees who choose to join.\"\nThe settlement resolved most charges filed by the union over incidents which allegedly occurred when the SEIU had been in the early stages of organizing a UPMC union.\nIn March, UPMC said it would increase the minimum starting salaries for entry-level positions to $15 an hour by January 2021.\nAdditionally, average service worker pay at these facilities will exceed $15 an hour by January 2019, the health system said."}
