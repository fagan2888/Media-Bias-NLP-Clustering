But he also says the Republican Party should be run \u201cfrom the bottom up, rather than the top down,\u201d and do more to help the poor, mentally ill and incarcerated.\n\n\u201cI think our actions have to reflect our rhetoric,\u201d Kasich told Reuters in an interview as he campaigned for Republican candidates in the industrial city of Youngstown ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections. \u201cSo when we say we\u2019re a party of opportunity, there should be (opportunity),\u201d he said, adding that in Ohio, Republicans will \u201cleave no one behind.\u201d\n\nHis message is an updated version of former President George W. Bush's mantra of \"compassionate conservative.\" It is unclear if it would resonate well enough with Republican voters and donors to make Kasich a serious contender for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nBut in Ohio, a presidential battleground state, voters seem receptive. Polls show that in Kasich's campaign to retain the governor's office, he has a double-digit lead over Democratic challenger Ed FitzGerald ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote.\n\nWhen asked if he will seek the presidency, Kasich insisted he is focused on being governor. But he made clear he believes Ohio\u2019s brand of Republicanism could play well nationally.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that the things we are doing in the state will influence some of the strains of the Republican Party,\u201d he said, referring to differing currents within the party.\n\nDuring a three-day bus tour last week, Kasich emphasized caring for people with addictions, assisting the disabled and reducing offender recidivism.\n\nRepublican candidates on the tour made stops on Thursday at a factory in rural Richland County, a family-owned deli west of Cleveland, a church in an Akron suburb and an air compressor distributor in the Democratic stronghold of Youngstown.\n\nAt Dearing Compressor and Pump Co., which has grappled with years of layoffs at auto and steel plants, Kasich told workers of his upbringing outside Pittsburgh by parents who were Democrats, suggesting his brand of Republican policies can work for Democrats too.\n\n\u201cIn 1980, my dad thought about the country ... he voted for Ronald Reagan, lots of Democrats did,\u201d Kasich said to the subdued but polite crowd.\n\nOHIO SUCCESSES COULD BE SPRINGBOARD\n\nKasich, 62, is a former U.S. congressman who won a tight race for governor against incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland in 2010. After leaving the U.S. House of Representatives in 2001 he worked for the investment bank Lehman Brothers until its 2008 bankruptcy, a role highlighted by Strickland during the 2010 campaign. As he was leaving the House, he briefly explored a White House bid but had difficulty raising money.\n\nKasich at times speaks in an offhanded manner. Shortly after being elected governor, he said to a group of state environmental workers that a police officer who ticketed him was an \u201cidiot,\u201d angering the law enforcement officers union. A spokesman apologized for his word choice and Kasich later met with the officer and apologized to him in person.\n\nPublic employees unions are still smarting over a Kasich-backed law early in his tenure to curb collective bargaining. Voters repealed the measure and Kasich opted to move onto other issues.\n\nKasich often cites how Ohio has built up nearly $1.5 billion in savings in its \u201cRainy Day Fund,\u201d how the state's unemployment rate is 5.6 percent, below the 5.9 percent nationwide unemployment rate, and how its credit rating has improved. The figures would support his image as a fiscal conservative during a White House bid.\n\nA new health office has allowed Ohio to reduce Medicaid spending, even while extending coverage to hundreds of thousands of additional low-income residents under the President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act.\n\nKasich moved ahead with Medicaid expansion despite opposition from the Republican-controlled legislature. Many other Republican governors opted out of the expansion, an element of Obamacare. If Kasich decides to run for president, that could be heavy baggage in a primary, given the antipathy toward the law among Tea Party voters.\n\nStrategists say Kasich would have to play to the middle to be a viable White House contender. Texas Senator Ted Cruz and Kentucky Senator Rand Paul would draw grassroots support from the party\u2019s conservative and libertarian wings.\n\nBut the middle could be crowded. Potential candidates such as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush are far better known nationally than Kasich and might amass campaign cash more easily.\n\n(Reporting By Amanda Becker; Additional reporting by Gabriel Debenedetti in Washington; Editing by Caren Bohan and Frances Kerry)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Amanda Becker", "Author": "Amanda Becker", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "In the struggle\u00a0within the Republican Party\u00a0between the conservative Tea Party flank and moderates, Ohio Governor John Kasich is seeking to position\u00a0himself as someone who can appeal to both sides.", "title": "Ohio Republican governor, with possible eye on 2016, preaches compassion", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20141102&t=2&i=988248261&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEAA105T", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
