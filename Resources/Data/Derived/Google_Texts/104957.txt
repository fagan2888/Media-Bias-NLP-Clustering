SAO PAULO (AP) - Neymar could be banned for more than a game because of the red card received after Brazil’s 1-0 loss to Colombia in the Copa America.

Neymar will miss the final group match against Venezuela on Sunday and is in danger of receiving a longer suspension that could keep him from playing in the quarterfinals, and even beyond if Brazil advances.

CONMEBOL said Neymar’s case will be analyzed on Friday.

After the final whistle of Wednesday’s match, a frustrated Neymar kicked the ball toward a Colombian defender and then tried to head-butt another player who confronted him. Colombia’s Carlos Bacca shoved Neymar from behind and also was sent off.

Neymar had already been shown a yellow card that would’ve kept him from playing against Venezuela.
