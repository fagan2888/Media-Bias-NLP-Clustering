An Oakwood man was hospitalized after a dangerous crash in Custer County.

Christopher Sturgeon, 53, was transported via Air Evac to OU Medical Center after crashing his 1997 Jeep Cherokee just a few miles outside of Thomas, OK.

According to police, Sturgeon's Jeep ran off the roadway to the right and then corrected back on to the road. Police say that's when Sturgeon exited the vehicle and was dragged approximately 30 feet before the Jeep ran off the road to the left.

The Jeep then struck a fence before it wound up catching fire in a ditch.

Sturgeon was admitted in critical condition with trunk, internal and head injuries. More details as they become available.
