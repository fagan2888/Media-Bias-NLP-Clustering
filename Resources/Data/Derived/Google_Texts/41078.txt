VIENNA—The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries doesn’t see oil prices consistently trading at $100 barrel again in the next decade, a pessimistic assessment that has the group considering the return of production limits to influence the market, according to people familiar with a recent strategy report.

The report, seen by The Wall Street Journal, predicts that oil prices US:CLM5 will be about $76 a barrel in 2025 in its most optimistic scenario, the people said, a reflection of the cartel’s worries that American competitors will be able to cope with low prices and keep pumping out supplies. It also contemplates situations where crude oil costs below $40 a barrel in 2025, the people said.
