That\u2019s roughly one in three residents. By comparison, about 1.4 million Californians are enrolled in Covered California.\n\nGiven its size, Medi-Cal\u2019s annual renewal process is now one of its greatest challenges. Last year\u2019s process was new, messy and confusing, and many Californians \u2014 we\u2019re not being told how many \u2014 were dropped from the program.\n\nThis year, Medi-Cal has changed the process again, and already people are complaining that they\u2019re getting dropped when they shouldn\u2019t.\n\nQ: I never received my Medi-Cal renewal application, but I just got a notice saying I\u2019m getting kicked off because I didn\u2019t turn it in. What should I do?\n\nA: Michael Gong, an Oakland graduate student, joined Medi-Cal last year when California expanded Medi-Cal eligibility (through the Affordable Care Act) to childless adults and those with higher incomes than before.\n\nUnder the new rules, individuals and families earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level can qualify. This year, that equates to about $16,200 for a single adult.\n\nWhen Gong received the letter in late January saying he was going to be dropped, he began a month-long quest to get reinstated. He submitted the renewal materials, which is allowed within a grace period. But in response, he received another termination letter in mid-February saying he can\u2019t be in Medi-Cal because he\u2019s not a California resident. (Whether or not you think Oakland belongs in California, it is generally accepted to be within our borders.)\n\nAt that point, he and his mother, Judyth Collin, made dozens of unanswered calls to county workers (who process Medi-Cal applications and determine eligibility) and visited county offices. Finally, she reached a supervisor by phone, who helped Gong get back on Medi-Cal in early March.\n\nGong\u2019s problems aren\u2019t isolated. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing from people who have been cut off who have turned in their forms,\u201d says Jen Flory, senior attorney at the Western Center on Law and Poverty. \u201cAnd we\u2019re hearing from people who are trying to contact their county workers and are having trouble getting through.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheoretically, this year\u2019s renewal process should be easier. If you enrolled in Medi-Cal or completed renewal forms last year and your county can determine that your eligibility hasn\u2019t changed, you should receive a letter this year confirming your enrollment for another year.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, we\u2019re not sending out an enormous blank packet for people to fill out,\u201d says Cathy Senderling-McDonald, deputy executive director of the County Welfare Directors Association.\n\nSome may not qualify for auto-renewal and will receive a notice that requests additional information, such as proof of income or state residency. If you receive that, you will have at least 30 days to respond, Senderling-McDonald said.\n\nRoughly 1 million Californians will be asked to renew each month, according to the state Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), which administers Medi-Cal at the state level.\n\nThe stakes are high, but it\u2019s hard to gauge the impact because Medi-Cal officials decline to say how many people have been dropped from the program as a result of the renewal process this year and last. \u201cThese data are not available currently,\u201d says Tony Cava of DHCS.\n\nHere\u2019s my advice: If you get a termination notice because you didn\u2019t submit renewal information \u2014 whether or not it was your fault \u2014 get that paperwork in as soon as possible.\n\nYou have 90 days from the date of termination to submit. If you make that and you\u2019re still eligible for the program, you will be reinstated retroactive to the date you were kicked out, Flory said.\n\nNext, reach out to your county case worker \u2014 I know, easier said than done. The roughly 15,000 county workers dedicated to Medi-Cal are overwhelmed. They\u2019re juggling an onslaught of new applications and renewals (some of last year\u2019s load was pushed into this year) \u2014 and persistent computer problems. For instance, the state computer system won\u2019t allow county workers to deny applications themselves or drop people who are ineligible, Senderling-McDonald said. All told, that leads to backlogs and mistakes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of manual work that counties are still doing to get around the issues in the computer system,\u201d she says.\n\nBut there\u2019s hope. The state is working on the technical problems. By July, county workers are scheduled to have the ability to deny applications on their own, Senderling-McDonald said. There\u2019s also $150 million in the current-year state budget to beef up county Medi-Cal resources, including money for overtime pay.\n\nSo, here are some tips until things get better:\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t ignore letters you receive from Medi-Cal. Because the forms are changing, your annual renewal probably won\u2019t look like it has in the past.\n\n\u2022 Be persistent. Ask for a supervisor if you\u2019re having trouble reaching someone at your county human services agency.\n\n\u2022 Request an eligibility hearing by calling 800-952-5253 if you receive a notice that you\u2019ll be losing your benefits. Doing this will flag your case for attention, and it may get resolved before your hearing date.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to submit a query, email AskEmily@usc.edu.
