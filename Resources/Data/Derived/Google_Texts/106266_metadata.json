Currently, roughly 4.2 million people are receiving Social Security benefits under such circumstances. These individuals could be using representative payees because of mild memory loss or problems balancing a checkbook.\n\nOver 50 percent of the veterans reported to the background check system by the VA are over age 80. Congressional Republicans have challenged the policy by unveiling legislation multiple times, most recently introducing the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act in the House.\n\nSocial Security has not yet been reporting individuals to the background check system, the database for which contains the records of 13 million people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration wants to bar certain individuals receiving Social Security benefits from owning firearms if they are not able to handle their affairs.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "In a new push toward gun control, the Obama administration wants to bar certain individuals receiving Social Security benefits from owning firearms if they are deemed no longer able to handle their af", "title": "Obama Administration Pushes to Block Some Old People from Owning Guns", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/obama-administration-pushes-to-block-some-old-people-from-owning-guns/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Old-woman-with-a-gun-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a new push toward gun control, the Obama administration wants to bar certain individuals receivin", "creator": "@mchalfant16", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Old-woman-with-a-gun-150x150.jpg", "title": "Obama Administration Pushes to Block Some Old People from Owning Guns", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b9a\"", "article_summary": "Currently, roughly 4.2 million people are receiving Social Security benefits under such circumstances.\nBY: Follow @mchalfant16In a new push toward gun control, the Obama administration wants to bar certain individuals receiving Social Security benefits from owning firearms if they are deemed no longer able to handle their affairs.\nOver 50 percent of the veterans reported to the background check system by the VA are over age 80.\nSocial Security has not yet been reporting individuals to the background check system, the database for which contains the records of 13 million people.\nEstablished in 1993, the background check system is used to prevent certain dangerous individuals \u2014 criminals, drug addicts, illegal immigrants, domestic abusers and others \u2014 from obtaining firearms."}
