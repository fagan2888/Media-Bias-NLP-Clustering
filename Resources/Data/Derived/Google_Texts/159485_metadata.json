They can also serve as air purifiers and natural humidifiers.\n\nWhile I have trouble keeping plants alive, they thrive under the care of my green-thumbed husband.\n\nI teased him recently that he was turning our home into a jungle. Almost every window is adorned with at least one plant, as are several other surfaces throughout the house.\n\nBut I can\u2019t complain. The other day, after my husband brought home a new batch of plants, the air smelled so fresh I thought someone must have left a window open. They were all closed.\n\nHere are five plants touted for their air-filtering abilities.\n\nEnglish ivy\n\nEnglish ivy is particularly useful in eliminating airborne fecal-matter particles, according to Healthy and Natural World. It also helps soak up carcinogens from second-hand smoke and doesn\u2019t require much maintenance.\n\nIt has also been shown to filter out formaldehyde found in some household cleaning products, according to Mother Nature Network.\n\nBut it is toxic to dogs, cats and horses, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals states.\n\nSnake plant\n\nThe snake plant, also called mother-in-law\u2019s tongue, is one of the best for filtering out formaldehyde, according to Mother Nature Network, and it will thrive in low-light, humid conditions, like a bathroom.\n\nThe highest levels of airborne formaldehyde have been detected in indoor air, where it is released from various consumer products such as building materials and home furnishings, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThe EPA considers it a probable human carcinogen.\n\nThe snake plant is easy to care for and is unique in how it takes in carbon dioxide and releases oxygen at night, according to Healthy and Natural World.\n\nBut the ASPCA states it can be toxic to dogs and cats.\n\nAloe\n\nAloe is easy to grow and helps clear formaldehyde and benzene, a byproduct of chemical-based cleaners and paints, according to Mother Nature Network.\n\nAnother benefit is the gel found inside the plant\u2019s leaves can be used to treat cuts, burns and skin conditions like psoriasis and cold sores, according to WebMD.\n\nAloe is toxic to dogs and cats, according to the ASPCA.\n\nSpider plant\n\nThe spider plant filters benzene, formaldehyde, carbon monoxide and xylene, a solvent used in the leather, rubber and printing industries, according to Mother Nature Network. It\u2019s also a safe houseplant for people with pets.\n\nPeace lily\n\nThe peace lily is one of few houseplants that will bloom indoors, according to Organic Gardening, and it\u2019s one of the best plants for removing formaldehyde. It also removes benzene and certain volatile organic compounds (chemicals emitted by an array of products, like paints, cleaning supplies and building materials), Organic Gardening\u2019s website states.\n\nIt has a high transpiration rate, which will humidify your air. But be careful. The peace lily\u2019s leaves can be poisonous to pets and children.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "variety,Garden,Plants,Home,5 spot", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Tracy Frank", "og": {"site_name": "INFORUM", "description": "FARGO \u2013 Plants can be a beautiful way to decorate your home, but they offer more than aesthetic benefits.
