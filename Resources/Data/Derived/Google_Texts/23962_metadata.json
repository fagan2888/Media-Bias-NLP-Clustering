There, identify the lies and the deceptions that demand debunking and get to work as quickly, as diligently, as assiduously as possible taking nothing for granted and leaving nothing to chance. Cover one's district back and forth, take the time, spend the energy, walk, drive, meet, speak, discuss, challenge, convince, but, especially and most importantly, listen and answer by debunking the lies and informing with clarity on the good.\n\nSimultaneously, as one works to debunk the lies and to clear the electorate view, tell the voters, both republicans and Democrats, how and who is paying for the lies being told them, remind them that you want the \"good of all Americans in your entire district for, after all, whether Republicans or Democrats, we are all Americans!\"\n\nIn this campaign, during these few months left before November, democratic candidates must stop acting sleepy, sloppy, shy, humble or scared and go tit-for-tat with the Republicans. Remember, when truth keeps quiet and stops shining, lies, in the end, become believable (I will never forget that one of my heroes, John Kerry, lost the 2004 presidential elections mostly for being too nice and refusing to go tit-for-tat against the callous lies of the Republicans who dirtied his heroic military service to our country, especially considering the fact that his opponent avoided seeing combat during the war that my hero served in).\n\nThe Democratic candidate who desires to win must focus on going town to town, town meeting to town meeting, restaurant to church, high school to college, supermarket to sport activity, speaking, dialoguing, having a conversation, debating from a righteous stand point with all voters of one's district and, when necessary -- when confronted with the lies and the false distortions of the party of \"No!\" and their fringes -- be ready with the facts in order to confront, debunk, and destroy the lies and the misleading propaganda of those who have not offered any legislation or any agenda that would help America; but, instead, they want to be elected through lies and distortions and scare tactics.\n\nAs Americans in one's district are informed and are given the true facts, they will ultimately choose LLPH over the politics of \"us against them!\", of hatred, lies, distortions, and disinformation.\n\nThe question is, how many Democratic candidates are determined and have the guts and \"the mind to work\" full-time for the win this November? Or are they all giving up, already listening to and believing the tea-leaves-readers?\n\nFollow Yaa-Lengi Ngemi on Twitter: www.twitter.com/yaalengi", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.expire_date": "2014-07-16 17:06:23 -0400", "og": {"url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yaalengi-ngemi/heres-how-democrats-can-win_b_5583449.html", "type": "article", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/o-US_UK_CA-facebook.jpg", "site_name": "The Huffington Post", "locale": "en_US"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/o-US_UK_CA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "yaalengi"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-07-15 17:06:23 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5583449", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "elections 2014,all politics are local,republican lies,president obama,Koch Brothers,debunking lies,how to win,campaign,democrats,wining by democrats,republicans", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "elections 2014,all politics are local,republican lies,president obama,Koch Brothers,debunking lies,how to win,campaign,democrats,wining by democrats,republicans", "published_time": "2014-07-15 17:06:23 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-09-14 05:59:06 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd97ec\"", "article_summary": "As Americans in one's district are informed and are given the true facts, they will ultimately choose LLPH over the politics of \"us against them!\nto everything Obama and the Democrats want to do for the good of ALL Americans.\nThe question is, how many Democratic candidates are determined and have the guts and \"the mind to work\" full-time for the win this November?\nFrom the above then, any Democratic candidate, whether incumbent or challenger, has the tools and the necessary facts to lead him or her to victory this November 2014, even in electoral districts that usually vote republican.\n\"All Politics Are Local\"\"All politics are local\" and debunking lies and deceptions demand constancy and perseverance wherever they're spread."}
