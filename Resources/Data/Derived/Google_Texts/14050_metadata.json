The Internet is abuzz with talk about the myriad of ways Obama might seek to extend his White House role \u2013 sparked in part by radio conjecture from conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh \u2013 and now at least one likely presidential candidate, Ben Carson, has weighed in to say: Don\u2019t worry, Obama will leave.\n\nFirst, the question from WND to Carson: \u201cWho would stop Obama from remaining in office past his second term?\u201d\n\nAnd Carson\u2019s reply, via email: \u201cWe the people would oppose it through our Constitution, the 22nd Amendment of which forbids more than two terms. Even some of the timid people in the other two branches of government would be willing to stand behind the fortified walls of our Constitution.\u201d\n\nSounds reasonable \u2013 but the buzz persists.\n\nAs far back as February 2014, Limbaugh was raising the \u201cwhat-if\u201d about an Obama who refused to leave office. Then, he was discussing the three-year extension for the employer mandate in Obamacare on his show and said, \u201cNow they\u2019re delaying the thing until after Obama\u2019s gone, although what evidence do we have that Obama\u2019s leaving? \u2018Well, Rush, I mean the Constitution says \u2013\u2019 Yeah? And the Constitution also says he can\u2019t do what he\u2019s doing here. \u2026 So when you make jokes about Obama having to leave office \u2026 why?\u201d\n\nLimbaugh spoke of the issue again on one of his most recent radio shows, after a caller bluntly asked: How would we get Obama out of office if Democrats wanted him to stay?\n\nLimbaugh\u2019s reply: \u201cLet\u2019s fast forward to, say, May, June of 2016 \u2026 [Obama] would go on television and say that the Democrat field is so weak that he\u2019s not confident that Mrs. Clinton can win. He might even take steps to make sure she can\u2019t win. You know, sabotage her campaign. And then call a national speech to the nation in which the main point is that it\u2019s beginning to look like the Republicans will win the White House and this is something that he can\u2019t risk. Not after eight courageous years of transforming America. \u2026 So as a service to the nation, he is going to forget the Twenty-Second Amendment and either not leave office or run for reelection himself as the Democrat nominee. Just imagine that scenario. I don\u2019t care how unreal it sounds, how unbelievable it sounds. Imagine it. What would anybody do? What would Mitch McConnell do? What would John Boehner do?\u201d\n\nLimbaugh\u2019s conclusion?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d be done,\u201d he said, adding that the Supreme Court would turn away the case, based on standing, while the media would cheer Obama.\n\nHe then warned: \u201cPut all this in the mix. This guy\u2019s out there thinking about this. It\u2019s hard to believe, it\u2019s so unlikely.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s still possible, Limbaugh said.\n\n\u201cWhat would the Republicans do? I think the odds are the Republicans might call an emergency constitutional convention and amend the Twenty-Second Amendment, permitting Obama to do this because their fear of being critical of Obama would destroy their chances of winning with the Independents,\u201d he said, on his Friday show.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as if Americans aren\u2019t wondering the same scenario.\n\nThe news forum for \u201cThe Sean Hannity Show\u201d is filled with discussion of just such a hypothetical. The leading question: \u201cWhat if Obama found a way to suspend, or dismiss, the 2016 election cycle, or results, and refused to leave office? What would your reaction be?\u201d And another forum, Quora, asked similarly: \u201cWill President Obama leave office after two terms, as per the Constitution?\u201d Replies varied.\n\n\u201cYes, he will,\u201d wrote Susie Downing. \u201cThis is one of the things I love about my country. Every four or eight years, on January 20th, the most powerful man in the free world packs his bags, gets on a helicopter and leaves.\u201d\n\nSteven Franklin, a self-described retired history teacher, wrote: \u201cThis is a silly question. Second, no president in the history of the United States ever tried to remain in office at the expiration of his term.\u201d\n\nCraig Priestley reminded of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 \u201cwho insisted on running for a third term \u2026 [and] went on to win a fourth term.\u201d It was shortly after the 22nd Amendment came into being. But, Priestley added: \u201cThe only way Obama could stay on for a third term, therefore, would be by amending the Constitution again.\u201d\n\nAnd yet one more wrote: \u201cIn any country, nobody governs without the consent of the military. \u2026 In a viable democracy, we don\u2019t see military coups, but if an American president tried to circumvent the Constitution to remain in power, he would likely lose the support of the military in very short order, no matter what party he represented.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "President Obama leaves office on Jan. 20, 2017 \u2013 or does he?
