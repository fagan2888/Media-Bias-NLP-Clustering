The Kansas Highway Patrol said the 27-year-old driver swerved to miss a deer and entered a ditch before her car overturned.\n\nChristine Munoz of Salina was taken to a local hospital and then transferred to Salina Regional Medical Center for treatment.\n\nThe second accident happened just before 11 p.m. about two and a half miles east of Perry on U.S. Highway 24 in Jefferson County. According to KHP, the 35-year-old driver was heading east and hit a deer that had entered the roadway.\n\nMichelle Olberding of Nortonville was taken to a hospital in Lawrence for treatment. A 7-year-old girl in the car was not hurt.\n\nReports state the two drivers were wearing seatbelts and the 7-year-old was properly restrained.\n\nIf you plan to be out on the road, be sure to be on the lookout for deer.\n\nAccording to the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism, November 17th is the most dangerous day to be on the road.\n\nData shows that in Kansas, this day has the most deaths cause by deer collisions. Mid-October to December is reproductive season for deer, which is one of the reasons they become more active.\n\n\u201cAlso at this time of year, many of the crops are being harvested so we're able to see more deer,\u201d said K-State Wildlife Specialist Charlie Lee. \u201cThey're looking for different places for cover than they're used to all summer, so it's kind of a two-pronged approach. We have deer that have unusual behavior patterns and less cover than they had through the summer.\"\n\nAnyone involved in a deer-related crash is required to report it to police immediately.\n\nIf your vehicle has significant damage or if you\u2019re injured and don\u2019t report it, it is a misdemeanor and you could lose driving privileges.\n\nRead more:\n\nMan hurt when motorcycle hits deer in Butler County\n\nVIDEO: Deer-related crashes on the rise across the state\n\nAirborne deer hits car, injuring Kansas woman\n\nKansas officials urge motorists to watch for deer\n\nKansas man hit, killed by car after accident involving deer", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Two women were hospitalized following separate deer-related accidents on Saturday, the day before what Kansas officials say is the deadliest day for these kinds of collisions.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"description": "Two women were hospitalized following separate deer-related accidents on Saturday, the day before what Kansas officials say is the deadliest day for these kinds of collisions.", "title": "2 hurt in separate deer-related accidents in Kansas", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/2-hurt-in-separate-deer-related-accidents-in-Kansas-232253371.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/B93/41F/B9341F08C2814E0188DD4E02FA23C652", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/7BA/ED6/7BAED6227F5C46FAAAEF7E1FA3896765.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Two women were hospitalized following separate deer-related accidents on Saturday, the day before what Kansas officials say is the deadliest day for these kinds of collisions.", "title": "2 hurt in separate deer-related accidents in Kansas", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/2-hurt-in-separate-deer-related-accidents-in-Kansas-232253371.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/deer+crossing+road2.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "2 hurt in separate deer-related accidents in Kansas", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2 hurt in separate deerrelated"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9dd8\"", "article_summary": "More Video...Two women were hospitalized following separate deer-related accidents on Saturday, the day before what Kansas officials say is the deadliest day for these kinds of collisions.\nThe first accident happened at 6:30 a.m. about two miles northeast of Lindsborg on Kansas Highway 4 in McPherson County.\nThe Kansas Highway Patrol said the 27-year-old driver swerved to miss a deer and entered a ditch before her car overturned.\nRead more:Man hurt when motorcycle hits deer in Butler CountyVIDEO: Deer-related crashes on the rise across the stateAirborne deer hits car, injuring Kansas womanKansas officials urge motorists to watch for deerKansas man hit, killed by car after accident involving deer\nData shows that in Kansas, this day has the most deaths cause by deer collisions."}
