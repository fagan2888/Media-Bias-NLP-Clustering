So far, only three medications have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat alcoholism: disulfiram (Antabuse), naltrexone (Vivitrol), and acamprosate (Campral).\n\nRelated News: ACA Brings Substance Abuse and Mental Health Treatment to Millions \u00bb\n\nGenes Gang Up to Create Dependence\n\nThe first of two studies conducted by scientists at the University\u2019s Waggoner Center for Alcohol and Addiction Research appears in the current edition of Molecular Psychiatry. It shows that among people with an alcohol use disorder, certain genes cluster together inside the brain, much like drinking buddies of all types gather around the bar. It\u2019s an important discovery, because it goes beyond simply identifying genes known to exist among drinkers to show how they conspire to create disease and dependence.\n\nIn a second study published today in Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, Waggoner scientists analyzed the effects of certain medications already approved by the FDA on mice that consumed alcohol.\n\nBoth studies aim to identify medications already approved by the FDA that could be effective in the treatment of alcoholism, researcher Dayne Mayfield told Healthline.\n\nMayfield and his colleagues examined tissue samples from the brains of 15 alcoholics and 15 non-alcoholics. The brains, provided by New South Wales Tissue Resource Centre at the University of Sydney in Australia, came from donors who underwent a rigorous screening process. They had to be \u201cpure alcoholics,\u201d and not users of other brain-altering substances as well, Mayfield said.\n\nUsing RNA sequencing technology, they examined molecular gene networks inside the tissue. They could see for the first time how genes work together to create alcohol dependence.\n\nA study on an additional 240 brain tissue samples will offer more insight but will take some time to complete, Mayfield said.\n\nCould Cholesterol, Diabetes Drugs Treat Alcoholism?\n\nIn the second study, the researchers showed that two currently approved medications reduced alcohol consumption in lab mice. The medications, fenofibrate (Tricor), which is used to treat cholesterol, and pioglitazone (Actos), which is used to control blood sugar levels, may reduce cravings for alcohol in people trying to quit drinking, the researchers found.\n\nRelated News: Majority of Heavy Drinkers Don\u2019t Discuss it with Their Doctors \u00bb\n\nThe next step is human laboratory studies using a limited number of people with problem drinking, lead investigator R. Adron Harris said in a statement. \u201cWe are learning a lot about the genetics of alcoholism \u2014 there is certainly a strong genetic component \u2014 and we need to use these genetics studies to find new biochemical targets for drug development,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHowever, it is extremely slow and expensive to develop and test a new drug, so progress in my lifetime is most likely if we use an existing, FDA-approved drug for a new purpose.\u201d\n\nOnly about half of all alcoholics develop the disease due to genetic factors, said Dr. Akikur Reza Mohammad of Inspire Malibu Treatment Center in Malibu, California. He said using chemicals to correct the biological causes of alcoholism, combined with group therapy, will lead to better outcomes.\n\n\u201cAfter prolonged use of drugs and alcohol, changes happen to the brain on a molecular level. If you can hit those changes with medication, people have a better chance of staying sober.\u201d Dr. Akikur Reza Mohammad, Inspire Malibu Treatment Center\n\nMohammad told Healthline that Mayfield\u2019s work proves what he and other addiction treatment specialists have long believed. \u201cAfter prolonged use of drugs and alcohol, changes happen to the brain on a molecular level,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you can hit those changes with medication, people have a better chance of staying sober.\u201d\n\nThe changes in the brain lead to what Mohammad calls \u201creward deficiency syndrome.\u201d People with opiate addictions repeatedly trick the brain into rewarding them by producing endorphins. Eventually, the brain won\u2019t make endorphins anymore, he said. Alcohol similarly changes receptors in the brain to make an alcoholic crave liquor.\n\n\u201cIf we can fix the reward deficiency with medication, we can fix the problem,\u201d Mohammad said.\n\nAlcoholism is a heterogeneous disease that affects each sufferer differently, Mayfield told Healthline. He stressed, \u201cThere is no magic bullet. Any treatment program would include medication and, most likely, some of kind of behavioral therapy (such as Alcoholics Anonymous),\u201d he said. \u201cSuccessful intervention will likely include a combined approach.\u201d\n\nRelated News: Science Reveals Why Some Drinkers Become Alcoholics and Some Don\u2019t \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Alcoholism, Gene Network, University of Texas at Austin, Affordable Care Act, ACA, FDA", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Experiments involving booze-consuming mice and human brain tissue show that already approved drugs to treat high cholesterol and diabetes could potentially reduce alcohol cravings.", "title": "Scientists Find First Gene Network Linked to Alcoholism", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/scientists-find-gene-network-linked-to-alcoholism-120914", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mental-health/120914_alcoholism_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mental-health/120914_alcoholism_THUMB.jpg", "description": "Experiments involving booze-consuming mice and human brain tissue show that already approved drugs to treat high cholesterol and diabetes could potentially reduce alcohol cravings.", "card": "summary", "title": "Scientists Find First Gene Network Linked to Alcoholism"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-09", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Experiments involving booze-consuming mice and human brain tissue show that already approved drugs to treat high cholesterol and diabetes could potentially reduce alcohol cravings."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1615\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act contains provisions for expanding alcoholism treatment, and many dependency specialists agree that more medications are needed to supplement psycho-social therapy.\nA study on an additional 240 brain tissue samples will offer more insight but will take some time to complete, Mayfield said.\nSo far, only three medications have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat alcoholism: disulfiram (Antabuse), naltrexone (Vivitrol), and acamprosate (Campral).\nCould Cholesterol, Diabetes Drugs Treat Alcoholism?\nThe University of Texas at Austin has served up two shots of scientific research that could help fill a tall order \u2013 faster approval of more medications to treat alcoholism."}
