Italian-born model Fabio Lanzoni, a newly minted U.S. citizen, hasn’t made up his mind yet on which candidate to support for president, but he knows one thing for sure: America’s immigration laws “are to be respected.”

The “I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter” spokesman, known just as Fabio, said he’s excited to vote in the 2016 election but is waiting to hear the nominations before picking a candidate, the New York Daily News reported.

“It’s going to get really, really brutal,” the 57-year-old said of the potential showdown between front-runners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

“I have to see [Mr. Trump] against Hillary,” he added. “I want to see the two candidates and that’s why you have debates.”

Generally, people all over the world are upset about politics, not just in America, Fabio explained.

“This world is always fed up with politicians. … It doesn’t matter where you go. I’ve been all over the world,” he told the Daily News. “People don’t trust anyone.”

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a statement that Fabio was one of more than 6,000 people from more than 140 countries who took the Oath of Allegiance together Wednesday at the Los Angeles Convention Center, The Associated Press reported.

Fabio said in the statement that it was one of the happiest days of his life and that the United States is the greatest country on Earth.

He told the Daily News that he always advises his friends to come into the country legally.

“Laws are to be respected,” Fabio said. “Nobody is above the law, not even Americans, so if you’re a foreigner, you have to go through the law.”
