A critical part of his troubling legacy has long been staring us in the face, although it finally started receiving the public scrutiny it deserves in recent years. As draconian punishments became the norm over the last three decades, the Supreme Court largely rubber-stamped these practices. Justice Scalia played a key role in this process, as his hardline stances on criminal punishment significantly contributed to mass incarceration, numerous executions, and systemic racial discrimination. Scalia was an outspoken supporter of harsh punishments and wanted the court to take an even more hands-off attitude toward so-called \u201ctough on crime\u201d laws.\n\nNot long after he made it onto the court in 1986, Scalia\u2019s influence on these issues began to be felt. In McCleskey v. Kemp, one of the first cases he heard, anti-death penalty advocates brought compelling evidence of pervasive racial discrimination in Georgia\u2019s administration of capital punishment. A sophisticated statistical study demonstrated that sentencing was tied to the race of the victim and offender. All other factors being equal, blacks who killed whites were the likeliest to receive a death sentence. Justice Scalia was unfazed. During oral arguments, he derisively asked: \u201cWhat if you do a statistical study that shows beyond question that people who are naturally shifty-eyed are to a disproportionate extent convicted in criminal cases, does that make the criminal process unlawful?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJohn Charles Boger, who represented the black death-row prisoner in McCleskey, responded by pointing to the obvious: \u201cThis is not some sort of statistical fluke or aberration. We have a century-old pattern in the state of Georgia of animosity [toward black-Americans].\u201d Scalia and four other justices nonetheless chose to analyze discrimination out of its social context, including in cases from Southern states with a lengthy history of slavery, segregation, and lynchings.\n\nScalia was in the majority as the court held that statistical proof of systemic discrimination in the death penalty is irrelevant. A defendant must instead prove intentional discrimination in his own case, an almost impossible standard without considering systemic patterns. Many experts consider McCleskey among the worst Supreme Court decisions of all-time. It largely closed the door to statistical evidence as a means of challenging systemic discrimination in criminal punishment.\n\nScalia would also play a significant role as the Supreme Court licensed ruthless sentences leading America to world record incarceration levels. He wrote the operative part of the influential Harmelin decision, a 1991 plurality opinion holding that the Eighth Amendment ban on \u201ccruel and unusual punishments\u201d does not require that a prison sentence be \u201cproportional\u201d to the crime. The court thus upheld a life-sentence for cocaine possession.\n\nScalia again was in the majority in Lockyer v. Andrade, a 2003 case upholding a 50-year-to-life sentence under California\u2019s three-strikes-law for a man who shoplifted videotapes worth $153 because he had prior convictions for petty theft, burglary, and transporting marijuana. Erwin Chemerinsky, who zealously represented the prisoner, was in tears as the media asked him about his reaction to the court\u2019s inhumane decision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMcCleskey, Harmelin, and Lockyer were all 5\u20134 decisions that could have been decided otherwise if Scalia had thought differently. Naturally, he was not a swing vote but a sure one for harsh justice.\n\nWhile the justices might not have been able to stop mass incarceration singlehandedly, they definitely could have limited it. Indeed, the court\u2019s belated decision in Brown v. Plata, has contributed to reducing California\u2019s incarceration rate. In this 2011 case, the court ordered California to reduce its dramatically overcrowded prison population because \u201cdepriv[ing] prisoners of basic sustenance, including adequate medical care, is incompatible with the concept of human dignity.\u201d In a vehement dissent, Scalia charged that this was \u201ca judicial travesty\u201d and that the majority was \u201cwildly\u201d overstepping its authority.\n\nSimilarly, he fiercely dissented in other rare cases where the court decided to check ruthless punishments. If it had been up to Scalia, it would still be constitutional to execute mentally retarded people or teenagers, not to mention sentence teenagers to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for homicide or any other crime.\n\nThis aspect of his legacy has been overshadowed by the common misconception that \u201cat least Scalia was quite fair to criminal defendants.\u201d To his credit, he concluded in several procedural cases that juries, not judges, must decide if all facts leading to harsher punishment are proved beyond reasonable doubt. In various other cases, he found that police searches went too far. But these are exceptions. He regularly took an extremely narrow view of due process, such as when he argued that the Constitution does not create \u201ca right to demand judicial consideration of newly discovered evidence of innocence.\u201d Scalia further suggested that executing an innocent person would not be unconstitutional per se. More than 1,300 prisoners were executed while Scalia was on the Supreme Court though he was persuaded that his colleagues created unjust procedural hurdles to executions by baselessly expanding the rights of death row prisoners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHad Scalia had his way, far more people would have been executed during his tenure and the court would have adopted an even more accommodating approach to mass incarceration. In his view, merciless punishments were just deserts for \u201cevildoers.\u201d He scoffed when fellow justices advanced a more nuanced view of criminal behavior or occasionally suggested that draconian punishments were dehumanizing. He was certain that the court already cared too much about people who faced the death penalty or endless prison sentences. Justices who disagreed with him were judicial activists who refused to defer to elected branches of government. Of course, Scalia did not do so himself in multiple cases. Tellingly, he voted to strike down campaign finance legislation in Citizens United. He likewise voted twice, unsuccessfully, in favor of eviscerating the democratically enacted Affordable Care Act.\n\nScalia still cultivated the image of an impartial judge whose decisions were not shaped by his personal values. He was the originalist, the defender of procedural rigor, and the anti-judicial activist. If so, he may have been the sole justice in history whose moral values did not play a major role in his judicial philosophy. Judges are only human.\n\nScalia\u2019s writing sheds additional light on why he embraced merciless punishments. In a 2002 article, he insisted that God wants us to execute murderers. He nevertheless began his essay by claiming that his moral values have no bearing on how he rules in capital cases. A few paragraphs later, however, Scalia wrote \u201cI could not take part in [the death penalty] process if I believed what was being done to be immoral,\u201d thereby contradicting his disclaimer.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Blacks, Latinos, and poor whites suffered because of his draconian approach to criminal punishment.", "fb-share": "Here is the human toll of Scalia\u2019s time on the court.", "sailthru.author": "Mugambi  Jouet", "description": "Blacks, Latinos, and poor whites suffered because of Scalia\u2019s draconian approach to criminal punishment.", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Blacks, Latinos, and poor whites suffered because of Scalia\u2019s draconian approach to criminal punishment.", "title": "How Antonin Scalia Made America\u2019s Culture of Execution and Mass Incarceration So Much Worse", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/antonio_scalia_made_america_s_incarceration_problem_worse.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/160216_JURIS_Scalia-2013.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Blacks, Latinos, and poor whites suffered because of Scalia\u2019s draconian approach to criminal punishment.", "title": "How Antonin Scalia Made America\u2019s Culture of Execution and Mass Incarceration So Much Worse", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/antonio_scalia_made_america_s_incarceration_problem_worse.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/160216_JURIS_Scalia-2013.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-17T18:32:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "How Antonin Scalia Made America\u2019s Culture of Execution and Mass Incarceration So Much Worse", "sailthru.headline": "The Human Toll of Antonin Scalia\u2019s Time on the Court", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"How Antonin Scalia Made America\\u2019s Culture of Execution and Mass Incarceration So Much Worse\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/antonio_scalia_made_america_s_incarceration_problem_worse.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/160216_JURIS_Scalia-2013.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100160217024\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2016-02-17T18:32:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Mugambi Jouet\",\n  \"tags\": [\"antonin scalia\"]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "The human toll of Antonin Scalia\u2019s time on the court:", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "keywords": "Antonin Scalia, Scalia legacy, Scalia, Scalia death penalty, Scalia mass incarceration, death penalty, mass incarceration, prison culture, black lives matter", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.tags": "Antonin Scalia, Scalia legacy, Scalia, Scalia death penalty, Scalia mass incarceration, death penalty, mass incarceration, prison culture, black lives matter", "sailthru.description": "Blacks, Latinos, and poor whites suffered because of Scalia\u2019s draconian approach to criminal punishment.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2016/02/160216_JURIS_Scalia-2013.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Scalia would also play a significant role as the Supreme Court licensed ruthless sentences leading America to world record incarceration levels.\nAs draconian punishments became the norm over the last three decades, the Supreme Court largely rubber-stamped these practices.\nMany experts consider McCleskey among the worst Supreme Court decisions of all-time.\nScalia was in the majority as the court held that statistical proof of systemic discrimination in the death penalty is irrelevant.\nJustice Scalia played a key role in this process, as his hardline stances on criminal punishment significantly contributed to mass incarceration, numerous executions, and systemic racial discrimination."}
