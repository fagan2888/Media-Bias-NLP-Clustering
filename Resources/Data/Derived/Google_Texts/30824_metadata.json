After Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s errand boy Jesse Watters caught up with Greenslate again Monday night, \u201cThe Five\u201d used the lazy surfer as \u201cthe representative of literally millions of Americans,\u201d in Bolling\u2019s words. It was epic.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing the system, he\u2019s stretching the rules to their limits,\u201d Bolling told Fox\u2019s angry, fearful, mostly elderly viewers. \u201cBut what would you expect with a $105 billion program that\u2019s almost tripled under Obamanomics? That\u2019s what you would expect, right there, take a look at it. But what\u2019s next? Strip clubs, liquor stores, pot dispensaries? Oh, that\u2019s already going on, folks. Welcome to Obama\u2019s America.\u201d\n\nBolling\u2019s rant came a day after Dick Cheney visited Fox and attacked Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel\u2019s military cuts, telling Sean Hannity, bizarrely, that Obama \u201cwould much rather spend the money on food stamps than he would on a strong military or support for our troops.\u201d\n\nThe right just can\u2019t leave that old dog-whistle alone. It\u2019s 2012 all over again \u2013 Newt Gingrich will be reviving his claim that Obama\u2019s \u201cthe food stamp president\u201d any minute now. In \u201cObama\u2019s America,\u201d the right is determined to make the president the tribune of a moocher-rewarding, ever-expanding welfare state, even if they have to lie to do so.\n\nOf course in Obama\u2019s America (and everyone else\u2019s) SNAP regulations prohibit buying alcohol or tobacco with food stamps, let alone drugs, and they can\u2019t be used at restaurants or bars, let alone strip clubs. But Bolling wants Fox viewers in a perpetual state of moral panic, and the notion that slackers like Greenslate are \u201clivin\u2019 large\u201d \u2013 Fox\u2019s term \u2014 on the public dime just works, the facts be damned.\n\nCheney\u2019s rant was in some ways more offensive. Charging that the cuts proposed by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel are \u201creally devastating,\u201d Cheney went on: \u201cIt does enormous long-term damage to our military. They act as though it is like highway spending and you can turn it on and off. The fact of the matter is he is having a huge impact on the ability of future presidents to deal with future crises that are bound to arise.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cheney says Obama prizes SNAP over the military, while Fox claims slackers use food stamps on strippers.
