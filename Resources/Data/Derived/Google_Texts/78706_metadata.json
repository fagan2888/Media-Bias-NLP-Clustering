Soref began his career directing music videos for \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic.\n\nThe movie aired in only a handful of theaters and authorities claim the studio money was only used to repay some movie investors.\n\nIn some cases, Seward allegedly talked clients into surrendering annuities early and paying large penalties by promising returns of between 10 and 18 percent. Investors that surrendered annuities paid more than $600,000 in penalties and fees for early withdrawal.\n\nAfter the film\u2019s completion, the two formed a new entity titled Windsor Pictures LLC, which investors were promised would produce several films. Investors were given promissory notes and told they would again earn between 10 and 18 percent on their investment.\n\nInvestigators found evidence that investors\u2019 money used to form Windsor Pictures was used to pay investors in the production of Not Forgotten. Additionally, Seward and Soref were not licensed to sell securities or provide investment advice.\n\nThe case is being prosecuted by the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s office.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A former insurance agent and an alleged accomplice have been charged with operating a Ponzi scam to defraud annuity owners out of $21 million.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "A former insurance agent and an alleged accomplice have been charged with operating a Ponzi scam to defraud annuity owners out of $21 million.", "title": "Former insurance agent charged in $21 million annuity, movie-making scheme", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2015/09/18/former-insurance-agent-charged-in-21-million-annuity-movie-making-scheme/", "image": {"width": 340, "identifier": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Michelle-Kenen-Seward-e1442590613706.jpeg", "height": 340}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Michelle-Kenen-Seward-e1442590613706.jpeg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-18T15:44:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-18T15:44:24+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "article_summary": "A former insurance agent and an alleged accomplice have been charged with operating a Ponzi scam to defraud annuity owners out of $21 million.\nThe movie aired in only a handful of theaters and authorities claim the studio money was only used to repay some movie investors.\nInvestigators found evidence that investors\u2019 money used to form Windsor Pictures was used to pay investors in the production of Not Forgotten.\nThe Los Angeles-area duo are accused of convincing clients to cash in their annuities and invest in a bogus, elaborate movie investment scheme.\nMichelle Kenen Seward, 42, of Flintridge, Calif., and Dror Soref, 75, of Los Angeles, were arrested last week."}
