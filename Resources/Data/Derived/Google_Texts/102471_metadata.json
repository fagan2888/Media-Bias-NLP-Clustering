Did I lose anyone with that last bit? I am, of course, talking about Alan Grayson, the saucy liberal firebrand\u2014or unhinged, ethically questionable demagogue, depending on your perspective\u2014currently representing Florida\u2019s 9th congressional district and running to replace Marco Rubio as the state\u2019s junior senator. The latest Public Policy Polling survey out of Florida, released last week, has Grayson up 11 points over the Democratic establishment\u2019s preferred candidate, Representative Patrick Murphy. This is unwelcome news for a party that\u2019s casting a hopeful eye on the Sunshine State as it works to claw back its Senate majority from Republicans. Because, in a cycle where many\u2014many\u2014Republicans are in a white-hot panic over the prospect of Donald Trump becoming the ochre-tinted face of their party, Grayson stands as a not-so-gentle reminder that Democrats have their loudmouthed embarrassments as well.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Grayson\u2019s political charms, they can be helpfully broken down into two different categories\u2014brash and business. Latest from Politics Can Trump Whitewater-Raft His Way to the White House? Most immediately apparent is the congressman\u2019s in-your-face, say-anything manner, which comes as close to trumping Trump as that of any politician working on either side of the aisle. Grayson\u2019s greatest hits include dubbing his 2010 Republican opponent \u201cTaliban Dan Webster,\u201d comparing the Tea Party to the Ku Klux Klan, calling a female Federal Reserve adviser a \u201cK Street whore,\u201d saying he has trouble listening to Dick Cheney \u201cbecause of the blood that sometimes drips from his teeth while he\u2019s talking,\u201d and asserting that the GOP alternative to Obamacare amounts to \u201cDon\u2019t get sick\u201d and, if you do, \u201cDie quickly.\u201d He has referred to his own party\u2019s leadership as \u201cthe party politburo\u201d and \u201ccorrupt, mendacious sellouts.\u201d He has called his chief Democratic primary opponent, Murphy, \u201ca lickspittle pillock\u201d (which, OK, is pretty impressive as insults go) and derided him as a \u201cRichie Rich\u201d \u201cspoiled trust-fund\u201d \u201cfaker\u201d who \u201chas never worked a day in his life in any real job\u201d but whose wealthy daddy was \u201cso proud that he was able to buy Little Richie a congressional seat.\u201d As with Trump, Grayson\u2019s mouthiness is a big part of what supporters love about him. \u201cHe says whatever he wants to say, and he is speaking to a part of our party that wants somebody to be as angry as they are when they\u2019re posting on Facebook or Twitter,\u201d says Kevin Cate, a Florida Democratic strategist. And, to be fair, most of the time, he\u2019s taking aim at the political enemy. \u201cWhen it comes to Republicans, he\u2019s extremely inflammatory, and obviously he\u2019s got constituents that like that,\u201d observes longtime party strategist Jim Manley, a former Senate leadership staffer. Not that Grayson limits himself to political targets. In explaining why it was taking so long for him to dissolve his marriage last year\u2014a messy process that ended with an annulment when his wife of 25 years was ruled a bigamist\u2014Grayson quipped, \u201cI\u2019ll sum it up for you: Gold diggers gotta dig.\u201d\n\nLess colorful but potentially more damaging may be the representative\u2019s, let us say, business issues. Last month, The New York Times took a long look at how the multimillionaire Grayson may have used his public office to benefit a hedge fund that he founded in 2011 (in between his two stints in the House) and continued to manage even after his reelection to Congress in 2012. (Until recently, the fund bore Grayson\u2019s name and operated out of the Cayman Islands, a favorite tax haven.) If so, this would be a no-no under House ethics rules. The matter has been under investigation by the ethics committee for several months now, but the Times detailed some of Grayson\u2019s more problematic practices, such as using his public title in marketing materials for his hedge fund and employing aides to do fund work and political work simultaneously. (Grayson has denied all wrongdoing. Aggressively.) The day after the Times piece ran, Harry Reid responded by all but ordering Grayson to drop out of the race. In a statement asserting that Grayson had disqualified himself from serving in the Senate, Reid fumed: \u201cAlan Grayson used his status as a congressman to unethically promote his Cayman Islands hedge funds, and he should drop out of the Senate race immediately. His actions aren\u2019t just disgraceful to the Democratic Party, they disgrace the halls of Congress.\u201d This was quite a smackdown, observes Manley: \u201cUsually leaders don\u2019t get involved in primaries.\u201d \u201cThey are desperate to have their Wall Street errand-boy flunkie get the nomination so he can carry on the great tradition of selling out voters.\u201d Just last week (one day after the PPP poll broke), both President Obama and Vice President Biden endorsed Grayson\u2019s opponent, Murphy. Biden is on tap to campaign with Murphy later this month, and Murphy is expected to get even more party support between now and late August, when Florida primary voters cast their ballots. Grayson remains unbowed by the forces amassing against him. \u201cThese are desperate measures by unscrupulous people,\u201d he assures me, asserting that the allegations against him \u201care nonsensical.\u201d This is, he says, all about party leadership carrying Patrick Murphy\u2019s water: \u201cThey are desperate to have their Wall Street errand-boy flunkie get the nomination so he can carry on the great tradition of selling out the voters.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He\u2019s an obnoxious millionaire New Yorker, a populist with a sketchy business, and party leaders hate him.
