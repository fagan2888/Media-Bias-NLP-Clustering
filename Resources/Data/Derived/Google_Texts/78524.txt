I went out for my morning walk today—two-thirds of a mile, woo hoo!—and needed to take a ten-minute break when I got home. So I'm listening to Andrea Mitchell tell me the stunning news that in the latest NBC/WSJ poll, a full 33% of Americans say that money in politics is their top concern about the upcoming presidential election. Specifically, 33% chose as their top concern, "Wealthy individuals and corporations will have too much influence over who wins."

Is that higher than usual? I suppose, though it hardly seems like the makings of a revolution. That's especially true when you see the partisan breakdown:

Democrats were most likely to cite the influence of corporations and wealthy individuals as the top concern, with roughly half of self-described liberals and Democratic primary voters ranking it as their primary anxiety as the 2016 White House race gears up. Only 21% of core Republican voters said it was their top concern.

So....Democrats are upset about money in politics as usual. Republicans don't really care much, as usual. I hope nobody minds too much if I find this a bit of a yawn.
