Rick Scott (R) last month to get the Obama administration to back off its plans to expand Medicaid in his state\u2014the Obama administration announced it would not entirely withhold funds for a federal program called the Low Income Pool (LIP).\n\nThe administration said it would fund the program with $1 billion, which is less than half of the current $2.16 billion funding the feds offer, according to The Hill.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nScott felt that by slashing funds for LIP, which compensates hospitals for treating people lacking insurance, Obama was forcing Florida to expand Medicaid. He said last month, \u201cIt is appalling that President Obama would cut off federal healthcare dollars to Florida in an effort to force our state further into ObamaCare.\u201d Florida spent over $18 billion on Medicaid in the 2013 fiscal year.\n\nMembers of the GOP have accused Obama of \u201coverreach,\u201d calling for a hearing on the matter, but the Obama administration insists that LIP funds should be estimated so they are not covering costs that would be dealt with under Medicaid expansion. The White House said it will still pursue a formal review process.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) wrote the state of Florida on Thursday asserting that the $1 billion it will receive will encourage \u201cstability\u201d while the state moves toward another system. The $1 billion figure will plunge to $600 million in 2016-17. The letter also acknowledged, \u201cWe believe that Medicaid expansion as evidenced by experience in other states would bring significant benefits to low income Floridians and the Florida health care system.\u201d\n\nAttacking Scott, White House press secretary Josh Earnest pontificated, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain why somebody would think that their political situation and their political interest is somehow more important than the livelihood and health of 800,000 people that they were elected to lead.\u201d\n\nCMS has warned other states that when their uncompensated care pools are due for renewal, they may not be funded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Thursday, the Obama administration announced it would not entirely withhold funds for a federal program called the Low Income Pool (LIP).", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "On Thursday, the Obama administration announced it would not entirely withhold funds for a federal program called the Low Income Pool (LIP).", "title": "Obama Administration Cuts Program Funding to Expand Florida Medicaid - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/rick-scott-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/21/obama-administration-cuts-program-funding-to-expand-florida-medicaid/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Thursday, the Obama administration announced it would not entirely withhold funds for a federal program called the Low Income Pool (LIP).", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/rick-scott-AP.jpg", "title": "Obama Administration Cuts Program Funding to Expand Florida Medicaid - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Florida, Low Income Pool, medicaid, Obama, Rick Scott,Big Government, Medicine, Obamacare,medicaid", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Rick Scott", "published_time": "2015-05-21T19:48:53-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe123a\"", "article_summary": "Rick Scott (R) last month to get the Obama administration to back off its plans to expand Medicaid in his state\u2014the Obama administration announced it would not entirely withhold funds for a federal program called the Low Income Pool (LIP).\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERScott felt that by slashing funds for LIP, which compensates hospitals for treating people lacking insurance, Obama was forcing Florida to expand Medicaid.\nThe administration said it would fund the program with $1 billion, which is less than half of the current $2.16 billion funding the feds offer, according to The Hill.\nMembers of the GOP have accused Obama of \u201coverreach,\u201d calling for a hearing on the matter, but the Obama administration insists that LIP funds should be estimated so they are not covering costs that would be dealt with under Medicaid expansion.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Thursday\u2014possibly triggered by the lawsuit brought by Florida Gov."}
