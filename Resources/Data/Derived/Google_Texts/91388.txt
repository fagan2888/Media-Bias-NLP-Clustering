Cory Barron's death at Progressive Field leaves many unanswered questions

Officials have not yet ruled on a cause of death for the man who fell five stories to his death through a trash chute Friday night at a concert at Progressive Field.

A landfill worker discovered the body of 22-year-old Cory Barron about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday at the Lorain County Landfill. Early statements from police say that Barron fell five stories through a trash chute after he wandered away from his family during the Jason Aldean concert.

Lorain County Medical Examiner Stephen Evans performed an autopsy Wednesday, but an initial cause of death wasn't known as of 2 p.m. Evans said toxicology tests could take weeks.

Officials remain tight-lipped about the events surrounding Barron's disappearance Friday from a Jason Aldean concert. He attended Bowling Green State University and lived in Fremont, 40 miles east of Toledo. | Read Patrick Cooley's story
