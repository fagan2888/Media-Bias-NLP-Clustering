His heirs say it was illegally seized in the 1870s.\n\nThe state still owns about 40,000 acres of the land northwest of Laredo.\n\nThe family filed a lawsuit in July in Travis County District Court, the Austin American-Statesman reported (http://atxne.ws/1PXobHt ). The main defendant is the General Land Office, whose commissioner is George P. Bush.\n\n\u201cThe land was pretty inhospitable,\u201d Tony Zavaleta, a sociology professor at the University of Texas at Brownsville who helped a coal company survey the land in the 1980s told the newspaper. \u201cWho knew that it was sitting on a sea of minerals?\u201d\n\nLand grants are a source of pride and pain among generations of Hispanics in Texas. Previous claims have not fared well in the courts.\n\nThe Texas Supreme Court ruled in 2008 against a family, deciding that the suit had run afoul of the statute of limitations. The court issued a similar ruling in 2003.\n\n\u201cYour land may have been stolen, but it was a long time ago, and proving it with the right documents is really difficult,\u201d said Lance Bruun, a South Texas oil and gas attorney who last year chaired a committee created by the Legislature to sort out Spanish land-grant inheritance claims.\n\nGalan received the land grant sometime before 1804. By 1816, a settlement called Palafox had 277 residents, but Comanche raiders burned the village and killed most of its residents in 1829.\n\nThe land was intermittently populated after that.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Austin American-Statesman, http://www.statesman.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 600 descendants of a Mexican settler have sued Texas over the alleged 1870s seizure of a royal land grant, claiming that they are entitled to the mineral revenue the state has collected for years.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/7/family-sues-texas-over-centuries-old-spanish-land-/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "More than 600 descendants of a Mexican settler have sued Texas over the alleged 1870s seizure of a royal land grant, claiming that they are entitled to the mineral revenue the state has collected for years.", "title": "Family sues Texas over centuries-old Spanish land grant"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than 600 descendants of a Mexican settler have sued Texas over the alleged 1870s seizure of a royal land grant, claiming that they are entitled to the mineral revenue the state has collected for", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Family sues Texas over centuries-old Spanish land grant"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb72e\"", "article_summary": "Joaquin Galan received a land grant from the Spanish king more than two centuries ago.\nGalan received the land grant sometime before 1804.\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - More than 600 descendants of a Mexican settler have sued Texas over the alleged 1870s seizure of a royal land grant, claiming that they are entitled to the mineral revenue the state has collected for years.\nThe Texas Supreme Court ruled in 2008 against a family, deciding that the suit had run afoul of the statute of limitations.\nThe family filed a lawsuit in July in Travis County District Court, the Austin American-Statesman reported (http://atxne.ws/1PXobHt )."}
