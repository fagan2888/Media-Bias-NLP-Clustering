And don't worry, that wasn't the only cringeworthy image he brought to mind: \"These days, when Grandma yells, 'Bingo!,' it's because an old vet just found her G-spot!\". Oof.\n\nWatch the full clip above. \"Real Time With Bill Maher\" airs Fridays at 10:00 p.m. EST on HBO.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Grandparents On Facebook Grandparents On Facebook\n\n1 of 17 ALL CAPS Because she's excited...and she can't see.
