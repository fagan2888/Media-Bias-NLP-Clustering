(Photo: Thinkstock)\n\nThe Obama administration plans to close a loophole in the Affordable Care Act that allows large companies to refuse to cover in-patient hospital stays in any of their health insurance plans, according to an official involved in the internal discussions.\n\nThe official requested anonymity until the announcement is made because \"the guidance that will be issued is not finalized.\"\n\nHealth plans for individuals and those working for smaller employers must include coverage within at least 10 categories of \"essential health benefits\" that include maternity care, prescription drugs and hospitalization.The health care law is much more stringent about what health insurance must cover for these people than it is for those working at large employers.\n\nWashington and Lee University law professor Timothy Jost says the employer health insurance mandate is \"not well-designed.\" It is a loophole, he says, that large companies \"are not required to cover all of the essential health benefits.\" To pass the government \"minimum value\" test, these companies are required to cover only 60% of the value of some of the essential benefits, so they \"don't have to necessarily offer every one,\" says Jost, a supporter of the law and an author of several health law books.\n\nPlans that cap the number of hospital visits \u2014 or offer no hospital coverage at all \u2014 could probably pass the ACA's minimum value test if other coverage is generous enough, says Cori Uccello, senior health fellow with the American Academy of Actuaries.\n\nCori Uccello is senior health fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries (Photo: American Academy of Actuaries)\n\nEven if they didn't, employers would be allowed to offer these no-hospital-coverage plans, as long as one of their plans meets this \"minimum value\" test, says health care lawyer Alden Bianchi. Companies with more than 100 employees have to pay about a $3,000-per-employee penalty if they don't offer an affordable health plan next year, and workers who aren't insured have to pay a penalty as well. Both the company and the employee can avoid the penalties with a plan that doesn't cover hospitalization or anything other than preventive services such as physicals as long as one is offered.\n\nMany low-wage workers are likely to be attracted by the low premiums these plans have. Bianchi says he has many temp and contract worker agency clients who are investigating and adopting plans that don't offer hospital benefits.\n\nSome experts warn that workers may not realize how \"skinny\" these plans are \u2014 until it's too late.\n\nPlans that don't cover hospitalization are \"preying on vulnerable people who don't have resources,\" says Brian Klepper, CEO of the National Business Coalition on Health. \"The purpose of insurance is to cover the services that most of us cannot afford when we desperately need it.\"\n\nSmall businesses can skirt some of the law's mandates by joining together in associations to buy insurance. This allows them to be treated like large employers, which have far fewer health insurance requirements.\n\nEmployees at these companies might wind up with plans that don't cover the essential health benefits required under the ACA. These plans could discriminate against them based on their age, gender or health status, according to a new report by the Georgetown University Health Policy Institute.\n\nAs open enrollment nears for both government exchanges and many employer-provided plans, Uccello says potential loopholes underscore the need for workers to \"consider not just the premiums but total out-of-pocket costs, which reflect the generosity of the plan.\"\n\nThe ACA prohibits limits on total health care coverage, but plans can have \"visit limits,\" says Kevin Lucia, senior research fellow with the Georgetown Health Policy institute.\n\nTim Jost is a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law. (Photo: Washington and Lee)\n\n\"Whenever there's a regulatory structure, there's going to be some gaming taking place to maximize profit,\" says Lucia, co-author of the Georgetown report, which was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. \"That's where regulators need to step in \u2014 to make sure it isn't being done to the detriment of what the ACA is trying to do.\"\n\nPlans with limited benefits, such as those through associations, or that lack hospital benefits are most attractive to companies that employ low-wage workers who can't afford the higher premiums that come with plans with higher levels of benefits.\n\nHealth care lawyer Nancy Taylor, who represents many restaurant companies, says she doesn't know of any offering plans without hospitalization. Neil Trautwein, vice president of health care policy at the National Retail Federation, says no retailers have acknowledged offering such plans.\n\n\"People have come in and kicked the tires, but there are not that many early adopters,\" Trautwein says. \"The sense is that it's a loophole that will get closed quickly.\"\n\nAlthough his benefits company doesn't offer \"skinny\" plans that don't offer hospitalization, Allen Wishner, CEO of Flexible Benefit Service in Rosemont, Ill., says they could make sense for some people.\n\n\"Is this serving the greater good? Is this a loophole? I don't know,\" he says. \"Sometimes the regulators just get it wrong.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1tUXA5N", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Some plans have no in-patient hospital benefits; others can lack health benefits supposed to be covered under the Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Some plans have no in-patient hospital benefits; others can lack health benefits supposed to be covered under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Feds to require big companies to cover hospitalization", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/11/03/obamacare-aca-loopholes-hospital-coverage/18073573/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some plans have no in-patient hospital benefits; others can lack health benefits supposed to be covered under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Feds to require big companies to cover hospitalization", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f62f7548887b2da5384b3132068f6594c835ebc/c=480-0-1798-1318&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/31/635503591593626341-178382075.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "Jayne O'Donnell"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/National Retail Federation", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/National Retail Federation", "title": "Feds to require big companies to cover hospitalization", "author": "Jayne O'Donnell", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/nation", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0905321b941f37a42b67c87952e987e945412bde/c=753-0-1739-1314/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/31/635503591593626341-178382075.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6295e855e71ff1c19378f2c90c0e5c91d4c4ebc7/c=480-0-1798-1318/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/31/635503591593626341-178382075.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70a15560e82ff9c6fd46f168533fd7165c061391/c=22-0-1770-1314/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/31/635503591593626341-178382075.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/41ad29c81ef8b9546be390ea8e9f2f7f60dcfd66/c=0-15-2279-1303&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/USATODAY/None/2014/10/31/635503591593626341-178382075.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-11-03T21:07:17.107000-05:00", "shorthed": "No hospital coverage?
