Ryan Reynolds started off his marriage to Blake Lively with a supremely romantic 2012 honeymoon following their candlelit wedding.

Then came shooting a movie in snowy, freezing Canada where he plays a father suspected of kidnapping his daughter in Captives.

Not so romantic.

"I dragged my wife from our honeymoon in Africa and landed her in Ontario, Canada, when it was -40 degrees," Reynolds said at a Captives press conference at the Cannes Film Festival on Friday.

Reynolds says the newlyweds camped "into this little roadside hotel where we stayed for a month. That was the biggest challenge."

Lively is from sunny California. Reynolds is Canadian, so he should be used to more challenging weather.

"Ironically, she coped with it far better than I did," Reynolds admitted.

The two are clearly allowing work to help make up for lost time. Lively has been a brilliant presence on the Cannes Film Festival red carpets as Reynolds shows off his film at Cannes. The film is part of the official festival competition.

Captives also gave him an opportunity to work with respected Canadian director Atom Egoyan.

"I felt privileged to get the chance just to be there," says Reynolds of shooting the movie.
