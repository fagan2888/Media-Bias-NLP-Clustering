Ryan M. Pitts, his arms and legs wounded by shrapnel, single-handedly defended an observation post near the village of Wanat in Afghanistan, preventing it from being overrun in a battle that claimed nine of his fellow soldiers.\n\nInjured, alone and rapidly losing blood, Pitts succeeded in using his machine gun and grenades to hold off attackers while sending coordinates to a command post, which allowed airstrikes to hit insurgent forces.\n\n------------\n\nFOR THE RECORD\n\nAn earlier version of this post said eight of Pitts' fellow soldiers were killed.\n\n------------\n\nOn Monday, those acts were rewarded with the Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest award for valor in combat. Pitts is the ninth living recipient to receive the award for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cRyan worked the radio, helping target the airstrikes,\u201d President Obama said in awarding the medal. \u201cAnd with those strikes, the tide of the battle began to turn....
