I don\u2019t recognize anything,\u201d my mom says, gazing wide-eyed out of the decades-old tram and into the chaotic streets of Hong Kong. \u201cI never used to take the ding ding. It\u2019s so slow,\u201d she complains as the tram operator rings the bell twice to alert pedestrians nearby \u2014 emitting a characteristic sound that gives the tram its Cantonese nickname. \u201cBut actually it\u2019s kind of nice. You can take your time to see the scenery around you.\u201d\n\nMore from Narratively: \u201cKids, We\u2019re Moving to Greenland\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been 33 years since she moved from Hong Kong to Toronto and four months since I did the opposite. This is how I became my mother\u2019s tour guide in her own hometown.\n\nMore from Narratively: \u201cHow an International Man of Mystery Scammed My Grandma\u201d\n\nThe crowded streets that are familiar to me are now unrecognizable to her. I guide her through the modern subway system, which was constructed after her departure, and advise her on the best bus routes to take when she meets up with her old school friends. We walk together through Central, the city\u2019s financial district, among 70-story skyscrapers and modern steel structures that my mother has never seen before. I introduce her to some of the great local restaurants I\u2019ve discovered; she uses her Cantonese fluency to order dishes that aren\u2019t on the English menu.\n\nMore from Narratively: \u201cCan German Atonement Teach America to Finally Face Slavery\u201d\n\nTogether, we are the ultimate Hongkonger.\n\nMy mom comments on how much my Cantonese has improved while we devour her expertly-ordered meal. This food that I\u2019m enjoying and the language I\u2019m eagerly practicing is in stark contrast to the attitudes of my youth.\n\nI credit my childhood apathy towards my mother\u2019s culture to the whitewashed Toronto suburb I grew up in, where I was one of three Chinese kids in an elementary school of 300. I wanted nothing more than to be just like my white Canadian peers with their Wonder Bread sandwiches and after-school ballet classes. Instead I was forced into weekly piano lessons, which I loathed, and fed traditional Chinese meals of steamed meat and stir-fried vegetables over heaping bowls of rice that I thought were bland.\n\nMy mother put me in Chinese school on the weekends to learn her native tongue, but replacing my Saturday morning cartoons with rote repetition of stroke order and Chinese characters instilled in me a repulsion of the language. Whenever she spoke to me in Cantonese, I\u2019d understand perfectly but reply back in English.\n\nThere\u2019s a Cantonese slang phrase to describe people like me: jook sing. The term originates from the knot in a reed of bamboo that prevents water from flowing from one end to the other. \u201cYou look at bamboo. It looks like it should be all hollow, but actually there are parts where it\u2019s closed inside,\u201d my mom explains. \u201cThat\u2019s like you. You look like you\u2019re Chinese but you\u2019re not really Chinese because you do not understand the language and the culture.\u201d It\u2019s meant to be derogatory, and it works. My mother and relatives would tease me, my sister and my cousins for being jook sing when we spoke our accented Cantonese or used our chopsticks incorrectly.\n\nWitnessing her children stuck between two cultures must have been frustrating for my mother too. While she moved to Canada to live and raise kids in a western environment, with western values and beliefs, she didn\u2019t know what the norms were. She had only her own childhood experience to draw from. Growing up in poverty, she adopted an eat-or-be-eaten attitude as the second eldest of six siblings. She witnessed how her father\u2019s strong work ethic brought him from low-level garment seamster to factory foreman and, later, top-level manager. My mother was taught by strict Catholic nuns at an all-girls high school, which undoubtedly influenced her own parenting style. The chaotic city life and incredible academic, societal and economic pressures of Hong Kong are what eventually pushed my mom out of the city.\n\nBetween the time my mom left in 1976 and the handover of Hong Kong from the British to the Chinese, a slew of Hongkongers fled to the west. I went to high school in a city that was popular with recent Hong Kong immigrants and their children, who became my classmates. I befriended many but I could never really relate, instead seeking distance from them and my mother\u2019s heritage. When I registered for university and renewed my passport I omitted my Chinese middle name on the application forms, thinking it might make me seem less Chinese and more Canadian.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was removed from this environment that I recognized the gap in my identity. In my third year of university, I spent a year abroad, studying in Copenhagen and traveling through Europe. I visited parts of the world where the concepts of immigration and visible minorities were virtually unheard of. I once met a group of young Croatian girls at a bar in Dubrovnik\u2019s Old City, celebrating a friend\u2019s eighteenth birthday. They fawned over my foreign appearance, a rarity in Eastern Europe. \u201cChina! You\u2019re from China?\u201d one of the girls asked in a tone that wasn\u2019t racist but inquisitively earnest.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, feeling, for the first time ever, ashamed in my eventual reply. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve never been.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nGrowing up with my mother and among other Chinese immigrants I never once imagined that I might live in Hong Kong one day. But then I graduated from university on the brink of a recession with no job prospects at home. Hong Kong was a natural destination. I easily found work with an English teaching agency and was trained with 60 other expatriates, mostly white and from the UK.\n\nSkills that I snubbed in my adolescence now gave me an edge above the typical new arrival to the city. Over heavily-accented Cantonese I negotiated with my landlord for cheaper rent. I enjoyed blending in with the crowd, slipping into clothing stores and shopping for groceries unnoticed, until my accented Cantonese outed me as a foreigner. While my new colleagues fumbled with their chopsticks at group lunches, skeptically eyeing the steaming bamboo baskets of curried cuttlefish, shrimp dumplings and pillow-y white buns with mystery fillings, I found comfort in these dishes that were more familiar to me than the strangers I was seated with.\n\nThese strangers did eventually become my friends. But over time, as my social networks expanded past the English teachers I first arrived with, I met more and more expatriates like myself \u2014 the children of Hong Kong immigrants who were born, raised and educated in the west but settled in Hong Kong for work. While these were the very people I was eager to distance myself from in my youth, in our parents\u2019 homeland I discovered a camaraderie that was missing before. While no one tracks the number of western-born people of Chinese descent living in Hong Kong, data from a 2013 census analyzed by Pacific Prime Hong Kong shows that there are an estimated 301,000 expatriates living in Hong Kong, comprising 4.24 percent of the city\u2019s population. This is a big jump from just 252,000 expatriates living there in 2009.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s western-born Chinese definitely aren\u2019t considered locals, but we aren\u2019t quite expats either. We navigate the city as in-betweeners, with our varying knowledge of the local customs and norms, the language and food. Yet we retain our western values, among them a sense of individuality and freedom that would be considered a rebellious trait of a traditional family-centric Hongkonger.\n\nWorking as an English teacher, I found that my in-between status hindered rather than helped. The schools where I taught English requested an immersive experience for their students, which meant native English speakers. The supervisor of my second teaching job, Pamela Bovitz, instructed me to pretend that I didn\u2019t understand a word of Cantonese.\n\n\u201cShe knows what we\u2019re saying!\u201d the kids would say in their native tongue, aware that I was one of them. I feigned confusion and fought the urge to reply back in Cantonese. At the kindergarten where I worked, I was hired to teach these young students English. But through the playground games and classroom conversations I overheard, the students inadvertently helped me improve my second language too. Every morning I listened to them sing their school\u2019s anthem in Cantonese and one day I sang it for my mother. In between fits of laughter, she helped me translate the song and understand the lyrics.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I was ashamed of living between two cultures in Toronto.
