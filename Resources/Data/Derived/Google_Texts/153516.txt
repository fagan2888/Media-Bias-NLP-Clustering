No state has been hurt more than Alaska. Five insurance companies originally offered individual coverage in the exchange. Today, only two are left. Both are increasing premiums by about 40 percent in 2015. In Anchorage, the lowest level bronze plan will rise 46 percent in just one year, making it among the most expensive in the country. Under the plan, a nonsmoking 40-year-old not receiving subsidies will pay $579 a month with a $6,850 deductible, or $678 a month with a $5,250 deductible.
