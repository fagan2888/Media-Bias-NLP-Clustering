It looked at 45 applications from October 2013 through March 2014.\n\n\u201cWithout resolving inconsistencies \u2026 the Minnesota Marketplace could not ensure that the applicant meets each of the eligibility requirements for enrollment in a [health plan] and, when applicable, for insurance affordability programs,\u201d auditors wrote in a report being released Tuesday.\n\nMNsure said it has since fixed the defects that resulted in two people qualifying for tax credits when they indicated access to coverage elsewhere.\n\nOn data inconsistencies, MNsure said that during the time period covered by the report, the exchange had suspended sending notices about such issues because of technical problems. The exchange has since made \u201csubstantial progress,\u201d MNsure said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAll of the findings in this audit have either been addressed, or are on track to be resolved in the coming months,\u201d said MNsure CEO Allison O\u2019Toole in an interview.\n\nThe audit looked at the portion of MNsure that individuals use to buy health insurance policies from private insurers. A different audit last month from state Legislative Auditor James Nobles looked at people who enrolled in public insurance programs through MNsure and found that thousands of people in early 2015 might have received coverage when they didn\u2019t qualify.\n\nMinnesota created the MNsure health insurance exchange in 2013 to implement the federal Affordable Care Act, which required new exchange marketplaces for all 50 states. Most states are covered by the federal government\u2019s HealthCare.gov exchange, but Minnesota was one of more than a dozen to create its own online system.\n\nMNsure is one of seven state-based insurance exchanges being reviewed by the Office of Inspector General. An audit of Kentucky\u2019s exchange released in October found that its internal controls were generally effective. Subsequent reports found problems with the exchanges in Colorado and Washington.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A new federal audit looks back at the troubled rollout of MNsure and finds that the state&rsquo;s health insurance exchange didn&rsquo;t always properly assess whether enrollees were eligible for financial help.", "title": "MNsure rollout woes detailed in federal audit", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/mnsure-rollout-woes-detailed-in-federal-audit/368896771/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "A new federal audit looks back at the troubled rollout of MNsure and finds that the state&rsquo;s health insurance exchange didn&rsquo;t always properly assess whether enrollees were eligible for financial help.", "title": "MNsure rollout woes detailed in federal audit", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/mnsure-rollout-woes-detailed-in-federal-audit/368896771/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201083"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A new federal audit looks back at the troubled rollout of MNsure and finds that the state&rsquo;s health insurance exchange didn&rsquo;t always properly assess whether enrollees were eligible for financial help."}, "article_summary": "A new federal audit looks back at the troubled rollout of MNsure and finds that the state\u2019s health insurance exchange didn\u2019t always properly assess whether enrollees were eligible for financial help.\nThe audit looked at the portion of MNsure that individuals use to buy health insurance policies from private insurers.\nMinnesota created the MNsure health insurance exchange in 2013 to implement the federal Affordable Care Act, which required new exchange marketplaces for all 50 states.\nOn data inconsistencies, MNsure said that during the time period covered by the report, the exchange had suspended sending notices about such issues because of technical problems.\nAn audit of Kentucky\u2019s exchange released in October found that its internal controls were generally effective."}
