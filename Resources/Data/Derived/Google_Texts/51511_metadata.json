Rick Scott and the Florida Cabinet Thursday began moving on replacing two high-profile state positions by agreeing on salary ranges and interview dates.\n\nMarshall Stranburg, executive director of the state\u2019s Department of Revenue, and Kevin McCarty, the state\u2019s insurance commissioner, both quit in the past two months.\n\nScott, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam agreed to advertise the jobs from Monday through March 11.\n\nOn March 23, Cabinet aides will select applicants for interviews for both positions, with public interviews to be held during the March 29 Cabinet meeting. Scott and the others will individually interview candidates before that, the governor said.\n\nSaying \u201cwe deserve an extraordinary talent\u201d as insurance commissioner, Atwater suggested creating a new salary range of McCarty\u2019s salary of $134,000 a year to $200,000. The motion passed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know there is an insurance market in the country as dynamic as Florida,\u201d Atwater said, adding that hurricane season starts June 1.\n\nA salary range for the Revenue Department post was set at Stranburg\u2019s present salary of $129,000 a year up to $150,000.\n\nStranburg and McCarty had long been targeted for removal by Scott, who wanted new leadership in those key offices.\n\nScott reportedly favors former state Rep. Tom Grady, a friend of his and a fellow resident of Naples, for the Office of Insurance Regulation top job.\n\nGrady is a former interim president of Citizens Property Insurance Corp. and Commissioner of Financial Regulation, the state\u2019s top banking regulator.\n\nOthers in the running, according to reports, include GOP state Rep. Bill Hager of Delray Beach, a former Iowa Insurance Commissioner and current vice chair of the House Insurance and Banking Subcommittee.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Gov.
