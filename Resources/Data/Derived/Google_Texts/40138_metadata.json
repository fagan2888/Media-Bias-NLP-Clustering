He was being held for spying for South Korea and asked the South or the U.S. government to rescue him, CNN said.\n\nHyeon Soo Lim, a South Korean-born Canadian who was the head pastor at one of Canada's largest churches, has been held by the North since February. Lim, who was 60 at the time of his arrest, was sentenced to hard labor for life in December for attempting to overthrow the North's regime.\n\n\"I wasn't originally a laborer, so the labor was hard at first,\" Lim told CNN in Korean through an interpreter. \"But now I've gotten used to it.\"\n\nThe charges against Lim lacked specifics, but Lim said it may have had to do with his open criticism of the North's three generations of leaders.\n\n\"I admit I've violated this government's authority, system and order,\" Lim said in the interview aired on Monday. Asked if his biggest crime was speaking badly of the North's leaders, he said: \"Yes, I think so.\"\n\nLim, who was brought into a Pyongyang hotel for the interview, his hair cropped short and wearing a gray padded prison uniform bearing the number \"036\" on his chest, works eight hours a day, six days a week digging holes in an orchard at a labor camp where he has seen no other prisoners, CNN said.\n\nLim, who had lived in Canada since 1986, gets three meals and day and regular medical attention, CNN said. His church has said Lim had a \"very serious health problem, very high blood pressure.\"\n\nThe church has said Lim had visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home.\n\nKim told CNN he spied on behalf of \"South Korean conservative elements\" and was arrested in October.\n\n\"I was tasked with taking photos of military secrets and scandalous scenes,\" Kim said.\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Seoul said it was aware of the report but did not have further comment. If confirmed, Kim would be the first American to be detained since the North released three U.S. citizens in 2014.\n\nHe said he had moved to the Chinese city of Yanji near the border with North Korea and worked in the North Korean city of Rason in a trading business, when a number of South Koreans approached him\n\n\"They asked me to help destroy the (North's) system and spread propaganda against the government,\" he said. He was being held at a Pyongyang hotel and was in good health, CNN said.\n\n(Reporting by Jack Kim and James Pearson; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore and Nick Macfie)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If confirmed, Kim Dong Chul, who CNN said was 60 and formerly of Fairfax, Virginia, wo", "title": "North Korea holding U.S. citizen and Canada pastor: CNN", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/11/North-Korea-holding-US-citizen-and-Canada-pastor-CNN", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/northkorea-canada-pastor_5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/11/North-Korea-holding-US-citizen-and-Canada-pastor-CNN", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/northkorea-canada-pastor_5.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If confirmed, Kim Dong Chul, who CNN said was 60 and formerly of Fairfax, Virginia, wo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "He was being held for spying for South Korea and asked the South or the U.S. government to rescue him, CNN said.\nIf confirmed, Kim Dong Chul, who CNN said was 60 and formerly of Fairfax, Virginia, would be the second Western citizen known to be held currently in North Korea.\nKim told CNN he spied on behalf of \"South Korean conservative elements\" and was arrested in October.\n\"I wasn't originally a laborer, so the labor was hard at first,\" Lim told CNN in Korean through an interpreter.\nHyeon Soo Lim, a South Korean-born Canadian who was the head pastor at one of Canada's largest churches, has been held by the North since February."}
