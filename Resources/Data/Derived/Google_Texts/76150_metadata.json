REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\n3913961\n\nWhile all eyes are focused on the \u2018glitches\u2019 plaguing the so-called Affordable Care Act\u2019s enrollment websites, it\u2019s the Obamacare \u2018navigators\u2019 that should concern us. The organizations tapped by the Obama administration and its state allies to educate consumers about their health care options include left-wing radicals, labor union front groups, and partisan activists. What\u2019s worse, they are navigating with $67 million in federal taxpayer grants as well as additional state funding.\n\nConsider some of the unsavory outfits the taxpayers are paying to help those same taxpayers navigate Obamacare. There are union-founded \u201cworker centers\u201d like the Restaurant Opportunities Center and the Retail Action Project. When not promoting Obamacare, these groups push Big Labor\u2019s agenda through lobbying and protests.\n\nOther navigators are notorious community organizers like Seedco, which recently paid $1.7 million to settle a federal fraud lawsuit, ex-operatives of the disgraced ACORN who are working with an outfit called Southern United Neighborhoods, and the nonprofit arm of Ralph Nader\u2019s notorious anti-business group Citizen Action.\n\nFinally, there are the under-the-radar shock troops of the left like the Community Service Society of NY, a leading advocate of a job-killing mandated leave law in New York City; and a group sponsored by the Center for Community Change, a nonprofit organization whose home page currently has a photo of GOP leaders John Boehner and Paul Ryan under the nonpartisan headline \u201cHouse GOP: cease and Desist!\u201d\n\nEven amid this extreme company, the Restaurant Opportunities Center stands out. Founded by the union HERE in 2002, ROC\u2019s co-founder has openly admitted the group\u2019s long-standing mission to \u201corganize the 99 percent of the [restaurant] industry that doesn\u2019t have a union.\u201d\n\nIn service of this goal, it has gained a national reputation for harming local eateries and national chain restaurants through coordinated lobbying efforts at every level of government, as well as protests, shakedowns, and intimidation campaigns that target specific restaurants.\n\nROC\u2019s tactics \u2014 like using a 12-foot inflatable cockroach to scare off patrons \u2014 have been so disruptive that restaurant employees have staged counter-protests to show that ROC doesn\u2019t speak for them at all. One New York judge slapped a restraining order on ROC, while ROC circumvented another cease-and-desist order by rebranding its protests as \u201cprayer vigils.\u201d\n\nIts anti-restaurant crusades have even caught the attention of Congress, where ROC is currently part of an investigation by a House of Representatives Committee for its \u201chistory of intimidation towards opponents.\u201d\n\nTo top it off, ROC\u2019s go-to person for its navigator program is a self-described \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrant who was arrested for her role in an immigration-related protest in Atlanta, the third undocumented worker linked to ROC in recent years. Perhaps serving as an Obamacare navigator is one of those jobs Americans won\u2019t do?\n\nUnfortunately, Obamacare isn\u2019t ROC\u2019s only source of public funds. In recent years, ROC and its regional affiliates have received nearly $1 million from the Department of Labor, along with $500,000 in federal stimulus funding in New York City and $200,000 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mike Paranzino", "description": "A fugitive and several 'undocumented' workers, paid for by ROC and your taxpayer dollars.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "While all eyes are focused on the 'glitches' plaguing the so-called Affordable Care Act's enrollment websites, it's the Obamacare 'navigators' that should concern us.
