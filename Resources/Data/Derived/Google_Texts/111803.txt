SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) - A business group is exploring the idea of opening a specialty grocery store in downtown Sioux City, according to a Friday report in the Sioux City Journal.

The newspaper reported (http://bit.ly/1Co9pHm ) that the store would be called Trader Sioux and feature local merchandise and fresh food. The store also could showcase products sold at the Sioux City Farmers Market, which is held twice weekly during the spring, summer and fall near the Tyson Events Center.

The business group, Downtown Partners, hasn’t announced a budget or a timetable. Chris Bogenrief leads the Downtown Partners committee organizing the project, and he says the project “is an economic initiative, so we want to make sure we spur as much spinoff development as we can.”

The group plans to hire a consultant to help analyze the administrative costs and projected revenues for the store. They have identified three possible sites for the project. Bogenrief said the goal is to buy a historic building and use tax credits to help pay for development.

One farmer who sells produce and meat at the Sioux City Famers Market said he would welcome a downtown store to showcase his goods.

“We’d most definitely be interested in something like that,” said Jay Wolff, of Norfolk, Neb.-based Wolff Farms. “Business slows down a lot in the winter time, but we still have produce to sell.”
