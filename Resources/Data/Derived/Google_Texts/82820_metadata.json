The industry is warning countries that their tobacco laws violate an expanding web of trade and investment treaties, raising the prospect of costly, prolonged legal battles, health advocates and officials said.\n\nThe strategy has gained momentum in recent years as smoking rates in rich countries have fallen and tobacco companies have sought to maintain access to fast-growing markets in developing countries. Industry officials say that there are only a few cases of active litigation, and that giving a legal opinion to governments is routine for major players whose interests will be affected.\n\nBut tobacco opponents say the strategy is intimidating low- and middle-income countries from tackling one of the gravest health threats facing them: smoking. They also say the legal tactics are undermining the world\u2019s largest global public health treaty, the W.H.O. Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which aims to reduce smoking by encouraging limits on advertising, packaging and sale of tobacco products. More than 170 countries have signed it since it took effect in 2005.\n\nMore than five million people die annually of smoking-related causes, more than from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAlarmed about rising smoking rates among young women, Namibia, in southern Africa, passed a tobacco control law in 2010 but quickly found itself bombarded with stern warnings from the tobacco industry that the new statute violated the country\u2019s obligations under trade treaties.\n\n\u201cWe have bundles and bundles of letters from them,\u201d said Namibia\u2019s health minister, Dr. Richard Kamwi.\n\nThree years later, the government, fearful of a punishingly expensive legal battle, has yet to carry out a single major provision of the law, like limiting advertising or placing large health warnings on cigarette packaging.\n\nThe issue is particularly urgent now as the United States completes talks on a major new trade treaty with 11 Pacific Rim countries that aims to be a model for the rules of international commerce. Administration officials say they want the new treaty to raise standards for public health. They single out tobacco as a health concern, wording that upset the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, which said that the inclusion would leave the door open for other products, like soda or sugar, to be heavily regulated in other countries.\n\n\u201cOur goal in this agreement is to protect the legitimate health regulations that treaty countries want to pursue from efforts by tobacco companies to undermine them,\u201d said Michael Froman, the United States trade representative, in a telephone interview. The language is not yet final, he said.\n\nBut public health advocates say the current wording would not stop countries from being sued when they adopt strong tobacco control measures, though some trade experts said it might make the companies less likely to win. This fall, more than 50 members of the House and about a dozen members of the Senate sent letters to the administration expressing concern.\n\nTobacco consumption more than doubled in the developing world from 1970 to 2000, according to the United Nations. Much of the increase was in China, but there has also been substantial growth in Africa, where smoking rates have traditionally been low. More than three-quarters of the world\u2019s smokers now live in the developing world.\n\nDr. Margaret Chan, director general of the W.H.O., said in a speech last year that legal actions against Uruguay, Norway and Australia were \u201cdeliberately designed to instill fear\u201d in countries trying to reduce smoking.\n\n\u201cThe wolf is no longer in sheep\u2019s clothing, and its teeth are bared,\u201d she said.\n\nTobacco companies are objecting to laws in both developed and developing nations. Industry officials say they respect countries\u2019 efforts to protect public health, but face difficulties promoting their brands as more countries ban cigarette ads. Often, the only space left is the packaging, and even that is shrinking, with some countries requiring that packages be plastered with shocking pictures of people with cancer; in Australia, brand names are reduced to uniform block letters on drab olive backgrounds.\n\n\u201cRemoving our trademarks removes our assurance to customers of the origin and quality of our lawfully available products, meaning they and their characteristics become indistinguishable from those of our competitors,\u201d said Gareth Cooper, group head of regulation at British American Tobacco.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the American government used to pressure countries to open their markets to American tobacco companies. As smoking rates in some of these countries rose, outrage grew, and President Bill Clinton issued an executive order in 2001 that banned the United States government from lobbying on the industry\u2019s behalf.\n\nBut other types of trade agreements have emerged that give companies rights.\n\nSuch treaties are intended to promote prosperity by reducing trade barriers and protecting investors from expropriation by foreign governments. They allow companies to sue directly, instead of having to persuade a state to take up their case. They have proliferated since the 1990s, and number around 3,000, up from a few hundred in the late 1980s, according to Robert Stumberg, a law professor at the Harrison Institute for Public Law at Georgetown University, whose clients include antismoking groups.\n\nIn Africa, at least four countries \u2014 Namibia, Gabon, Togo and Uganda \u2014 have received warnings from the tobacco industry that their laws run afoul of international treaties, said Patricia Lambert, director of the international legal consortium at the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to intimidate everybody,\u201d said Jonathan Liberman, director of the McCabe Center for Law and Cancer in Australia, which gives legal support to countries that have been challenged by tobacco companies. In Namibia, the tobacco industry has said that requiring large warning labels on cigarette packages violates its intellectual property rights and could fuel counterfeiting.\n\nMr. Cooper, of British American Tobacco, whose local affiliate sent the government a legal opinion, said in an email that countries should \u201cconsider the broader context of implementing regulations that can impact trade.\u201d\n\nThomas Bollyky, a trade lawyer and a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said many developing countries are at a disadvantage in investment cases because they do not have the specialized legal expertise or resources to fight.\n\nUruguay has acknowledged that it would have had to drop its tobacco control law and settle with Philip Morris International if the foundation of the departing mayor of New York, Michael R. Bloomberg, had not paid to defend the law. (The company\u2019s net revenue last year was $77 billion, substantially more than Uruguay\u2019s gross domestic product.) Even developed countries like Canada and New Zealand have backed away from planned tobacco laws in the face of investment treaty claims, Mr. Bollyky said.\n\nThe most closely watched legal battle is playing out in Australia, where the tobacco industry lost a case in domestic courts last year. Philip Morris International has filed suit under an investment treaty between Australia and Hong Kong, where the firm has a branch. The proceedings, which are not public, will be held in Singapore and decided by outside arbitrators, not judges.\n\nPhilip Morris International has dozens of subsidiaries, allowing the company \u201cto play the treaty game much more adroitly,\u201d Professor Stumberg said.\n\nCompanies are even paying for countries to make the industry\u2019s case against other nations in the World Trade Organization. Ukraine filed a complaint with the organization against Australia\u2019s packaging rule, even though the two countries barely trade. Mr. Cooper acknowledged that his company was helping Ukraine pay the legal bills, but said that was standard practice in W.T.O. disputes.\n\nBashupi Maloboka, a Health Ministry official who steered the tobacco control law to passage in Namibia, said the industry\u2019s approach had slowed what was already a plodding process.\n\n\u201cThe fear is that they have the money and they have the resources, so they can pay for anything,\u201d said Mr. Maloboka, who retired last year.\n\nBut Dr. Kamwi, the health minister, said he hoped the regulations to put the 2010 law into practice would be finished next year. \u201cWe have decided to put our foot down,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they want to go to court, we will see them there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/12/13nyt-smoking-acropHF.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Tobacco companies threaten costly, prolonged legal battles over trade and investment treaties"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff79\"", "article_summary": "Tobacco companies are objecting to laws in both developed and developing nations.\nIn Namibia, the tobacco industry has said that requiring large warning labels on cigarette packages violates its intellectual property rights and could fuel counterfeiting.\nThey also say the legal tactics are undermining the world\u2019s largest global public health treaty, the W.H.O.\nFramework Convention on Tobacco Control, which aims to reduce smoking by encouraging limits on advertising, packaging and sale of tobacco products.\nIn the early 1990s, the American government used to pressure countries to open their markets to American tobacco companies."}
