He has admitted to being \u201caddicted\u201d to the internet and is a passionate believer in its power and relevance as a tool to spread knowledge in today\u2019s world and for future generations. Born in Alabama in the US, he now lives in London with his wife and two daughters. Euronews\u2019 Paul McDowell caught up him.\n\nPaul McDowell euronews: \u201cJimmy Wales, you and Wikipedia won the Princess of Asturias Award for International Cooperation. Another award \u2013 growing every year it seems.\u201d\n\nJimmy Wells: \u201c We are quite happy about this award because it is for international cooperation, which is an aspect of Wikipedia which is really important to us as it\u2019s part of our culture, part of our community spirit and it is not often recognised. So, people sometimes think of us as an internet phenomenon, a technical phenomenon but we really think of ourselves as more of a cultural phenomenon and about international people working together globally so it\u2019s nice, yes.\n\neuronews: \u201cHow much of Jimmy Wells is in Wikipedia?\u201d\n\nJW: \u201cWell, that\u2019s really hard to say. I do think some of the early values of Wikipedia are still reflected in Wikipedia so I tend to be a very reflective and thoughtful person. I don\u2019t like political debates that are one side yelling at the other side and everybody being very extreme. I like to say, \u201cno let\u2019s stop and understand this first\u201d. That\u2019s obviously a value of Wikipedia \u2013 to try and really seek that neutral presentation to understand first, before having an opinion.\u201d\n\neuronews: \u201cDo we want to be neutral, surely we want to be stimulated, we want that argument. Politics moves on by arguing, by that debate.\u201d\n\nJW: \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting, I think. I believe very strongly that people want both and actually one of the mistakes which has been made in the media \u2013 I now live in London and so newspapers there can be sniping at each other and it is all that sort of thing. It gets a lot of attention and obviously we know online \u201cclickbait\u201d headlines as we call it get a lot of attention.Yet Wikipedia is the fifth most popular website in the world and we don\u2019t run outrageous articles to get people\u2019s blood boiling. So, I think people want both. They want a bit of spirited debate but actually want the background information.\n\nFor example if you take an issue like Obamacare \u2013 healthcare reform in the US \u2013 turn on any television news programme or look at any newspaper and you will see ranting editorials for and against. It is actually very hard to figure out what the hell it is exactly, what exactly were these reforms. It was enormously complicated and Wikipedia provides that. Just a basic description of what is it and so now we can fight about it because we actually know what we are talking about.\u201d\n\neuronews: \u201cOf course you are providing knowledge and knowledge is power. Could it be a bit of a dangerous game giving us all power, empowering us with that knowledge?\u201d\n\nJW: \u201cYeah, that\u2019s great. I hope so, I hope so, I hope that what we are doing is giving people the ability to access lots of information, lots of knowledge to improve their lives by learning more about culture, literature, science also political matters. One of the things we see around the world is that the internet and the new communication tools are giving rise to popular rebellions.\n\nBut we also see people really struggling and saying \u201clook here in my country we have sham elections and the same people have been running things for 40 years and in Europe and America \u2013 as flawed as things might be in this way or that way \u2013 you have a change of government that is peaceful and ideas that people support do ultimately get expressed. How can we get there, what is wrong with our institutions?\u201d So that is a deep question of political science that is not answered by going out on the street corner and protesting. It is answered by saying, \u201cokay, what are the right checks and balances, how do we form a proper government that will tend be protective of human liberty and so forth?\u201d\n\nWell, we are only a tiny piece of that, but I hope the internet, by giving people access to knowledge that they are less vulnerable to the demagogue of the weak in various places around the world.\u201d\n\neuronews: \u201cI am thinking of when we were at school \u2013 you all remember those teachers that really inspired you to learn. The internet is a very flat dull uninteresting way, I just pick up Wikipedia and read it and there is nothing that comes out and hits me.\u201d\n\nJW: \u201cBut, people do read it and they get quite passionate about it. I think for many people they are a bit tired of inflammatory things and so on and they actually just want a calm sane presentation of the facts. And also the massive comprehensiveness of Wikipedia means there is something interesting for everyone.\u201d\n\neuronews: \u201cLooking at your page on Wikipedia I don\u2019t really know the man, I don\u2019t really know what your dark moments were, I don\u2019t really know what your high moments are.\u201d\n\nJW: \u201cYeah, yeah for sure. One of the interesting things about Wikipedia is that we say we want to be the sum of all human knowledge \u2013 the sum meaning \u201csummary\u201d but there is so much more to culture. The experience of a fantastic presentation of Hamlet is a world apart from reading about Hamlet in Wikipedia. On the other hand, going to see Hamlet without any background, any cultural understanding and so on you miss a lot of the nuances and so the two hand in hand are a fantastic experience and so I think it\u2019s absolutely right. If you want to understand a person, really understand them you need more than just the Wikipedia page. It will give you the basic facts.\u201d\n\neuronews: \u201cYou mentioned the sum of all knowledge and you said you want to get that available to every individual in the world. That is a huge strategy, that is a huge task.\u201d\n\nJW: \u201cIt is and interestingly enough I think it is one of the reasons we have been successful. It is a big bold exciting idea and I think if it were more limited people wouldn\u2019t be as inspired by it. But it does drive our work. We know in the next five to 10 years there is going to be a billion, possibly two billion coming online. We need to think now about how we can support them, what does it mean for people who previously had almost no access to knowledge to have the whole internet in their pocket because they are coming online with mobile devices.\n\nSo that vision of trying to reach as many people as possible in every part of the world is really important to us. And for me it is part of what makes Wikipedia really meaningful. It is to say this is actually a moment in history where we have this fantastic tool. When most people first saw the internet they thought this is fantastic, this can bring everyone together as one planet, they can all learn together and so on. And then in the dot com boom it seemed to be mostly about ordering dog food at home and sort of nonsense like that. Wikipedia is about that fundamental vision to say \u201cwow\u201d we have got this amazing tool to bring people together, to share knowledge, to understand each other, to understand the world. Okay great let\u2019s do that then, that sounds like a fun thing to do so that is where we are up to.\u201d\n\neuronews: Jimmy Wales, thank you very much indeed.\n\nJW: \u201cGreat, thank you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"date.created": "2015-10-29 13:36:29", "description": "interview - Jimmy Wales is a renowned internet entrepreneur who is best known as the co-founder and promoter of the non-profit encyclopedia Wikipedia.
