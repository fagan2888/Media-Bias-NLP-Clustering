Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nThe Supreme Court was substantially more popular with those on the political left than those on the political right, according to polling ahead of last week\u2019s historic decisions on gay marriage and health-case subsidies.\n\nAhead of Thursday\u2019s decision that affirmed important parts of the Affordable Care Act and Friday\u2019s making gay marriage a constitutional right, the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed strong positive feelings about the court among self-described Democrats, liberals and 2012 Obama-voters.\n\nOne especially sharp divide: The court had a strong net positive among liberal respondents \u2013 51% positive vs. just 20% negative. But among conservatives, the feelings about the Court were essentially neutral \u2013 30% positive and 30% negative.\n\nThe split carries through other partisan divides as well, including a difference between Republican primary voters (35% have positive feelings about the Court) and Democratic ones (49% have positive feelings).\n\nA couple thoughts on what this means for 2016:\n\nFirst, even before last week\u2019s big rulings, conservatives weren\u2019t terribly happy with the court\u2013 so Republican presidential candidates\u2019 pitches on the importance of appointing conservative justices may have particular resonance with primary voters.\n\nSecond, justices don\u2019t always vote in line with the politics of the president who appointed him or her \u2014 so you better get insurance. Thursday\u2019s ACA breakdown was 6-3 tally, a tally that included two Republican appointees; the 5-4 2012 ruling upholding the ACA included one GOP appointee; as did Friday\u2019s 5-4 ruling backing gay marriage.\n\nDante Chinni writes Politics Counts as a regular Capital Journal feature.
