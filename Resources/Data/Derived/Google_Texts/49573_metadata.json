After all, would Democrats be seeking the truth at all? When it comes to her violating rules or laws that protect national security, what difference at this point does it make? I mean, Chris Stevens is still dead, right? Isn\u2019t the partisanship of her GOP questioners at least equally matched by the partisanship of House Democrats whose constant goal is to stymie and shut down the committee in order to protect Mrs. Clinton from the consequences of her own cynical (and perhaps criminal) behavior?\n\nIs there a candidate in this race (including Donald Trump, about whom more in a moment) who stands for so little other than her own desire for power? Bernie Sanders is a nut, and Joe Biden not far behind, but at least they believe in something; I cannot name a single fundamental principle regarding the proper role of government which Mrs. Clinton deeply believes and which she has consistently held dear. I defy you to find a Clinton supporter who can find such a principle either (in her, and perhaps in themselves.)\n\nSpeaking of cynical behavior and loose attachment to principle, how about The Donald? This week\u2019s breathless media focus is on Trump\u2019s strange (and, at least for most Republicans, politically unwise) unsubtle assignment of responsibility for the 9/11 attacks to former President George W. Bush, triggering applause from liberals and a furious response from the current Bush family candidate for president.\n\nBut the still-simmering family feud has overshadowed a more important \u2014 and more presidentially disqualifying \u2014 statement by Mr. Trump, made on Fox News Sunday: when asked about his willingness to \u201cshut down the government\u201d (a period during which most important functions of government continue to operate) over the debt ceiling Trump\u2019s answer was, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say. I want to be unpredictable.\u201d Anchor Chris Wallace asked a follow-up question regarding shutting down the government to end Planned Parenthood funding to which Trump reiterated, \u201cI want to show unpredictability.\u201d\n\nDoes Mr. Trump not realize that this isn\u2019t football or a Hollywood cliffhanger, where half the fun is not knowing what\u2019s going to happen?\n\nIf a candidate for your local school board was asked whether she supported the existence of charter schools and responded with, \u201cI don\u2019t want to say. I want to be unpredictable,\u201d would you think to yourself, \u201cHey, that will sure make next year\u2019s vote about my child\u2019s education exciting!\u201d Or would you conclude that the candidate is simply masking ignorance, laziness, or political stupidity of the first order? (If you\u2019d prefer the \u201cunpredictability,\u201d you\u2019re a possible Trump supporter \u2014 and a terrible parent.)\n\nSince his cultish supporters think that any statement contrary to conventional political wisdom demonstrates the hyper-worthiness of their man, Trump\u2019s opacity may not hurt his poll numbers. They will, however, further limit his ability to gain additional supporters. As well they should.\n\nDonald, this is not a game in which surprise is a winning strategy, either for your electoral ambitions or for a nation choosing a leader as we mercifully exit the most harmful presidency in recent, or perhaps all of, American history and continue through a time of great challenge, both at home and abroad. There is nothing more important in this election than knowing what the candidates believe (standing for good television ratings does not suffice) and what actions they are willing to take to implement policies based on those beliefs.\n\nIndeed, one problem for Republicans is that Americans are unsure what elected GOP politicians really believe \u2014 and believe enough to act on. Sure, they talk a big game about Planned Parenthood or immigration or national security, but what have they actually done? Indeed, what have they even tried to do?\n\nConsider this: President Obama and each of the Democratic presidential candidates have posited climate change as the most pressing issue facing the nation and the world. There has been no significant change in global temperatures for more than eighteen years and climate change is perpetually at or near the very bottom of issues the public cares about (although with a huge partisan divide, which may explain the Democrats\u2019 mindless pandering).\n\nYet a group of people who should be laughed off the ballot nevertheless stand a real chance of fielding the eventual general election winner because the GOP (in part due to Trump\u2019s sucking up so much media attention) is doing such a poor job of explaining the conservative alternative.\n\nFor Republicans to be seen by voters as worthy of maintaining congressional majorities and taking back the White House, party leaders and prominent GOP candidates need to do a much better job of explaining what they are for, how they will take steps toward those goals (in ways that don\u2019t strike the ordinary American as \u201cextreme\u201d), and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 why those goals benefit the vast majority of our citizens now and in the future. In other words, the GOP needs to do precisely the opposite of what Donald Trump just did.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s gratifying to read (in a NRCC summary of legislative activity for the coming week) that\u2026\n\n[T]he House is likely to consider theRestoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act. The bill, which does not currently have a number, is a consolidated bill from provisions reported by three different House committees. The bill repeals several elements of Obamacare including the individual mandate, the employer mandates, the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), the medical device tax, and the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax. The bill also blocks federal funding for Planned Parenthood for one year.\n\nBecause the measure is moving through the budget reconciliation process \u2014 meaning it can pass the Senate with a simple majority vote and not be subject to a Democratic protect-the-president filibuster \u2014 it stands a strong chance of making it to the president\u2019s desk. Of course, Obama will veto the bill but making him do so has substantial political benefits: reminding voters of an important issue and the Republicans\u2019 position on it, demonstrating legislative steps to deal with the issue, and waking Americans up to the fundamental but often neglected truism that \u201celections have consequences.\u201d\n\n(Republicans should stop adding to their own bills unrelated or unnecessarily divisive items which detract from their effectiveness as political messages, especially messages aimed at garnering votes from independent voters, women, etc. Including a Planned Parenthood provision in Obamacare reform is just such a poison pill, allowing Democrats to say they voted against the bill in the name of \u201cwomen\u2019s health.\u201d)\n\nThe heart of winning elections is convincing voters that your principles and the policies you will support based on those principles will benefit the nation. At this early point in the election cycle, an understanding of this basic fact seems remarkably absent: Hillary does not stand for anything other than her own divine right to power. Donald Trump does not want to tell us what he stands for when it comes to important questions that will inevitably face a president, as if \u201cunpredictability\u201d is an asset in the White House. And congressional GOP leadership has spent so long in fear of Barack Obama\u2019s bully pulpit and the \u201cmainstream\u201d media amplifying his lies and demonization that few Americans even know what Republican politicians truly stand for.\n\nThis is no way to run a campaign, much less to run a country.\n\nHow remarkable it is \u2014 and what an indictment of American voters and the American educational system \u2014 that each party\u2019s frontrunner is winning by standing for almost nothing at all.\n\nAnd what a vindication it will be when the eventual election winner is a principled conservative who stands for something and has both the courage and the ability to convince the American people how much that matters.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4eb\"", "article_summary": "How remarkable it is \u2014 and what an indictment of American voters and the American educational system \u2014 that each party\u2019s frontrunner is winning by standing for almost nothing at all.\nThe bill, which does not currently have a number, is a consolidated bill from provisions reported by three different House committees.\nWhen it comes to her violating rules or laws that protect national security, what difference at this point does it make?\nI defy you to find a Clinton supporter who can find such a principle either (in her, and perhaps in themselves.)\nAnd what a vindication it will be when the eventual election winner is a principled conservative who stands for something and has both the courage and the ability to convince the American people how much that matters."}
