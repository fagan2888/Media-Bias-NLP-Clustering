He now stars as gangster Frank Tagliano in the Netflix original series Lilyhammer, which is filmed in Norway. Season two of Lilyhammer just premiered on Netflix.\n\nHe gave his views on Obamacare in a HuffPostLive interview (see embed above). Van Zandt described himself as an independent who shares many of Springsteen\u2019s left-liberal views.\n\nVan Zandt expressed annoyance that the politicians wasted two years (actually more) talking about healthcare \u201cwhen we should be talking about heath.\u201d He insisted that the country is having the wrong conversation about the wrong subject.\n\nContinued Van Zandt: \u201cI spend six months a year in Norway\u2026 Healthcare\u2019s free in Norway because everybody\u2019s healthy.\u201d\n\nThere are few things in Obamacare that are \u201cnice\u201d and will help some people, Van Zandt admitted, \u201cbut mostly it\u2019s almost worthless\u2026 because we need to be talking about health\u2026 We have two out of three people obese in this country. Why is that? We\u2019re a little bit lazy, we don\u2019t exercise enough. Maybe we eat too much, but that\u2019s not really the reason.\u201d\n\nVan Zandt insisted that proper nutrition should be the focus: \u201cThe reason is the preservatives and additives and steroids, all this gluten and every other junk that\u2019s in our food. We take care of that and then we start talking about healthcare. Let\u2019s get this under control. Let\u2019s get our health under control.\u201d\n\nSeparately, a new AP poll indicates that about half of those Americans with employer-based insurance expect their coverage to change next year, and mostly for the worse, in terms of higher premiums and increased deductibles and co-pays.\n\nDo you agree with Steven Van Zandt that Obamacare amounts to merely a band aid on a pervasive healthcare crisis?\n\n[thumbnail image credit: Frantogian]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Actor and musician Steven Van Zandt claims that the Obamacare law is mostly worthless because it doesn't address America's sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Actor and musician Steven Van Zandt claims that the Obamacare law is mostly worthless because it doesn\u2019t address America\u2019s sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary", "title": "Steven Van Zandt Slams Obamacare As \u2018Almost Worthless\u2019 [Video]", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1062588/steven-van-zandt-slams-obamacare-as-almost-worthless-video/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Steven-Van_Zandt.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-15T11:37:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-15T10:51:27+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Steven-Van_Zandt.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2013-12-15T11:37:13+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,affordable care act,bruce springsteen and the e street band,lilyhammer,obamacare steven van zandt,obesity,steven van zandt,steven van zandt obamacare,the sopranos,celebrity news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Steven-Van_Zandt.jpg", "height": 408, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Actor and musician Steven Van Zandt claims that the Obamacare law is mostly worthless because it doesn\u2019t address America\u2019s sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29fe\"", "article_summary": "Do you agree with Steven Van Zandt that Obamacare amounts to merely a band aid on a pervasive healthcare crisis?\nActor and musician Steven Van Zandt claims that the Obamacare law is mostly worthless because it doesn\u2019t address America\u2019s sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary practices.\nVan Zandt is best known for his role as Tony Soprano\u2019s right-hand man on The Sopranos and as the guitarist in Bruce Springsteen\u2019s E Street Band.\nVan Zandt described himself as an independent who shares many of Springsteen\u2019s left-liberal views.\nVan Zandt expressed annoyance that the politicians wasted two years (actually more) talking about healthcare \u201cwhen we should be talking about heath.\u201d He insisted that the country is having the wrong conversation about the wrong subject."}
