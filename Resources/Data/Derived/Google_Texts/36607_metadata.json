The first thing thing that happened is that they reported that he died. Then they reported that he had lost his leg. The truth is that he actually had a very bad traumatic brain injury,\u201d Morelli said.\n\nRelated: Tracy Morgan\u2019s Wal-Mart lawsuit is no laughing matter\n\n\u201cMany many people really thought \u2018Well, he broke his leg \u2026 it\u2019s not that serious,\u2019\u201d Morelli added. \u201dIt was much more serious than anyone really knew. When that came out I think everyone was very shocked.\u201d\n\nThe crash occurred when a Wal-Mart tractor-trailer slammed into a limo bus carrying Morgan and several others on the way back from a show in Delaware. Morgan\u2019s friend and fellow comedian James McNair was killed and others were injured in the incident.\n\nMorgan has since launched legal battle against the retail giant, alleging the truck\u2019s driver, Kevin Roper, was awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the crash. The lawsuit also alleges he was asleep at the wheel.\n\n\u201cUpon information and belief, plaintiffs\u2019 injuries, if any, were caused, in whole or in part, by plaintiffs\u2019 failure to properly wear an appropriate available seat belt restraint device,\u201d Wal-Mart said, according to court papers made public in September.\n\n\n\n\u201cBy failing to exercise ordinary care in making use of available seat belts, upon information and belief, plaintiffs acted unreasonably and in disregard of plaintiffs\u2019 own best interests,\u201d they added.\n\nMorgan fired back in a statement, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t believe Wal-Mart is blaming me for an accident that they caused.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Tracy Morgan\u2019s Wal-Mart lawsuit is a good thing\n\nOn Tuesday, lawyers appeared in a New Jersey courtroom to set a date for a conference for Morgan\u2019s suit.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever seen any photos of the vehicle they were riding in \u2026 you can understand that they\u2019re lucky they they\u2019re alive,\u201d Morelli told msnbc.\n\nAs to whether or not Morgan will ever make a full recovery, Morelli says only time will tell. \u201cI don\u2019t know and neither do the [doctors.] He is improved, there\u2019s no question, but that\u2019s where we are. He\u2019s a fighter. He\u2019s fighting every single say to get better and trying to live his life under the circumstances\u201d\n\nStill, in a statement to the Associated Press, Morelli said it is unlikely that the comedian will ever be \u201cthe Tracy Morgan he once was.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "According to his lawyer, former SNL star Tracy Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury in a June 7 limo bus crash on the New Jersey Turnpike.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/tracy-morgan-suffered-traumatic-brain-injury-crash", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "According to his lawyer, former SNL star Tracy Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury in a June 7 limo bus crash on the New Jersey Turnpike.", "title": "Bad news for ex-SNL star", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/tracy-morgan-suffered-traumatic-brain-injury-crash", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/h_14474651.jpg?itok=nxfKdFhN", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/tracy-morgan-suffered-traumatic-brain-injury-crash", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/h_14474651.jpg?itok=TQ21Ogr2", "title": "Lawyer: Tracy Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury in crash", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "According to his lawyer, former SNL star Tracy Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury in a June 7 limo bus crash on the New Jersey Turnpike."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-18T19:38:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "bridget-todd", "title": "Lawyer: Tracy Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury in crash", "tags": "celebrities,culture,health,society,wal-mart", "published": 1, "date": "11/18/2014 19:38:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/tracy-morgan-suffered-traumatic-brain-injury-crash"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "According to his lawyer, former SNL star Tracy Morgan suffered a traumatic brain injury in a June 7 limo bus crash on the New Jersey Turnpike.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Society, Culture, Celebrities, Wal-Mart"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1a6\"", "article_summary": "Related: Tracy Morgan\u2019s Wal-Mart lawsuit is no laughing matter\u201cMany many people really thought \u2018Well, he broke his leg \u2026 it\u2019s not that serious,\u2019\u201d Morelli added.\nTracy Morgan, the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201c30 Rock\u201d star, suffered a traumatic brain injury, in addition to several other injuries, in a June 7 car accident on the New Jersey Turnpike, Morgan\u2019s lawyer, Benedict Morelli, confirmed to msnbc on Tuesday.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever seen any photos of the vehicle they were riding in \u2026 you can understand that they\u2019re lucky they they\u2019re alive,\u201d Morelli told msnbc.\nThe truth is that he actually had a very bad traumatic brain injury,\u201d Morelli said.\n\u201cThe story with Tracy is \u2013 at the beginning, when reports came out, they had a lot of misinformation."}
