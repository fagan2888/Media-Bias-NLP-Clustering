More than half of the economy’s new jobs went to women last month, led by services, leisure and hospitality employers, according to government data released Friday.

The economy added 175,000 nonfarm positions in February, and 99,000 of those spots, or 57%, went to women. The Institute for Women’s Policy Research crunched the numbers for February and found that women gained 55,000 jobs in professional and business services, another 24,000 jobs in education and health services, and 14,000 jobs in leisure and hospitality. (The above IWPR chart shows the year-over-year gains for women’s employment.)

Meanwhile, longer-term trends show that women’s share of employment gains is flattening out at about 50% — a reasonable level given that women represent almost half of the workforce, according to government data. Over the 12 months through February, women’s nonfarm employment rose by 1.07 million jobs, half of the total U.S. gain of 2.16 million. A couple of years ago, women accounted for just 37% of annual job gains.

What’s going on? During the “hecession,” also less-rhymingly known as the “mancession,” men lost the lion’s share of jobs, flooding the labor market with unemployed workers looking for a new spot. So it makes sense that earlier in the recovery, they made up a larger share of employment growth, said Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a policy analyst at the National Women’s Law Center.

Now that the U.S. is past the recovery’s earliest stages, women are gaining about half the jobs.

“It shows a normalization of the job market,” Gallagher Robbins said.
