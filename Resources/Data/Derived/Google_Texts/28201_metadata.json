Every North Korean believes this.\n\nShe discusses this at length in her new novel, \u201cThe Girl With Seven Names: A North Korean Defector\u2019s Story,\u201d and spoke with The Daily Signal about her experiences as well.\n\nAs Lee explains, propagandized since birth, the people of North Korea know nothing of what life is like outside their own borders. The brutal dictatorships of Kim Jong-un and his predecessors Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung have socially engineered a system void of any freedoms whatsoever, and have positioned themselves as the sole source of information in the country.\n\n\u201cThree generations of Kim regime leadership brutally repressed the people, to the point where the North Korean people don\u2019t even realize that there is something beyond North Korea,\u201d said Olivia Enos, research associate in the Asian Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not getting better.\u201d\n\nThere is a complete lack of freedom of thought and belief in the North Korea Lee grew up in: no freedom of the press, no freedom of movement and no freedom of speech. Nights are pitch-black due to power outages or lack of electricity, neighbors and friends are encouraged to spy on one another and becoming pregnant by a Chinese man is punishable by death.\n\nLife gets infinitely worse for anyone who speaks out against the regime in any way. These perceived traitors can be tortured, thrown into secret prison camps called kwanliso or publicly executed. Their families are also punished.\n\n\u201cGuilt by association in North Korea means that if you commit a crime, not only will you be punished, but also three generations of your family will be punished. Your parents, your grandparents, your grandchildren,\u201d explained Phil Robertson, Asia Deputy Director at Human Rights Watch.\n\nParallels With Nazi Germany\n\nOn February 7, 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Council released a Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea detailing the volume and horror of the human rights abuses of the Kim regime, finding the government guilty of crimes against humanity.\n\n\u201cEven if you are a North Korean that doesn\u2019t find themselves in a prison camp situation and you\u2019re living a normal North Korean life\u2014to say that ordinary North Korean people are enduring unbelievable repression of freedom is accurate,\u201d Enos said.\n\nThe crimes against humanity in North Korea include extermination; murder; enslavement; torture; imprisonment; rape; forced abortions and other sexual violence; persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds; the forcible transfer of populations; the enforced disappearance of persons; and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.\n\nThe U.N. Inquiry further details nearly 400 pages of horror stories, ranging from government officials confiscating food from those in need to women in the kwanliso prison camps who were tragically forced to drown their own babies.\n\n\u201cThe gravity, scale and nature of these violations reveal a state that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,\u201d according to the report. In fact, the U.N. Human Rights Council goes so far as to point out \u201cmany parallels\u201d between North Korea and Nazi Germany.\n\nUnlike with Nazi Germany, though, the international community cannot claim ignorance as an excuse for not intervening to stop the human rights abuses.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for action. We can\u2019t say we don\u2019t know anymore. The suffering and tears of the people of North Korea demand action,\u201d Michael Kirby, the chairman of the U.N. Inquiry, pleaded in the report. \u201cOur generation must tackle this issue urgently and collectively, and indeed the world will judge us by our response.\u201d\n\nIt raises the question: How should the world respond?\n\nThe Global Response\n\nOne of the recommendations made by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry was to refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court, where Kim Jong-un and his officials would be held accountable for committing crimes against humanity.\n\nHere in the United States, Congress can take measures as well. In early February, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Calif.) and Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) introduced the bipartisan North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act. Unlike prior legislation, this bill has an important human rights focus that came about as a response to the U.N. Inquiry.\n\nThis legislation would make it so that the U.S. directly sanctions North Korea\u2014not just for its nuclear weapons proliferation, but also for the regime\u2019s ongoing human rights abuses, according to Enos.\n\nThis would ensure that the sanctions impact not the suffering North Koreans, but rather the regime itself.\n\nIn terms of human rights, the legislation involves studying the possibility of bringing cellular and Internet communications to the people of North Korea, the State Department investigating and shedding more light on the political prison camps, and the State Department identifying severe human rights abusers in North Korea.\n\n\u201cIt is past time to hold Pyongyang\u2019s elites responsible for their actions,\u201d Engel said in a press release. \u201cThis bipartisan legislation would strengthen U.S. sanctions and close loopholes used by the Kim Regime to profit from illicit activities.\u201d\n\nLee has some ideas of her own for policy changes that could benefit North Koreans.\n\nAs it stands now, Chinese policy is to forcibly repatriate any North Korean defectors they catch, releasing the refugees back into the hands of the aggressor nation. Upon returning, the defectors face harsh punishment in the kwanliso\u2014torture, starvation, execution\u2014as do their families. This is the biggest problem for defectors, Lee explained.\n\nChina is the only path to South Korea, where defectors are granted automatic citizenship due to their asylum status. Throughout their escape journey to South Korea, North Koreans fear for their safety in China, the possibility of being sent back to a wretched life always looming.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t catch them,\u201d Lee pleaded to the Chinese government while speaking at an event Wednesday at the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to stay in China; they want to come to South Korea for asylum. I don\u2019t ask for [China] to give ID cards or citizenship, it\u2019s too much for them. At least stop trying to catch them,\u201d she begged.\n\nNo matter how the world chooses to combat this humanitarian crisis, North Korean defectors and policy experts alike advocate for an urgent and effective response from the international community.\n\nBruce Klingner, senior research fellow of Northeast Asia in the Asian Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation, urged the world to stand up to the Kim regime in an issue brief last year, writing that there \u201cshould be widespread international outrage against the horrors systemically perpetuated on the North Korean people by their leaders.\u201d\n\n\u201cTime is running out for the North Korean people, but too many have already perished as the world turned its back,\u201d Klingner warned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hyeonseo Lee describes North Korean propaganda, explains living under the Kim regime, and raises awareness of the human rights abuses in her home country.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Hyeonseo Lee describes North Korean propaganda, explains living under the Kim regime, and raises awareness of the human rights abuses in her home country.", "title": "What Is Life Really Like in North Korea?
