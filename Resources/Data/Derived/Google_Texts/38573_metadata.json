The 27-year-old Willett made six birdies and no bogeys on the final day and finished with weekend rounds of 65 and 66 for an 18-under-par total of 270 at Gary Player Country Club.\n\n\u201cJust one of them weeks where the swing felt good and it came off,\u201d said Willett, who had just three bogeys all week.\n\nThe former top-ranked Donald, seeking a first title in more than a year, couldn\u2019t quite celebrate his 37th birthday in style and ended with a 73 with four bogeys. He was six shots behind Willett.\n\n\u201cA lot of positives,\u201d Donald said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to put myself back in position. I could have played a bit better but I still would have had to shoot 5 under just to tie with Danny.\u201d\n\nWillett trailed Donald by one heading into the final round, but had three birdies in his first five holes on Sunday to surge ahead and he led to the end.\n\nWillett\u2019s chasers had a glimpse of hope when he missed the green at No. 14, leaving himself with a tricky chip over a bunker back to the hole. But the former top-ranked European amateur recovered so well that he still made birdie, and Fisher and Donald saw their hopes slip away.\n\nWillett shoots to the top of the new European Order of Merit standings.\n\nBehind Donald, Germany\u2019s Marcel Siem was alone in fourth on 9 under, Thailand\u2019s Kiradech Aphibarnrat was fifth and Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez completed a solid weekend with back-to-back 69s for sixth.\n\nFormer No. 1s Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer - both former Sun City champions - finished 2 over and 4 over respectively, well off the pace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Danny Willett spoiled Luke Donald's birthday with a final-round 66 to charge past his English compatriot and win the Nedbank Golf Challenge by four shots on Sunday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Danny Willett spoiled Luke Donald\u2019s birthday with a final-round 66 to charge past his English compatriot and win the Nedbank Golf Challenge by four shots on Sunday.", "title": "England\u2019s Danny Willett wins Nedbank Challenge", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/7/englands-danny-willett-wins-nedbank-challenge/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/07/66d950a6080b8f30670f6a706700e64c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/07/66d950a6080b8f30670f6a706700e64c.jpg", "description": "Danny Willett spoiled Luke Donald's birthday with a final-round 66 to charge past his English compatriot and win the Nedbank Golf Challenge by four shots on Sunday.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "England\u2019s Danny Willett wins Nedbank Challenge"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc482\"", "article_summary": "Willett claimed his second European Tour title ahead of Ross Fisher (68), while overnight leader Donald slipped to third in an all-English top three at Sun City.\nSUN CITY, South Africa (AP) - Danny Willett spoiled Luke Donald\u2019s birthday with a final-round 66 to charge past his English compatriot and win the Nedbank Golf Challenge by four shots on Sunday.\nBut the former top-ranked European amateur recovered so well that he still made birdie, and Fisher and Donald saw their hopes slip away.\n\u201cJust one of them weeks where the swing felt good and it came off,\u201d said Willett, who had just three bogeys all week.\nHe was six shots behind Willett."}
