These enterprising women, who met for the first time over lunch in 2009, shared a similar vision: to help homeless mothers become self-sufficient by training them for jobs in the hospitality business.\n\n\u201cChildren and hunger is an important issue to me,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cWe live in one of the richest agricultural regions in the world and there shouldn\u2019t be a child in our area whose mother is worried that there\u2019s nothing for breakfast tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAfter visiting a rehabilitative program in San Francisco called Delancey Street, Steeb recognized that training formerly homeless mothers enrolled in St. John\u2019s program to work in a real restaurant would be an important component to helping them provide for their own children eventually.\n\n\u201cThey are homeless, not helpless,\u201d she said.\n\nWithin six months of that initial meeting, Plates Caf\u00e9 & Catering opened in an old Army commissary building, where it operates rent-free, thanks to a compassionate landlord who charges only for utilities and maintenance.\n\nTrue to the founders\u2019 vision, Plates is staffed by women served by St. John\u2019s who clock in an average of 600 to 1,200 hours of training in preparing, cooking and serving breakfast and lunch to patrons, as well as filling orders for catering events, which generates the majority of Plates\u2019 revenues.\n\nWhile they don\u2019t earn money during their vocational training, they don\u2019t have many expenses, either. St. John\u2019s provides shelter, meals and child care. And Thunder Valley Casino, owned by the United Auburn Indian Community, offers a free shuttle service to the women. Steeb said these much-needed services remove barriers to steady employment so women can focus on completing the program and finding work in hospitality in order to become self-sufficient someday.\n\nAnd the program is working wonders. Just ask 46-year-old Cynthia Bailey. In 2012, Bailey came to St. John\u2019s as a homeless mother, addicted to drugs and alcohol. Today, she is clean and sober, and life looks promising. She and her 12-year-old son recently moved into their own apartment, subsidized by the shelter. She is training at Plates as a server and to her great surprise, discovered through art classes at St. John\u2019s that she is a gifted artist.\n\n\u201cI never knew I had this talent,\u201d Bailey said. Her artwork hangs on a wall at Plates, along with works by other women. \u201cThis program has given me so many blessings and rewards. It empowers me and I want to keep moving forward.\u201d\n\nMary Scott, the sous chef at Plates, is another success story. In 2010, she left an abusive relationship in another part of the state where she owned a Mexican restaurant and gas station deli, and moved into St. John\u2019s shelter to start anew.\n\nAfter taking part in Plates\u2019 six-month vocational training, Scott, who said she felt right at home in the restaurant business, was hired as the sous chef. Now it\u2019s her job to teach other women how to cook and prepare dishes for customers.\n\n\u201cThis program saved my life. Now I\u2019m self-sufficient, renting a house and saving up to buy a condo in the area,\u201d she said.\n\nRunning the daily show at Plates and Plates2Go is General Manager Susan Wagner, who is in her element. Before moving to Sacramento, Wagner managed a chain of five restaurants in the Bay Area. \u201cI have a big passion for this business because food is the celebration of life,\u201d she said.\n\nManaging Plates has been a dream job for this natural-born hostess, who said she fell in love with the women immediately. \u201cTo watch the human spirit come back to life is like watering a plant that has wilted,\u201d Wagner said her work with the women of St. John\u2019s is similar to the seeds she plants in her own garden:\n\n\u201cYou water them and they\u2019ll grow; you nurture them and they will produce. It feels so great to be in that environment.\u201d\n\nLynn Armitage has a lot on her plate, too. She is a single mother in Northern California and an enrolled member of the Oneida Tribe of Indians of Wisconsin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Sacramento, California, there is a very special restaurant called \u201cPlates Caf\u00e9 & Catering.\u201d What makes Plates different from other eateries are the people who", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/12/notes-single-mom-restaurant-serves-inspiration-homeless-mothers-153072", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/cynthia3.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Notes From a Single Mom: Restaurant Serves Inspiration for Homeless Mothers"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-12T11:00-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/12/notes-single-mom-restaurant-serves-inspiration-homeless-mothers-153072", "dc": {"title": "Notes From a Single Mom: Restaurant Serves Inspiration for Homeless Mothers"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Notes From a Single Mom: Restaurant Serves Inspiration for Homeless Mothers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd65f0\"", "article_summary": "In 2012, Bailey came to St. John\u2019s as a homeless mother, addicted to drugs and alcohol.\nSt. John\u2019s provides shelter, meals and child care.\nIn 2010, she left an abusive relationship in another part of the state where she owned a Mexican restaurant and gas station deli, and moved into St. John\u2019s shelter to start anew.\nIn Sacramento, California, there is a very special restaurant called \u201cPlates Caf\u00e9 & Catering.\u201d What makes Plates different from other eateries are the people who work there: homeless mothers served by St. John\u2019s Shelter for Women and Children.\nPlates is the brainchild of Michelle Steeb, CEO for the shelter, and Bobbin Mulvaney, co-owner of a restaurant and catering company in Sacramento."}
