Most of the Pacers Sports & Entertainment offices also will move to the center, allowing future re-purposing and modernization of current space in Bankers Life Fieldhouse.\n\n\n\nPacers spokesman Bill Benner said the former fieldhouse office space could be transformed into some type of public space.\n\n\n\nThe new 130,000-square-foot facility will be built in a pie-shaped space on Delaware Street immediately east of the fieldhouse and adjacent to the Virginia Avenue Parking Garage. The space is currently an employee parking lot.\n\n\n\nPacers officials said the team will pay the costs to construct and operate the $50 million facility while paying the Capital Improvement Board, a municipal corporation, $1 per year in rent for the land usage. CIB unanimously approved using the land for the project on Monday.\n\n\n\nIt remains unclear whether the facility will be subject to property taxes. That issue, said CIB attorney Toby McClamroch, \u201cwould be between the Pacers, the assessor and the City-County Council.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe current practice court in Bankers Life Fieldhouse will still be used by the Indiana Fever. But with the Pacers moving their practices and training across the street, the fieldhouse space will be free for more diversified uses, Pacers officials said. Many events, such as the Big Ten basketball tournaments, use the current practice court for media and other purposes.\n\n\n\nThe new facility will be key in attracting top-flight NBA free agents and retaining the Pacers' current stars, Benner said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know this facility will be a great addition for all of us and everyone at Pacers Sports & Entertainment,\u201d Pacers President of Basketball Operations Larry Bird said in a prepared statement.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited about the joint venture with St. Vincent. We see some major synergies between the two companies working together, especially in the same building,\" Bird said. \"This is a state-of-the-art facility that helps a small-market team compete for top talent in a very competitive business.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Indiana Pacers\u2019 new five-story training venue will be called the St. Vincent Center and include a facility on the fifth floor where primary care, cardiovascular and sports performance services will be provided for athletes of all ages and the general public.
