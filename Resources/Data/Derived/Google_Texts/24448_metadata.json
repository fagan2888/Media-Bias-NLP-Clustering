Even retirees eligible for Medicare end up spending a large chunk of their income getting or staying healthy.\n\nA recent report from the Employee Benefit Research Institute finds that average out-of-pocket recurring medical expenses for retirees are around $1,855 per year, not including hospital stays or nursing home care. That means the average 65-year-old retiree needs to have at least $40,000 saved just to cover those expenses.\n\nA typical couple would need nearly $250,000 on hand to have a 90 percent chance of covering all their medical expenses in retirement.\n\nThat\u2019s a jarring number for many workers who are starting to think about retirement, planners say. \u201cYou think you have a lot of money for retirement, but when you set aside the money you\u2019ll need for health care, you may not have as much left as you think,\u201d says Don Roy of New England Wealth Advisors.\n\nSeven in 10 couples over age 50 have not discussed how much they\u2019ll need to save to pay for health care in retirement, according to a recent study by Merrill Lynch and Age Wave.\n\nHere are some strategies to help you prepare:\n\nEstimate your costs. EBRi\u2019s $250,000 for a couple estimate is roughly in line with that of other think tanks, but it\u2019s worth getting a more personalized estimate of health care costs. Enter information about your age, health and family history into an online calculator, like this one from AARP to get a ballpark sense of what your medical expenses may look like in retirement.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re far short of your projected need, start making changes now so that you\u2019re not caught unprepared later. \u201cThat might mean that instead of taking a cruise or an extra vacation, you might need to save that money for your long-term health expenses and get those things tucked away beforehand,\u201d says Bank of America Merrill Lynch adviser Mary McDougall.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: 5 Shocking Predictions About Retirement in America\n\nMax out your HSA. If you have access to a high-deductible health plan at work (a growing number of employers are offering them) you also get access to a health savings account. Individuals can put up to $3,350 into an HSA this year, and families can contribute up to $6,650. Those over age 50 can add another $1,000.\n\nThe money put into an HSA is deposited pre-tax, grows tax free, and it\u2019s withdrawn tax-free as well, as long as you use it for qualified medical expenses. The money rolls over every year (unlike an FSA), so there\u2019s an opportunity to grow a really sizeable account. \u201cRight now, the HSA is the most tax efficient savings vehicle we have in the United States,\u201d says James Nichols, head of advice for Voya Financial.\n\n\n\nGet elective procedures done before your retire.\n\nMedicare plans or private plans purchased via the Obamacare exchanges tend to be less generous than employer plans for non-essential benefits such as dental or vision coverage. If you\u2019ve got a great employer plan, make the most of it before you hang up your work clothes for good. Schedule expensive dental work before you say goodbye to your boss for good.\n\n\n\nFocus on getting healthy. It\u2019s good advice anyway, but keeping active and fit, watching what you eat, and getting regular preventive treatment will help keep your medical expenses down in retirement.Retirees suffering from chronic conditions can expect to spend more than $300,000 on medical costs in retirement, more than twice the estimate for healthy individuals.\n\n\n\nKeeping healthy will not only keep your costs down, but it will also make your retirement more enjoyable. The vast majority of retirees (81 percent) cite health as the most important agreement to a happy retirement, according to the Merrill Lynch study, putting it ahead of financial security or having loving family and friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: Out-of-pocket Medical Costs Threaten Seniors\n\nConsider long-term care insurance. One of the biggest medical expenses\u2014and one of the most unpredictable-- for retirees is a nursing home stay, which can easily run more than $50,000 per year. Planners say that long-term care insurance can be a good way to hedge against these costs, for some consumers.\n\n\n\nAt more than $2,000 per year, LTCI doesn\u2019t come cheap, however. It can be a smart move for those with more than $500,000 in assets (enough to be worth protecting) but less than $5 million (enough to self-insure). Look for a plan from a high-rated insurer that includes an inflation rider. The younger you are when you purchase it, the lower your premiums will be.\n\n\n\nBecome a smart shopper. It\u2019s becoming easier to make informed decisions about the cost of your healthcare, especially if you\u2019ve got a high deductibles and copays. Do some research to see whether you can get a procedure done more cheaply by a different doctor or hospital, and consider switching to generic drugs to lower expenses.\n\n\n\nHave an end-of-life plan. The largest portion of medical expenses tends to come in the months before the end of your life. Studies have shown that patients with advanced medical directives (legally binding documents outlining their wishes when it comes to end-stage medical treatment), tend to have lower medical bills during that time. \u201cIf you\u2019re plugged in, but you don\u2019t want to be, you\u2019re sapping all your money,\u201d says certified financial planner David Jackson.\n\nUpdate: This article has been corrected to reflect the cost of out-of-pocket recurring medical expenses for retirees.\n\n\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you think you\u2019re spending a lot on health care now, just wait until you retire.", "title": "How Medical Expenses Could Derail Your Retirement", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/24/How-Medical-Expenses-Could-Derail-Your-Retirement", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11282010_medical_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/24/How-Medical-Expenses-Could-Derail-Your-Retirement", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11282010_medical_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If you think you\u2019re spending a lot on health care now, just wait until you retire.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a16\"", "article_summary": "A typical couple would need nearly $250,000 on hand to have a 90 percent chance of covering all their medical expenses in retirement.\nThe largest portion of medical expenses tends to come in the months before the end of your life.\nUpdate: This article has been corrected to reflect the cost of out-of-pocket recurring medical expenses for retirees.\nEnter information about your age, health and family history into an online calculator, like this one from AARP to get a ballpark sense of what your medical expenses may look like in retirement.\nWhile many expenses tend to decline in retirement, the money spent on healthcare isn\u2019t one of them."}
