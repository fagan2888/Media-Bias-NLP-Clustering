The President has a new batch of fans thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and it\u2019s \u201cHookers for Obama\u201d now.\n\nThe \u201cindependent contractors\u201d \u2014 prostitutes \u2014 at the Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Carson City, Nev., used to be virtually uninsurable because insurance companies classified them as \u201cillegal working girls,\u201d many of whom had high rates of getting sexually transmitted diseases or AIDS, Nevada\u2019s News 10 reported. But the Affordable Care Act solves all of their problems, and for the first time, receiving health coverage is a possibility.\n\n\u201cThey just, they absolutely equate us to illegal working girls that have very high rates of STDs and AIDS,\u201d Caressa Kisses,a Bunny Ranch prostitute, told News 10. \u201cAnd so, since they group us into the illegal working girls, they just deny us. I mean, I have the best care insurance in the world, but that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s covered.\u201d\n\nBut starting January 1, insurance companies will no longer be able to deny these independent contractors access to health insurance. And many prostitutes at the Bunny Ranch view Obamacare as a blessing.\n\n\u201cSo it is truly a miracle because it is harder for us to get health insurance because not everyone understands our profession and agree with that we do,\u201d Bunny Ranch independent contractor Bella Dawn said.\n\nBrothels are illegal across all 50 states except for in eight counties in Nevada, which is the only state to allow legal prostitution. However, it must be in the form of a regulated brothel like the Moonlite Bunny Ranch.\n\nBut while Obamacare is praised by Bunny Ranch\u2019s prostitutes, its owner, Dennis Hof, views the law as a double-edged sword.\n\nIn addition to his working girls \u2014 who can receive health coverage \u2014 Hof also employs abut 150 non-prostitute employees across his several businesses. Under the employer mandate, Hof must not provide them all with health insurance, an endeavor that is expected to cost him about $250,000 per year.\n\nStill, Hof is happy for what the law does for his working girls.\n\n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s hookers for Obama,\u201d Hof said, \u201cbecause they appreciate what he\u2019s done and Obamacare works for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Move over, Moms for Obama.
