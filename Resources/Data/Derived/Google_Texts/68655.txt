× Hillary Clinton speaks at campaign event in Indianapolis

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. — Hillary Clinton attended a “Get Out and Vote” event in Indianapolis Sunday.

The event started at 12:30 p.m. at Douglas Park Gymnasium at 1616 East 25th Street.

Clinton discussed a variety of things including her plans to raise incomes for Hoosier families and break down barriers that hold many communities back.

She touched on the topic of jobs, saying she wants to have a manufacturing renaissance. She also wants more vocational programs in schools, because she says not every body chooses to go to college.

If elected, Clinton says she will continue some of the things President Obama has done in office.

“I don’t think President Obama gets the credit for digging us out of the ditch we were in,” said Clinton.

She says she’s going to stick with the Affordable Care Act put into place during Obama’s time in office, but she plans to improve it and make care less expensive.

Clinton says she will work to end discrimination against the LGBT community and defend a woman’s rights to make her own health care decisions. Clinton also says she will “take on the gun lobby to help bring an end to the epidemic of gun violence.”

She ended her speech saying, “If you go out and vote for me, I will fight for you throughout this campaign and into the White House.”
