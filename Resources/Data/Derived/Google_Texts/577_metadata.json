Frank sang to you \u2013 not at you. I never wanted to be a singer that sings at somebody. I\u2019ve always wanted to sing to somebody.\u201d\n\nDylan was asked by the seniors\u2019 publication if he thought the album was \u201crisky,\u201d because some fans will say it will fail to match up to Sinatra, to which he replied:\n\nRisky? Like walking across a field laced with land mines? Or working in a poison gas factory? There\u2019s nothing risky about making records. Comparing me with Frank Sinatra? You must be joking. To be mentioned in the same breath as him must be some sort of high compliment. As far as touching him goes, nobody touches him. Not me or anyone else.\n\n\u201cShadows in the Night\u201d will officially be released on Feb. 3.\n\nListen to Dylan\u2019s version of \u201cStay with Me\u201d below:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Iconic musician Bob Dylan recently opened up to AARP Magazine in a wide-ranging interview about his new album of Frank Sinatra covers and has now revealed he will give away the record for free to thousands of seniors.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Iconic musician Bob Dylan recently opened up to AARP Magazine in a wide-ranging interview about his new album of Frank Sinatra covers and has now revealed he will give away the record for free to thousands of seniors.", "title": "50,000 Seniors to Receive Free Copy of New Bob Dylan Album", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Bob-Dylan-AARP-The-Magazine-Cover.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/01/24/bob-dylan-to-give-away-new-album-to-50-thousand-senior-citizens/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Iconic musician Bob Dylan recently opened up to AARP Magazine in a wide-ranging interview about his new album of Frank Sinatra covers and has now revealed he will give away the record for free to thousands of seniors.", "title": "50,000 Seniors to Receive Free Copy of New Bob Dylan Album", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Bob-Dylan-AARP-The-Magazine-Cover.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "AARP, Bob Dylan, senior citizens, Shadows in the Night,Big Hollywood,Bob Dylan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Shadows in the Night", "published_time": "2015-01-24T11:52:59-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn his first interview in three years, Dylan told AARP about the album, which will be released next month.\nComparing me with Frank Sinatra?\nWondering Sound is now reporting that 50,000 of AARP\u2019s subscribers will be chosen at random to receive a free copy of Shadows in the Night, which is composed entirely of Sinatra renditions.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIconic musician Bob Dylan recently opened up to AARP Magazine in a wide-ranging interview about his new album of Frank Sinatra covers and has now revealed he will give away the record for free to thousands of seniors.\n\u201cPeople talk about Frank all the time,\u201d Dylan said."}
