Perhaps you think about your favorite brand, or celebrations with friends where having a beer made a good time better.\n\nBut have you ever thought about the thousands of people involved \u2013 literally from grains to glass \u2013 that are at work brewing and delivering you that beer?\n\nWith roots dating back to 1862, the Beer Institute has advocated on behalf of brewers, beer importers and beer drinkers for generations. We want to remind Members of Congress \u2013 and their staff \u2013 that when they enjoy a beer, they are supporting a unique industry with deep ties to American history, culture and the economy.\n\nToday's brewing industry represents an often overlooked part of the nation's economy. More than two million Americans are at work because of beer \u2014 from farmers to factory workers, brewers to bartenders.\n\nIn fact, for every one job at the brewery or beer importer, there are another 45 jobs created in other industries: agriculture, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, warehousing, transportation, concessions and retail, just to name a few.\n\nAll told, the economic contribution from beer provides more than $246 billion to the country's bottom line. We already contribute more than $49 billion in federal, state and local taxes.\n\nAnd those two million workers collect $79 billion in wages and benefits, with the average line worker in a major U.S. brewer earned more than $88,000 annually. These are good jobs, and they run deep through our workforce.\n\nWhen the next Congress convenes, we urge them to go to work finding common ground, whether blue state or red state, whether freshman Member of veteran incumbent. Perhaps they could find that common ground over the simple but celebratory experience of meeting together over a beer. Doing so would go a long way to celebrating the two million Americans who worked to put that beer in their hand.\n\nFor more information about brewers, beer importers and industry suppliers, please visit www.BeerInstitute.org.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Going Beyond the Bottle: How Beer Contributes to the Economy", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2014-12-04T16:51-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "title": "Going Beyond the Bottle: How Beer Contributes to the Economy", "url": "http://thehill.com/sponsored/content/225694-going-beyond-the-bottle-how-beer-contributes-to-the-economy", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-04T16:51:24-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "the Beer Institute", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/sponsored/content/225694-going-beyond-the-bottle-how-beer-contributes-to-the-economy", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-02T10:20-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mariann Szucs", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-02T10:20:44-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-04T16:51:24-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/sponsored/content/225694-going-beyond-the-bottle-how-beer-contributes-to-the-economy", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Going Beyond the Bottle: How Beer Contributes to the Economy"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd32b2\"", "article_summary": "With roots dating back to 1862, the Beer Institute has advocated on behalf of brewers, beer importers and beer drinkers for generations.\nFor more information about brewers, beer importers and industry suppliers, please visit www.BeerInstitute.org.\nMore than two million Americans are at work because of beer \u2014 from farmers to factory workers, brewers to bartenders.\nPerhaps you think about your favorite brand, or celebrations with friends where having a beer made a good time better.\nDoing so would go a long way to celebrating the two million Americans who worked to put that beer in their hand."}
