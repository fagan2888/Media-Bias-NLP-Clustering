In Faulkner County, unofficial numbers show 62 percent of county voters (20,878) supported the Issue 5 ballot measure with 38 percent against (12,561).\n\nThe state\u2019s minimum wage will increase to $8 per hour on Jan. 1, 2016 and to $8.50 per hour on Jan. 1, 2017.\n\nAccording to the Arkansas Department of Labor, employers with four or more employees must currently pay at least $6.25 per hour, though employers with more than $500,000 each year in business must pay the federal minimum wage, $7.25 per hour.\n\nThe federal minimum wage was last increased from $6.55 per hour in 2008 to $7.25 per hour in 2009, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nOne of Conway\u2019s largest employers, Conway Regional Health System with about 1,330 employees, according to the Conway Development Corporation (CDC), doesn\u2019t foresee a negative impact in the short term.\n\n\u201cConway Regional began planning two years ago in regards to making sure our employees are paid above the minimum wage and as a result, very few of our employees are currently working at that rate,\u201d Lori Ross Scroggin, corporate director of marketing and foundation at Conway Regional, said. \u201cWe anticipated the passage of the statewide proposal to increase the minimum wage and already have funds budgeted for next year to cover that expense.\u201d\n\nAnother one of the city\u2019s main sources for jobs is Conway Public Schools, which employs about 1,100 in the school district, according to the CDC.\n\nGreg Murry, superintendent of Conway Public Schools, said the district does not have \u201cany employee who is making at or less than $7.50 an hour, so there will be no impact on our budget this year.\u201d\n\nHe added that a lower wage impacts only a limited number of employees, with most receiving well above the minimum wage as faculty and staff.\n\nKyle Tabor, Blue Sail Coffee owner and founder, said the minimum wage\u2019s increase will likely have an impact on his business\u2019 profit margin, putting pressure on the coffee shop to pay more with greater chances for national chains such as Starbucks to succeed at a better rate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder for us to grow and our mission is to make a positive impact for the community,\u201d Tabor said, adding that Blue Sail positions itself to offer a unique atmosphere to the city.\n\nBlue Sail, which opened earlier this year as a community coffee shop in downtown Conway, currently has nine employees who are paid $7.25 per hour.\n\nLisa Covington, owner of The Patio Caf\u00e9, echoed a similar sentiment about concerns as another downtown coffee shop, though her worry lies more in what will happen in 2017.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing how it will be a positive but I\u2019m worried about when it gets to $8.50,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do struggle to pay what we do.\u201d\n\nCovington said she has to remain positive and supportive of the minimum wage increases overall impact to employees.\n\n\u201cYou have to think that way,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Patio Caf\u00e9 has 10 employees, with non-tip staff earning an average of $7.50 per hour. Tipped employees earn about $3 per hour. The employees alternate in shifts that she said cater to putting education first for college students.\n\nKen Vaughan, operating partner and COO of The Purple Cow Restaurant in Conway, said his business already pays employees \u201cwell over\u201d $8.50 an hour, not factoring in employees who receive less as tip staff.\n\n\u201cIn terms of how it\u2019s going to affect [Purple Cow] is yet to be determined,\u201d he said.\n\nOf the about 50 team members employed at Purple Cow in Conway, about half are non-tip employees.\n\nDuring this year\u2019s election, similar proposals to change state minimum wages were on the ballots in Alaska, increasing from $7.75 to $9.75 an hour by 2016; Nebraska, increasing from $7.25 to $9 an hour by 2016; and South Dakota, increasing from $7.25 to $8.50 per hour in 2015, with an increase based on inflation after that.\n\nVoters in each of the four states passed the wage increase measures.\n\n(Staff writer Brandon Riddle can be reached by email at brandon.riddle@thecabin.net, by phone at 505-1215 or on Twitter @BrandonCRiddle.
