(AP) - One of the two Waldo police chiefs suspended over the past month due to allegations of illegal ticket quotas has resigned.

The north Florida town this week agreed to allow the Alachua County Sheriff's Office to provide security.

Waldo Police Chief Michael Szabo was suspended Aug. 12 after a state investigation into the alleged quotas. The Ocala Star-Banner (http://bit.ly/1tB1ql2) reports that Szabo resigned Friday evening.

Szabo's interim replacement was suspended after a group of officers complained at a city council meeting about the illegal ticket quotas.

City Manager Kim Worley says the agreement with the sheriff's office gives her time to find a permanent replacement who does not currently work for the police department.

State authorities also are investigating the ticket quota and other alleged misconduct by Szabo.
