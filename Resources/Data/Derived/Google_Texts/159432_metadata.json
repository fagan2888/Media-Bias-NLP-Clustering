Part of the reason is historical \u2014 the U.S. health care model typically relied on employers as the decision makers.\n\nBut with the introduction of health-care exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, consumers now have the transparency and responsibility to make decisions for their well-being.\n\nAs this trend \u2013known in the industry as \u201cconsumerism\u201d\u2014accelerates, private equity firms have decided to come along for the ride, as we report in this month\u2019s issue of Private Equity Analyst.\n\nFirms like General Atlantic, H.I.G. Capital and Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe have made investments in client-facing urgent care centers, which cater to patients whose conditions aren\u2019t serious enough to warrant a visit to emergency rooms.\n\nBut consumerism also opens up a whole host of other investment opportunities for private equity.\n\nGenstar in 2010 acquired Netsmart Technologies Inc., which provides software that helps mental health and substance abuse treatment agencies and psychiatric hospitals with electronic health records and data analytics.\n\nMeanwhile, Baird Capital backed Myelin Health Communications Inc., which helps health-care service providers with branding.\n\n\u201cProviders historically viewed advertising as unnecessary,\u201d said Michael Bernstein, a Baird Capital partner. That\u2019s because up to this point, \u201cinsurers, employers and managed-care organizations made the decisions for employees and members about which health-care providers they are going to be able to access.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in the early, early innings of consumerism,\u201d said Roman Margolin, a principal at Genstar Capital. \u201cThis purchasing dynamic is going to continue in the next three to four years.\u201d\n\nFor a trial subscription to Private Equity Analyst, visit the homepage, scroll to the bottom and click \u201ctry for free.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "As the trend of \"consumerism\" accelerates, private equity firms have decided to come along for the ride.", "title": "PE Tracks the Rise of Health Care \u2018Consumerism\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/12/29/pe-tracks-the-rise-in-health-care-consumerism/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "PE Tracks the Rise of Health Care \u2018Consumerism\u2019", "description": "As the trend of \"consumerism\" accelerates, private equity firms have decided to come along for the ride.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Amy Or", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "As the trend of \"consumerism\" accelerates, private equity firms have decided to come along for the ride.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-12-29T12:30:34-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/12/29/pe-tracks-the-rise-in-health-care-consumerism/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-17829", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "As the trend of \"consumerism\" accelerates, private equity firms have decided to come along for the ride.", "title": "PE Tracks the Rise of Health Care \u2018Consumerism\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2014/12/29/pe-tracks-the-rise-in-health-care-consumerism/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-17829", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-12-26T22:24:26-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Part of the reason is historical \u2014 the U.S. health care model typically relied on employers as the decision makers.\nHealth care has lagged retail services by a wide margin when it comes to customer engagement.\nAs this trend \u2013known in the industry as \u201cconsumerism\u201d\u2014accelerates, private equity firms have decided to come along for the ride, as we report in this month\u2019s issue of Private Equity Analyst.\nBut consumerism also opens up a whole host of other investment opportunities for private equity.\nMeanwhile, Baird Capital backed Myelin Health Communications Inc., which helps health-care service providers with branding."}
