(Brandon Hopper / Daily Record)\n\nGetting five wrestlers to the finals on Saturday night wasn't expected by Tigers head coach Duff Seaney.\n\nDropping all five, well, he knew that was a possibility.\n\nGaven Guess, Caleb Coffey, Anthony Abbott, Cody Killis and Blake Repshire all made championship-match appearances in the Ca\u00f1on City Invitational, but each one fell short.\n\nThe Tigers had a 12-point team lead on Pueblo Centennial heading into the final round, but Guess', Coffey's and Repshire's losses were to Bulldog wrestlers. That was enough for Centennial to take home the team title.\n\n\"Its's kind of the story of the finals this year,\" Seaney said. \"We just can't find a way. But honestly, we're the team of overachievers, really. Just getting to the finals with that many kids is a pretty big accomplishment for us. We're just medium. We're a bunch of medium kids, and we seem to find a way to win and get some points but can't get over the hump at the end.\n\nThe Tigers were underdogs in all five of their championship matches. Nineteenth-ranked Guess lost to 13th-ranked Jair Flores (Centennial); unranked Coffey suffered an injury default to Centennial's ninth-ranked James Engle; tenth-ranked Abbott lost to third-ranked Ladd Bunker (Erie); unranked Killis lost to Swink's second-ranked Brody Wisemon; and eighth-ranked Repshire was pinned by Centennial's fourth-ranked Demitrius Miller.\n\nOn Deck Wednesday: Ca\u00f1on City vs. Pueblo West, 6:30 p.m.* Friday: Ca\u00f1on City @ Garden City Invite Saturday: Ca\u00f1on City @ Garden City Invite Feb. 8: Ca\u00f1on City hosts Tiger Quad, 9 a.m. * South-Central League dual\n\nIt was Repshire's first time being in a championship match of an individual tournament, he said. It's fresh off Seaney's decision to move him from 195s to 220s. He still weighs around 195, so he gives up weight, but he said he thinks the success he had on Saturday solidifies his decision that it was the right move.\n\n\"I fell like it's a great move for me to move up to 220s,\" he said.\n\nGuess lost a decision in his finals match, but bled form his nose virtually the entire time. Coffey's loss was controversial. Engle slammed him to the mat and the Tigers felt it was illegal. Coffey stayed on the mat for a few minutes.\n\nThe Tigers will host Pueblo West in the team's final South-Central League dual at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/canoncity-sports/ci_24994514/ca-city-tigers-fail-finish-home-tourney-pleased", "modificationDate": "2014-01-25T21:14:18-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0125/20140125__27drcwrw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Brandon Hopper \n \n  hopperb@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Getting five wrestlers to the finals on Saturday  night wasn't expected by Tigers head coach Duff Seaney.
