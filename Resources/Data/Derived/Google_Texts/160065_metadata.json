These people will be repatriated to Haiti at the earliest opportunity.\"\n\nHe said that the search for casualties had concluded for Wednesday, although a \"scaled down search\" would begin again on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard deployed two helicopters to the scene after local authorities requested help, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Sabrina Laberbesque said. Two fast-response vessels from Florida Coast Guard bases were also dispatched.\n\nDozens of Haitians have died in similar accidents in recent years, as many seek to escape an island still reeling from the devastating 2010 earthquake.\n\nIn November, at least 30 Haitian migrants drowned when their overloaded boat capsized off the southern Bahamas. Eleven Haitian migrants died in June 2012 when a boat carrying 28 people from the Bahamas to Florida sank.\n\nTurks and Caicos are about 120 miles north of Haiti in the northern Caribbean Sea.\n\nReuters contributed to this report", "article_metadata": {"description": "Seventeen migrants died early Wednesday when their overloaded boat capsized off the Turks and Caicos Islands as it was being towed to port by the authorities.\nA spokesman for the British territory's government said that 33 others were pulled from the wate", "title": "Haitian migrant boat capsizes off Turks and Caicos, killing 17 - World News", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Seventeen migrants died early Wednesday when their overloaded boat capsized off the Turks and Caicos Islands as it was being towed to port by the authorities.\nA spokesman for the British territory's government said that 33 others were pulled from the wate", "title": "Haitian migrant boat capsizes off Turks and Caicos, killing 17", "url": "http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/25/22047519-haitian-migrant-boat-capsizes-off-turks-and-caicos-killing-17", "image": "http://cdn.lib.newsvine.com/chrome/worldnewsfranchise/images/defaultog.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": 22047519, "section": "{\"domainName\":\"worldnews\",\"displayName\":\"World News\",\"avatar\":\"http:\\/\\/nvcdn.nbcnews.com\\/_vine\\/images\\/av\\/30x30\\/group.gif\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/worldnews.nbcnews.com\\/\",\"type\":\"group\",\"ass\":\"\",\"groupId\":\"6784\",\"articleCount\":\"9180\",\"seedCount\":\"70617\",\"memberCount\":\"35\",\"description\":\"\",\"createDate\":1311293760,\"groupType\":null,\"groupTypeId\":\"5\",\"blessed\":0,\"lastPub\":1464202580,\"isEnabled\":1}", "author": "World News", "trackData": "{\"section\":\"World news\",\"subSection\":\"worldnewsfranchise\",\"sitePageId\":\"a22047519\",\"headline\":\"Haitian migrant boat capsizes off Turks and Caicos, killing 17\",\"pageSource\":\"World News\",\"typeName\":\"Story\",\"byline\":\"World News\",\"tags\":[\"immigration\",\"haiti\",\"caribbean\",\"turks-and-caicos\"],\"seedSource\":\"\"}", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"asap\", \"load_pers\":\"1\"}", "cip": "104.96.220.204", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "date": "May 25, 2016, 12:50 pm", "server": "web02", "nv": {"contentId": 22047519, "contentType": "n"}, "canonical": "http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/12/25/22047519-haitian-migrant-boat-capsizes-off-turks-and-caicos-killing-17"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7782\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard deployed two helicopters to the scene after local authorities requested help, U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Sabrina Laberbesque said.\nEleven Haitian migrants died in June 2012 when a boat carrying 28 people from the Bahamas to Florida sank.\n\"I can confirm that 33 people were detained as suspected illegal Haitian immigrants,\" said Colin Farquhar, of the Royal Turks and Caicos Island Police Force.\nIn November, at least 30 Haitian migrants drowned when their overloaded boat capsized off the southern Bahamas.\nSeventeen migrants died early Wednesday when their overloaded boat capsized off the Turks and Caicos Islands as it was being towed to port by the authorities."}
