In the case of director David O. Russell, his past and present selves probably wouldn\u2019t recognize each other. While always a well-regarded whirling dervish of creativity, post \u201cI Heart Huckabees\u201d \u2014 when leaked production footage showed the filmmaker fighting with and berating his actors \u2014 the filmmaker\u2019s then-reputation as a mercurial, bad boy director couldn\u2019t have been lower (this was,m of course, a film or two after George Clooney allegedly clocked him on the set of \u201cThree Kings\u201d; his legend was already growing).\n\nOn reflection, Russell now sounds like a completely different person. He's the celebrated, thrice-in-a-row Academy Award-nominated Best Director whose films seem like an instant ticket to award season success for himself and his actors (his last three films have 25 Oscar nominations between them, 11 of them for his casts). Maybe in another alternate universe, his narrative could have gone astray and a more downward trajectory could have followed. Or at least, a much more ruinous trajectory is potentially hinted at in \u201cAccidental Love,\u201d formerly known as \u201cNailed,\u201d a belatedly \u201cfinished\u201d comedy released against Russell\u2019s wishes \u2014 he disavowed the unfinished film, which has been cobbled together by the new owner Millennium Films and he negotiated to take his name off the picture. The director credit now goes to \u201cStephen Greene.\u201d\n\nA wacky, manic, and slapsticky comedy with a tone somewhere between an episode of \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d the movie from \"Greene\" is a bizarrely pitched political satire, health care comedy, and love story rolled into one, but has none of the sharp \u201cDaily Show\u201d or \u201cColbert Report\u201d wit you\u2019d expect. Written by Kristin Gore (Al Gore\u2019s daughter, who worked on \u201cFuturama\u201d if you want to get a sense of the madcap humor), \u201cAccidental Love\u201d centers on a waitress named Alice (Jessica Biel) who accidentally gets nailed in the head during a marriage proposal from her small town\u2019s sexiest cop, Scott (James Marsden). But without health insurance, Alice cannot afford the medical procedure to remove the nail from her head (which also causes crazy bouts of rage, sexual mania, and speaking in Portuguese), and her engagement begins to crumble thanks to her hedging-his-bets groom-to-be. Desperate and without options, she decides to go to Washington, DC in the hope that a young, idealist (but ultimately unscrupulous) congressman, Howard (Jake Gyllenhaal), can help her plight.\n\n\"Accidental Love\" has a rather large cast too. Aside from Gyllenhaal, Biel, and Marsden, the movie features Catherine Keener, Bill Hader, James Brolin, Paul Reubens, Kirstie Alley, Beverly D\u2019Angelo, and the now all-grown-up Olivia Crocicchia, who some will remember from Jason Reitman\u2019s \u201cMen, Women & Children\u201d (she plays a baby-ish Girl Scout troop leader in the film). Even James Caan was in the film, before he dropped out a few days after shooting. All that is to say, many were clamoring to work with Russell on his political satire, but nothing in this frenzied movie suggests his various comedic talents, both past and present.\n\nWatching the incoherent \u201cAccidental Love\u201d is akin to being high, but not really enjoying the trip. The movie whizzes by at a feverish, disjointed speed, but its hyper momentum and disorderly delivery is more disorienting than it is pleasant. Sequences jump from scene to scene with jarring dizziness and without rest notes or massaging transitions (most of which were never presumably shot). Tracy Morgan \u2014 who plays one of the motley crew health insurance-less wounded who make the pilgrimage to Washington \u2014 is perhaps best suited to the movie\u2019s zany tenor, but he hijacks every scene to the degree that he\u2019s either better-suited to the crazy rhythms or acting in a different movie, it\u2019s never quite clear.\n\n\u201cAccidental Love\u201d dives into every scene with screwball-ish fervor, but never attempts to credibly establish any relationships. Whether these scenes were excised from the final cut, or never scripted, we\u2019ll likely never know. Russell is a big Frank Capra acolyte, and one could see \u201cAccidental Love\u201d as his ode to \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington,\u201d added to the craziness of post-modern sitcoms and sketch comedies, but none of it gels remotely well.\n\nMarked by quick fades to black in scenes that seem unfinished, or at least had no transitional elements between them, \u201cAccidental Love\u201d is all over the map. But at the same time, it\u2019s perhaps less unfinished than we\u2019ve been lead to believe. Sure, it\u2019s rushed, hurried, feels stitched together in many parts, and yes, the infamous \u201cnailed\u201d scene was never shot and has been recreated thanks to the use of cheap CGI. But the nuts and bolts of the picture are there, including a beginning, middle, and fully completed ending, a semi-coherent story, and a through line. That\u2019s not to say \u201cAccidental Love\u201d isn\u2019t a compromised effort, it is, but perhaps the biggest problem is its execution.\n\nLaying blame at the feet of the hack-edit job done without the director feels reasonable enough. And yet, the humor, now dated, and satire, mostly scatterbrained, and toothlessness, suggests a project that was ill-conceived from the get-go (all those egregious Dutch angles in the first act were presumably not directed by someone else either). It\u2019s tempting to think Russell was happy this film fell apart and would never see the light of day (guess again).\n\nAt the same time, how fair is it to judge a movie that was shut down eight times during production and never actually 100% finished (for one, the producers tried to ransom the delinquent financiers, Capitol Films at the time, but purposely delaying the shooting of this critical scene in hopes it would force them to come through with the promised money). The seat-of-its-pants uncertainty of it all surely must have put extreme duress on filmmaker, crew, and cast. And who\u2019s to say, under regular circumstances this movie might have worked. Reshoots for one, could have certainly massaged passages that didn\u2019t work, and there are definitely several of examples of elements that would have never flown with Russell \u2014 score, music, corny non-diegetic sounds like a stop-the-needle record scratch, etc.\n\nLastly, in a post Obamacare nation, perhaps \u201cAccidental Love\u201d might have felt a little bit more relevant had it been released in 2008, but seven years later, it really feels like the socially-relevant equivalent of rocking a faux hawk today. It's untimely release of course does it no favors. The backstory of \u201cAccidental Love,\u201d aka \u201cNailed,\u201d is infinitely more fascinating that the movie itself, though the film is a depressing and cautionary tale about who you make movies with in Hollywood. While \u201cStephen Green\u2019s\u201d movie does contain the occasional laugh \u2014 James Marsden can be surprisingly sharp as the small town cop \u2014 \u201cAccidental Love\u201d is mostly a mess, a curiosity for fans, and a mangled misfire you'd understand anyone hoping to omit from their CV.
