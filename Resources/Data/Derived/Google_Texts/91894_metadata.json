If his sketch at Saturday night\u2019s White House Correspondents Dinner was any indication, he could be a shoo-in for a job as a brand ambassador.\n\nIf he gets bored with golf, that is.\n\nThe \u201cCouch Commander\u201d video was littered with references to companies and products. Vice President Joe Biden modeled his collection of aviators. Michelle Obama scolded her husband for using her iPhone for a disastrous Snapchat Obamacare PSA\u2014and then she went to SoulCycle. Former House Speaker John Boehner offered some advice\u2014\u201dStop sending me all these LinkedIn requests\u201d\u2014and reminisced on post-politician life: \u201cYesterday, I had a beer at 11:30 in the morning, and McDonald\u2019s serves breakfast all day long.\u201d He said he also \u201cfinally got the grand bargain on a sweet Chevy Tahoe,\u201d before offering Obama a cigarette.\n\nObama has said he plans to stay in D.C. for at least two years after his term ends.
