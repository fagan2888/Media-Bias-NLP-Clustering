In good weather, it\u2019s a blissful drive. Biscayne Bay is so near and bright that you can almost imagine you\u2019re at the wheel of a boat instead of a car. The mainland greets the highway with a crowded comb of skyscrapers, a fine and sharp introduction to the city of Miami.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable sight, though, is of the three pill-shaped islands just north of the causeway. Dredged to life in the 1920s by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, these tiny isles boast some of America\u2019s most extravagant houses. On Star Island, the westernmost of the three, a vacant lot sold for $10 million this summer. Homes command two to three times that much; neighbors include Sean Combs and Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\n\nWhat\u2019s unusual about Star Island, though, isn\u2019t the concentration of luxury, but its proximity to a busy highway. The alabaster colonnades and turquoise pools are there for the gawking, just 200 yards across the bay.\n\nIt\u2019s rare to come face to face with such heights of personal wealth in this country. The grandest homes are squired away, Biltmore-style, on large estates. The next class of mansions hides behind walls, gates or dense horticulture. Most wealthy Americans simply live in the suburbs, in the subtle but no less certain privacy of the periphery.\n\nThis is a relative peculiarity of the American city, whose gradual abandonment by the rich has little equivalent elsewhere in the world. By the late 20th century, cities like Cincinnati and Memphis had been abandoned by their downtown residential elite (and much of the middle class, too). In younger cities, like Phoenix and Houston, the rich never lived downtown to begin with. The economic historian Richard F. Muth has estimated that median income in American cities rises by 8 percent for every mile one moves away from downtown. Ten miles out, it has doubled.\n\nThis donut effect gives the American city a unique psychic aura: Poverty is more visible than wealth. When Jacob Riis wrote, a century ago, that one half of the world didn\u2019t know how the other half lived, he meant the rich didn\u2019t know much about the poor.\n\nToday, that statement could easily be inverted. For decades, the deteriorating brick hulks of public housing projects have broadcast the despair of inner-city poverty to suburban commuters. But the top end of the country\u2019s wealth spectrum has grown more and more obscure.\n\nOf course, Americans have for years tuned their televisions to shows like Cribs, Real Housewives, Keeping up with the Kardashians, and the rest. But those programs portray wealth as spectacle, as a kind of surreal fiction.\n\nEveryday extravagance is much less visible. The typical American city has no billion-dollar, 27-story residence looming over the skyline (like in Mumbai); few exclusive, central neighborhoods (like in London or Paris). The skylines here aren\u2019t dotted with private pools, like in Kuala Lumpur or Lima. Opulence lurks unseen.\n\nThat may be one reason Americans don\u2019t seem to rally around inequality as a political issue: It\u2019s hard to see. The tremendous concentration of wealth at the upper end of America\u2019s income spectrum isn\u2019t reflected in our daily experience of the world. On paper, this may be another Gilded Age. In person, it doesn\u2019t look like it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the United States, visions of poverty are much more commonplace than extreme wealth.
