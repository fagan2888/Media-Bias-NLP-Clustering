Carson\u2019s flat tax would apply only to income above 150 percent of the poverty level, meaning that a family of four would face almost no income taxes on the first $36,375 of earnings. Anyone below that level would pay what the campaign calls a \u201cde minimis\u201d amount of taxes, \u201cto treat everyone in America as citizen-owners.\u201d Many lower-income households would pay more in taxes than they do now. That\u2019s because the plan eliminates breaks such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, which currently allow about 45 percent of US households to pay no federal income tax.\n\nRead more\n\nClinton says January tax proposals will \u2018go beyond\u2019 Buffett Rule\n\nDemocratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton will unveil proposals this month that will \u201cgo beyond the Buffett Rule\u201d to raise the effective tax rates paid by the wealthiest Americans, wrote Jennifer Epstein of Bloomberg. \u201cAs president, I\u2019ll do what it takes to make sure the super-wealthy are truly paying their fair share,\u201d Clinton said in a statement responding to the IRS\u2019s release of new data on tax rates paid by the 400 wealthiest US households, which averaged 22.89 percent in 2013. She called billionaire Warren Buffett\u2019s plan, which would set the minimum effective tax rate for those earning $1 million per year at 30 percent, \u201cone idea that would help achieve greater fairness in our tax system.\u201d Clinton hinted at the coming proposals during a December campaign stop in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett endorsed her, saying then that she wanted to \u201cgo even further\u201d than his idea.\n\nRead more\n\n\u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 delay gives CFOs breathing room\n\nMaxwell Murphy of CFO Journal wrote that December\u2019s omnibus budget package containing a measure to delay a provision of the Affordable Care Act by two years is giving finance chiefs some extra time to prepare. The tax on high-cost employee health plans, or \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d puts employers on the hook for a 40 percent levy on any excess cost of health plans above certain thresholds. Even before the delay, many companies and municipalities had already begun to assess whether their plans would trigger additional payments and make preemptive changes to avoid it. \u201cIt gives companies a little more time if they hadn\u2019t taken it seriously,\u201d said Gary Claxton, vice president for the Kaiser Family Foundation. Many companies said they are concerned about a large tax bill for healthcare plans they provide. Some are moving to less expensive plans and shifting more of the cost to employees.\n\nRead more\n\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}\n\nFASB proposes to curb what companies must disclose\n\nGretchen Morgenson of the New York Times wrote that investor groups are none-too-thrilled with a Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) proposal that would effectively change the definition of materiality. Under the FASB\u2019s proposal, materiality will become a strictly legal concept identical to the definition cited by the US Supreme Court in securities fraud cases. In the new framework, information would be considered material if it was likely to be seen by a reasonable person as significantly altering the total mix of facts about a company. In practice, investors say, that change will not only set too high a bar for what is material information, but it will also effectively outsource to lawyers what is better left to auditors: disclosure decisions on accounting matters. \u201cFASB\u2019s proposal would be a sweeping change that would make financial statements much less valuable as a source of information for investors,\u201d said Amy Borrus, interim executive director at the Council of Institutional Investors.\n\nRead more\n\nMichael G. Oxley, co-author of anti-fraud legislation, dies at 71\n\nMichael Oxley, a former Ohio representative who helped write landmark anti-fraud legislation \u2013 the Sarbanes-Oxley Act \u2013 after a wave of corporate scandals that brought down Enron Corp. and WorldCom, died on Jan. 1 in McLean, Virginia, the Associated Press wrote. He was 71. Oxley, a Republican, left Congress in 2007 after 25 years in the House, where he devoted most of his time to issues involving corporate oversight and insurance protection. He led an effort to investigate Enron, the failed energy company, and helped create new accounting requirements in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which took effect in 2002. Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD) also sponsored the legislation. The law reshaped corporate oversight after accounting scandals in 2001 and 2002 at Enron, WorldCom, and other major corporations exposed inadequate internal controls and auditors who had become too cozy with the companies whose books they examined.\n\nRead more\n\nQuick Links:", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Jason Bramwell"}, "dcterms.title": "Bramwell's Lunch Beat: Carson\u2019s Tax Plan, Hillary Talks Taxes, Materiality Gripes", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Individuals"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "Bramwell's Lunch Beat: Carson\u2019s Tax Plan, Hillary Talks Taxes, Materiality Gripes", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/bramwells-lunch-beat-carsons-tax-plan-hillary-talks-taxes-materiality-gripes", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/tuesday_lunchbeat_alexandercreative.jpg?itok=uiWvavjb", "updated_time": "2016-01-05T10:45:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/bramwells-lunch-beat-carsons-tax-plan-hillary-talks-taxes-materiality-gripes", "card": "summary", "title": "Bramwell's Lunch Beat: Carson\u2019s Tax Plan, Hillary Talks Taxes, Materiality Gripes"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/individuals/bramwells-lunch-beat-carsons-tax-plan-hillary-talks-taxes-materiality-gripes", "dcterms.creator": "Jason Bramwell", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-05T10:45+00:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[\"Election\",\"Sarbanes-Oxley\"]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"Individuals\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"Individuals\",\"Tax\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_26148\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-05T16:56:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-05T16:57:10+00:00"}, "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "Individuals", "sft-tag": "Sarbanes-Oxley", "sft-date": "Jan 5th 2016", "sft-type": "Article", "sft-topic": "Tax", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-26148", "publishtime": "2016-01-05T16:56:12:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Jason Bramwell", "sft-title": "Carson Tax Plan, Hillary Talks Taxes, Materiality"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2de3\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s because the plan eliminates breaks such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, which currently allow about 45 percent of US households to pay no federal income tax.\nCarson\u2019s flat tax would apply only to income above 150 percent of the poverty level, meaning that a family of four would face almost no income taxes on the first $36,375 of earnings.\nMany companies said they are concerned about a large tax bill for healthcare plans they provide.\nThe tax on high-cost employee health plans, or \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d puts employers on the hook for a 40 percent levy on any excess cost of health plans above certain thresholds.\nRead moreClinton says January tax proposals will \u2018go beyond\u2019 Buffett RuleDemocratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton will unveil proposals this month that will \u201cgo beyond the Buffett Rule\u201d to raise the effective tax rates paid by the wealthiest Americans, wrote Jennifer Epstein of Bloomberg."}
