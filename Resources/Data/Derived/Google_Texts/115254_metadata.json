These include that moment when lightning hits a tree and transfers through the tree and the air to your body \u2014 this is called a side splash \u2014 or when you touch the metal body of your car, which is called conduction. For these reasons, we\u2019re often told to avoid hiding under a tree and to avoid contact with metal during these storms. But surprisingly, metal could be one of the best things to wear during a thunderstorm.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered about the best way to survive a lightning strike, look no further than the video from MinuteEarth above. Although well over 99 percent of us don\u2019t carry suits of armor in our trunks or backpacks \u2014 that\u2019s just speculation; there could be millions with these suits of armor lying around \u2014 the folks at MinuteEarth point to the fact that metal, being a great conductor for electricity, is likely to attract lightning. But because it\u2019s basically a shell, it directs the current through the metal and down into the ground, while passing around the person inside. The same can be said about a car, or a simple metal box, and these types of containers are known as Faraday cages.\n\nUnfortunately, not all of us have cars to protect us (especially here in New York City) and very few of us (I suspect) have suits of armor in our closets. So, if you\u2019re ever caught out in a thunderstorm, there are other ways to avoid being struck by lightning, or at the very least, suffer minimal harm. But for those, you can check out MinuteEarth\u2019s video.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "survive, lightning, strikes, wearing, metal, suits, standing, your, feet, close, together", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Being struck by lightning is definitely deadly, but by taking these steps in a thunderstorm, you might have a chance at survival.", "title": "How To Survive A Lightning Strike [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/survive-lightning-strikes-wearing-metal-suits-standing-your-feet-close-together-315630", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2014/12/28/survive-lightning-strikes-wearing-metal-suits-standing-your-feet-close-together.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Being struck by lightning is definitely deadly, but by taking these steps in a thunderstorm, you might have a chance at survival.", "title": "How To Survive A Lightning Strike [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/survive-lightning-strikes-wearing-metal-suits-standing-your-feet-close-together-315630", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2014/12/28/survive-lightning-strikes-wearing-metal-suits-standing-your-feet-close-together.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/28/survive-lightning-strikes-wearing-metal-suits-standing-your-feet-close-together.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2014-12-28T15:35:24-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-28T15:42:39-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Being struck by lightning is definitely deadly, but by taking these steps in a thunderstorm, you might have a chance at survival."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3169\"", "article_summary": "Although it\u2019s certainly possible to be directly struck by lightning during a thunderstorm, there are many other ways to be struck.\nFor these reasons, we\u2019re often told to avoid hiding under a tree and to avoid contact with metal during these storms.\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered about the best way to survive a lightning strike, look no further than the video from MinuteEarth above.\nSo, if you\u2019re ever caught out in a thunderstorm, there are other ways to avoid being struck by lightning, or at the very least, suffer minimal harm.\nBut surprisingly, metal could be one of the best things to wear during a thunderstorm."}
