Fox aimed to make the film \u2013 about a group of teenage boys mysteriously locked inside a giant maze \u2013 the first post-summer event movie, putting it on IMAX and large-format screens.\n\n\u201cOur little $34 million-budgeted film is pretty darn strong,\u201d said Chris Aronson, head of distribution for Fox. \u201cNo one had launched a YA title in September. We took a risk, but it paid off.\u201d\n\nAronson said attracting young moviegoers has been \u201cthe Achilles heel\u201d of Hollywood in recent years. But the studio has recently found success with relatively low-budget YA releases, like \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d the Shailene Woodley melodrama that made $125 million earlier this year despite a budget of just $12 million.\n\n\u201cIt shows the pitch-perfect strategic planning of Fox,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office tracker Rentrak. \u201cTeenagers are probably the most fickle creatures on the planet to figure out. So marketing to this particular group is tricky, and there have been a lot of casualties in this YA war.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cThe Maze Runner,\u201d which drew a 51 percent female audience despite an almost all-male cast, is now a promising franchise. Its opening was further boosted by $37.6 million internationally. Aronson announced Sunday that the planned sequel, \u201cThe Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,\u201d will bow Sept. 18 next year.\n\nWhile Neeson\u2019s box-office strength has been hard to beat in recent years, Universal\u2019s darker, R-rated \u201cA Walk Among the Tombstones\u201d came in well below the track record established by his \u201cTaken\u201d series or, from earlier this year, \u201cNon-Stop.\u201d Neeson stars as a justice-seeking former NYPD detective.\n\nWarner Bros.\u2019 \u201cThis Is Where I Leave You,\u201d about a large suburban family sitting Shiva for the funeral of their patriarch, boasted an A-list ensemble cast including Tina Fey, Jason Bateman and Jane Fonda.\n\nBut such adult fare rarely lights up the box office, even when directed by a filmmaker with a proven record of attracting crowds. The film, adapted from Jonathan Trooper\u2019s best seller, was directed by Shawn Levy, who is best known for broader comedies like the \u201cNight at the Museum\u201d franchise.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak.

Final domestic figures will be released Monday.\n\n1. \u201cThe Maze Runner,\u201d $32.5 million ($37.6 million international).\n\n2. \u201cA Walk Among the Tombstones,\u201d $13.1 million ($5 million international).\n\n3. \u201cThis Is Where I Leave You,\u201d $11.9 million.\n\n4. \u201cNo Good Deed,\u201d $10.2 million.\n\n5. \u201cDolphin Tale 2,\u201d $9 million ($1.2 million international).\n\n6. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d $5.2 million ($5.2 million international).\n\n7. \u201cLet\u2019s Be Cops,\u201d $2.7 million ($1.5 million international).\n\n8. \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,\u201d $2.7 million ($7.3 million international).\n\n9. \u201cThe Drop,\u201d $2.1 million.\n\n10. \u201cIf I Stay,\u201d $1.8 million ($3.2 million international).\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at international theaters (excluding the U.S. and Canada), according to Rentrak:\n\n1. \u201cThe Maze Runner,\u201d $37.6 million.\n\n2. \u201cLucy,\u201d $13 million.\n\n3. \u201cThe Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d $8.2 million.\n\n4. \u201cSex Tape,\u201d $7.6 million.\n\n5. \u201cTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,\u201d $7.3 million.\n\n6. \u201cNon-Stop,\u201d $7 million.\n\n7. \u201cOne Step Away,\u201d $6 million.\n\n8. \u201cInto the Storm,\u201d $5.7 million.\n\n9. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d $5.2 million.\n\n(tie) \u201cHercules,\u201d $5.2 million.\n\nUniversal and Focus are owned by NBC Universal, a unit of Comcast Corp.; Sony, Columbia, Sony Screen Gems and Sony Pictures Classics are units of Sony Corp.; Paramount is owned by Viacom Inc.; Disney, Pixar and Marvel are owned by The Walt Disney Co.; Miramax is owned by Filmyard Holdings LLC; 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight are owned by 21st Century Fox; Warner Bros. and New Line are units of Time Warner Inc.; MGM is owned by a group of former creditors including Highland Capital, Anchorage Advisors and Carl Icahn; Lionsgate is owned by Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.; IFC is owned by AMC Networks Inc.; Rogue is owned by Relativity Media LLC.\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 21 Sep 2014 21:54:44 -0400", "Description": "NEW YORK \u2013 The young-adult adaptation \u201cThe Maze Runner\u201d raced to the top of the box-office with $32.5 million, giving a budding franchise a quick start out of the gate.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "NEW YORK \u2013 The young-adult adaptation \u201cThe Maze Runner\u201d raced to the top of the box-office with $32.5 million, giving a budding franchise a quick start out of the gate.", "title": "\u2019Maze Runner\u2019 races past \u2018Tombstones\u2019 with $32.5M", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/ap/maze-runner-races-past-tombstones-with-325-20140921/", "image": {"width": 3900, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140921/ARTICLE/140929858/AR/0/AR-140929858.jpg", "height": 2591}, "updated_time": "2014-09-21T22:19:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "NEW YORK \u2013 The young-adult adaptation \u201cThe Maze Runner\u201d raced to the top of the box-office with $32.5 million, giving a budding franchise a quick start out of the gate.", "title": "\u2019Maze Runner\u2019 races past \u2018Tombstones\u2019 with $32.5M", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140921/ARTICLE/140929858/AR/0/AR-140929858.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-09-21T21:54:44Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-09-21T22:19:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1648\"", "article_summary": "\u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d $5.2 million ($5.2 million international).\nAronson announced Sunday that the planned sequel, \u201cThe Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials,\u201d will bow Sept. 18 next year.\n\u201cThe Maze Runner,\u201d $32.5 million ($37.6 million international).\n\u201cThe Maze Runner,\u201d $37.6 million.\nNEW YORK \u2013 The young-adult adaptation \u201cThe Maze Runner\u201d raced to the top of the box-office with $32.5 million, giving a budding franchise a quick start out of the gate."}
