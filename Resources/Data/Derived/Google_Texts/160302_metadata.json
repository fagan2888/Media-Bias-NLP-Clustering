That means a smaller workforce that isn't allowed to work as much overtime during the January to April busy season, Koskinen said.\n\nTax filers who call the IRS's toll-free number should expect \"extensive waits\" of a half-hour or more, he said. Filers should try, as much as possible, to get their basic questions answered from the IRS' website, irs.gov. This includes filers who want to check on the status of their refund.\n\nPeople who file paper returns can expect the IRS to take at least one extra week to process their refund.\n\n\"We clearly are resource-strained,\" Koskinen said.\n\nThe filing season kicks off Friday when the IRS' Free File program will open for the year. Anyone who earns $60,000 or less can file online at no cost. Although 70 percent of all taxpayers qualify for Free File, only 3.2 million returns -- roughly 2 percent -- were filed through Free File last year.\n\nFree File is an agreement between the IRS and a group of major tax software companies. In exchange for the IRS agreeing not to put out its own software, the companies agree to provide their product at no charge for low- and middle-income tax filers.\n\nTaxpayers can begin filing their returns by mail or electronically through any program beginning Tuesday, Jan. 20.\n\nOther highlights from Thursday's news conference:", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "income-tax-return,irs,taxes", "title": "IRS budget cuts mean taxpayers can expect \"extensive\" delays if they call for help", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"IRS budget cuts mean taxpayers can expect \\\"extensive\\\" delays if they call for help\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2015/01/irs_budget_cuts_mean_taxpayers.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/business_impact/photo/tax-forms8bjpg-82f7513de757447c.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14969511\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-15T20:22:27Z\", \"author\": \"Teresa Dixon Murray, The Plain Dealer\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"income-tax-return\",\"irs\",\"taxes\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cleveland.com/business_impact/photo/16780059-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@teresamurray", "site": "@clevelanddotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "With the start of the federal income tax filing season on Friday, taxpayers had better hope they don't need to call the IRS for help."}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, January 15, 2015,  3:55 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/business_impact/photo/tax-forms8bjpg-82f7513de757447c.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"tmurray\", \"author_nickname\": \"Teresa Dixon Murray, The Plain Dealer\", \"author_id\": \"4419\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Business\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "With the start of the federal income tax filing season on Friday, taxpayers had better hope they don't need to call the IRS for help.", "title": "IRS budget cuts mean taxpayers can expect \"extensive\" delays if they call for help", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2015/01/irs_budget_cuts_mean_taxpayers.html", "image": "http://media.cleveland.com/design/alpha/img/logo_cleve.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, January 15, 2015,  3:30 PM", "article_author": "Teresa Dixon Murray, The Plain Dealer", "Description": "With the start of the federal income tax filing season on Friday, taxpayers had better hope they don't need to call the IRS for help."}, "article_summary": "Tax filers who call the IRS's toll-free number should expect \"extensive waits\" of a half-hour or more, he said.\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- With the start of the federal income tax filing season Friday, taxpayers had better hope they don't need to call the IRS for help.\nThe filing season kicks off Friday when the IRS' Free File program will open for the year.\nThat means a smaller workforce that isn't allowed to work as much overtime during the January to April busy season, Koskinen said.\nAlthough 70 percent of all taxpayers qualify for Free File, only 3.2 million returns -- roughly 2 percent -- were filed through Free File last year."}
