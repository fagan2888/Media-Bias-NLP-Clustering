My grandmother, my mother, my sister, my niece and way too many women I know and love have all been diagnosed, so when I tell you I keep abreast of this subject, you\u2019ll know I\u2019m not just punning you.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what I\u2019ve discovered about the war on breast cancer that has nothing to do with the color pink: Women should take command of their bodies and include thermograms as part of their breast health regimen.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wait for your gynecologist or primary doctor to suggest it. Chances are, they know nothing about this continually improving imaging technology. It\u2019s had lousy PR ever since it was approved by the FDA in 1982. Maybe because it\u2019s simply not part of the billion-dollar cancer industry. Maybe if it had a color of its own.\n\nBreast thermography \u2014 using a digital infrared camera \u2014 is safe, effective, involves no radiation or squishing, and is evolving as a super-important risk-assessment tool.\n\n\u201cWhen treated in its earliest stages, most breast cancer has a cure rate of 95 percent,\u201d says Dr. Kathryn Ater, a doctor of Oriental medicine, who gave me my first, second and third thermograms over the last 4 years. Her mission is simply stated on her Two Birds Thermography website: To help women take care of themselves.\n\n\u201cYou are the one who decides when and how you\u2019re going to monitor your breast health,\u201d says Ater, who\u2019s been analyzing thermograms for more than 10 years. \u201cThermography is a tool. It\u2019s a piece of the puzzle that we can offer to help find abnormalities in the breast tissue before abnormal growth begins.\u201d\n\nMammograms \u2014 and I\u2019m not going to get into all the pros and cons that have women so confused \u2014 are simply not useful for early detection.\n\n\u201cA cancer has been growing 8 to 10 years before it\u2019s big enough or dense enough to be detected by mammography,\u201d explains Sandra Fields, a certified clinical thermographer with a master\u2019s in nursing. She\u2019s part of an expanding network of doctors, nurses, patients, and health experts spreading the good word about thermograms.\n\n\u201cWomen need to know that breast thermography is a promising and safe technology that is a welcome addition to helping women create breast health,\u201d says another wise advocate, the best-selling Dr. Christiane Northrup.\n\nThe science is simple and makes sense to anyone with a breast or a brain: By the time a tumor is the size of a pinhead (after about two years of growing) it requires its own blood supply. The process of developing that blood supply is called angiogenesis. Thermography is the best technology for detecting angiogenesis because it detects increased heat, blood flow or changing vascular patterns. All of these are early indicators that something suspicious is happening in the breast tissue and needs follow-up.\n\nIt\u2019s an easy, painless procedure that takes about 30 minutes. The patient stands naked from the waist up, turning in different directions while the technician clicks away, using a state-of-the-art infrared thermal camera.\n\nI felt relieved when Ater went over my most recent thermogram with me. We both looked at the beautiful result, a Peter Max-like pattern of red, blue, green, yellow. It\u2019s worthy of framing.\n\n\u201cLooks good,\u201d are the words I remember.\n\nI\u2019m not waiting for my insurance company to do the right thing. I pay the $199 out of pocket, and $50 dollars more for Ater\u2019s careful review of the results.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that thermograms can or should replace mammograms. It\u2019s a first line of defense and prevention, an excellent tool for early detection of a spreading blood supply, and it\u2019s not getting the good publicity it merits.\n\nWhere is Susan Komen when we need her?\n\n\u2014Marilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
