That kept them busy for a while. But now they are finally paying attention to the stuff we really care about\u2014like inventing a respectable football team.\n\nThis season counts as MIT\u2019s football breakthrough. The Engineers are undefeated at 8-0. They won their first-ever New England Football Conference championship on Saturday. They also clinched a spot in the Division III playoffs. They would be favored to complete an undefeated regular season by beating the U.S. Coast Guard Academy on Saturday if betting on low-level college football were common.\n\nTo put MIT\u2019s football achievement in terms that quantum physicists may understand: It\u2019s like winning a Nobel Prize\u2014only far more impressive.\n\nMIT\u2019s students, faculty and alumni won 80 Nobel Prizes between 1944 and 2013. In that time, MIT won a total of 80 football games, though it didn\u2019t have a varsity team for decades. With all due respect to the school\u2019s sailing and pistol teams, its only national champions in recent memory, MIT\u2019s football team may be engineering the greatest athletic accomplishment in school history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to walk through campus and have every other person congratulate you and know who you are,\u201d MIT football coach Chad Martinovich said.\n\nThat got us thinking: When were MIT\u2019s academic peers most relevant in sports?\n\nPrinceton\u2019s upset of UCLA in the 1996 NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament, for example, still beats its squash and lacrosse dynasties as the school\u2019s athletic highlight. Harvard\u2019s football team was the Alabama of the early 20th century.\n\nBut others have more humble athletic histories. The University of Chicago\u2019s sports legacy is the school\u2019s incredible decision to drop its football team after the 1939 season. (Chicago now plays football on the D-III level.) Then there is the California Institute of Technology, which is most legendary for pranking the crowd at the 1961 Rose Bowl into displaying the word \u201cCALTECH\u201d\u2014the closest that Caltech has ever come to winning a major bowl game.\n\nENLARGE\n\nWrite to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-11-10T23:50:00.000Z", "article.section": "Sports", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "With MIT\u2019s football team at 8-0, the Count looks at the most noteworthy athletic achievements of the top 10 U.S. universities.", "creator": "@bzcohen", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/PJ-BY317_SP_COU_G_20141110184308.jpg", "alt": "Revenge of the nerds?
