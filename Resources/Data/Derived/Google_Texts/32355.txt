A Gypsum-based National Guard helicopter rescued an injured hiker near the summit of Pyramid Peak outside Aspen on Friday afternoon.

About 2 p.m., two climbers called authorities for help from the south side of the peak, roughly 300 feet below the summit, according to a news release from the Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office. Several hours later, rescue crews on foot and in a helicopter reached one of the hikers, who had fallen and had a possibly fractured arm, a dislocated elbow and injuries to his leg.

The other climber was able to “self-rescue” and hike out to a parking lot, according to the office.

The 14,025-foot peak is part of the Maroon Bells Wilderness Area.

Mountain Rescue Aspen, which helped find and assist the climbers, has had 10 missions over the past five days, the release said, including a woman with a compound ankle injury who was flown by Flight for Life from the wilderness area Friday.
