He made the switch to a more attacking 4-3-3 formation in the second half and tweaked it further when referee Pedro Proenca stopped the match in the 76th minute to allow players to rehydrate.\n\nThat helped turn the match around and extend Mexico\u2019s second-round curse to six straight World Cups.\n\n\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d said Arjen Robben, the Netherlands forward that earned the late penalty. \u201cFive minutes from full time, we were out.\u201d\n\nInstead of the Dutch players, it was the Mexicans who wilted in the heat as they conceded twice as many goals in the final minutes of the match as they had in the entire group stage.\n\n\u201cThe humidity was against us, but we were fresher and fitter than the Mexicans,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cYes, we escaped. But we showed that we could create more chances with 4-3-3, and the players handled this shift very well.\u201d\n\nThe Dutch will next face either Costa Rica or Greece in the quarterfinals on Saturday in Salvador, and may have to play without midfielder Nigel de Jong, who was substituted in the ninth minute with a groin injury.\n\nMexico coach Miguel Herrera, one of the most popular characters at the World Cup because of his emotive ways on the sidelines, blamed Proenca for the loss and accused Robben of diving under a challenge from Rafael Marquez to earn the penalty.\n\n\u201cToday it was the man with the whistle who eliminated us from the World Cup,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cIf a referee invents a penalty, you\u2019re out of the World Cup.\n\n\u201cI hope they have a look at what happened and that this gentleman goes home just like we are.\u201d\n\nMarquez said Robben admitted that it was a bad call, but added that the Dutchman thought he should have been awarded a spot kick for an earlier challenge.\n\n\u201cI spoke with him after the match and he told me that it was not a penalty,\u201d Marquez said. \u201cHe said that the first foul was a penalty and that one was not called.\u201d\n\nMexico has now advanced to the second round at the World Cup six straight times and not reached the quarterfinals. The last time the team made it that far was as host of the 1986 tournament.\n\nGiovani Dos Santos gave the Mexicans the lead in the 48th minute after a goalless first half, but Sneijder equalized with a hard shot in the 88th.\n\nIt was the first time Sneijder, who scored five goals at the last World Cup in South Africa, has found the net in Brazil.\n\nRobben, who has already scored three goals for the Dutch at this year\u2019s tournament, then earned the penalty in the fourth minute of injury time but he handed the ball to Huntelaar.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know when your chance will come, but it was today, and so you grab it with both hands,\u201d said Huntelaar, who replaced captain Robin van Persie in the 76th minute. \u201cAnd it was fantastic.\u201d\n\nFor Mexico, goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa was again the star player, pulling off two more great saves after playing a key role in holding Brazil to a 0-0 draw in Group A.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t block Sneijder\u2019s shot and guessed wrong when diving in an attempt to stop Huntelaar\u2019s penalty.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to go out this way, the way this match went,\u201d Ochoa said. \u201cIt\u2019s just very hard to deal with when victory escapes you this way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored an injury-time penalty Sunday to give the Netherlands a 2-1 win over Mexico and a spot in the World Cup quarterfinals.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored an injury-time penalty Sunday to give the Netherlands a 2-1 win over Mexico and a spot in the World Cup quarterfinals.", "title": "World Cup: Dutch shock Mexico with pair of late goals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/29/world-cup-dutch-shock-mexico-pair-late-goals/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/29/brazil-soccer-wcup-netherlands-mexicojpeg-098ee.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/29/brazil-soccer-wcup-netherlands-mexicojpeg-098ee.jpg", "description": "Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored an injury-time penalty Sunday to give the Netherlands a 2-1 win over Mexico and a spot in the World Cup quarterfinals.", "card": "summary", "title": "World Cup: Dutch shock Mexico with pair of late goals"}, "Author": "Mike Corder", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Mexico, Wesley Sneijder, Brazil, The World Cup"}, "article_summary": "\u201cToday it was the man with the whistle who eliminated us from the World Cup,\u201d Herrera said.\nIt was the first time Sneijder, who scored five goals at the last World Cup in South Africa, has found the net in Brazil.\n\u201cIf a referee invents a penalty, you\u2019re out of the World Cup.\nFORTALEZA, Brazil \u2014 The Dutch were worried about the oppressive heat at Arena Castelao, and they left it with the stifling hot conditions to thank for a spot in the World Cup quarterfinals.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy to go out this way, the way this match went,\u201d Ochoa said."}
