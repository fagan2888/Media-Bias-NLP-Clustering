Since I\u2019m the author of a five-volume unofficial biography of Richard Nixon\u2014\u201dDevil in Gethsemane\u201d\u2014and \u201cHarlot\u2019s Empanada,\u201d a 3,000-page novel about the CIA\u2019s involvement in Central America, I have more perspective than anyone. Somewhat due to attrition but mostly due to talent, I remain The Greatest Living American Writer. Therefore, it\u2019s my job to call our present moment into focus. But to understand the present, we must journey backward into the gauzy, cisgendered American past.\n\nIn one of those halcyon moments in the late 1930s before the world fell, I sat in a rowboat with the Roosevelts on the Hudson River, gladly pulling along America\u2019s first family with the strength of my lithe, hairless, proto-bisexual arms. My family had been friendly with the Roosevelts since the dawn of Gotham. Hedging our bets, along with our hedges, we also befriended the Kennedys and Bushes, sponsored the early career of Ronald Reagan, and owned property in Arkansas where the Clintons picked their nits. Needless to say, my access to the corridors of presidential power has been unparalleled throughout the decades. This is somewhat surprising, given that I\u2019m also the foremost literary critic of America\u2019s imperial adventures.\n\nRegardless, on that drizzly day on the Hudson as Hitler contemplated Poland, FDR and Eleanor warned me to monitor the rise of fascism in America.\n\n\u201cBe wary of aggressive promises,\u201d FDR said. \u201cThe mob responds well to a toupeed con-man who talks about his penis.\u201d\n\nAt the time, it seemed to me that a mischievous house-servant had once again mixed laudanum into the president\u2019s morning Ovaltine, and I dismissed his comment with a witty Thorstein Veblen reference that caused him and the first lady to roar with laughter. But decades later, while doing mushrooms with Ken Kesey in Panama, I thought of what FDR had said. So when I returned home, I dropped the same wisdom on \u201cFiring Line,\u201d as I debated Germaine Greer about the publication of my essay, \u201cThe World Is a Diseased Vagina,\u201d in Esquire\u2019s special \u201cwomen\u2019s lib\u201d issue. \u201cFDR once told me that the mob responds well to a toupeed con-man who talks about his penis,\u201d I said, and then Gore Vidal leapt from the audience and smacked me over the head with a thick Winter Fiction issue of the Partisan Review.\n\nThe thought didn\u2019t occur to me again until I met Donald Trump.\n\nIt was 1986, and, even though I hardly needed the money, I worked as a roving correspondent for Spy magazine, penning vicious celebrity profiles under the pseudonym \u201cSidney Falco.\u201d I enjoyed countless gold-plated lunches in the Age of Greed. Trump was a speaker at one of them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The intellectuals of the world must rise above the Trump rabble to bring back that old-timey democracy", "title": "\u201cThe mob responds well to a toupeed con-man who talks about his penis\u201d: Witness the Great Phallic Unraveling of 2016", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The intellectuals of the world must rise above the Trump rabble to bring back that old-timey democracy", "title": "\u201cThe mob responds well to a toupeed con-man who talks about his penis\u201d: Witness the Great Phallic Unraveling of 2016", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/12/the_mob_responds_well_to_a_toupeed_con_man_who_talks_about_his_penis_witness_the_great_phallic_unraveling_of_2016/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/donald_trump_debate7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The intellectuals of the world must rise above the Trump rabble to bring back that old-timey democracy", "title": "\u201cThe mob responds well to a toupeed con-man who talks about his penis\u201d: Witness the Great Phallic Unraveling of 2016", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/donald_trump_debate7.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Neal Pollack", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump, Election 2016, political satire, Satire", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump, Election 2016, political satire, Satire, Elections News, Entertainment NewsAs we contemplate the Great Phallic Unraveling that comprises the political rise of Donald Trump, it\u2019s important to have historical perspective on the presidency.\nThe thought didn\u2019t occur to me again until I met Donald Trump.\nBut decades later, while doing mushrooms with Ken Kesey in Panama, I thought of what FDR had said.\nSomewhat due to attrition but mostly due to talent, I remain The Greatest Living American Writer.\nThis is somewhat surprising, given that I\u2019m also the foremost literary critic of America\u2019s imperial adventures."}
