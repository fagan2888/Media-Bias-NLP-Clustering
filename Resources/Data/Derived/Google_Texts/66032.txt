A large smoke plume is picked up on radar as a grass fire rolls north across western Butler County.

US-Highway 400 has been re-opened, but crews continue to battle a large grass fire near the Butler/Greenwood County line.

As of 9:30 p.m. Sunday Butler Co. Dispatchers said crews from several fire departments continue working to snuff out the blaze originating in northern Cowley County at about 2:30 p.m.

US-Highway 400 was closed for a few hours from Flint Hills Road near Beaumont east into Greenwood County.

Strong winds have pushed the flames north and east across more than 15 miles of dry land to US-Highway 400 just outside of Beaumont. The large smoke plume could be seen on radar.
