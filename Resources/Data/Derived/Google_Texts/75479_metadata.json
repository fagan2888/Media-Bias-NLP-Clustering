And she started taking female hormones, which caused her breasts to develop and the muscle mass on her 6-foot one-inch frame to shrink.\n\nThe next step was gender reassignment surgery. For that, Payne, who is now 44, said she needed health coverage. \u201cIt is not a simple, easy, magical surgery,\u201d said Payne, a photographer who lives in Palm Springs. \u201cTrying to do this without insurance is a big risk. Things can go wrong \u2026 not having the money to pay for it would be awful.\u201d\n\nPayne learned in the fall that she might qualify for subsidies through the state\u2019s new insurance marketplace, Covered California, because her income fell under the limit of $46,000 a year. She eagerly signed up in March for a Blue Shield plan for about $230 a month, and began making preparations for the surgery that would change her life.\n\nA \u2018Pre-existing Condition\u2019\n\nAmong the less-talked-about implications of the Affordable Care Act is the relief it is providing to many transgender people, many of whom are low-income and who have struggled to obtain health coverage.\n\nGetting jobs that offer insurance often has been difficult for transgender people and the cost of purchasing plans on the private market can be prohibitive. Some have been denied policies altogether after being diagnosed with \u201cgender identity disorder,\u201d often considered a pre-existing condition.\n\nWithout insurance, many people were unable to afford the hormones, surgeries and counseling needed to complete their transition. Nor would they have been covered in the event of surgical complications, which can include infections.\n\n\u201cWe are still dependent on insurance and the medical community for us to be able to live authentically,\u201d said Aydin Kennedy, coordinator of the transgender health program at St. John\u2019s Well Child and Family Center in Los Angeles.\n\nNow, federal law prohibits health insurance companies from discriminating against transgender people, and it bars insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. That makes it possible for more transgender people to purchase private plans. And in states that expanded their Medicaid programs, those with low incomes may get free coverage.\n\nThe federal anti-discrimination regulations have yet to be written, but California insurance regulators have said that companies must treat transgender patients the same as other patients. For example, if plans cover hormones for post-menopausal women, they must also cover them for transgender women. Medicare, the program for the elderly and disabled, lifted its ban on covering sex reassignment surgery earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe law and policy are on a transgender person\u2019s side for the first time,\u201d said Anand Kalra, program administrator at the Oakland-based Transgender Law Center.\n\nConservative and religious groups oppose using government funds for transgender surgeries, questioning whether they are medically necessary, ethical or effective.\n\n\u201cWe would oppose sex change operations all together,\u201d said Peter Sprigg, senior fellow at the Family Research Council in Washington, D.C. \u201cBut as a public policy issue, we would feel particularly strongly that taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be asked to pay for it.\u201d\n\nA few obstacles remain for transgender patients. Not many doctors specialize in transgender care. And while the law opens the door to insurance coverage, insurers can set conditions and don\u2019t automatically approve payment.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies are making up their own rules as they go along,\u201d said Kalra of the Transgender Law Center.\n\n\u2018Feeling Complete\u2019\n\nGrowing up in Kansas, Payne remembers trying on her mother\u2019s clothes and dressing as a girl every year for Halloween. She dreamt of having another life after this one, as a girl. But Payne said she mostly suppressed her feelings and tried to live up to the expectations for a male.\n\n\u201cI put it out of my head,\u201d she said.\n\nShe married a woman she met at work and they had four children, now ages 7 to 22. But she never felt comfortable in the traditional role of father and provider.\n\n\u201cI was just horrible at it because it wasn\u2019t who I was,\u201d she said. So Payne became the primary caretaker, playing the \u201cmommy role\u201d as she worked from home doing software development for pharmaceutical companies.\n\nShe felt increasingly anxious, and in late 2012, a therapist helped her to realize that she was meant to live as a woman. Payne said her entire outlook on life changed when she started taking female hormones.\n\n\u201cAll my anxiety and all of the bad things that I felt inside were just completely washed away,\u201d she said.\n\nPayne told her wife, who was upset. She told Payne: I married a man, not a woman -- but she also admitted that she wasn\u2019t entirely surprised. With mixed feelings, Payne\u2019s wife stayed in the marriage, and the family moved from Kansas to California, in part so Payne could be more comfortable living as a transgender woman. They rented a small house in a middle class neighborhood on the outskirts of Palm Springs and sent their children to the public school.\n\nLate last year, Payne\u2019s wife, who had battled alcoholism for years, died of liver disease.\n\nPayne said the children worried how people would react to her transition, but she said they soon realized it wasn\u2019t as big of a deal as they had feared. When Payne brought birthday cupcakes to her 7-year-old daughter\u2019s classroom last year, the children asked if she was a girl or a boy. After Payne told them she was a girl, \u201cthey just wanted their cupcakes.\u201d\n\nIn California, Payne found transgender friends and became an advocate within the community. \u201cYou find out that there is a whole world of people out there,\u201d said Payne, who wears little makeup or jewelry and calls herself a \u201cT-shirt and skirt kind of a girl.\u201d\n\nPayne was ready for the surgery. She started calling the approved providers in Blue Shield\u2019s preferred provider network. But they were booked up for months, or years. She felt she couldn\u2019t wait -- she wanted to do the surgery while her children were on summer vacation so they could go to her parents\u2019 house in Kansas as she recovered. She found an out-of-network doctor in Palo Alto who would do the surgery about a month later.\n\n\u201cThe time was right and I wanted to get it done,\u201d she said.\n\nHer Blue Shield policy said that gender reassignment surgery \u2013 which uses existing tissue to construct female genitalia -- could be covered if patients met certain guidelines. For example, she had to be diagnosed with gender identity disorder and have an \u201cexpressed desire\u201d to live as a member of the opposite sex.\n\nBy the scheduled date, Blue Shield had authorized the operation but hadn\u2019t determined exactly how much it would pay for an out-of-network provider. Payne got a cashier\u2019s check for nearly all her savings, $27,000, to pay the doctor, hoping her insurance plan would reimburse most of it. She worried about all the other expenses too, including the hospital stay, lab work and anesthesiology services.\n\nThe day of the surgery at Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City, Payne said she remembers being wheeled in to the operating room and feeling very calm. When she woke up, with oxygen still attached and wearing her hospital gown, a friend told her that the surgery had gone well, without any immediate complications.\n\nLater that day, she had just enough energy to type a few words on her Facebook profile: \u201cFeeling complete.\u201d\n\nGrateful for Coverage\n\nOn a boiling afternoon in early July, about six weeks after the operation, Payne and her friends sat outside on the patio next to a pool. Misters sprayed above them, and Payne\u2019s cat and two dogs wandered beneath their feet.\n\nPayne said she did suffer a few complications later \u2013 some swelling and an infection -- but she recovered with medication and support from friends.\n\nShe is still trying to figure out how much she has to pay out-of-pocket for the surgery and hospital stay -- and how much of that her insurance plan will reimburse. Payne said she believes the lab work, pathology, anesthesiology services and follow-up doctor\u2019s visits were all covered. But recently she got a statement saying she was on the hook for $17,000 of the total cost of the surgery.\n\nPayne believes that the government and insurance companies should help cover such operations. The population of transgender patients who want surgery is small, and she said they are less likely to suffer mental health problems once they have it.\n\nPayne said she will be grateful for whatever coverage she can receive. Her friend Jenny Taylor, who is staying with her during the recovery, has had an even harder time with her insurance.\n\nAn outgoing transgender woman who laughs easily and wears colorful outfits and painted nails, Taylor purchased a policy through the insurance exchange in Tennessee. But she soon learned her doctor wasn\u2019t in the plan\u2019s network and that she had to pay cash for everything, with no hope of reimbursement.\n\n\u201cMy insurance, even though I finally got it, was useless,\u201d she said.\n\nThe policy also wouldn\u2019t pay for her hormones. A pharmacist told her the medication was for women \u2013 and her identification still listed her as a male. Taylor recently moved to Palm Springs and said she now plans to apply for insurance through Covered California.\n\n\u201cI was really frustrated,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to be ourselves, at the end of the day.\u201d\n\nPayne agreed, saying she finally feels like her body matches what she knows to be true \u2013 that she is a woman. \u201cIt seems more natural,\u201d she said.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
