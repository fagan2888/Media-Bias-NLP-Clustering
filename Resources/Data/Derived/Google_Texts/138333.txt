CNBC's Bertha Coombs and Dan Mangan, CNBC Business News, discuss the potential big price hikes in Obamacare plans for 2017 and what it could mean for consumers.

The costs of providing health care to an average American family surpassed $25,000 for the first time in 2016 â€” even as the rate of health cost increases slowed to a record low, a new analysis revealed Tuesday.

The $25,826 in health-care costs for a typical family of four covered by a employer-sponsored "preferred provider plan" is $1,155 higher than last year, and triple what it cost to provide health care for the same family in 2001, the first year that Milliman Medical Index analysis was done.

And it's the 11th consecutive year that the total dollar increase in the average family's health-care costs exceeded $1,110, actuarial services firm Milliman noted as it released the index.
