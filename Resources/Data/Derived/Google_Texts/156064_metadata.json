Heatstroke is one of the leading causes of death among children. In 10 minutes, a car\u2019s temperature can rise more than 20 degrees, according to The U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Even at an outside temperature of 60 degrees, the temperature inside a car can reach 110 degrees, causing severe injury or death to a child.\n\n\u201cThere is no \u2018safe\u2019 amount of time to leave a child unattended in a car,\u201d said Secretary of Health Dr. Karen Murphy. \u201cChildren are at a higher risk for heat stroke than adults. Even minutes can mean the difference between life or death.\u201d\n\nFollow these important rules to protect children from heatstroke:\n\n-- Always check the back seats of a vehicle before locking it or walking away.\n\n-- Keep a stuffed animal in a child\u2019s car seat when it\u2019s empty, and move the toy to the front seat as a reminder when a child is in the back seat.\n\n-- If someone else is driving a child or daily routines have been altered, always check to make sure a child has arrived safely.\n\nIn Pennsylvania it is a summary offense to leave a child under the age of six unattended in a vehicle that is out of the adult\u2019s sight under the Leaving an Unattended Child in a Motor Vehicle law.\n\nAdditionally, leaving a child in a hot car can rise to the level of endangering the welfare of a child, which is a misdemeanor of the first degree. Anyone who sees a child unattended in a car should call 911 immediately and stay with the vehicle.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Fri, 29 May 2015 10:20:50 EDT", "description": "The departments of Human Services (DHS) and Health today reminded Pennsylvanians to never leave children alone in cars, which could prove deadly after only a few minutes.", "generator": "CoreMedia", "og": {"site_name": "WTAE", "description": "The departments of Human Services (DHS) and Health today reminded Pennsylvanians to never leave children alone in cars, which could prove deadly after only a few minutes.", "title": "Pennsylvania government departments urge vigilance to prevent harming children in hot vehicles", "url": "http://www.wtae.com/news/pennsylvania-government-departments-urge-vigilance-to-prevent-harming-children-in-hot-vehicles/33284522", "image": "http://www.wtae.com/image/view/-/30929786/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/3mg73nz/-/dashboard---speedometer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wtae.com/news/pennsylvania-government-departments-urge-vigilance-to-prevent-harming-children-in-hot-vehicles/33284522", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wtae://content/article/33284522", "iphone": "wtae://content/article/33284522", "googleplay": "wtae://content/article/33284522"}, "name": {"ipad": "wtae", "iphone": "wtae", "googleplay": "wtae"}, "id": {"ipad": 506053781, "iphone": 506053781, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wtae"}}, "site": "@WTAE", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wtae://content/article/33284522", "app_name": "wtae", "package": "com.hearst.android.wtae"}, "ios": {"url": "wtae://content/article/33284522", "app_store_id": 506053781, "app_name": "wtae"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 103664079013}, "keywords": "health", "google-site-verification": "yDb1_gOPiN1BUVxthVho7DtUbsFNoHF1JMM4A1Pldk8", "news_keywords": "health"}, "article_summary": "The departments of Human Services (DHS) and Health today reminded Pennsylvanians to never leave children alone in cars, which could prove deadly after only a few minutes.\nAnyone who sees a child unattended in a car should call 911 immediately and stay with the vehicle.\n\u201cThere is no \u2018safe\u2019 amount of time to leave a child unattended in a car,\u201d said Secretary of Health Dr. Karen Murphy.\n\u201cEvery year children die in cars, but these tragedies are preventable,\u201d said DHS Acting Secretary Ted Dallas.\nEven at an outside temperature of 60 degrees, the temperature inside a car can reach 110 degrees, causing severe injury or death to a child."}
