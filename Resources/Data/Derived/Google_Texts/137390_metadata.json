Bush\u2019s policies and has been criticized from the right for blaming Bush for problems he inherited when he took office. (Photo: Associated Press file)\n\nRe: \u201cObama has only polarized America\u201d (Rabble Rouser, Oct. 15)\n\nI completely disagree with virtually every word the Rabble Rouser wrote on Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nThe writer calls it \u201ca disaster\u201d and says Obama \u201chas done very little, if anything, to improve the lives of the average American.\u201d Is he serious?\n\nObama is responsible for the Affordable Care Act, which has resulted in possibly lifesaving medical coverage for millions of Americans who couldn\u2019t get any before. All Americans now cannot be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. Young people can stay on their parents\u2019 coverage until 26. Many items of preventative care are now free or at reduced cost.\n\nHow can any these accomplishments not improve the life of the average American? They are literally lifesavers.\n\nBut that\u2019s just one of many accomplishments. Obama pulled the country out of the worst recession since the Great Depression. The stock market has doubled, there have been 55 months of positive jobs created (a new record), unemployment has dropped, and the deficit has dropped.\n\nThis president directed the rescue of the auto industry when his opponent in 2012 suggested letting it go bankrupt.\n\nThis president directed the killing of the man who was instrumental in murdering 3,000 Americans, after his predecessor openly admitted that wasn\u2019t a top priority.\n\nThis president made student loans more affordable and available to millions of college students, helped the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act become law, helped create bank reform after his predecessor let banks run wild and destroy people financially, and stopped the military from kicking out gay Americans.\n\nThere\u2019s much more, but I\u2019m out of space. And all of this with absolutely zero cooperation from the other party.\n\nThe writer also complains about Obama for blaming President George W. Bush\u2019s policies. Sorry, but history didn\u2019t begin six years ago. Bush\u2019s disgraceful invasion of Iraq not only cost us 4,000 lives, tens of thousands maimed, and a trillion dollars, but it screwed up that country for decades to come. The Sunnis that he kicked out have now morphed into ISIS. His tax cuts for the rich are still crippling the economy.\n\nTalk about a president who did nothing to improve Americans\u2019 lives. Bush had eight years, six with his party in control of both houses of Congress, and a record of zero achievements.\n\nThe writer lives in Voorhees.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1wdUVn2", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "He pulled country out of worst recession since Great Depression; stock market has doubled.", "og": {"site_name": "Courier-Post", "description": "He pulled country out of worst recession since Great Depression; stock market has doubled.", "title": "RABBLE ROUSER: Obama has many accomplishments", "url": "http://www.courierpostonline.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/10/19/rabble-rouser-obama-many-accomplishments/17573619/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courierpostonline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He pulled country out of worst recession since Great Depression; stock market has doubled.", "title": "RABBLE ROUSER: Obama has many accomplishments", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c0eae680d3a642869ff9de0bee5ef8077e4bdb10/c=172-0-1837-1665&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/CherryHill/2014/10/19/obamaandbush.jpg", "creator": "@cpsj", "site": "@cpsj", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=789840748", "fb": {"app_id": 175025579194557}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "President Barack Obama, presidency, Affordable Care Act, economy, jobs"}, "article_summary": "The writer also complains about Obama for blaming President George W.
