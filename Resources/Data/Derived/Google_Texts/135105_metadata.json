Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.\u201d\n\nBut he challenged Catholics to go further.\n\n\u201cThis respect must be real, not rhetorical, and ever reflective of the Church\u2019s commitment to accompanying all people,\u201d he said in a statement issued Sunday. \u201cFor this reason, the Church must extend support to all families, no matter their circumstances, recognizing that we are all relatives, journeying through life under the careful watch of a loving God.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe rapid social changes signaled by the Court ruling call us to mature and serene reflections as we move forward together,\u201d Cupich said in a statement. \u201cIn that process, the Catholic Church will stand ready to offer a wisdom rooted in faith and a wide range of human experience.\u201d\n\nHe said the Church will \u201chold fast to an authentic understanding of marriage which has been written in the human heart, consolidated in history, and confirmed by the Word of God\u201d and noted that the Court\u2019s 5-4 decision \u201chas no bearing on the Catholic Sacrament of Matrimony, in which the marriage of man and woman is a sign of the union of Christ and the Church.\u201d\n\nCupich, a moderate among the American hierarchy, also praised the Court\u2019s 6-3 decision upholding the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe have issues with provisions of that legislation and will continue to advocate to preserve our religious freedom,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, we understand that for millions of individuals and families, most of them the working poor, this decision preserves access to health care and the promise it offers of a healthier, longer life.\u201d\n\nCupich\u2019s statement appears to distance him from the more pointed criticism of the Court\u2019s decision by the head US Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nThe president of the Conference, Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of Louisville, called the decision \u201cprofoundly immoral and unjust\u201d and a \u201ctragic error\u201d in a statement Friday. A handful of other Catholic bishops reacted similarly last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoston\u2019s Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, one of Pope Francis\u2019 top advisors, echoed Kurtz\u2019 dire tone.\n\n\u201cCertainly every citizen of this land, regardless of their sexual orientation, deserves to be respected in their personal and civic life,\u201d he said. \u201cBut enshrining same sex marriage in our constitutional system of governance has dangers that may become fully evident only over time.\u201d\n\nCupich isn\u2019t alone in calls for moderation, however.\n\nArchbishop Wilton Gregory of Atlanta, a former president of the USCCB, released a statement Friday noting that the Church\u2019s understanding of marriage \u201cbeautifully joins a man and woman in a loving union that is permanent in commitment and open to God\u2019s blessing of precious new life.\u201d\n\nHowever, he warned those disappointed by the Court\u2019s decision to refrain from \u201cmore venomous language or vile behavior against those whose opinions continue to differ from our own.\u201d He said the ruling \u201cconfers a civil entitlement to some people who could not claim it before,\u201d but stated that it \u201cdoes not resolve the moral debate that preceded it and will most certainly continue in its wake.\u201d\n\nGregory wrote that the decision makes his job \u201cmore complex since it demands that I both continue to uphold the teachings on my Church regarding the Sacrament of Matrimony while also demanding that I insist upon respect for the human dignity of both those who approve of the judgment as well as those who may disapprove.\u201d\n\nBishop Robert McElroy of San Diego said in a statement that the Church \u201cwill continue to honor and embody the uniqueness of marriage between one man and one woman as a gift from God,\u201d but \u201cwill do so in a manner which profoundly respects at every moment the loving and familial relationships which enrich the lives of so many gay men and women who are our sons and daughters, our sisters and brothers, and ultimately our fellow pilgrims on this earthly journey of life.\u201d\n\nPope Francis, who met with Cupich Friday in Rome, has repeatedly said that marriage must be a union of one man and one woman, but nonetheless is viewed by progressive Catholics as being more hospitable to gays and lesbians than previous popes.\n\nIn October, bishops will gather from around the world for the second part of the Synod on the Family, which is expected to include a discussion of pastoral care for LGBT Catholics.\n\nCupich was elected by the USCCB to serve as an alternate American delegate for the synod, though some Catholics wonder if Francis will appoint him as one of his special delegates.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/church/2015/06/29/in-wake-of-supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-ruling-some-bishops-call-for-calm/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Archbishop-Cupich-on-SCOTUS-rulings-750x422.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Following his first meeting with Pope Francis, Archbishop Blase Cupich calls Catholics to engage in \"mature and serene reflections.\"", "title": "In wake of Supreme Court same-sex marriage ruling, some bishops call for calm"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d1d2d3", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe have issues with provisions of that legislation and will continue to advocate to preserve our religious freedom,\u201d he wrote.\nEvery sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided.\u201dBut he challenged Catholics to go further.\nThe president of the Conference, Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of Louisville, called the decision \u201cprofoundly immoral and unjust\u201d and a \u201ctragic error\u201d in a statement Friday.\n\u201cCertainly every citizen of this land, regardless of their sexual orientation, deserves to be respected in their personal and civic life,\u201d he said.\nBut some US prelates have chosen a different tack, releasing nuanced statements in the hours after the decision that uphold the Church\u2019s teaching on marriage but nonetheless call on Catholics to reflect deeply on the ruling."}
