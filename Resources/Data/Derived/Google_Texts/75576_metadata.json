Secord, who began his career as a health-care administrator 40 years ago at Virginia Mason, was excited then about the act\u2019s potential for broadening access and improving health care.\n\nSecord has experience with experiments in health care, having spent much of his career trying to improve it, especially for people traditional systems wouldn\u2019t reach. For almost 19 years he\u2019s been the executive director of Neighborcare Health, a community-clinic system that serves Seattle.\n\nI heard he was planning to retire, so I met with him last week to talk about his work and health care in general. He told me he\u2019s upbeat about the direction of health care in the country and at his organization.\n\nSince we spoke five years ago, the act, often called Obamacare, has survived two major challenges in the U.S. Supreme Court, and Secord sees it as an important part of transforming health care in the U.S.\n\nSecord said traditional health care has broken the links between caregivers and community \u201cwith an overreliance on technology and special language.\u201d People are left feeling they have no power in the system, when they should be active participants in their own health.\n\nFor about a decade, he said, providers around the country have talked about three goals: better health, better care and lower costs. People are trying to make health-care systems work better for the public they serve, and Secord said community clinics are already on that path.\n\nThe ACA, he said, is not just about insurance. It\u2019s also about changing the health-care delivery system, which is why the organization includes support for community health centers.\n\nThis month is the 50th anniversary of the creation of Medicare and Medicaid and the founding of the first two community clinics in the U.S., one in a poor neighborhood of Boston and one in rural Mississippi. Those clinics came out of the social-justice movement and were modeled on clinics created in South Africa during Apartheid to serve people who didn\u2019t have access to care.\n\nSocial justice is one of the foundations of Neighborcare\u2019s mission, Secord said, even internally. He said doctors, dentists and managers are paid less than they would be elsewhere, but they choose that because of the mission, while the organization tries to pay more to people in jobs that might earn low wages in other systems.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me, being part of an organization that lives by its core values,\u201d he said. When new staff or volunteers come in, \u201cI always ask them, \u2018What drew you to Neighborcare,\u2019 and I get to hear a slice of people\u2019s life.\u201d They often have stories about when they were in need, and that\u2019s what draws them.\n\nThere are now 10,000 community clinic sites around the country, and like those run by Neighborcare, they serve people regardless of their ability to pay. Before the ACA, Secord said, 40 percent of the people served by Neighborcare were uninsured, and half that many are uninsured now. Neighborcare has signed up 22,000 people for insurance under the program and continues to sign up more.\n\nSecord praises Washington for embracing the ACA. \u201cIt\u2019s still incredible to me that other states can turn their backs\u201d on people who need care.\n\nAccess is critical, but the organization is also, as its name suggests, invested in integrating care into the community. You don\u2019t do that by waiting for people to show up at clinics, Secord said. Staff go to places where they\u2019ll find people who may be without health care. Besides primary-care clinics and dental clinics around Seattle, it operates in 14 Seattle Public Schools and 23 supportive-housing facilities.\n\nIt\u2019s even trying to reach people where they shop, creating a mini-clinic at a St. Vincent De Paul thrift shop on North Aurora Avenue.\n\nNeighborcare is getting people who live in the neighborhoods it serves involved in helping their neighbors get healthy and stay healthy. They\u2019ve started with four people in Yesler Terrace who speak languages common in the development who are leading walks and helping people navigate the health-care system.\n\nNeighborcare saves money for the larger community. Their staff members work to prevent unwanted pregnancies by providing counseling and contraceptives to high- school students. \u201cYou know the stats for what happens when teenagers bring babies into the world without support,\u201d Secord said. Staff members embedded in housing facilities such as the Morrison, which provides housing and services to homeless people in downtown Seattle, has reduced 911 calls there.\n\nAnd its focus on preventive health care helps reduce the chronic diseases that suck up a huge portion of health-care dollars in the U.S.\n\nSecord said community clinics like Neighborcare make up the largest primary-care system in the state when taken altogether, serving 800,000 people in Washington.\n\nThey\u2019re still growing. Neighborcare is building a new facility across the freeway from Northgate Mall, Meridian Center for Health, that is designed to integrate multiple aspects of health care and social services. Money from the ACA made the project possible, and the facility is a partnership with Seattle-King County Public Health and Valley Cities Mental Health Treatment.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge project for Neighborcare and reflects its growth since Secord came on board in 1992, when the system had two medical clinics, four dental clinics and one school-based center.\n\nSecord, who\u2019s 65, plans to stay around for Meridian\u2019s opening this fall and will retire sometime after that. He told me he and his wife expect to be involved in social justice and health-care-related causes, but first he wants to relax. He\u2019s an amateur stone mason and has already started working on a cabin they own.\n\nHe\u2019ll leave knowing he\u2019s helped lay a strong foundation for Neighborcare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Neighborcare leader sees community clinics and Obamacare as remaking health care to benefit people, rather than systems.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "Neighborcare leader sees community clinics and Obamacare as remaking health care to benefit people, rather than systems.", "title": "Fixing the link: Local health clinics unite caregivers, community", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/fixing-the-link-local-health-clinics-unite-caregivers-community/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-facebook.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seattletimes", "description": "Neighborcare leader sees community clinics and Obamacare as remaking health care to benefit people, rather than systems.", "card": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-twitter.png", "title": "Fixing the link: Local health clinics unite caregivers, community"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Local News", "published_time": "2015-07-05 18:33:10", "modified_time": "2015-07-06 05:49:39"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local News, Health"}, "article_summary": "Neighborcare leader sees community clinics and Obamacare as remaking health care to benefit people, rather than systems.\nI heard he was planning to retire, so I met with him last week to talk about his work and health care in general.\nFor almost 19 years he\u2019s been the executive director of Neighborcare Health, a community-clinic system that serves Seattle.\nIt\u2019s also about changing the health-care delivery system, which is why the organization includes support for community health centers.\nHe told me he\u2019s upbeat about the direction of health care in the country and at his organization."}
