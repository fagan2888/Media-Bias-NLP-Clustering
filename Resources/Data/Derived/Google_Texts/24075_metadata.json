They can\u2019t get approved for loans. They\u2019ve all got such student loan debt, or many of them, that owning anything is out of the question\u201d Limbaugh said on his show, saying that they couldn\u2019t be home or car owners \u201cbecause of the Obama economy.\u201d\n\nBut the image of the entitled Millennial who just wants to live out of Air Bnb\u2019s and take Uber\u2019s forever and not put in 40 hours of work a week? Limbaugh calls it \u201cB.S.\u201d\n\nIt was just the fact they couldn\u2019t afford it, they didn\u2019t have the money for it, they didn\u2019t have the jobs, there wasn\u2019t any job prospects. Look at housing prices where most of the country is just out of reach, even starter homes out of reach. So a lie was concocted. Well, they don\u2019t care anyway. They want to rent, sharing economy. These are much more communal people.\n\nThese \u201ccommunal people\u201d are actually less liberal than they are portrayed to be, with polls showing younger Millennials as being much less liberal than older Millennials.\n\nDespite these contradictions, Millennials just keep on keeping on, ignoring the memes and continuing to \u201cfollow their dreams. \u201c", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Image via rushlimbaugh.com There has been a lot written about Millennials, those illusive 20-somethings that can\u2019t make eye contact or speak on the phone but will share everything on their social media accounts.
