Since 2000, Accenture has had $10 billion in federal contracts; less than half of 1 percent have involved federal health care.\n\nWhile it seems to be fine working in the private sector \u2013 where the money its clients spend actually matters \u2014 it has history of botching government work in Democrat priority areas like food stamps and voter registration systems \u2013 costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThat troubled history is hidden in plain sight in a remarkably soft-pedaled report in Sunday\u2019s Washington Post passed along by Rat Nation.\n\nIn weirdly restrained language, and under the mollycoddling headline \u201cAccenture, hired to help fix Healthcare.gov, has had a series of stumbles,\u201d the Post reported Accenture\u2019s history of:\n\nFouling up North Carolina\u2019s food stamp program to the point where the Obama administration threatened to withhold funding for it (think about that for a second \u2013 how bad does it have to be for the Obama administration to withhold food stamp funding?);\n\nLosing contracts with the Pentagon and four states to develop online voting or voter-registration systems because of flawed software and poor security (for the criminal candy store of Healthcare.gov, poor security might be a problem);\n\nBeing called a giant liar by the Postal Service\u2019s Inspector General, which reported in an audit on June 19 that Accenture had \u201cdemonstrated an absence of business ethics\u201d and recommended canceling $200 million in contracts with the company.\n\n\u201cThe Postal Service should consider Accenture for suspension or debarment and review existing contracts to determine whether the contracts warrant termination. This action would protect the Postal Service\u2019s financial interest from unethical, dishonest, or otherwise irresponsible supplier practices.\u201d\n\nThe company, the inspector general wrote, presented \u201cimmediate risk of future fraud and abuse\u201d at the Post Office.\n\n(USPS officials dismissed the recommendation out of hand two days after it was submitted because its findings were \u201cunwarranted,\u201d according to Part & Parcel, which covers mail and express delivery issues. )\n\nSo this is Obamacare\u2019s cyber savior: a company branded \u201cunethical\u201d and \u201cdishonest,\u201d according to the Post Office Inspector General; a company with a history riddled with failure in large, public computer systems; a company with no experience in federal health programs.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong?\n\nHT: Rat Nation", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Accenture, the Irish consulting contractor hired to take rescue the Obamacare website, was accused last summer of being an \u201cimmediate risk of future fraud\u201d at the Post Office.
