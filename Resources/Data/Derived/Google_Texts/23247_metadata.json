Now, after spending parts of three seasons toiling on a practice squad and two more as a rotational player, Baker finally has a chance to make his name known to the general public as well.\n\nAfter entering the season pegged as the starter at left defensive end, Baker will assume a role as the Redskins\u2019 starting nose tackle for the next two months following news that Barry Cofield would be out at least that long because of a high right ankle sprain.\n\nSEE ALSO: LOVERRO: Pitchman to pariah: Last year, NFL used Ray Rice jersey in women\u2019s apparel ad\n\n\u201cIt means a lot,\u201d Baker said. \u201cTo be able to come in as a starter was a blessing for me, and a huge opportunity for me to show the coaches and show the rest of people that I\u2019m a hell of a football player.\u201d\n\nUndrafted out of Hampton in 2009, where he played one season after three at Penn State, Baker bounced from Denver\u2019s practice squad to Miami\u2019s, and then to Washington\u2019s in 2011. He was signed to the 53-man roster for the first time that December, but the stay lasted a day; while trying to prove to teammates that he could dunk a basketball, the 6-foot-2, 329-pound Baker tore a quadriceps, costing him the rest of the season.\n\nAccording to the NFL, there were a combined 229 undrafted players on teams\u2019 active rosters, reserve lists and practice squads as of the midpoint last week \u2014 roughly 10 percent of all players currently in the league.\n\nThough the league couldn\u2019t provide a breakdown by experience, a sizeable proportion of those players are either rookies or on the practice squad. Few undrafted players, outside of Dallas quarterback Tony Romo and Houston running back Arian Foster, have displayed the ability to stay in the league as long as Baker.\n\n\u201cJust the adversity that he\u2019s faced shows how strong he is and shows his true character,\u201d said Damik Scafe, a defensive end currently on San Diego\u2019s practice squad who was a high school teammate of Baker\u2019s in Windsor, Connecticut. \u201cYou can\u2019t describe that level of heart and will and determination.\u201d\n\nBaker has been able to survive because of his versatility. Originally a nose tackle, which is perhaps his most natural position, the Redskins moved him outside at the start of last season because they believed his athleticism and his strength would make him a strong pass rusher.\n\nHe played approximately 20 percent of all defensive snaps in 2012, then 40 percent last year, when he had 27 tackles and dropped Chicago quarterback Jay Cutler for his only sack. The uptick in playing time came as part of Baker\u2019s continued maturation, as the team felt comfortable using him in its nickel package and, for the last three games of the season, as the starting right end with Stephen Bowen on injured reserve.\n\n\u201cWe always knew Bake was good,\u201d said defensive end Jarvis Jenkins, who Baker replaced this offseason as a starter. \u201cThe main thing was he had to get it [mentally], as far as being in the moment, knowing the situation, and not doing those rookie mistakes. He\u2019s been in the league. He\u2019s recognized those mistakes now, and he\u2019s grown from it, you know? He was rewarded those last five or six games. He came on stronger than anybody on our defense.\u201d\n\nJust because Baker has matured, however, doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s grown up. After noticing running back Lache Seastrunk grooving to the rhythm of the music during warm-ups in training camp, Baker decided one day to challenge him to a dance contest, ending it before it began merely by gyrating in Seastrunk\u2019s general direction.\n\nWhen rookie Silas Redd, another undrafted player, made the initial 53-man roster last week, Baker walked by reporters and teased the running back about his newfound superstar status before joining in to ask a question about representing Connecticut, their home state.\n\nThat sense of levity has helped Baker cope with the uncertain future that often comes with being a football player on the periphery of the roster. Now firmly a part of it, there are other ways he hopes he can make an impact.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a resilient player, but I\u2019ve always been a player no matter where I was positioned,\u201d Baker said. \u201cI knew if I had a chance and an opportunity to show my skills, I would be OK. As long as I had that chance and that opportunity, I always did well. For the coaches and the players to believe in me, to be a starter \u2014 it\u2019s a blessing, and you know, I don\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baker has endeared himself to his teammates and coaches for years, partly because of his easygoing, good-natured personality.
