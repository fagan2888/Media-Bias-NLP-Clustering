Sentencing will be this summer for a Wichita, Kansas, man convicted of federal prostitution-related charges connected to a sting operation targeting massage parlors.

A federal jury has convicted 51-year-old Kay Tee of Wichita of one count each of attempting to entice a person to cross state lines to engage in prostitution, using a telephone in furtherance of prostitution and money laundering.

Tee was indicted last year on suspicion of trying to broker a deal to purchase a massage parlor that would offer sex services.

Sentencing is scheduled for July 13.
