He criticized Republicans for \u201calways putting the blame on someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey distract people, divide people and demonize people, and they do a great job of it,\u201d Clinton told the packed gymnasium.\n\nWithout mentioning Republican front-runner Donald Trump by name, Clinton called out GOP presidential candidates for focusing their campaigns on \u201cnegative\u201d issues to generate publicity. He mentioned the success of Mexico in producing top-notch engineers as an example of Republicans ignoring important facts.\n\n\u201cInstead of applauding their success, it turns into \u2018they\u2019re taking your jobs, and we have to build a wall,\u2019\u201d Clinton said.\n\nThe former president also addressed viral videos of police shootings as a way to promote his wife\u2019s \u201cinclusive social policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm tired of looking at African-American men that are shot when they're unarmed,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton said he was in favor of President Barack Obama\u2019s stance on health care, and affirmed his wife supported Obamacare.\n\n\u201cHillary thinks it would be a mistake to replace and repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nHe said he believed a Hillary Clinton presidency would also help improve rising death rates of middle-age white Americans, a \u201cnational travesty\u201d that was reported in November. Clinton said the rise in mortality rates could be attributed to a \u201cbroken heart, because the American dream is lost to them.\u201d\n\nThe 42nd president said his wife would propose $10 million in grants for each state to give \u201cevery state and every community the mental health treatment it needs.\u201d\n\nFinally, Clinton touched on the cost of college education to differentiate his wife\u2019s policies with those of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nHe said college tuition should be paid for \u201cmiddle class and working-class people\u201d but that it \u201cshould not be free for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe former president left the audience with two questions before exiting the stage just before 9 p.m.\n\n\u201cDo children have a better future? Are we coming together rather than being torn apart? If you want to be able to say yes at the end of the next term, you'll elect Hillary president.\u201d\n\nClinton is scheduled to speak Friday night in Reno at the Boys and Girls Club of Truckee Meadows.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former President Bill Clinton criticized the Republican Party on Thursday night in Las Vegas while stumping for his wife and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a speech that touched on police brutality, health care and social equality ...", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "Former President Bill Clinton criticized the Republican Party on Thursday night in Las Vegas while stumping for his wife and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a speech that touched on police brutality, health care and social equality ...", "title": "In Las Vegas speech, Bill Clinton jabs Republicans, touts Hillary as unifier", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2016/jan/21/in-las-vegas-speech-bill-clinton-jabs-republicans/", "image": "http://photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2016/01/21/20160121_Sun_Bill_Clinton_Campaigns_For_Hilary_LE1_t378.jpg?42670983c634e7c20626cc4856c543752c0d8b2f", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "//photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2016/01/21/20160121_Sun_Bill_Clinton_Campaigns_For_Hilary_LE1_r100x100.jpg?b3c07ccb2170322b6086abdb714037205a461b06", "creator": "@@kudialisLVSun", "site": "@LasVegasSun", "card": "summary", "account_id": 12055942}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-21T23:00", "author": "//lasvegassun.com/staff/chris-kudialis/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5afe\"", "article_summary": "In Las Vegas speech, Bill Clinton jabs Republicans, touts Hillary as unifierFormer President Bill Clinton criticized the Republican Party on Thursday night in Las Vegas while stumping for his wife and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a speech that touched on police brutality, health care and social equality.\nClinton said he was in favor of President Barack Obama\u2019s stance on health care, and affirmed his wife supported Obamacare.\n\u201cHillary thinks it would be a mistake to replace and repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201dHe said he believed a Hillary Clinton presidency would also help improve rising death rates of middle-age white Americans, a \u201cnational travesty\u201d that was reported in November.\n\u201cInstead of applauding their success, it turns into \u2018they\u2019re taking your jobs, and we have to build a wall,\u2019\u201d Clinton said.\nHe mentioned the success of Mexico in producing top-notch engineers as an example of Republicans ignoring important facts."}
