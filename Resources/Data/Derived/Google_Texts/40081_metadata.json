St. Cloud State tied it on Nick Oliver\u2019s fluke goal. Then it was all DU.\n\n\u201cWe just took over the game. It wasn\u2019t close,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cYou\u2019re waiting for a response from your team, and it was great to see. It was everybody.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: The University of Denver hosted St. Cloud State on Saturday, January 17, 2015.\n\nVanVoorhis got the primary assist on Danton Heinen\u2019s game-winner 6:50 into the third. Jaillet was flawless, with the only puck getting past him coming off an intended St. Cloud State pass that caromed in off the skate of defenseman Josiah Didier.\n\nJaillet, who came off the bench to backstop DU to Friday\u2019s 3-1 win in the series opener, has allowed just one goal in his past three appearances, including two starts.\n\nJaillet, 21, is older than sophomore Evan Cowley, 19, who has struggled in his last two starts.\n\n\u201cTanner is playing really well. He\u2019s really calm. Some of our players call him a miniature Sam Brittain,\u201d Montgomery said of DU\u2019s top goalie last season. \u201cI know we\u2019re going to need both goalies the rest of the year. Evan\u2019s really good and he\u2019s won us several games. He\u2019s going to get it back.\u201d\n\nReturning All-America defenseman Joey LaLeggia scored his eighth goal of the season with 6:55 remaining to clinch it for DU, and left winger Trevor Moore added further insurance with 5:15 to go.\n\nZajac and LaLeggia finished with multiple-point performances, and fourth-line winger Larkin Jacobson, top-four defenseman Will Butcher, second-line center Quentin Shore and third-line center Gabe Levin had assists.\n\nDU (13-7-1, 6-5) got a little to a lot from everyone to sweep St. Cloud (9-12-1, 4-7), the defending NCHC regular-season champion.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "DU Pioneers complete sweep of St. Cloud State with 4-1 victory", "title": "DU Pioneers complete sweep of St. Cloud State with 4-1 victory", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/17/du-pioneers-complete-sweep-of-st-cloud-state-with-4-1-victory/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150117__denver-hockeyp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150117__denver-hockeyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-17T21:37:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T11:32:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NCAA hockey, University of Denver"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6a2\"", "article_summary": "DU (13-7-1, 6-5) got a little to a lot from everyone to sweep St.\nCloud State before a crowd of 5,048 fans at Magness Arena.\nCloud State pass that caromed in off the skate of defenseman Josiah Didier.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real good sweep,\u201d DU coach Jim Montgomery said.\nCloud State on Saturday, January 17, 2015."}
