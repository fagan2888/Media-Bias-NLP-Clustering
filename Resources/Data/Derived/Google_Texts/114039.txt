Donald Trump (Vine)

Long before he became the de facto face of the Republican Party and a Twitter troll par excellence, billionaire businessman Donald Trump had a Vine account for a brief moment in time.

According to Business Insider the account was created in 2013 and — as might be expected — topics covered by Trump in the 10 Vines he created before pulling the plug on the social media experiment seem a little outdated.

Multiple Vine’s are dedicated to Trump bashing former Congressman Anthony Weiner who resigned after sharing pictures of his penis with admirers on Twitter, and Trump mocking Obamacare, New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez (“a joke’) and rapper Mac Miller for name-checking Trump in a song.

On the more upbeat side, Trump had high praise for pop singer Miley Cyrus, telling the then 20-year-old, “Miley, don’t let them get you down. They’re just jealous.”
