That\u2019s shortsighted and vain. And yes, there are serious problems with sexism and age discrimination \u2013 problems which manifest themselves with some ugly behavior.\n\nBut such ethical problems aren\u2019t solely, or even primarily, the product of individual character defects. They\u2019re the result of self-reinforcing cultural norms at work. Anthropologists and sociologists could do worse than study the tech culture of the Silicon Valley. It would be important work, in fact, because this insular culture is having a deep and lasting impact on our economy and society.\n\nHere, to star them off, are five socially destructive aspects of Silicon Valley culture:\n\n1. Tech products become the byproducts of a money-making scheme rather than an end unto themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s almost inevitable when big money enters the picture: Smart or talented people are drawn to a field for the chance to get rich, not necessarily because it\u2019s where their greatest talents or dreams lie. The same thing has happened to fields as diverse as film, pop music, and the financial sector. There\u2019s nothing wrong with getting rich, but it should be the byproduct of a happy marriage between talent and inspiration.\n\nBut here\u2019s how it works instead: The goal of entrepreneurs and innovators was once summed up in the cliched phrase, \u201cbuild a better mousetrap.\u201d But for many Silicon Valley products and services, including services like Uber and AirBnB, the goal now is to build a product which can be hyped into a multi-billion-dollar valuation \u2013 preferably by winning as much market share as possible, and then using that market position to engage in the kinds of practices usually reserved for monopolies and monopsonies (markets in which there is only one buyer). This process is described in more detail here.\n\nInstead of building a better mousetrap, the new Silicon Valley business model works like this:\n\ni. Give your \u201cmousetrap\u201d away for free, or as close to free as you can make it. (Since you\u2019re working with digital signals transmitted over a government-invented network, that can usually be done at minimal cost. In other cases it pays to benefit from a government tax loophole (see Amazon) or make an end run around the regulations your competitors must follow (see Uber, Lyft, and AirBnB).\n\nii. Use these government-conferred advantages, along with your own aggressive market moves, to gain a large or decisive marketshare. (See Amazon, Facebook, etc.) In exceptional cases, actually build brilliant and superior software to win your market share. (See Google.)\n\niii. Use your newfound market share to a) bend government to your will wherever possible, b) screw down your suppliers\u2019 prices, c) hit your customers with increased prices and/or new ads or other profit-making devices, and d) manipulate your customers without their knowledge. (See Uber, Amazon, Google, Facebook, et al.)\n\nThis business model has directed much of the Valley\u2019s efforts away from inventing genuinely creative new products \u2013 and toward the kinds of aggressive tactics that, as we\u2019ve written before, would be very familiar to the Robber Barons of the 19th century.\n\n2. Even inspired leaders internalize a worldview which places profits over humane behavior.\n\nSteve Jobs is a prime example of this phenomenon. As an early innovator in the tech field, Jobs \u2013 however interested he was in making money \u2013 was not drawn to the field for the sake of money alone. Nor was he following in the footsteps of others, seeking to replicate the successes of a Zuckerberg or a Sergey Brin, as newcomers to the field are now. Jobs possessed a genuinely inspired design vision, from the earliest days of his career to his last.\n\nAnd yet, for all his gifts, the pursuit of wealth led Jobs to commit some morally reprehensible deeds. As \u201cwhite collar criminologist\u201d William K. Black Jr. told me in a 2012 radio interview, Jobs\u2019 drive to maximize profits \u2013 and his craving to get new products to market as quickly as possible \u2013 almost certainly led him to knowingly ignore abuses and safety threats to the Chinese workers who built his products. That, in turn, led to dormitory-based workers being forced to work under extreme conditions. These unheeded warnings also led to the horrific burning deaths of several workers.\n\nAmazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos is also unquestionably an innovator. But the working conditions which Amazon\u2019s warehouse workers endure would seem familiar to their Apple counterparts in China. As documented by Simon Head in his book \u201cMindless: Why Smarter Machines Are Making Dumber Humans\u201d (excerpt here), Amazon\u2019s American warehouse workers are subjected to ever-harsher production expectations and invasive measurement techniques. Head documents the case of a Pennsylvania employee who worked 11-hour shifts and was ultimately fired for \u201cunproductive periods\u201d which lasted only minutes. GPS devices in an England warehouse tell workers which routes they must travel \u2013 inside the warehouse \u2013 and their expected travel time.\n\nAmazon\u2019s German operations employed \u201ca security firm with alleged neo-Nazi connections that \u2026 intimidated temporary workers lodged in a company dormitory \u2026 with guards entering their rooms without permission at all times of the day and night.\u201d An Allentown facility which lacked air conditioning repeatedly reached temperatures of more than 100 degrees one summer. More than fifteen workers collapsed, but supervisors refused to open garage doors. Reports Head: \u201cCalls to the local ambulance service became so frequent that for five hot days in June and July, ambulances and paramedics were stationed all day at the depot.\u201d\n\nA number of Silicon Valley CEOs were also implicated in a widespread conspiracy to illegally suppress wages and prevent job-seeking from engineers and other key employees. Mark Ames, who has reported extensively on the conspiracy, wrote that \u201cconfidential internal Google and Apple memos \u2026 clearly show that what began as a secret cartel agreement between Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs and Google\u2019s Eric Schmidt to illegally fix the labor market for hi-tech workers, expanded within a few years to include companies ranging from Dell, IBM, eBay and Microsoft, to Comcast, Clear Channel, Dreamworks, and London-based public relations behemoth WPP.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The tech industry is morally and ethically bankrupt, and it's starting to take its toll on ordinary Americans", "author": "Richard Eskow", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The tech industry is morally and ethically bankrupt, and it's starting to take its toll on ordinary Americans", "title": "Rise of the techno-Libertarians: The 5 most socially destructive aspects of Silicon Valley", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/12/rise_of_the_techno_libertarians_the_5_most_socially_destructive_aspects_of_silicon_valley_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_181985711-e1449168898686.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The tech industry is morally and ethically bankrupt, and it's starting to take its toll on ordinary Americans", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/shutterstock_181985711-e1449168898686.jpg", "title": "Rise of the techno-Libertarians: The 5 most socially destructive aspects of Silicon Valley", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Rise of the techno-Libertarians: The 5 most socially destructive aspects of Silicon Valley", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Baking techniques, libertarian, Silicon Valley", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Baking techniques, libertarian, Silicon Valley, Technology News, NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetNowadays the Silicon Valley is either celebrated as a hotbed of creativity or condemned as a cauldron of greed and wealth inequality.\nHere, to star them off, are five socially destructive aspects of Silicon Valley culture:1.\nAnthropologists and sociologists could do worse than study the tech culture of the Silicon Valley.\nInstead of building a better mousetrap, the new Silicon Valley business model works like this:i.\nBut the working conditions which Amazon\u2019s warehouse workers endure would seem familiar to their Apple counterparts in China."}
