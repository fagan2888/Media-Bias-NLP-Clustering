Americans may be wondering if home values are in jeopardy or whether to hold off on buying or selling a house.\n\nThe number of new home sales in September dropped 15.2 percent from August to an annual rate of 468,000 units, sharply lower than estimates and the lowest level since November 2014. Pending sales of previously owned homes also fell 2.3 percent in September, surprising economists who expected a slight increase.\n\n\u201cIn short, disappointing numbers. Taken literally, they suggest that home sales have stopped improving,\u201d Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. economist of High Frequency Economics, wrote. \u201cThe new home sales data earlier this week were even weaker.\u201d\n\nRelated: A New Housing Bubble? Some Buyers Are Camping Out for Lots\n\nBut O\u2019Sullivan attributes the weakening to volatility rather than any underlying issues, echoing many other economists.\n\nDon\u2019t sound the alarm\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to go on month-to-month data. Anything can happen in a given month like weather,\u201d says Jim Gaines, chief economist at the Texas A&M University\u2019s Real Estate Center. \u201cEvery month, they change the previous month\u2019s estimate, so you can\u2019t get too carried away. The pattern over the last several months shows that the housing sector is doing well.\u201d\n\nThe report on new home sales comes with a large margin of error, says Chris Christopher, director of U.S. macro and global economics at IHS Global Insight. To smooth out the volatility, it\u2019s better to look at the three-month moving average which shows that sales are about 15 percent higher than the same period a year ago.\n\nA few bright spots\n\nChristopher further noted that the week offered some positive housing news. The widely watched Standard & Poor\u2019s/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index showed that national home prices rose 4.7 percent in August year over year. That year-over-year gain is slightly lower than the index\u2019s nearly 40-year average of 5.04 percent.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Home Prices Are Climbing So Quickly\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an indicator of the housing market gaining traction,\u201d he says.\n\nMore work to be done\n\nThe homeownership rate in the U.S. also ticked up for the first time in two years, to 63.7 percent in the third quarter to 63.4 percent in the second quarter. Still, the rate remains below last year\u2019s level.\n\nGaines also added that new home sales have moderated around 500,000 annual units, which is well below the 800,000- to 900,000-unit level that the economy needs.\n\n\u201cWhile the trend has been positive, the upward trend is still at a low level,\u201d Gaines says. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting back to the level it needs to be a robust stimulus for the economy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A pair of downbeat housing reports this week offer a slightly darker outlook on the na", "title": "U.S. Housing Gets Hit with a Double Whammy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/29/US-Housing-Gets-Hit-Double-Whammy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08082011_House_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/29/US-Housing-Gets-Hit-Double-Whammy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08082011_House_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A pair of downbeat housing reports this week offer a slightly darker outlook on the na", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A pair of downbeat housing reports this week offer a slightly darker outlook on the nation\u2019s housing market.\n\u201cThe new home sales data earlier this week were even weaker.\u201dRelated: A New Housing Bubble?\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Home Prices Are Climbing So Quickly\u201cThat\u2019s an indicator of the housing market gaining traction,\u201d he says.\nA few bright spotsChristopher further noted that the week offered some positive housing news.\nPending sales of previously owned homes also fell 2.3 percent in September, surprising economists who expected a slight increase."}
