I find it confusing as I read letters to the editor from people who are defending Planned Parenthood. I am not aware of anything in the recent videos exposing Planned Parenthood's trafficking in body parts of unborn children that would suggest anyone wants to take away legitimate health care for women.

I just don't understand why a private organization should receive half a billion dollars in federal taxpayer funds. I thought Obamacare was supposed to take care of women's health.

The issue is Planned Parenthood's admission that it performs abortions past the legal limit, then dissects and sells the organs and tissue of children who may have been born alive.

If this were Nazi Germany, I would understand the defense of doing this for the greater good. But this is America. We have always stood for life. Or have we?
