UnitedHealth Group, Incorporated, WellCare Health Plans, Inc. and WellPoint, Inc. The report is meant to be used as a desktop guide, providing financial data and rankings, key credit strengths and concerns, and current ratings levels and rating sensitivities. Fitch views the key credit metrics of these nine publicly traded health insurers as improving in the first half of 2014 compared to the prior year period. Strong revenue growth driven by the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) exchanges and Medicaid expansion, continuing popularity of Medicare Advantage products and acquisition-related growth generated increases in EBITDA that more than offset declining margins. Interest coverage ratios improved, and leverage ratios declined modestly. The first section of the report includes company rankings based on revenue growth, EBITDA margin and returns on capital as well as capitalization measures such as debt-to-EBITDA and financial leverage. The second section of the report provides a more detailed discussion of the nine individual companies including credit strengths and concerns, ratings and rating triggers (where applicable), and detailed information about each company's capital structure. The report 'U.S. Health Insurance: Credit Metrics Update' is available on the Fitch web site at 'www.fitchratings.com'.
