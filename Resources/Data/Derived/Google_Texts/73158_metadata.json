Missouri, where Appelbaum lives, is one of the 34 states that did not set up its own healtchare exchange. \u201cI finished my radiation treatment this morning. I am still just processing it all. I am really, really, really happy right now that I got through this part. I still have surgery and stuff to go, but I got through the chemo and radiation.\u201d\n\nTo her, these were big hurdles.\n\nJust months after she and her husband purchased their insurance through one of the exchanges, Appelbaum was diagnosed with breast cancer. Their insurance, provided by Anthem Blue Cross, costs just $180 a month thanks to subsidies that cover about $600 a month.\n\nWhen the supreme court first heard the King v Burwell case in March, Appelbaum was on the way to one of her chemotherapy appointments. At that time, she had four more chemotherapy appointments left, to be followed by radiation.\n\nRelated: King v Burwell: 'The Republicans and the supreme court might kill me rather than my cancer'\n\n\u201cI am petrified, to be quite honest, of what can happen. I am more scared right now that the Republicans and the supreme court might kill me rather than my cancer,\u201d she said then, crying.\n\n\u201cI know that\u2019s horrible to say, but I feel like I am getting the treatment I need. My doctors are wonderful. And then I get scared whenever I hear that they might take the subsidies away or they might repeal it. I honestly don\u2019t know how we would pay for this.\u201d\n\nIt has been more than three months since the hearing, and in that time Appelbaum has been able to complete the most expensive parts of her treatment. Last week, as she finished her radiation treatment, Appelbaum took a photo with her radiation therapists. In it, she is holding a sign that reads: \u201cThe ACA is working!\u201d\n\nLaDonna Applebaum on her last day of radiation treatment, holding a sign that reads: \u2018The ACA is working!\u2019 Photograph: Courtesy of LaDonna Applebaum\n\n\u201cI still have a ways to go. I have to have surgery after my skin heals. I look like a cooked chicken wing,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cIt really does just cook your skin. I have to wait four months for my skin to heal and then my doctor is going to look at my skin and try to pinpoint when we would do a reconstructive surgery. That\u2019s what I have ahead of me now.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, after the supreme court ruled, Appelbaum was crying once more. They were happy tears.\n\n\u201cWe are celebrating. We are just hugging and crying right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI am just so relieved.\u201d\n\nBesides more visits to the doctor, her to-do list now also includes pushing for expansion of Medicaid.\n\n\u201cLegislators have to realize how important healthcare is to the state of Missouri,\u201d said Appelbaum. \u201cThat\u2019s what I am going to be working for.\u201d\n\nSue Martin, 64, North Carolina\n\nFor Sue Martin, this was going to be just a regular Thursday. Except it wasn\u2019t.\n\nAlong with her youngest granddaughter, she went to McDonald\u2019s for breakfast only to come home and find out that the supreme court upheld the subsidies in her state \u2013 something she had been worrying might not happen.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that I am relieved now that I don\u2019t have to worry about healthcare again,\u201d she told the Guardian on Thursday. \u201cI am still going to be active in trying to push our governor and general assembly here in North Carolina to expand Medicaid.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rate of uninsured Americans drops among poor and minority groups\n\nAccording to her, there are about 700,000 people who would get coverage if North Carolina expanded Medicaid.\n\n\u201cEven though this [supreme court] decision will help those who already have insurance, it hasn\u2019t done anything for those stuck in that gap,\u201d she said.\n\nStates that expanded their Medicaid coverage saw greater drops in their uninsured rates than those that had not. A recent study found that states with expanded Medicaid coverage had 13.3% of uninsured adults under 65, while the states that did not expand their coverage had 19.6% of uninsured adults.\n\nAfter being married for 30 years, Martin and her husband divorced in 2000 and she was not able to keep his military benefits, including health insurance. Over the next 16 years, she had insurance for about three and half years.\n\n\u201cI had health insurance and then it would get too expensive and then I\u2019d have to drop it,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cWhen the Affordable Care Act came along, I was thrilled.\u201d\n\nThe law came about at a perfect time for Martin, who became ill in 2012.\n\n\u201cNo one knew what was the matter and I didn\u2019t have health insurance and that, man, that was really tough. I just kept getting sicker and sicker and I really wasn\u2019t able to see a doctor until I got the insurance.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Susan Martin: \u2018I just kept getting sicker and sicker and I wasn\u2019t able to see a doctor until I got the insurance.\u2019 Photograph: Courtesy of Susan Martin\n\nOnce she was able to see a doctor, Martin was diagnosed with Lyme disease and two other tick-borne diseases.\n\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the subsidies, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford the insurance. Right now, I am paying $238 a month and I make right now about $26,000 a year \u2013 gross. That\u2019s before taxes. I don\u2019t have a whole lot extra. If I don\u2019t have the subsidy, I would not be able to afford it,\u201d she said.\n\nMarilyn Schramm, 63, Texas\n\nMarilyn Schramm, a retired lawyer, had just downloaded the supreme court\u2019s decision and was getting ready to read it when she was reached by the Guardian.\n\n\u201cI am happy that I don\u2019t have to make another major decision in the near future,\u201d said Schramm, who was diagnosed with colon cancer last year while traveling around the US. (The supreme court isn\u2019t as lucky, as it still has to rule on same-sex marriage.)\n\n\u201cPlease just get me to Medicare age before these Republicans try to take away my healthcare once again. I am sure they are not done,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got \u2013 what? \u2013 16 months left till I turn 65, so if I can just get through the next year and a half ...\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marilynn Schramm: \u2018Please just let me get to Medicare age before these Republicans try to take away my healthcare once again.\u2019 Photograph: Courtesy of Marilyn Schramm\n\nCurrently Schramm\u2019s health insurance costs about $400 a month, and that\u2019s with a $300 monthly subsidy. She also has a $4,500 deductible.\n\n\u201cI am still paying off bills, but I am getting close to it. With the cost of chemo and all the doctor\u2019s appointments and the cost of the colostomy supplies \u2013 which are subject to my deductible \u2013 I have almost met that deductible,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how people can afford those damn colostomy bags. It\u2019s unbelievable. You gotta have them. I can\u2019t believe how expensive it is.\u201d\n\n\n\nObama Subsidy interactive Nadja Popovich for the Guardian.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Schramm finished her chemotherapy. But if she had been diagnosed with more tumors in the coming months and the supreme court had ruled to strike down the subsidies, she was planning to dip into her savings and retirement fund to pay for better health insurance \u2013 or to move out of Texas. According to her, without her subsidy her health insurance would become unaffordable. At 25.7%, Texas has one of the highest uninsured rates.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is no point in having savings if you\u2019re going to die,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d probably use that in short term, but in the long term, I would be looking to move to a state that has a state exchange,\u201d she said.\n\nThanks to the supreme court\u2019s ruling on Thursday, Schramm can stay put in Texas \u2013 or even go back to traveling the US in her RV, like she did before she was diagnosed.\n\nHer top two choices for a new place to live are New Mexico and Florida \u2013 neither of which, she points out, has a state exchange.\n\nBarbara Fox, 59, Arizona\n\nBarbara Fox cannot afford to move to a different state. She also can\u2019t get a full-time job. Keeping her subsidy is the only way she says she could afford her health insurance.\n\nIn 2012, Fox, who is an adjunct professor at a local community college, was diagnosed with breast cancer and was given less than a year to live.\n\n\u201cEssentially they said: \u2018We are not going to be able to cure this but we can definitely buy you time.\u2019 I was scared. I was terrified because I had no money and no insurance,\u201d said Fox. She relied on a pre-existing condition insurance plan (PCIP), which was available through a state program, until the Affordable Care Act was implemented.\n\nRight now Fox pays about $220 a month. Her subsidy covers about $300.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor the coverage that I am getting \u2013 the fact that it covers previous conditions, the fact that it doesn\u2019t flinch at cancer treatments, the fact that my copays are reasonable and the pharmacy prescription requirements allow me to get the drugs I need \u2013 it\u2019s a remarkable bargain. I haven\u2019t found a downside to it yet,\u201d she said.\n\nShe calls her insurance her \u201cpersonal miracle\u201d \u2013 and thanks to the supreme court\u2019s decision, she gets to keep it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "For 9 million people, Thursday\u2019s ruling on the Affordable Care Act was a potentially life-saving decision: \u2018We are celebrating.
