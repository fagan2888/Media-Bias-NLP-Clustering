Southwest said there were 126 passengers onboard.\n\nAuthorities were made aware of the threat at about 5:15 p.m. and the plane landed safely at DIA at 6:36 p.m.\n\nMontgomery said the flight was bound for Denver, not diverted to DIA for a landing.\n\nSouthwest spokesman Brad Hawkins said he could not immediately identify the nature of the threat.\n\n\u201cOut of an abundance of caution, the captain in command of Flight 3456 from Baltimore/Washington to Denver has stopped short of the gate after an uneventful landing to allow the authorities at Denver International Airport access to the aircraft,\u201d he said in an e-mail.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have further details to share except to reiterate that the safe operation of every flight is a shared priority of all agencies and operators involved in commercial aviation. Our employees are working with any of the 126 customers whose travel plans will be impacted by the delayed arrival at the terminal. The aircraft is scheduled to travel on to Orange County this evening.\u201d\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Threat to Southwest flight deemed non-credible", "title": "Threat to Southwest flight deemed non-credible", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/04/threat-to-southwest-flight-deemed-non-credible/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150704_073958_twitter.com-CJHTcs9WcAE5et0-.jpg", "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150704_073958_twitter.com-CJHTcs9WcAE5et0-.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-04T18:58:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T15:23:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Denver International Airport"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb05\"", "article_summary": "A Southwest Airlines plane finishing a flight from Baltimore to Denver was parked in a remote area at Denver International Airport Saturday evening because of an unspecified security threat that was later deemed non-credible.\nAmy Sanders, a spokeswoman for the FBI, said in an e-mail, \u201cThe threat was deemed non-credible at this time,\u201d but would not identify the nature of the threat.\nSouthwest spokesman Brad Hawkins said he could not immediately identify the nature of the threat.\nShe added no one was detained or arrested \u201cat this time.\u201dDIA spokesman Heath Montgomery said the passengers aboard Southwest Flight 3456 were shuttled to the main terminal by bus.\nAuthorities were made aware of the threat at about 5:15 p.m. and the plane landed safely at DIA at 6:36 p.m.Montgomery said the flight was bound for Denver, not diverted to DIA for a landing."}
