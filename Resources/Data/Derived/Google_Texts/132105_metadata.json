But private analysts said the up to one-third percentage funding increase could be valued anywhere from the hundreds of millions to billions of dollars.\n\nRep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) said that China, through the PLA, has developed one of the most sophisticated cyber capabilities in the world.\n\n\u201cThey have stolen hundreds of billions of dollars of intellectual property from U.S. businesses and continue to commit this theft,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cThe Chinese have now increased their capacity to conduct massive attacks and continue to consider this weapon as a primary tool in their are arsenal.\u201d\n\nA CIA spokesman declined to comment. Chinese Embassy spokesman Zhu Haiquan declined to directly address China\u2019s increased cyber spending. \u201cChina advocates for the peaceful use of cyberspace. Efforts should be made by the international community to prevent militarization of cyberspace and a cyber arms race,\u201d Zhu said.\n\nThe increase in cyber warfare funding is part of what China\u2019s military calls its \u201cinformation warfare\u201d program and was outlined in the latest Chinese defense budget unveiled in early March.\n\nChina\u2019s government announced March 4 that defense spending this year will increase by 10 percent from last year\u2019s budget to around $143.6 billion.\n\nThat official figure, however, excludes China\u2019s spending on strategic nuclear forces, foreign weapons imports, military space programs, and research and development. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that Chinese defense spending could be 55 percent higher than official figures.\n\nChina has been sharply increasing its defense spending nearly every year by double-digit percentages as part of an effort to modernize its military.\n\nThe boost in Chinese cyber warfare programs followed a meeting in September of the ruling Communist Party Politburo when General Secretary and President Xi Jinping called for adopting a new information warfare strategy.\n\nState-run Chinese television reported Sept. 2 that Xi called for \u201cmore military innovation in China and a new strategy for information warfare amid a global military revolution.\u201d The directive was made during an Aug. 29 meeting of the Communist Party Politburo.\n\n\u201cXi Jinping encouraged the army to change fixed mindsets on mechanized warfare and create a concept of information warfare, as the country faces escalating tensions on intelligence issues with other countries,\u201d the report stated.\n\nXi also called for greater PLA efforts to \u201ccounter non-traditional security threats,\u201d including economic threats, and to increase joint military operations between Chinese military regions \u201cto improve combat capabilities.\u201d\n\nChinese military hacking into both government and private sector U.S. computer networks prompted the Justice Department to indict five PLA hackers on May 1.\n\nDefense specialists said determining the amount China spends on cyber warfare programs is very difficult as the programs are among China\u2019s most secret operations.\n\nRichard A. Bitzinger, a specialist on Chinese defense issues at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said China does not disclose details of its military budget, although it has said that about a third, or around $45 billion a year, is spent on \u201cequipment,\u201d including research and development and procurement.\n\n\u201cHow much of this is for cyber, I can\u2019t begin to guess,\u201d he said, noting that operations and support funding also might fund cyber programs. \u201cI can imagine that it\u2019s in the billions, nationwide, and certainly in the hundreds of millions within the Chinese military. It\u2019s likely that even a ballpark figure is unobtainable, given how disparate China\u2019s overall cyber activities are.\n\nCyber warfare and intelligence activities also are spread out among the military and its electronic intelligence service, the civilian Ministry of State Security, as well as semi-official technical institutes and universities, making funding estimates difficult.\n\nPaul Rosenzweig, a cyber security expert and former Department of Homeland Security policymaker, said China regards itself as a close competitor of the United States in the cyber domain and views cyber capabilities as a way of \u201cleveling the playing field.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have previously devoted substantial resources to cyber espionage and theft,\u201d Rosenzweig said. \u201cIt is unsurprising that they are, likewise, investing heavily in more \u2018conventional\u2019 cyber warfare capabilities.\u201d\n\nOver the longer term, \u201cChina\u2019s vision of combined operations, with cyber as a strong component of its capability, will significantly challenge American freedom of action in the Pacific,\u201d Rosenzweig added.\n\nWhile China\u2019s cyber warfare and cyber espionage programs are secret, Chinese military writings have provided some insights into Beijing\u2019s thinking on the subject.\n\n\u201cIt is anticipated in the foreseeable future that it is extremely likely for cyber warfare to assist or even replace conventional firepower damage means as a major player in modern and future wars,\u201d states an Oct. 1, 2013 technical paper in the journal China Military Science.\n\n\u201cIn conventional warfare, material media associated with kinetic energy, such as knifes, bullets, artillery shells and missiles are used as the damage media,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn cyber warfare, computer technology represented by the Internet, or \u2018information flow\u2019 is used as the warring media. Warring parties only need to click a mouse to complete the entire attacking process.\u201d\n\nCyber attacks also are not limited to military personnel but can also be carried out by civilian hackers, and can be conducted anonymously in order to complicate efforts to respond, the report said.\n\nAnother factor that may have contributed to the decision by Chinese leaders to increase cyber warfare capabilities were disclosures of U.S. cyber operations by the renegade National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.\n\nLate last year, NSA documents provided to Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel revealed that the NSA is so proficient at cyber operations that it can break into the communications networks used by foreign spy agencies and steal the data they are collecting clandestinely from agents.\n\nThe technique was called \u201cI drink your milkshake\u201d in the NSA documents, a reference to a line about covertly drilling oil from someone else\u2019s well in the 2007 film There Will Be Blood.\n\nRick Fisher, a China military affairs expert with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, said gauging Chinese cyber warfare efforts is difficult because of Beijing\u2019s lack of transparency.\n\nHowever, the Chinese boost could be related to the Snowden disclosures, Fisher said.\n\n\u201cSnowden\u2019s revelations obtained by Chinese and then Russian intelligence services, which they likely shared, also likely betrayed superior U.S. cyber capabilities\u2014some detailed in subsequent press reports\u2014that China is now trying to match or exceed,\u201d Fisher said.\n\n\u201cChina today already poses the most pervasive cyber threat to the world in terms of its rapacious appetite for government, corporate, and financial information,\u201d he added, noting the increased effort could be dubbed a \u201cSnowden Effect\u201d that will increase the cyber threat to the United States.\n\nThe U.S. military is seeking $5.5 billion for cyber activities in the fiscal year 2016 budget, a figure that was questioned last month by Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, as it turns out, the budget is disproportionately focused on network infrastructure with only eight percent of that $5.5 billion allocated for Cyber Command and the development of our cyber mission forces,\u201d McCain said on March 19.\n\nAdm. Mike Rogers, head of the U.S. Cyber Command, testified that cyber threats are \u201cpervasive\u201d and adversaries growing in sophistication.\n\n\u201cOur military networks are probed for vulnerabilities literally thousands of times per day,\u201d Rogers said at a Senate hearing March 19. \u201cThe very assets within our military that provide us formidable advantages over any adversary are precisely the reason that our enemies seek to map, understand, exploit and potentially disrupt our global network architecture.\u201d\n\nCyber attackers seek not only to disrupt military action but also \u201cto establish a persistent presence on our networks,\u201d Rogers aid. \u201cQuite simply, threats and vulnerabilities are changing and expanding at an accelerated and alarming pace in our mission set.\u201d\n\nRogers said the sophistication of cyber attackers includes nations that are attempting to \u201cconfuse our attribution ability by creating different relationships\u201d in cyber space.\n\n\u201cFor example, using other partners, trying to distance themselves in a visible way so their activity is not as directly attributable,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Up to a 30 percent increase", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "China\u2019s government is sharply increasing its investment in cyber warfare programs in what U.S. intelligence officials say is a major attempt to compete with superior U.S. military cyber capabilities", "title": "China Sharply Boosts Cyber Warfare Funding", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/china-sharply-boosts-cyber-warfare-funding/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/China-hack-site-AP-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "China\u2019s government is sharply increasing its investment in cyber warfare programs in what U.S. int", "creator": "@BillGertz", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/China-hack-site-AP-150x150.jpg", "title": "China Sharply Boosts Cyber Warfare Funding", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @BillGertzChina\u2019s government is sharply increasing its investment in cyber warfare programs in what U.S. intelligence officials say is a major attempt to compete with superior U.S. military cyber capabilities.\nThe official said new intelligence reports indicate Beijing has \u201cmade a long term strategic commitment\u201d to bolstering cyber warfare efforts.\nWhile China\u2019s cyber warfare and cyber espionage programs are secret, Chinese military writings have provided some insights into Beijing\u2019s thinking on the subject.\n\u201cHow much of this is for cyber, I can\u2019t begin to guess,\u201d he said, noting that operations and support funding also might fund cyber programs.\n\u201cIn cyber warfare, computer technology represented by the Internet, or \u2018information flow\u2019 is used as the warring media."}
