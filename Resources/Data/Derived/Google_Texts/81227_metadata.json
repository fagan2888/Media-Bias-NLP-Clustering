He\u2019s just one sick pup among many ailing sea lions overwhelming marine mammal centers in California. Nearly 1,000 have washed ashore so far this year.\n\nEmaciated and dehydrated sea lions, mostly pups about 8 months old, have been admitted in record numbers to facilities up and down the California coast. It\u2019s the third straight year of record strandings in the state.\n\nFive hundred fifty sea lions were being treated statewide as of Feb. 18, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries.\n\nRescuers are swamped.\n\nPeter Wallerstein of Marine Animal Rescue works in much of Los Angeles County. He said he received calls about Walter before the young sea lion wandered into the complex. But as long as the pup was out of the way of people, he was on the back burner for rescue.\n\n\u201cBut then this lady called me and said he was up in the parking lot. So I responded immediately because I knew it would be bad for him,\u201d Wallerstein said.\n\nThere are so many strandings right now we cannot possibly pick up all the pups,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t seem to understand.\u201d\n\nWallerstein\u2019s two-person rescue team receives two dozen or more calls a day. He said he\u2019d been rescuing marine mammals for 29 years and \u201cfor January and February, it\u2019s the highest number of rescues I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe same day Marina del Rey residents called about Walter, Roxanne McCann was walking along Las Flores Beach in Malibu when she spotted a thin sea lion pup on the shore.\n\n\u201cThe poor little thing looked like it was struggling,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody thinks it\u2019s a cute story. People don\u2019t understand that they\u2019re not well.\u201d\n\nA neighbor\u2019s call to a rescue hotline didn\u2019t produce quick results. The neighbor later received a message saying there would be no action that day, McCann said.\n\nCalifornia Wildlife performs marine mammal rescues in the Malibu area. A recording at the emergency line cautions that the \u201cextreme high call volume\u201d means animals may not be rescued on the day they\u2019re spotted. \u201cWe also may not be able to return every phone call of a reported marine mammal.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, researchers from NOAA\u2019s National Marine Mammal Laboratory visited sea lion rookeries on the Channel Islands, where most of America\u2019s sea lions breed, in a search for clues to the high number of strandings.\n\nThey measured and weighed pups and found them to be considerably underweight, with an average growth rate that was the lowest they had seen since they began monitoring in the early 1990s.\n\nThe pups\u2019 weight was similar to that in 2013, the year of an \u201cunusual mortality event\u201d for sea lions, a phenomenon characterized by an unexpected number of strandings and significant die-off of a marine mammal population.\n\nIn 2013, the Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro was treating two to three times as many California sea lions as usual. David Bard, operations director, said that in the first two months of this year, the numbers are double what they were at the beginning of 2013.\n\nWallerstein remembers doing 25 rescues in the first two months of 2013. So far this year, he has rescued 117 marine mammals.\n\nScientists thought 2013 was an anomaly, said Shawn Johnson, director of veterinary services at the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito.\n\n\u201cBut then it happened again last year, and now it\u2019s happening again,\u201d he said.\n\nScientists are awaiting more data from the research on the Channel Islands, but NOAA Fisheries said higher-than-average sea surface temperatures along the California coast in fall 2014 may be a factor in the strandings.\n\nThe warmer water could have affected the availability of prey to the sea lions. Females sea lions might be spending more time and energy to obtain food, so pups are abandoned.\n\nAnother possibility is \u201cthe sea lion population is reaching carrying capacity,\u201d Bard said.\n\nCalifornia sea lions were exploited in the 19th and early 20th centuries for their hides and blubber and continued to be hunted for sport in some areas later in the 20th century. The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 led to significant increases in the populations of marine mammals, Johnson said. The population is now 300,000, with a birth rate of about 50,000 a year.\n\nThe environment simply may not be able to support a larger sea lion population. According to the Marine Mammal Center, experts don\u2019t believe the record strandings will affect California sea lion populations overall.\n\nStill, \u201cthe current stranding crisis is concerning because it indicates a more complex occurrence in the ocean,\u201d the center said in a statement. \u201cOur ocean is clearly under stress.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "People in Marina del Rey, Calif., were surprised when a sea lion pup wandered into their apartment complex.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "AMY HUBBARD Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "People in Marina del Rey, Calif., were surprised when a sea lion pup wandered into their apartment complex.", "title": "Stranded sea lions overwhelm animal rescue centers in Calif.", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/nation/stranded-sea-lions-overwhelm-animal-rescue-centers-calif", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_US_NEWS_ENV-SEALIONS_4_LA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/nation/stranded-sea-lions-overwhelm-animal-rescue-centers-calif", "creator": "@thedailyherald", "card": "summary", "title": "Stranded sea lions overwhelm animal rescue centers in Calif."}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1125433", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1125433", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Nation,Local News,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-22T23:50:57-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde706\"", "article_summary": "People in Marina del Rey, Calif., were surprised when a sea lion pup wandered into their apartment complex.\nFive hundred fifty sea lions were being treated statewide as of Feb. 18, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries.\nHe\u2019s just one sick pup among many ailing sea lions overwhelming marine mammal centers in California.\nIn 2013, the Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro was treating two to three times as many California sea lions as usual.\nAccording to the Marine Mammal Center, experts don\u2019t believe the record strandings will affect California sea lion populations overall."}
