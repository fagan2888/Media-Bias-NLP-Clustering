Muskogee Police are looking for a man and woman they say robbed a Dollar Tree discount store at gunpoint Tuesday night. The armed robbery took place just before 10 p.m. in the 900 block of West Shawnee.

Corporal Michael Mahan said a man and woman entered the store at closing time. The woman bought something and left and the man walked to the back of the store.

One of the clerks checked the bathrooms as part of the store closing procedure. That's when the male suspect confronted the clerk with a handgun, according to a news release. The man robbed the store of cash and one of the two clerks in the store of cash and a cell phone.

The two suspects left the store on foot.

The man is described as a black male in his 30s, about 155 pounds. He was wearing black shoes, a black shirt with a silver design and black jeans. The woman is described as a black female in her 30s with a thin build. Police say she's about 5'6" and was wearing a tank top.
