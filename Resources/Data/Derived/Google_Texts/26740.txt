Riverside Invests in 3D Printing Group Fisher/Unitech

The move follows a 3D printing software acquisition by MakerBot

Private equity firm the Riverside Co. has acquired Fisher/Unitech for an undisclosed amount.

Fisher, headquartered in Troy, Michigan, is a reseller of 3D solid modeling design software, 3D printing hardware and related products and services. The company has 13 locations with classroom facilities and sells products in 16 states. The company distributes Stratasys 3D printers and SolidWorks software.

3D solid modeling and additive manufacturing are increasingly being employed for a wide array of product design, prototype development and manufacturing applications, says Riverside partner Steve Dyke.

For Cleveland and New York-based Riverside, the deal comes just days after an investment in community development software Safebuilt. The firm's other recent acquisitions include the education division of LeaseHawk, which the firm added to Grace Hill, and a majority stake in audio and video marketing company Spectrio LLC.

Maranon Capital provided financing for the transaction and Jones Day advised Riverside.

Earlier in November, Stratasys subsidiary MakerBot bought software startup Layer by Layer. For more on 3D printing and MakerBot, see Six Sizzling Sectors: Manufacturing.
