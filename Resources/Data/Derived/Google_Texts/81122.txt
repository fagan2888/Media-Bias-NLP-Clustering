UC San Diego is named the ninth best public university in the country and 39th best overall in the annual U.S. News & World Report rankings.

UCSD has been among the top 10 public institutions of higher learning for the last decade. The rankings are based on academic reputation, graduation and retention rates, faculty resources, student selectivity, financial resources, graduate rate performance and alumni giving.

"It is an honor to once again have UC San Diego named as one of the nation's top public universities,'' said Chancellor Pradeep Khosla. "This ranking exemplifies UC San Diego's strong commitment to providing our students with a premier educational experience and demonstrates our dedication to academic excellence.''

UCSD was tied with UC Davis.

The University of San Diego and a couple of other several schools came in 91st overall. San Diego State University was tied for 152nd overall, and was among those named the 81st best public university.

Point Loma Nazarene was ranked as the 17th best regional university in the western U.S.
