The blaze, which burned for 36 hours, sent flames and smoke hundreds of feet into the air. At one point, the fire was pulling in so much oxygen that nearby trees were whipping about as if in a tropical storm. Several blocks from the blast site leaves turned an orange-red color from the overwhelming heat. It was early summer, but they looked like autumn foliage.\n\nThe explosions and fire destroyed some 40 buildings and killed 47 people, most of whom were enjoying live music at a popular cafe. Wooden homes along the lakeshore burned from the inside out as fire erupted out of water pipes, drains, and sewers. A 48-inch storm pipe that runs from the train yard to the nearby Chaudi\u00e8re River became a conduit for the petroleum, spewing flames and oil more than half a mile into the water. \u201cIt looked like a Saturn V rocket,\u201d says Robert Mercier, director of environmental services in Lac-M\u00e9gantic. Manhole covers on the Boulevard des Veterans exploded as columns of fire shot into the air.\n\nBy the time the fire had been contained, the soil surrounding the blast site was a layer of grey ash. \u201cIt was like being on the moon,\u201d says Sylvaine Perreault, an emergency responder who arrived early Saturday morning. \u201cIt was all dust.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, July 5, a 79-car train carrying petroleum from North Dakota\u2019s Bakken oil fields had been parked for the night on a modest but steady incline in the town of Nantes, seven miles outside of Lac-M\u00e9gantic. The sole engineer employed to secure the train and responsible for applying handbrakes in some of the cars left his shift at 11:25 p.m. At 11:30 p.m. a 911 call was made reporting a fire on one of the locomotives. Twelve firefighters from the town of Nantes arrived, along with two track-maintenance employees from Montreal, Maine & Atlantic, the company operating the train. They extinguished the fire and left the scene. Just before 1:00 a.m. the train began to roll down the incline. It eventually reached a speed of more than 60 miles per hour before it careened off the track toward the Musi Caf\u00e9 nightclub and exploded.\n\nRejean Campagna, a 73-year-old Lac-M\u00e9gantic native, was awoken by the sound of the train screeching past his apartment and then of steel piling on steel. \u201cAs if somebody had a big drum of steel and was hammering on it with a sledgehammer right beside my window,\u201d he told me. The train tracks are a scant 200 feet away from Campagna\u2019s front window, and when he opened the blinds the first thing he saw was a large ball of fire. \u201cIt grew and grew and grew and then it mushroomed.\u201d\n\nCampagna and his wife, Claudette Lapointe, grabbed their pillboxes and cell phones and fled. The hood of their car was so hot that he couldn\u2019t touch it. (According to Mercier, the heat could be felt for more than a mile.) From a safe distance, about a quarter-mile away, they watched as the town burned. In the early morning hours a steady rain began to fall. The surface of Campagna\u2019s umbrella was so warm that when the drops of water bounced off it they sent spirals of steam into the night. If not for the rain, Campagna says, the whole town would have been destroyed. \u201cThe rain saved us,\u201d he says.\n\nLapointe lost two cousins. Campagna knew everyone who lived in the homes along the lake, some of whom also died. Roger Paquette, a 61-year-old friend of Campagna\u2019s, could not be awoken in time. \u201cNeighbors tried to wake him up, but the back of his house was already on fire,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of these people never had a chance to get out of their homes, so swift was the flow of fire.\u201d\n\nLac-M\u00e9gantic residents had little warning they were in danger. Few residents interviewed for this article knew that millions of gallons of highly flammable light crude oil were passing through their lakeside village nearly every day. When it comes to transporting oil by rail, the railroad industry and oil and gas companies operate in near total secrecy, with little federal oversight or regulation to ensure public safety.\n\nThe oil moving through Lac-M\u00e9gantic was mislabeled \u2013 classified as packing group III instead of packing group II or I, which refer to more dangerous substances with lower flashpoints. A hazardous-materials inspection team issued safety warnings in 2011 and 2012, but no changes have been made to tank cars since then. Inspections of loading facilities in the Bakken oil fields conducted in October 2011 and June 2012 found that there were shortages of suitable rail cars; those in use were often being overloaded; and, because of the many different companies involved in transferring and shipping the oil, compliance was difficult to enforce. According to those inspection documents, which were obtained by NBC News shortly after the Lac-M\u00e9gantic accident, shippers were regularly using tank cars that did not meet industry specifications. \u201cThe pressure to ship those cars was more than the risk of failure in transportation or discovery by FRA [Federal Railroad Administration],\u201d the inspectors noted. They also said the oil was extremely flammable and warned truck drivers and inspectors to take special precautions. \u201cFire retardant clothing, and grounded equipment, truck and rail cars are mandatory due to the high flammability of the crude and possibility of static discharge.\u201d\n\nThe criminal investigation into the accident in Lac-M\u00e9gantic, which has focused on the question of whether the brakes were properly secured, was completed in late March. Charges had not been issued, though they were anticipated, when this story went to press.\n\nEven as federal regulators discuss new safety measures \u2013 updating or retrofitting the standard petroleum tank cars, reducing train speeds near towns, and performing spot inspections of oil trains \u2013 oil trains continue to roll through towns and cities across the United States and Canada. In the last six years the quantity of oil being shipped by rail across North America has increased dramatically. Most of that increase comes from the recently tapped shale oil fields in North Dakota. The Bakken formation is now producing more than one million barrels of crude oil a day, and more than 60 percent of that is shipped by rail. According to the American Association of Railroads, there were 9,500 rail cars carrying crude oil in 2008. Last year there were more than 400,000.\n\n\u201cThe Bakken shale has gone from close to nothing to a million barrels a day in a very short time,\u201d Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz told an Albany newspaper in February. \u201cAnd the infrastructure certainly just isn\u2019t there, certainly in terms of pipelines to manage that.\u201d That means more and more shale oil will be shipped by rail in outdated cars, on tracks that are rarely inspected, and through towns and cities ill equipped to deal with a disaster.\n\nSince the Lac-M\u00e9gantic disaster there has been a string of oil train collisions and derailments. Late on the night of November 7, a train carrying at least 2.7 million gallons of Bakken crude derailed near Aliceville, Alabama, resulting in dramatic explosions similar to those seen in Lac-M\u00e9gantic. Because the train exploded a few miles outside of Aliceville, no one was injured or killed. On December 30, a train carrying crude collided with another train outside of Casselton, North Dakota, releasing more than 400,000 gallons of oil into the surrounding land. At least half the town\u2019s 2,400 residents were evacuated, though no one was injured. And on April 30, an oil train operated by CSX derailed in the city of Lynchburg, Virginia, sending flames and oil into the James River and forcing the evacuation of more than 300 residents. Last year more oil spilled in rail accidents \u2013 1.15 million gallons \u2013 than the previous 35 years combined.\n\nThe economic and political pressure to move the oil far exceeds efforts to upgrade the nation\u2019s rail infrastructure and impose new regulations on either the oil or rail industry. Kenton Onstad, a North Dakota legislator who lives just outside New Town, where the train that exploded in Lac-M\u00e9gantic originated, says the nation\u2019s oil-by-rail infrastructure needs to be overhauled and that it should have started years ago. According to Onstad, public officials have known since 2009 that the amount of production from the Bakken would be close to what it is today, and yet they did little to prepare for the oil boom. \u201cI think it was economics and profits versus safety,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got all kinds of failings on all sides, inadequacies that are coming to light because trains are blowing up all over the place,\u201d says Fred Millar, a railway safety consultant.\n\nThe worries about basic railroad safety are compounded by concerns over the unique composition of Bakken shale oil. Independent tests obtained by Earth Island Journal suggest that the North Dakota light crude is especially flammable, perhaps because it is being produced at such a breakneck pace that drilling companies aren\u2019t following standard industry practices to separate out volatile gases. Each day millions of gallons of highly combustible oil are moving through major metropolitan areas \u2013 yet local residents and public officials are often unaware of the danger, and many first responders are unprepared for a disaster like the one that occurred in Quebec.\n\n\u201cI live in fear of waking up to a bunch of text messages and emails because there\u2019s been a 100-car explosion in Chicago and 300,000 people are vaporized,\u201d says Scott Smith, a researcher at the nonprofit group Water Defense and the inventor of Opflex, a foam sponge that absorbs oil and was used in the Gulf Coast after the BP oil spill. \u201cUnfortunately, that is a very real possibility if something\u2019s not done.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks before the Casselton collision, Lynn Helms, the director of North Dakota\u2019s Department of Mineral Resources and a chemical engineer, boasted that his agency was prepared to draft a white paper on the properties of Bakken crude \u201cto dispel this myth that it is somehow an explosive, really dangerous thing to have traveling up and down rail lines.\u201d Around the same time an agency spokeswoman was quoted as saying, \u201cCrude is crude.\u201d\n\nScott Smith knew otherwise. Smith, a citizen-scientist whose work has focused on oil spills, was at home on Cape Cod when he saw images of the fiery explosions in Lac-M\u00e9gantic. Having worked on several oil-spill cleanups in the past \u2013 including the BP blowout, Italy\u2019s Costa Concordia disaster, and China\u2019s Dalian pipeline explosion in 2010 \u2013 he knew this incident was somehow different. According to Smith, when conventional crude oil spills or leaks it rarely goes up in flames. In fact, one method of dealing with offshore oil spills is to try to burn off the oil in the hope that doing so will minimize damage to marine ecosystems. But getting it to burn is often a significant challenge. \u201cConventional crude on the surface never ever explodes, let alone vaporizes people like Hiroshima,\u201d Smith says. (Five of the 47 people killed in Lac-M\u00e9gantic were never found.)\n\nSmith and a pair of colleagues drove up to Lac-M\u00e9gantic, where they took samples of the oil from the Chaudiere River. The samples were then tested at an independent lab in Ohio, and later shared with a small group of scientists, including a visiting researcher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The results showed very high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in the oil. Unsatisfied with the lack of information on the characteristics of Bakken crude \u2013 and unable to get answers \u2013 Smith took a trip to North Dakota and obtained samples of oil from a landowner with an oil well on his property. As he pumped oil out of the ground, Smith says, he could hear the gases escaping. Smith returned to North Dakota after the train collision outside of Casselton and spent 36 hours documenting the spill and taking samples.\n\nSmith now has conducted detailed analyses of Bakken crude from the three accident sites in Quebec, North Dakota, and Alabama, along with baseline data. He says he is the only outside expert to have done so and has shared those lab results with Earth Island Journal . Even government agencies \u2013 including the US Department of Transportation (DOT), which is tasked with regulating oil by rail transport \u2013 have been largely kept in the dark about the qualities that make Bakken crude so volatile as well as how it varies throughout the formation. \u201cDespite the energy industry making assurances to DOT more than two months ago, we still lack data we requested and that energy stakeholders agreed to produce,\u201d a Department of Transportation spokesperson told Reuters in March.\n\nAll the samples collected and tested by Smith share the same high levels of VOCs and alkane gases in what Smith says are exceptional combinations. According to Smith, 30 to 40 percent of Bakken crude is made up of toxic and explosive gases. Typically these gases are separated out of the crude oil before transport. A recent report by the Pulitzer Prize-winning website Inside Climate News speculates that because of the whirlwind pace of production in North Dakota and the absence of processing facilities, volatile gases like propane are not being removed at the wellhead.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about Bakken crude, Smith says. This includes the presence of metals, radioactive materials, and gases. Because of the varying depths of the Bakken formation, two wells a mile apart can produce crude oil with very different characteristics. This makes sampling and testing especially tricky. It also makes industry cooperation essential.\n\nSmith still has vials of Bakken crude that he pumped out of the ground nearly a year ago. \u201cWhen it gets above 80 degrees and you shake them,\u201d he says, \u201cit bends the top of the container. Any form of static electricity will ignite this stuff and blow it up.\u201d\n\nIndependent reviews corroborate Smith\u2019s findings. Chemists with California\u2019s Office of Spill Prevention and Response examined Smith\u2019s samples and concluded that the Bakken crude \u201cresembles a typical crude oil that has been mixed with diesel or a diesel/gasoline mix. \u2026 Obviously, flammability and volatility are greater concerns with Bakken than with \u2018typical\u2019 heavier crudes.\u201d In February The Wall Street Journal , based on its own analysis of data collected by the Capline Pipeline in Louisiana, reported that oil coming from the Bakken has significantly more combustible gases and a higher vapor pressure than oil from other formations. In early March, Canada\u2019s Transportation Safety Board (TSB) issued its own findings from oil samples taken from the nine tank cars that did not derail in Lac-M\u00e9gantic. While the TSB does not contend, as Smith does, that the Bakken oil is significantly different from other light sweet crudes, the agency also found that oil coming out of the Bakken has a very low flashpoint \u2013 which means that it ignites easily or at a relatively low temperature \u2013 a level more similar to unleaded gasoline. When the rail cars went off the track in Lac-M\u00e9gantic, sending up sparks and static charges, it didn\u2019t take much to set off explosions. \u201cAll of the conditions required for ignition to occur were present,\u201d the TSB report concluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oil trains are crisscrossing the continent with volatile cargo, yet many communities are unprepared for an accident", "author": "Adam Federman", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Oil trains are crisscrossing the continent with volatile cargo, yet many communities are unprepared for an accident", "title": "\u201cThe infrastructure isn\u2019t there\u201d: Why shipping Bakken crude oil by rail is a disaster in the making", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/29/the_infrastructure_isnt_there_why_shipping_bakken_crude_oil_by_rail_is_a_disaster_in_the_making_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/AP781137425313-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Oil trains are crisscrossing the continent with volatile cargo, yet many communities are unprepared for an accident", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/AP781137425313-1280x960.jpg", "title": "\u201cThe infrastructure isn\u2019t there\u201d: Why shipping Bakken crude oil by rail is a disaster in the making", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cThe infrastructure isn\u2019t there\u201d: Why shipping Bakken crude oil by rail is a disaster in the making", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bakken Crude Oil, Canada, Earth Island Journal, Keystone XL pipeline, Oil", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd81c\"", "article_summary": "According to the American Association of Railroads, there were 9,500 rail cars carrying crude oil in 2008.\nChemists with California\u2019s Office of Spill Prevention and Response examined Smith\u2019s samples and concluded that the Bakken crude \u201cresembles a typical crude oil that has been mixed with diesel or a diesel/gasoline mix.\nThere\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about Bakken crude, Smith says.\nBecause of the varying depths of the Bakken formation, two wells a mile apart can produce crude oil with very different characteristics.\nSmith still has vials of Bakken crude that he pumped out of the ground nearly a year ago."}
