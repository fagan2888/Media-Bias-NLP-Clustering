Through Prescription Hope\u2019s proprietary process, individuals can receive over 1,500 FDA-approved prescription medications from over 180 American pharmaceutical companies for $35 per month, per medication, without the traditional barriers of insurance.\n\n\u201cThe bankruptcy of health insurance co-ops is the most recent example of difficulties Americans face when trying to access their prescription medications,\u201d said Douglas K. Pierce, President and Chief Executive Officer of Prescription Hope. \u201cWe work to bridge the gap that insurance can often leave behind, connecting Americans with the medications they need at a price they can afford.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, over 800,000 individuals lost access to affordable health insurance when over half of America\u2019s insurance co-ops went bankrupt. The largest bankruptcy was Health Republic Insurance of New York, forcing over 150,000 individuals to seek new health insurance. Other major co-operatives to go bankrupt include CoOpportunity Health serving Iowa and Nebraska, Louisiana Health Cooperative, and Nevada Health CO-OP. As a result, many were forced into other insurance programs or discount cards, which may increase out-of-pocket costs for routine prescription medications.\n\nResearch from the Centers for Disease Control shows once Americans lose access to their prescription medications, they begin taking risks with their health, ultimately driving up the cost of their care. Although one in five people rely on three or more monthly prescription medications, those who cannot afford all of their medicines may be skipping dosages, splitting medicines, or sharing them with others.\n\n\u201cNobody should be forced into deciding between paying their bills and affording their prescription medications,\u201d said Pierce. \u201cThrough our program, individuals do not: our program allows individuals to control their costs by fixing prescription medication costs at $35 per month, per medication.\u201d\n\nAs opposed to discount drug cards or mail-order pharmacy programs, each medication received through Prescription Hope costs only $35 per month. More importantly, Prescription Hope works alongside any coverage an individual may have. There is no limit to the number of prescribed medications an individual can receive through Prescription Hope.\n\nWhen an individual joins Prescription Hope, the highly-skilled team begins working on their behalf to obtain each of their prescription medications for the set monthly cost of $35 per month, per medication. Prescription Hope works hand-in-hand with America\u2019s major pharmaceutical manufacturers and their pharmacy to secure prescriptions, track medication shipments, manage refills on time, maintain up-to-date records, and renew prescription medications every year. Individuals and families earning less than $100,000 per year often qualify for Prescription Hope.\n\n\u201cWith over a decade of experience, our dedicated team has served thousands of people across the country, saving them millions off the retail costs of their medications,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cI personally welcome those 800,000 individuals who lost their health insurance access to experience a new level of hope for their personal care through Prescription Hope.\u201d\n\nFor more information about Prescription Hope, or to apply to receive prescription medications for $35 per month, per medication, visit http://www.prescriptionhope.com or call 1-877-296-HOPE (4673).\n\n---\n\nAbout Prescription Hope: Prescription Hope, Inc. is the nation\u2019s fastest growing pharmacy program, serving thousands of Americans with access to over 1,500 FDA-approved prescription medications for $35 per month, per medication.
