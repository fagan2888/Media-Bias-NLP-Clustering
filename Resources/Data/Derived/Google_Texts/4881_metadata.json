Bill Walker (I) initially asked the legislature to approve the state\u2019s participation in ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. The legislature has thus far declined. Now, Walker is trying to implement it anyway, and the legislature appears to be taking him to court. According to Alaska Dispatch News:\n\nThe Alaska Legislature on Tuesday said it will sue Gov. Bill Walker to block his move last month to expand the public Medicaid health care program without lawmakers\u2019 approval.\n\nFollowing a private discussion Tuesday morning, a Republican-controlled House-Senate committee voted 10-1 to spend up to $450,000 on two law firms to represent the Legislature in a suit against the governor.\n\nOne, Bancroft PLLC, is based in Washington, D.C., and represented more than two dozen states in their U.S. Supreme Court challenge to the Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamacare.\u201d The second, Holmes, Weddle & Barcott, is based in Anchorage.\n\nIn a news conference after the committee vote, Republican leaders framed their decision to challenge the governor as a constitutional one. They\u2019re seeking an injunction to stop Medicaid expansion from going into effect Sept. 1.\n\n\u201cThis is not a policy issue \u2014 we\u2019re not discussing whether we should or shouldn\u2019t expand Medicaid,\u201d said Senate President Kevin Meyer, R-Anchorage. \u201cThis is a question of authority and process and our constitution.\u201d\n\n[\u2026]\n\nThe Legislature is challenging Walker\u2019s move based on a provision in Alaska statute that requires legislative approval before Medicaid coverage can be offered to people whose care is not required under federal law.\n\nThe version of \u201cObamacare\u201d passed by Congress required states to expand Medicaid to cover low-income Americans, who can otherwise face steep health care costs without the subsidies that the legislation offers to individuals with higher incomes.\n\nAs written, the law would have revoked all federal Medicaid funding for states that didn\u2019t go through with the expansion. But the U.S. Supreme Court said in 2012 that the threat of revoking the money was unconstitutional and coercive.\n\nThe ruling created ambiguity for Alaskan policymakers and legal experts: If Medicaid expansion is technically required under the ACA, but the Supreme Court has ruled the federal government can\u2019t enforce the requirement by revoking money from states that don\u2019t comply, does that make the newly eligible people under Walker\u2019s proposed expansion an optional group that requires legislative approval?\n\nWalker, citing a memorandum from Attorney General Craig Richards, says no. The Republican lawmakers that support the lawsuit say yes and argue the governor is circumventing their authority.\n\nAn initial filing in the Legislature\u2019s lawsuit is expected next week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The legislature says no, and votes to take the governor to court.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "The legislature says no, and votes to take the governor to court.", "title": "Can Alaska's Governor Implement ObamaCare's Medicaid Expansion without the Legislature?", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/can-alaska-gov-bill-walker-implement-obamacares-medicaid-expansion-without-legislature", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/can-alaska-gov-bill-walker-implement-obamacares-medicaid-expansion-without-legislature", "creator": "@CatoInstitute", "description": "The legislature says no, and votes to take the governor to court.", "card": "summary", "title": "Can Alaska's Governor Implement ObamaCare's Medicaid Expansion without the Legislature?"}, "site": "Cato Institute", "robots": "noodp", "node_creation_date": "2015/8/19", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "publication_date": "2015/8/19", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-19T12:02:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Bill Walker (I) initially asked the legislature to approve the state\u2019s participation in ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\nAccording to Alaska Dispatch News:The Alaska Legislature on Tuesday said it will sue Gov.\nThey\u2019re seeking an injunction to stop Medicaid expansion from going into effect Sept. 1.\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court said in 2012 that the threat of revoking the money was unconstitutional and coercive.\nAs written, the law would have revoked all federal Medicaid funding for states that didn\u2019t go through with the expansion."}
