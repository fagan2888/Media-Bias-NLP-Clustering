In fact, only 25 out of the 227 drug products in the brand name category were used to treat acute or intermittent conditions, according to Purvis. Some of the highest 8-year cumulative price increases were seen in therapeutic classes such as Uroxatal (alfuzosin\u2014Sanofi Aventis) 10-mg tablets; Solaraze Gel 3% (diclofenac sodium\u2014PharmDerm); Humulin R U-500 (concentrated) (insulin human injection {rDNA origin}\u2014Eli Lilly); Prandin (repaglinide\u2014Novo Nordisk) 2 mg, among others.\n\n\u201cThe brand-name prescription drug price trends that we are seeing are unsustainable, particularly in combination with ever-increasing launch prices,\u201d said Purvis.\n\nHe warned that continued increases in the cost of medications could affect all Americans\u2014not just seniors\u2014and prompt them to stop taking necessary medications.\n\n\u201cThose with private health insurance will pay higher premiums and cost sharing for their health care coverage,\u201d said Purvis. \u201cOver time, it could also lead to higher taxes and/or cuts to public programs to accommodate increased government spending.\u201d\n\nPotentially worsening the situation is evidence showing that certain generic prescription drug prices are increasing as well. A Senate hearing on that topic is scheduled for November 20.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "American Pharmacists Association", "description": "Drug prices are increasing\u2014but it\u2019s not just the high cost of specialty drugs that has patients and policy make", "title": "Cost for common prescription drugs at all-time high", "url": "https://pharmacist.com/cost-common-prescription-drugs-all-time-high", "image": "/sites/default/files/images/APhA-footer-logo.png", "updated_time": "2014-11-20T09:26:30-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-20T09:26:30-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-20T09:26:30-05:00"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Drug prices are increasing\u2014but it\u2019s not just the high cost of specialty drugs that has patients and policy make", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHowever, our data indicate that brand name drug prices were increasing substantially years before ACA passed.\u201dMost of the drug prices analyzed were for chronic conditions.\nA new report from AARP finds that prices for common prescription drugs has risen dramatically.\nDrug prices are increasing\u2014but it\u2019s not just the high cost of specialty drugs that has patients and policy makers worried.\n\u201cThe brand-name prescription drug price trends that we are seeing are unsustainable, particularly in combination with ever-increasing launch prices,\u201d said Purvis.\nIn a statement, AARP said the report indicates that this is the highest average annual price increase since AARP began tracking prescription drug prices in 2004."}
