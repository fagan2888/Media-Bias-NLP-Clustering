Chris Christie criticized Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts during a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Tuesday, several hours after launching his presidential campaign.\n\nAsked by an audience member what he thought about the Supreme Court decisions last week upholding Obamacare subsidies and legalizing same-sex marriage, and what type of judges he would appoint as president, Christie expressed admiration for Justice Samuel Alito.\n\n\u201cIf you read Justice Alito\u2019s opinions, what they are, are an absolute tribute to what the role of the court should be in my opinion,\u201d Christie said. \u201cWhich is that they\u2019re not there to make laws, they\u2019re not there to make social policy, they\u2019re there to interpret the laws passed by the Congress and signed by the president, and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s made New Jersey\u2019s Supreme Court \u201cmore conservative\u201d with the three appointees he chose.\n\nChristie said he is \u201cincredibly disappointed\u201d in Chief Justice Roberts.\n\n\u201cHe had two opinions that you couldn\u2019t square with each other,\u201d Christie said. \u201cOn Thursday, he writes an opinion on Obamacare that basically says \u2018I know the words don\u2019t say this, but I think they mean it, so I\u2019m going to vote to keep Obamacare.\u2019 The next day, he votes against same-sex marriage by saying \u2018the court has no role in second-guessing the people and their legislature.\u2019 Well, man, you just did it yesterday. Right? So this is the problem.\u201d\n\nHe called Alito\u2019s opinions \u201cconsistent and reasoned.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I became president of the United States, I\u2019d be out there looking for Sam Alitos to put on the court,\u201d Christie said.\n\nChristie, the fourteenth Republican to enter the race for president, said that he is ready for the upcoming debate.\n\n\u201cI want to be the next president of the United States and I intend to win this election,\u201d he said.\n\nChristie described himself as \u201cbattle-tested,\u201d citing his record of \u201cexecutive experience\u201d as a conservative governor of New Jersey.\n\nHe said he is uniquely qualified to defeat Democrat front-runner Hillary Clinton due to his victory in New Jersey\u2019s gubernatorial election over his Democrat rival state Sen. Barbara Buono, whom he called ideologically similar to Clinton.\n\n\u201cYou can absolutely lay your opponent out without saying a bad word,\u201d Christie said.\n\nIn an allusion to some of his Republican rivals, Christie also said \u201cwe have already tried\u201d electing a \u201cone-term senator as president of the United States\u201d and that president has been a failure.\n\nChristie touted his record of \u201ccompromise.\u201d\n\nHe said that due to his Irish father and Sicilian mother, he became an \u201cexpert at dispute resolution\u201d from \u201ca very young age.\u201d\n\nHis upbringing, he said, taught him that \u201chonest disagreement\u201d and \u201chonest compromise\u201d are necessary in life and in government.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Jersey Gov.
