This morning the media mogul\u2019s Liberty Global international cable holding company agreed to buy Dutch cable company Ziggo for \u20ac6.9 billion ($9.44 billion).\n\nHere\u2019s how that changes the lineup for Liberty Global in Europe:\n\nMr. Malone has made no secret of his thirst to grow via consolidation of cable assets. \u201cThe name of the game in the cable business is scale,\u201d he said at Liberty Global\u2019s annual meeting in June last year. And Europe, beset by a fragmented telecom industry, weak economies and fast-moving regulation, is a good place for him to do business.\n\nLiberty Global has spent $38.7 billion on 16 telecom deals in the last two years, representing 6% of the global telecom market\u2019s value by merger and acquisition activity totaling $635.3 billion, according to data provider Dealogic. The purchase of the remainder of Ziggo was Liberty Global\u2019s third-largest acquisition ever, after Virgin Media in February last year and Cable & Wireless Communications 15 years ago, via its subsidiary NTL.\n\nLiberty Global was a particularly active deal maker in 2013.\n\nAt the start of the year, it acquired U.K. cable-television and Internet provider Virgin Media for $16 billion. It also raised its stake in Telenet Group Holding of Belgium, which it tried to acquire fully.\n\nIn June, Liberty moved to acquire Germany\u2019s biggest cable operator, Kabel Deutschland Holding, but was outbid by Vodafone in a roughly $10.6 billion deal. Liberty already was a major operator in Germany, having bought Germany\u2019s No. 2 cable company, UnityMedia, in 2009, and Kabel Baden-Wuerttenberg, in 2011.\n\nThe Ziggo deal is unlikely to be the endpoint for Mr. Malone\u2019s European adventure, as U.S. telecom providers circle Europe for deals.\n\n\u201cU..S operators have been looking at Europe. Europe is a mature market, but an important market,\u201d said Mike van Dulken, analyst at Accendo Markets.\n\nLiberty Global declined to comment on its acquisition strategy or potential targets.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "John Malone's adding to his European empire.
