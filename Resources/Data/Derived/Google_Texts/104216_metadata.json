Hayek also provides the voice of the girl's mother, Kamila.\n\nThe story is based on the \"The Prophet,\" a book written in 1923 by iconic Lebanese writer Khalil Gibran that has inspired generations of artists. The book, a series of poems about love, joy, sorrow, and work, has been translated into at least 40 languages and has never been out of print.\n\nThe film is divided into chapters illustrated by various animators. The score is by Gabriel Yared, the French composer of Lebanese descent who won an Oscar for his work on the \"English Patient.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters Monday, Hayek, whose paternal grandparents are Lebanese, described the film as \"a love letter to my heritage\" that will hopefully encourage new generations to think differently.\n\n\"Through this book I got to know my grandfather. Through this book I got to have my grandfather teaching me about life. So it is a very personal movie for me,\" Hayek told reporters in Beirut ahead of the movie's premiere. The film opens in cinemas in the United States in August.\n\nHayek said through illustrations, it was possible to capture the spirit of Gibran's work.\n\n\"It encourages the new generation to go somewhere else to break out of the box\" to change the world, she said.\n\nThe movie also helped bring to the audience a message of compassion and humanity from an author who comes from a violence-torn region.\n\nGibran, she said, \"is an Arabic writer who wrote philosophy and poetry and who brought all religions and the world together.\"\n\nOn the red carpet, Hayek, who was wearing a dress by Lebanese designer Elie Saab, said she didn't read the book to her 7-year-old daughter, Valentina, but has watched the film with her.\n\n\"It's hard for a kid to understand (the Prophet) as it's written, that's why we made the movie. She understands it in the film, because she sees the images of the words,\" Hayek told AP.\n\nHayek's daughter and her father accompanied her on her first trip to Lebanon.\n\n\"This has been the most amazing trip. I was not prepared for how emotional it was going to be for my family to be here,\" she said.\n\n---\n\nAssociated Press writer Maeva Bambuck contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salma Hayek hopes 'The Prophet' inspires new generations - AP News: BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Salma Hayek said on Monday that the .05/25/2016 17:18:13PM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Salma Hayek said on Monday that the animated feature film \"The Prophet\"", "title": "AP News - Salma Hayek hopes 'The Prophet' inspires new generations", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2015/04/27/salma-hayek-hopes-the-prophet-inspires-new-generations-n1991010", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\117\\ad98334f-2a06-45d8-9dce-05c6498b65cb.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Salma Hayek said on Monday that the animated feature film \"The Prophet\"", "title": "AP News - Salma Hayek hopes 'The Prophet' inspires new generations", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/entertainment/2015/04/27/salma-hayek-hopes-the-prophet-inspires-new-generations-n1991010", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/117/ad98334f-2a06-45d8-9dce-05c6498b65cb.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Salma Hayek hopes 'The Prophet' inspires new generations, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf15e\"", "article_summary": "The story is based on the \"The Prophet,\" a book written in 1923 by iconic Lebanese writer Khalil Gibran that has inspired generations of artists.\nSo it is a very personal movie for me,\" Hayek told reporters in Beirut ahead of the movie's premiere.\nShe understands it in the film, because she sees the images of the words,\" Hayek told AP.\nHayek told The Associated Press that the movie has a \"message of peace.\"\nHayek is visiting Lebanon, her ancestral homeland, for the international premiere of the film, written and directed by Roger Allers, the maker of the Disney production \"The Lion King.\""}
