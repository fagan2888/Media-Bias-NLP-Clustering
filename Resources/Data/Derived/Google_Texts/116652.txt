NEW YORK (MainStreet) — The less miles on the road, the lower the risk of an auto accident — but most insurers, especially big ones, don't want to offer low-mileage deals, as those drivers help insurance companies absorb the risk of higher-volume drivers. And risk, after all, is what auto insurers try to avoid.



But what the industry is really avoiding, says the Consumer Federation of America, is rewarding low-mileage, safer drivers with better rates.

"Large auto insurers frequently fail to reward drivers with low mileage despite a strong relationship between this mileage and insurance claims," the CFA says in a study. "In fact, three of the five largest insurers often give low-mileage drivers no break at all" — despite 61% of U.S auto insurance consumers saying mileage should be a factor in determining auto insurance costs.



Worse, in the opinion of the CFA, is that the auto insurance industry is sticking it to demographic groups who can afford it the least. "The failure of most large insurers to adequately reward low mileage especially harms lower-income and older drivers, because they drive the least," says Stephen Brobeck, executive director. "This lack of concern for mileage, along with an emphasis on other non-driving factors such as occupation and income, help explain why insurers charge many lower-income drivers such high prices for minimal, state-required liability coverage," he adds.



The CFA looked at some of the biggest auto insurers in the nation, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive, Geico and Farmers. Using a sample driver (a 30-year-old single women with no history of accidents or traffic tickets driving a 2005 sedan on a $30,000 salary), the CFA compared insurance quotes for 5,000 and 20,000 miles annually. In 49 states — California mandates that auto insurers use mileage when formulating insurance costs — Farmers, Progressive, and Allstate provided the same yearly premium for both the 5,000 and 20,000 miles driven.
