At best, that\u2019s a simplification. What has really happened is that the party system finally catching up with the development of ideology.\n\nThat makes it look like we have extreme parties, but what we really have is distinct parties.\n\nFor one thing, the liberal-conservative conflict, in its modern form, is relatively new. A hundred years ago, party competition was intense, but it wasn\u2019t over the same issues. Those who were against, say, teaching evolution in schools were as often for redistributive policies as against them. Most strikingly, the progressives of the Progressive Era, who were concerned about inequality and wanted the government to intervene in the market, were generally fairly racist. Government should help out struggling white workers, progressives thought, but perhaps blacks were destined to be poor and uneducated.\n\nThis changed over the course of the first half of the twentieth century. Anti-black progressives faded, and modern liberals replaced them. They were people who were liberal on economics, liberal on race, and liberal on a lot of other things. In my new book, I look at the positions taken by political intellectuals in magazines and newspapers. Among those thinkers, modern liberalism began to emerge in the early 20th century, and modern conservatism followed in the middle of the century.\n\nBut the parties took a while to catch up to these developments in ideology. Parties are coalitions of people trying to get elected. They had built constituencies based on idiosyncratic platforms, which evolved locally in different ways. They were not ideologically distinct from one another. Northern Democrats began to represent liberal voters (and, perhaps more importantly, liberal activists). But Southern Democrats, meanwhile, had constituencies based on opposition to civil rights, but also on a commitment to the Cold War and opposition to labor unions. Southern Democrats weren\u2019t just more conservative than other Democrats \u2014 they were more conservative than most Republicans.\n\nMuch has been made of the fact that many early social programs, like Medicare and Social Security, were enacted by bipartisan coalitions, while the Affordable Care Act was passed on party-line votes. This is true. But this not because there was a great consensus on Medicare. It\u2019s that the liberals who were for it were in both parties, and the conservatives who opposed it were also in both parties.\n\nIdeological activists had to force the parties to change, on race, on women\u2019s rights, on defense spending, etc. And they continue to do so. Now, there are few conservative Democrats, and even fewer liberal Republicans.\n\nThose who study voters like to call this \u201csorting\u201d and that\u2019s not bad. I think polarization is a fine term, but it\u2019s polarization because the parties have aligned themselves to new poles.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Intellectuals and activists created modern liberalism and conservatism.
