Benefitbay is attempting to help cut these costs by providing a platform that helps small businesses contain costs through a defined contribution model.\n\n\u201cRather than the employer offering one benefits package to all employees, the employer can now give everyone a set amount,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThe employee can then go in and shop for an individual health plan that best fits their needs.\u201d\n\nThe comparator feature\n\nBenefitbay also features the \u201ccomparator,\u201d a tool that provides more flexibility and transparency for small business owners to decide if they want to offer a small group plan or individual plans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s challenging to determine what the costs are associated with going with a group or individual plan,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cWe\u2019ve really simplified that process so employers can get quotes for both routes.\u201d\n\nFisher explained that the comparator also takes into account taxation and subsidies available from the government.\n\nGrowing pains\n\nFisher explained that one of the biggest challenges the team often runs into is legislation.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, all employers were supposed to shift to new ACA plans,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cWhen that changed again under Obama, many employers hung onto their old group plans because they\u2019re cheaper and don\u2019t offer as much coverage.\u201d\n\nFisher explained that these legislation changes caused benefitbay to pivot.\n\n\u201cBut through that pivot we ended up signing a deal with Humana. Humana chose benefitbay, a little software company in Omaha to power their own private exchange, which is really exciting.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for benefitbay\n\nUltimately benefitbay aspires to be the platform of choice for small business customers. While they are currently focused on benefits, the team plans to evolve the product into a single source platform for all benefits, HR and payroll activities.\n\nTo learn more about benefitbay, you can visit https://www.benefitbay.com/about-us\n\n\u2013\n\nMelanie Lucks is a communications intern for Silicon Prairie News and AIM Careerlink.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Silicon Prairie News", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://siliconprairienews.com/2016/02/benefitbay-helps-small-businesses-save-on-employee-benefits/", "article_author_name": "Melanie Lucks", "image": "http://siliconprairienews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2015-08-27-at-4.03.06-PM.png", "site_id": "6ab441d59352267ec8583bd242d4c08b", "article_published_time": "2016-02-18T16:00:52+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T16:15:43+00:00", "keywords": "enterprise, featured, startups", "wp_version": "7.6.1.9"}, "og": {"site_name": "Silicon Prairie News", "description": "When the Affordable Care Act started to change how businesses bought healthcare, Omaha insurance executives saw an opportunity. \u201cThe insurance execs knew how the space was changing under the ACA, but didn\u2019t know how to build a platform,\u201d said Patrick Fisher, CEO, benefitbay. \u201cThey approached a few technology execs in Omaha, came together and benefitbay...
