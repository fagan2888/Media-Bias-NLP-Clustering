If Vice President Biden's decision to run for president hinges on Hillary Clinton's performance in the Tuesday night debate, two Democratic strategists predict he will sit out the 2016 race.

The Hill's Molly K. Hooper talks with veteran Democratic strategists Steve Rosenthal of the Organizing Group and Center for American Progress Action Fund Executive Director Angela Kelley, who agree that Clinton's debate performance shot her back to front-runner status in the Democratic field.

“If it looked to some insiders as if the Clinton campaign wasn’t performing that well, if she came down a few pegs, there was a possibly a rationale for Biden to consider running," Rosenthal said.

But that's not what happened, he added, "I think it would be really tough for Vice President Joe Biden to get in the race at this point."

Kelley notes that the country has watched Biden struggle to make a decision since his son Beau died, considering the personal toll that a presidential campaign would have on his family.

"If he was waiting, though, to see what happened, going into this debate: Was Secretary Clinton a formidable opponent? Was Secretary Clinton ready but not rehearsed? Was Secretary Clinton wanting the job and able to connect with people — then ‘yes,’ ‘yes,’ ‘yes,’ " Kelley said pointing to reasons that Biden may not enter the race.
