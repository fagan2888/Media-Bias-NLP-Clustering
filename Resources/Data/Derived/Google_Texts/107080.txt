A crowd gathers outside the Supreme Court on March 4, 2015, as the Court hears arguments in King v. Burwell.

Before the end of June, the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on King v. Burwell, a lawsuit that seeks to strip premium tax credits from people who live in states with a federal insurance marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. Repealing this pillar of the law, which helps make health coverage more affordable for consumers, would have severe consequences.

The stakes could not be higher. The sudden elimination of a key component of the ACA would cause substantial disruptions to the U.S. health care system. Moreover, it would take away health insurance coverage from more than 8 million Americans and cause premiums to spike for many more.

This court decision has the potential to upend the health care system at the same time that the Affordable Care Act is working. Across the country, 16.4 million people have gained quality, affordable coverage as of May 2015.
