This intelligence failure was an apt harbinger. More than fourteen years later weaponized drones are still killing civilians under the cloak of secrecy, and the CIA is still making the dubious claim that it is crucial for America\u2019s safety.\n\nFormer CIA Chief Gen. Michael Hayden, in a recent New York Times oped, writes that it is \u201cfair to say that the targeted killing program has been the most precise and effective application of firepower in the history of armed conflict,\u201d while admitting that the program is not perfect \u2013 that \u201cno military program is.\u201d Here lies the fatal error in this assertion, and illuminates the reality that makes the weaponized drone program so dangerous to America\u2019s safety: the CIA should be in the intelligence business, not the military business. The covert nature of the CIA\u2019s drone program shields it from any meaningful discussion, critique, or oversight, and allows Hayden and other advocates to assert, without facts or evidence, that the program works; that despite overwhelming and objective data, civilians rarely get killed; that claims that drone strikes are creating more militants are without merit.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEven the title of Hayden\u2019s article hints at the shortsightedness of American drone policy and the apparent inflexibility of our intelligence apparatus: in order to \u201ckeep America safe,\u201d she must embrace drone warfare. As if there is no option to defeat militants other than killing them with drones. If an errant strike kills a civilian and, as a result, creates ten militants where there were none before? No problem, we just kill ten more. His anecdotal example of a targeting process\u2014described, presumably, to share how thoroughly vetted is the decision prior to launching an attack\u2014is indicative of the dangers of having an unchecked intelligence agency conducting purely military missions: the notion that all military-age males are automatically deemed militants, and thus lawful targets; that, despite a nation where amputees are common, having one leg is evidence enough to confirm legitimacy as a lawful target; where a child\u2019s death is acceptable because his grandfather had chemicals that he\u2014\u201cperhaps\u201d\u2014intended to use on Americans.\n\nThis is warmongering at its worst. It is unimaginative problem solving, particularly when lives, both American and foreign, are at stake. Imagine if a foreign military regularly fired a $100,000 rocket from a $13 million airframe to destroy a single enlisted soldier in the U.S. Army, and killed a child each time they did so. Yet this is essentially Hayden\u2019s justification when he writes \u201cin warfare it is regrettably necessary to kill foot soldiers, too.\u201d Weaponized drones undoubtedly kill men who have nefarious intentions for the United States, but in killing civilians\u2014and they almost always do\u2014weaponized drones create such men as well.\n\nHayden argues that drone warfare keeps America safe, but of what version of America does he speak? America\u2019s strength lies in her transparency, in her due process, and in her ability to legitimately profess to be a nation of laws with a professional military other nations could emulate. There are now nearly eighty countries that use drones, more than a quarter of which have or are developing weaponized platforms. If America wants to effect global use of weaponized drones, then America has an opportunity to lead by example. The authority for firing missiles from a weaponized drone should be restricted to the warfighters in the Department of Defense, not left under the auspices of a spy agency. There should be assurances that the President\u2019s 2013 Procedures for the Use of Force, which requires a \u201ccontinuing, imminent threat\u201d and \u201cnear certainty\u201d that civilians will not be killed or injured prior to a lethal attack, are followed. If it makes tactical sense to kill a single foot soldier with a missile, and civilians in the process, then the legal standard for determining what is a lawful target and when it can be lawfully engaged should be made clear and subject to scrutiny. When individual mistakes are made, there should be a thorough investigation, followed by acknowledgement and compensation where appropriate. Congress should consider an independent review for covert drone operations, similar to the study of the CIA\u2019s Detention and Interrogation Program conducted by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nUntil then, and for as long as the CIA fires weaponized drones, the notion that \u201cdrone warfare\u201d is keeping America safe is nothing more than a dangerous opinion.\n\nMorse is the senior advocate, US Program, at the Center for Civilians in Conflict in Washington, D.C.
