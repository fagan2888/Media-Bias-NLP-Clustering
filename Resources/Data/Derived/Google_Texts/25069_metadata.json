They were overruled by political aides.\u201d\n\nOverruled by political aides? This is simply damning.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to get a lie into a presidential speech. Every draft address is circulated to the White House senior staff and key Cabinet officials in something called the \u201cstaffing process.\u201d Every line is reviewed by dozens of senior officials, who offer comments and factual corrections. During this process, it turns out, some of Obama\u2019s policy advisers objected to the \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d pledge, pointing out that it was untrue. But it stayed in the speech. That does not happen by accident. It requires a willful intent to deceive.\n\nIn the Bush White House, we speechwriters would often come up with what we thought were great turns of phrase to help the president explain his policies. But we also had a strict fact-checking process, where every iteration of every proposed presidential utterance was scrubbed to ensure it was both accurate and defensible. If the fact-checkers told us a line was inaccurate, we would either kill it or find another way to make the point accurately. I cannot imagine a scenario in which the fact-checkers or White House policy advisers would tell us that something in a draft speech was factually incorrect and that guidance would be ignored or overruled by the president\u2019s political advisers.\n\nThis whole episode is a window into a fundamentally dishonest presidency. And the story gets worse. After Obama began telling Americans they could keep their plans, White House aides discussed using media interviews \u201cto explain the nuances of the succinct line in his stump speeches.\u201d But they decided not to do so, because \u201cofficials worried . . . that delving into details such as the small number of people who might lose insurance could be confusing and would clutter the president\u2019s message.\u201d\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The Right\u2019s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site\u2019s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

He could have said \u201cmost Americans will be able to keep their plans.\u201d Or he could have said, as his communications director Dan Pfeiffer put it on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d Sunday, \u201cif you had a plan before the Affordable Care Act passed, [and] it hasn\u2019t been changed or canceled, you can keep it\u201d (which prompted McConnell spokesman Don Stewart to reply, \u201cSo . . . you can keep your plan \u2014 unless it\u2019s been cancelled. Gee, thanks.\u201d) That would certainly have been less powerful, but at least it would have been accurate.\n\nBut Obama didn\u2019t say those things. He said, \u201cIf you like your health-care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health-care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.\u201d That statement was clear, unequivocal and wrong \u2014 and Obama and his advisers knew it.\n\nThe president\u2019s defenders are twisting around for ways to explain away his 16 words. The New York Times wrote in an editorial Sunday that \u201cMr. Obama clearly misspoke.\u201d Misspoke? On 24 separate occasions? Sorry, the president didn\u2019t \u201cmisspeak.\u201d This was an premeditated deception. This wasn\u2019t something Obama ad-libbed. It was a line in a presidential speech that was carefully reviewed by the entire White House senior staff. Obama\u2019s political advisers were told by his policy aides the statement was inaccurate \u2014 but they decided to let Americans believe the falsehood.\n\nObama\u2019s former chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, told the Journal that the speechwriters were working to find ways to explain a complex policy and that the goal was \u201csimplification and ease of explanation . . . while still being true.\u201d Except what Obama said wasn\u2019t true.\n\nEvery president faces the challenge of explaining complex policies in simple terms. But the quest for simplicity is no excuse for dishonesty.\n\nObama\u2019s own advisers told the Journal that they knew those 16 words were untrue, but Obama kept on saying them \u2014 over and over and over again.\n\n1 of 14 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The worst media screw-ups of 2013 View Photos Washington Post media blogger Erik Wemple picks the biggest mistakes of the year.
