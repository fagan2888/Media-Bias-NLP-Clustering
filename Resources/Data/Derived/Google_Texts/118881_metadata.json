Todd Young (R) and his chief of staff. For likely the thousandth time while in D.C., each one of us went around the table telling where we were from, what we were studying and, of course, where we were interning.\n\nWhen it was my turn I said I was an intern at Ready for Hillary, the political action committee encouraging former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to run ?for president.\n\nThe congressman\u2019s chief of staff responded by asking if I realized not everyone\u2019s ready for Hillary, to which I sharply replied with the fact that there\u2019s a lot of us that are. And that\u2019s a reality Republicans are waking up to everyday \u2014 whether they like it or not.\n\nI\u2019m ready for Hillary because I want somebody who won\u2019t back down from a fight in the face of Republican obstructionism in Washington that has left our ?government broken.\n\nTime and time again the Republican-controlled Congress has shown its preference for acting on its personal animus toward President Obama than actually governing \u2014 and we need someone who will take them to task for it.\n\nThere are few people in the public sphere that have faced as many fights and are prepared for such a task as Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s no surprise the GOP has tried to prop up so many shamelessly partisan scandals using congressional gavels to attack her character instead of, you know, actually governing.\n\nI\u2019m ready for Hillary because no one on either side of the aisle is as prepared, experienced or competent in the realm of policy \u2014 both foreign and domestic \u2014 as she is. Our economy is recovering, yet we\u2019re still trying to move past the shadow of the Great Recession.\n\nFor a lot of people left behind in the recovery, it feels like the deck has been stacked against them while the rich continue to get richer.\n\nFor millennials and so much of the eroding middle class, the American Dream is little else than a buzzword. Democrats can disagree on how to tackle the seemingly insurmountable challenge that is income inequality in our country, but at the end of the day we can agree we all do better when we all ?do better.\n\nThat\u2019s the vision Hillary has for America \u2014 one that can resonate even in the bastions of the heartland and the South that have all but shut out the party\u2019s message.\n\nIn terms of our place in the world, American leadership is needed now more than ever as the world has changed so much this decade. Though we should always be mindful of how we use it, we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to exercise American power overseas when it\u2019s needed.\n\nI\u2019m ready for Hillary because we\u2019ve made too much progress to turn back. If you\u2019re not, that\u2019s fine \u2014 because when you are, we\u2019ll ?be here.\n\nedsalas@indiana.edu", "article_metadata": {"description": "We've made too much progress to turn back.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"url": "http://www.idsnews.com/article/2015/04/column-why-im-ready-for-hillary", "image": "http://duvq7ua50whdw.cloudfront.net/20160412QJeR6mqyqZ/dist/img/IDS-fb-icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "We've made too much progress to turn back.", "title": "COLUMN: Why I\u2019m ready for Hillary"}, "twitter": {"description": "We've made too much progress to turn back.", "site": "@idsnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "COLUMN: Why I\u2019m ready for Hillary"}, "keywords": "Indiana University, IU, Bloomington, Indiana, Monroe County, Indiana Daily Student, IDS, student newspaper, newspaper, news, students, college, university, campus, Ernie Pyle", "google-site-verification": "FkL7grEXumouo-bfJ89mrCvOGorioiCTNQ4t4X3bjjI", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2166\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019m ready for Hillary because we\u2019ve made too much progress to turn back.\nWhen it was my turn I said I was an intern at Ready for Hillary, the political action committee encouraging former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to run ?for president.\nI\u2019m ready for Hillary because I want somebody who won\u2019t back down from a fight in the face of Republican obstructionism in Washington that has left our ?government broken.\nI\u2019m ready for Hillary because no one on either side of the aisle is as prepared, experienced or competent in the realm of policy \u2014 both foreign and domestic \u2014 as she is.\nIn terms of our place in the world, American leadership is needed now more than ever as the world has changed so much this decade."}
