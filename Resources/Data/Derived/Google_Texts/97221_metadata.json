As both an adjective and as a noun, it describes something that during the next several years may save Americans with severe or chronic medical conditions significant money on some very expensive prescription drugs.\n\nIn March, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a group of drugs dubbed biosimilars, or nonbrand-name near-equivalents of biologic drugs. It\u2019s called Zarxio, and it\u2019s modeled on an existing brand-name drug used to boost white blood cell counts in people who are undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.\n\nZarxio is expected to cost less than its expensive, brand-name cousin. And although Zarxio so far is the only biosimilar to be granted FDA approval, it may herald a coming wave of other biosimilars to market which, it is hoped, can represent a financial godsend for patients who use them.\n\nMost of the common drugs with which laymen are familiar \u2014 Lipitor, Viagra, numerous generic and brand name painkillers and antibiotics \u2014 are created by following, in effect, a chemical recipe \u201cto produce an exact replica, if you will,\u201d says Mark Decerbo, a doctor of pharmacy and associate professor of pharmacy practice at Roseman University of Health Sciences College of Pharmacy in Henderson.\n\nBiologic drugs, in contrast, are produced from cell cultures, from living cells, Decerbo says.\n\n\u201cThey can be produced from bacteria, they can be produced from yeast, Decerbo says. \u201cSo it\u2019s an entirely different process, obviously, because it\u2019s not really us who are producing them from the cookbook formula, it\u2019s the bacteria or the yeast that are producing these.\u201d\n\nThe relative simplicity of creating a drug by the cookbook-recipe approach led to the ability to create and bring to market identical, lower-cost generic versions of higher-priced brand-name drugs. However, even though biologics hit the U.S. market back during the \u201980s, \u201cno one gave thought to (producing) generics based on them because they\u2019re so specialized,\u201d Decerbo says.\n\nBecause of the lack of standardization inherent in using living organisms to manufacture biologic drugs, \u201cno one thought it would even be possible to (manufacture a biologic) that would be even closely identical\u201d to the original, he explains. \u201cOur molecular (generic) medicines are exact copies. With biologics, there\u2019s no such thing as an exact copy, and even the companies that make the brand-name biologics, processes still are always different a little bit from production cycle to production cycle.\u201d\n\nAnother hurdle to creating what would be, in effect, a generic version of a brand-name biologic drug was that there was no federal licensing pathway to approve a drug that was similar, but not identical, to its name-brand cousin.\n\nThen came passage of the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which, through the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, created a regulatory pathway for drugs that, the FDA says, are \u201chighly similar\u201d to \u201can already-approved biological product.\u201d\n\nNow, Decerbo says, a company that wishes to create a biosimilar version of a brand-name biologic drug must show that the new product is \u201chighly similar in terms of structure\u201d and that the biosimilar carries \u201cno difference in efficacy and safety.\u201d\n\nAnd that led to the FDA\u2019s groundbreaking approval of Zarxio, which, says Dr. James Sanchez, a medical oncologist with Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada, helps to boost white blood cell counts in patients who are undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest negative side effects of chemotherapy treatment has always been that it (causes) a drop in white blood cell counts, and that\u2019s the first line of defense against infection,\u201d Sanchez says, and that can lead to \u201ca significant number of hospitalizations after a course of chemotherapy.\u201d\n\nZarxio and its brand-name predecessor \u201care designed to help stimulate the bone marrow to make a quicker recovery, so it reduces the time a person is immune-compromised and makes them stay healthy and on track with treatment,\u201d Sanchez says.\n\nSanchez says he\u2019s been practicing medicine for about 30 years and remembers the days before biologic drugs were available. Today, he says, \u201cI\u2019d say the vast majority of (cancer) patients are receiving some form of biologic, either as a supportive agent or as an actual specific treatment for their underlying cancer.\u201d\n\nBiologic drugs also are used in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Two common biologics, Humira and Enbrel, even have become network morning TV ad staples.\n\nDr. Mitchell Forman, a rheumatologist and dean of Touro University Nevada College of Osteopathic Medicine, says that while biologic drugs aren\u2019t first-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, they can be \u201cvery effective\u201d in \u201creducing the inflammation and the underlying autoimmune inflammatory process associated with rheumatoid arthritis.\u201d\n\nAs useful and as effective as biologics can be, they do have a downside: Biologic drugs \u201care generally very, very expensive medications,\u201d Forman says.\n\nForman estimates that treatment with a biologic drug \u2014 which typically is administered via injection or intravenously \u2014 can cost $1,000 to $2,000 monthly, and that the copayment alone for a biologic drug can mean $600 or $700 a month out of pocket for a patient.\n\n\u201cMy patients tell me all the time, \u2018I can\u2019t afford to pay that kind of copay,\u2019 \u201d Forman says. \u201cSome of the pharmaceutical companies have patient assistance plans that provide (a) biologic free of charge to the patient, but you can\u2019t rely on them.\u201d\n\nJust as the introduction of generic drugs offered consumers significant cost savings, Sanchez says it is hoped that the introduction of biosimilar drugs \u201cwill provide competition and, hopefully, lead to a decrease in (biologic drugs\u2019) cost, because the costs are very high.\u201d\n\nDecerbo says there are not yet any solid estimates of how much patients, and the health care system, might save through the introduction of biosimilars. But, he notes, data from Europe \u2014 a form of Zarxio has been on the market there for several years \u2014 point to savings of about one-third over the cost of a brand-name biologic.\n\nBut don\u2019t hold your breath. While a handful of other biosimilars are waiting in the wings, research, development, clinical trials and ultimate approval take time. Also, while they are expected to cost less than brand-name biologics, even biosimilars still will represent a hefty chunk of change for patients to pay.\n\nHowever, the advent of biosimilars is, Sanchez says, good news for patients. Until now, the biosimilar debate has played out mostly behind the scenes, as a sort of inside baseball undertaking among medical professionals, pharmaceutical companies and regulators.\n\nBut, Sanchez says, \u201cI think it needs to be played out in the social arena, because this is something that can benefit everyone.\u201d\n\nContact reporter John Przybys at jprzybys@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0280, or follow @JJPrzybys on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Federal approval of the first biologic drug may bode well for patients\u2019 pocketbooks \u2014 someday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "JOHN PRZYBYS &#0010;LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Pricey drugs made cheaper?", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/pricey-drugs-made-cheaper", "twitter": {"description": "Federal approval of the first biologic drug may bode well for patients\u2019 pocketbooks \u2014 someday.", "title": "Pricey drugs made cheaper?", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/pricey-drugs-made-cheaper", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_shot_0.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-2031191"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=3249235", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=3249235", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Federal approval of the first biologic drug may bode well for patients\u2019 pocketbooks \u2014 someday.", "title": "Pricey drugs made cheaper?", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/pricey-drugs-made-cheaper", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_shot_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-author": "JOHN PRZYBYS &#0010;LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,Life,", "parsely-section": "Health", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-03T16:11:45-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Health,Life", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_shot_0.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-05-03T23:11:45Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb461\"", "article_summary": "In March, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first of a group of drugs dubbed biosimilars, or nonbrand-name near-equivalents of biologic drugs.\nBiologic drugs, in contrast, are produced from cell cultures, from living cells, Decerbo says.\nSanchez says he\u2019s been practicing medicine for about 30 years and remembers the days before biologic drugs were available.\nIt\u2019s called Zarxio, and it\u2019s modeled on an existing brand-name drug used to boost white blood cell counts in people who are undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.\nBecause of the lack of standardization inherent in using living organisms to manufacture biologic drugs, \u201cno one thought it would even be possible to (manufacture a biologic) that would be even closely identical\u201d to the original, he explains."}
