John Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWe at University Hospitals commend and thank Gov. Kasich for including reauthorization of Medicaid eligibility in his budget proposal,\u201d University Hospitals CEO Thomas Zenty III said in a statement released by Kasich\u2019s office last week. \u201cThe governor is showing strong leadership on the issue of health care access for the working poor.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Zenty was paid $4,497,592 by the Cleveland-based nonprofit hospital network, which reported $238 million in net revenue to the IRS and ended the year with $1.3 billion in net assets.\n\nA study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2013 found Oregon\u2019s 2008 expansion of Medicaid did not significantly improve patient health or decrease emergency room utilization. But Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion has already resulted in more than $2 billion in new federal entitlement spending in Ohio.\n\nKasich, a Republican, implemented Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to able-bodied, childless, working-age adults over Ohio General Assembly disapproval. The governor lacks statutory authority to pay for his Obamacare expansion on an ongoing basis.\n\nGiven a choice between receiving more taxpayer money or not getting it, OHA member hospitals support the former. Kasich and his allies in Ohio House and Ohio Senate leadership have indicated the only debate around Medicaid expansion this year will involve how to tweak the program so Republicans will continue funding it.\n\nSince 2013, OHA has helped Kasich push the narrative that hospitals throughout Ohio would go belly-up without billions per year in Obamacare money. Their message remains much the same today.\n\n\u201cExtending Medicaid imperative for local economies,\u201d the headline of a Jan. 29 Chillicothe Gazette op-ed by Adena Health System CEO Mark Shuter warned.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the Ohio Hospital Association, I saw first-hand how providing health coverage for an additional 451,000 Ohioans through Medicaid in 2014 is impacting the ability of working people to stay healthy and on the job,\u201d Shuter wrote.\n\n\u201cIt also means Ohio hospitals, as the direct employer of more than 240,000 Ohioans, are able to sustain their community mission of improving the health of local residents while providing 24/7 care and responding to every disaster or new illness,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to go back.\u201d\n\n\u201cHealth care coverage means better health and better economic security for all of us,\u201d wrote Shuter, who was paid $779,946 in 2013. \u201cIn this new year, preserving Medicaid coverage for hardworking Ohioans who have incomes too low to buy private insurance is key to keeping our state moving forward.\u201d\n\nShuter asserted hospitals are responsible for 15,000 jobs and 6,000 indirect jobs in Southeast Ohio \u2014 an angle hospital CEOs throughout the state will likely emphasize as OHA pressures lawmakers to appropriate new Obamacare spending.\n\nAdena Health System, a nonprofit network of health-care providers headquartered in Chillicothe, reported $420 million in total revenue to the IRS for 2013. Adena had $25 million in revenue less expenses and ended the year with $215 million in net assets.\n\nThe year before Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion took effect, Adena reported $75 million in Medicaid expenses and $41 million in Medicaid revenue. In Ohio, Medicaid pays care providers roughly half as much as a private insurer would.\n\n\u201cAdena\u2019s mission is to provide quality healthcare services to patients in our region who need it, regardless of their ability to pay. What Medicaid Expansion has done is assure hardworking men and women who didn\u2019t have access to healthcare coverage the opportunity to seek preventive care, or to maintain their health,\u201d Maria Smith, Adena\u2019s director of corporate communications, explained in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cIf Medicaid Expansion ends or is significantly reduced, you can expect many people will not have the ability to pay for the healthcare they need and will revert to seeking out treatment only when they are in an emergent situation,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cGenerally in these cases, the cost to care for the patient\u2019s illness is likely to be much more costly than had they the opportunity for preventive care or chronic disease management.\u201d\n\nSmith told Ohio Watchdog all 10 of Adena\u2019s primary care clinics accepted new Medicaid patients in 2014, with average wait times nearly identical to the wait times experienced by those with private insurance.\n\n\u201cOver the past several years, we like many other health systems in the nation have adapted to many changes and challenges in our industry,\u201d Smith noted in response to a question about Medicaid reimbursement rates dropping at the end of 2014. \u201cEach is a concern, but we must always put the needs of our patients first and make the necessary adaptations to do so.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital CEOs in the Ohio Hospital Association are pressing state lawmakers to keep Obamacare money flowing through Gov.
