The timeline is a resource that distills information about the epidemic into short, pithy statements you can quote for your social media audiences.\n\nIt begins with the publication of the first report of what would come to be known as AIDS, and contains many links to original source materials. A simple click will take you to any year between 1981\u20132015.\n\nMany of the entries can be used as tweets or Facebook posts. You might consider using some of the information as #tbt (Throwback Thursday) or #FactFriday social posts.\n\nWe\u2019re excited to see that people are using the timeline in novel ways. For example, it helped to inform the International Museum of Surgical Science\u2019s December 2015 exhibit: Then and Now: 35 Years of HIV/AIDS .\n\nAs we approach the 35th anniversary of that first report, we hope you will take advantage of the wealth of history the timeline offers to educate your digital followers about how far we\u2019ve come since the early days of the epidemic!\n\nYou can view the timeline online or download it as a PDF [PDF 491KB].\n\nSign up to receive email updates of AIDS.gov blog posts (and more!)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
