Andrew M. Cuomo's office.\n\n\"Our administration is committed to protecting consumers from scammers who seek to prey on hard-working New Yorkers,\" Cuomo said. \"New Yorkers need to remain vigilant, be skeptical of anyone seeking to solicit personal information, and report any suspicious activity to the appropriate authorities.\"\n\nSCAMS TARGETING TAXPAYERS Cuomo urged taxpayers to be wary of three new scams emerging early in the tax season:\n\nScammers posing as NYS or U.S. Treasury representatives \u2013 Callers posing as New York State Treasury agents encourage victims to turn over their bank account information along with $250 in return for a larger sum of cash to come at a later date. To make themselves appear more convincing, the scammers provide the victim with a phone number, address, and confirmation code specific to the transaction. New Yorkers have also received calls from individuals posing as U.S. Treasury agents.\n\nPocketing Affordable Care Act penalties \u2013 Uninsured New Yorkers may face another tax scam involving penalties under the Affordable Care Act. In some cases, untrustworthy tax preparers tell clients to pay the penalties directly to them, and they keep the money. Taxpayers should never make a tax payment directly to an individual or tax preparer. Payments should be made only with a tax return or in response to a letter from the IRS.\n\nRecent scams are targeting the preparers via phone calls demanding client information. In these cases, scammers pretend to be from the IRS in hopes of gaining user-names and passwords to taxpayer accounts.\n\nTIPS TO PROTECT AGAINST SCAMMERS\n\nTo help New Yorkers protect themselves, Cuomo offered the following tips:\n\nDon't be fooled by callers who threaten you or ask for personal information. Be sure you only give your personal information -- including your social security number -- to someone you trust. Remember, the NYS Tax Department and the IRS will always send you a letter before contacting you by phone or email about a tax debt.\n\nBeware of \"phishing\" emails. Taxpayers may receive emails that bear fictitious government logos that offer assistance in settling fake tax issues. The NYS Tax Department and IRS will never request personal or financial information by email.\n\nAvoid identity theft. Your tax return contains personal information, including your social security number, that identity thieves and scammers seek. To prevent your sensitive information from being compromised, only give it to a tax preparer you trust and regularly monitor your bank account for suspicious activity.\n\nReport it. If you believe that you've been contacted by someone attempting a scam, have been the victim of fraud or identity theft, or suspect a tax preparer is engaging in illegal activities, visit the Tax Department's new fraud webpage to learn how to report it.\n\nThe governor also announced the launch of a new website for New Yorkers to report scams, fraudulent activity, and identity theft.\n\nFOLLOW Tracey Porpora on FACEBOOK", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "New Yorkers, Tax Department, New York State Treasury Departments, NYS Treasury, United States, identity theft, NYS Tax Department, Andrew Cuomo, Internal Revenue Service, business-news, news-page, news", "title": "What you need to know to protect yourself from tax scams", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"What you need to know to protect yourself from tax scams\", \"link\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/02/state_warns_of_tax_scams_afoot.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/19683221-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17936857\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-02-05T14:46:52Z\", \"author\": \"Tracey Porpora | porpora@siadvance.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@river\",\"business-news\",\"news-page\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/19683221-standard.jpg", "creator": "@TraceyPorpora1", "site": "@SIAdvance", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Here's what you need to know to protect yourself during tax season."}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, February 05, 2016,  9:46 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"Protect yourself from tax scams\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.silive.com/latest_news/photo/last-minute-income-tax-filers-8a657fc89851faed.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"tporpora\", \"author_nickname\": \"Tracey Porpora | porpora@siadvance.com\", \"author_id\": \"10346524\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Staten Island Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "SILive.com", "description": "Here's what you need to know to protect yourself during tax season.", "title": "What you need to know to protect yourself from tax scams", "url": "http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2016/02/state_warns_of_tax_scams_afoot.html", "image": "http://image.silive.com/home/silive-media/width620/img/latest_news/photo/19683221-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "SILive.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tracey-Porpora/534339770025055?ref=bookmarks"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, February 05, 2016,  9:47 AM", "article_author": "Tracey Porpora | porpora@siadvance.com", "Description": "Here's what you need to know to protect yourself during tax season."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3344\"", "article_summary": "Pocketing Affordable Care Act penalties \u2013 Uninsured New Yorkers may face another tax scam involving penalties under the Affordable Care Act.\nSTATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Each year, tax season brings out con artists who will try to scam taxpayers out of their money.\n\"New Yorkers need to remain vigilant, be skeptical of anyone seeking to solicit personal information, and report any suspicious activity to the appropriate authorities.\"\nTIPS TO PROTECT AGAINST SCAMMERSTo help New Yorkers protect themselves, Cuomo offered the following tips:Don't be fooled by callers who threaten you or ask for personal information.\nBe sure you only give your personal information -- including your social security number -- to someone you trust."}
