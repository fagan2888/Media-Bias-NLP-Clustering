It is literally a horse-and-buggy operation.\n\nDodd-Frank was sold as the salvation of America\u2019s wayward financial system. President Obama hailed the \u201creform\u201d as a measure that would prevent another crisis like the 2008 meltdown.\n\nDespite the promises, Dodd-Frank fixed nothing. As we predicted in 2010, it was simply \u201c2,319 pages of unintended consequences for the economy.\u201d\n\nOf the many negative effects of Dodd-Frank, one is its disincentives for opening new banks.\n\nIn fact, the only bank that has opened since Obama signed the bill is the Bank of Bird-in-Hand located in Bird-in-Hand, Pa., a small village in Amish country. A second bank was approved last month by the FDIC and will open in May or June in Bedford, N.H.\n\nDodd-Frank\u2019s compliance burden is heavier on small banks than larger ones, which are better financed and staffed to handle the costs and complexities. Given this difficult environment, why would anyone open a small bank \u2014 which is to say, why would anyone open a bank at all, since no one starts out opening a large bank?\n\nYet there is a new bank in Bird-in-Hand.\n\nAnd while it doesn\u2019t, according to the Wall Street Journal, \u201coffer online banking \u2026 its sole branch does have a drive-through window that can accommodate a horse and buggy.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s make that horse-and-buggy image a metaphor for the state of today\u2019s banking system in the era of Dodd-Frank.\n\nYes, there are still plenty of big banks, which are getting larger through regulation-driven consolidation.\n\nBut community banks are disappearing , often because they\u2019re being bought by big banks. Their demise is particularly hard on small businesses, which get half their loans from community banks.\n\nA Harvard University study released this year found that \u201ccommunity banks\u2019 share of assets has shrunk drastically \u2014 over 12%\u201d since Dodd-Frank. Separate data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. show a 9.5% decline in the number of small banks in just three years after Dodd-Frank\u2019s passage. It\u2019s been a disaster.\n\nRather than move the banking industry forward, Dodd-Frank has put it in reverse. As is too often the case in Washington, \u201creform\u201d is actually regression.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Regulation: To understand how far Dodd-Frank set back the financial industry, look at the first bank to open in the country since that legislation became law in", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Regulation: To understand how far Dodd-Frank set back the financial industry, look at the first bank to open in the country since that legislation became law in 2010.
