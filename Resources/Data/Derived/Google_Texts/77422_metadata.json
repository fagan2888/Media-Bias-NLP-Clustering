The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors will vote Tuesday whether to allocate a total of $5 million to support treatment facilities struggling to maintain their properties or leases due in part to the area\u2019s high cost of living. Furthermore, after years of waiting, California received federal approval for its waiver to the Affordable Care Act that could allow some of these specialty treatment centers to draw Medi-Cal dollars for the first time. For those who run Our Common Ground and Project 90, nonprofit providers with several facilities throughout the county, news of the multi-million dollar show of support is a comfort \u2014 particularly as timing is of the essence when it comes to treating those who struggle with substance abuse. \u201cWe need this to stay in business, to serve and support clients,\u201d said Ray Rosenthal, president emeritus of the OCG Board of Directors. \u201cWe cannot ignore the problem, this is something that\u2019s not going away. Unfortunately, drug and alcohol abuse is just rampant.\u201d OCG and Project 90 have struggled to provide residential services in an attempt to break one\u2019s addiction cycle through a sober living environment and therapy. But funding sources have dried up as many thought the ACA would kick in and assist. Exacerbated by an increasing population, rising cost of doing business in the Bay Area and Proposition 47 that reduced many drug crimes to misdemeanors, officials feared services would soon be lost if the county didn\u2019t provide more support. The Board of Supervisors had stayed a decision on how to assist until a comprehensive study of the local providers\u2019 finances was completed, said Steve Kaplan, director of the county\u2019s Department of Behavioral Health and Recovery Services. \u201cWe did two things, one was to look at what the existing balances that were on any of the facilities that providers had mortgages on and then concurrently, try to get a sense of their overall financial stability,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cAs we expected, a number of them are pretty on the edge in terms of finances. So the strategy is to stabilize two things; one is the actual treatment capacity so none of the properties are lost, and then secondly, by doing so, improving the overall fiscal health of the organization.\u201d Emergency funding With the OCG board considering having to sell its Redwood City facility to make ends meet and Project 90 soon needing to relocate from its main intake building on Ninth Avenue in San Mateo, the county agreed to extend an emergency $1 million last month. Now, the additional $4 million \u2014 sourced from Measure A half-cent sales tax funds \u2014 will provide longer-term assistance in the form of a low-interest 30-year loan for providers to pay off mortgages and secure their vulnerable properties. But with the extensive application process and funds from the ACA waiver not expected to trickle down for months, if not years, some worry the time lapse will result in more addicts being turned away. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to come up with a program to help us with assistance. But I don\u2019t know that they get the depth of the problem,\u201d said Project 90 Executive Director Jim Stansberry. \u201cMy fear is that even with the money they\u2019ve allocated with the best intentions, that process might take several months. And every month that goes by, we\u2019re sinking further and we\u2019ve got the scars of being in limbo over the last two or three years.\u201d While grateful for the support, Stansberry said he plans to share information about the number of people seeking treatment who\u2019ve dropped off the wait list as treatment beds throughout the county disappear. \u201cEveryone that falls off the wait list is probably going to be impacting other people \u2014 their families or the community. The cost of not giving them services is probably far greater than any cost of helping them,\u201d Stansberry said. Project 90 must move out of two San Mateo properties as the owners plan a major redevelopment along Ninth Avenue. Stansberry said he hopes the county will assist in finding a suitable alternative, particularly as finding a facility with residential and office amenities is difficult. Federal assistance to trickle down Eventually, the county and providers can opt in to the state\u2019s ACA waiver, which would assist local centers by providing insurance funds for the treatment portion of their work. However, Medi-Cal will never reimburse for the expensive residential costs associated with in-patient substance abuse treatment. The waiver will also will provide for a cost of living adjustment to providers with more than 16 beds that are critical to the Bay Area. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a very stable funding source once it gets up and running,\u201d OCG Executive Director Orville Roache said about the waiver. \u201cBut always the question not just for us, but for any other residential provider, is can you survive the time until it gets up and running?\u201d Kaplan said the county must now develop an implementation plan that needs approval from California and federal health officials. As notice of the waiver took months longer than anticipated, Kaplan said he couldn\u2019t be sure when the county would be able to begin doling out Medi-Cal funds to local providers. Eventually, Kaplan said he\u2019s hopeful the insurance funds will help not only ensure there\u2019s options for those seeking treatment to address substance abuse, but alleviate some of the county\u2019s funds to provide other intervention or preventative programs as well as housing assistance. \u201cOver the years, we know that the capacity really hasn\u2019t addressed the full demand and we\u2019ve lost beds,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cAt minimum, we don\u2019t want to have any further reductions in that part of our continuum [of care]. We may need to build more, but we all know that trying to start a residential treatment center in San Mateo, well it\u2019s an understatement to say it\u2019s a challenge. So we want to make sure the ones that are open stay open.\u201d Rosenthal said he\u2019s thankful progress is being made both on the county supervisors front as well as toward further the federal and state aid. However, he added people should recognize providing treatment is better for the community at large. \u201cIf we leave these people without services or any kind of help, they\u2019ll end up in prison and as you know, our prisons are way overpopulated. Judges are having to release people because it\u2019s overcrowded,\u201d Rosenthal said. \u201cThen what do we have? We have a society that is in chaos. So this gives us the ability to provide a program and support.\u201d samantha@smdailyjournal.com (650) 344-5200 ext. 106", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Drug rehab centers to get bailout: Residential programs, facilities set to get $5M in county money -", "title": "Drug rehab centers to get bailout: Residential programs, facilities set to get $5M in county money - San Mateo Daily Journal", "url": "http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2015-09-22/drug-rehab-centers-to-get-bailout-residential-programs-facilities-set-to-get-5m-in-county-money/1776425150560.html", "image": "http://www.smdailyjournal.com/adv_image/smdj-large.jpg", "ttl": 2592000, "type": "website"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000103315106, "app_id": 484828421538257}, "GENERATOR": "San Mateo Daily Journal"}, "article_summary": "Unfortunately, drug and alcohol abuse is just rampant.\u201d OCG and Project 90 have struggled to provide residential services in an attempt to break one\u2019s addiction cycle through a sober living environment and therapy.\nWe may need to build more, but we all know that trying to start a residential treatment center in San Mateo, well it\u2019s an understatement to say it\u2019s a challenge.\n\u201cMy fear is that even with the money they\u2019ve allocated with the best intentions, that process might take several months.\nStansberry said he hopes the county will assist in finding a suitable alternative, particularly as finding a facility with residential and office amenities is difficult.\nHowever, Medi-Cal will never reimburse for the expensive residential costs associated with in-patient substance abuse treatment."}
