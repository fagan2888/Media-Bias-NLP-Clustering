It\u2019s an image of the Good Samaritan inscribed, \u201cTake care of him and I will repay thee.\u201d\n\nThat hospital, the nation\u2019s first, has been in continuous use since then.\n\nEarlier this year, Joseph Alkus, a born-and-raised Philadelphian, was so pleased with the two spinal surgeries he received there that he wrote a letter of praise to the hospital\u2019s executive director.\n\nAlkus told Healthine that he regards himself as a discerning patient. He had considered another local hospital but felt uneasy about the surgeon.\n\nBefore his consultation at Pennsylvania Hospital, he saw his new surgeon listed prominently in Philadelphia Magazine \u2014 it clinched his decision.\n\nWhat Alkus didn\u2019t know was that the federal government has repeatedly penalized the hospital for quality issues.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, created three separate programs that reduce Medicare payments to hospitals that don\u2019t perform well on certain quality metrics.\n\nIn 2015, Pennsylvania Hospital ranked second in in the nation \u2014 out of more than 3,000 hospitals \u2014 for the total penalties it received, including one designed to target surgical errors and infections.\n\n\u201cIf somebody had said, \u2018You might have a higher chance of getting an infection at Pennsylvania Hospital,\u2019 that probably would have impacted my decision to have surgery there,\u201d Alkus said.\n\nBut some experts aren\u2019t convinced that the hospitals receiving penalties are riskier places to seek treatment.\n\nThe penalty programs were intended to promote higher quality of care, along with lower rates of medical errors and hospital readmissions. However, early research suggests the program metrics may have flaws and some hospitals may be unfairly burdened with penalties.\n\nRead More: The Basic Facts on Medicare \u00bb\n\nsection 2 The Hospitals Most Impacted\n\n\u201cNo patient wants to get out of the hospital and feel like they were at a lemon,\u201d Dr. Ben Raimer, vice president of health policy and legislative affairs at University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), told Healthline.\n\nHe added that, in an ideal world, the risk of medical errors would drop to zero.\n\nBut UTMB hasn\u2019t reached that ambitious mark. Like Pennsylvania Hospital, it got dinged in all three Medicare penalty programs.\n\nIt\u2019s also a storied institution, home to the oldest medical school in the Lone Star State. The hospital once offered its full range of medical services to any patient who came through its doors, including the uninsured, until mounting debt led to cutbacks.\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of the Medicare penalty programs is their heavier impact on two types of hospitals.\n\nOne is the \u201cmajor teaching\u201d hospitals, which tend to care for the sickest patients. The other is \u201csafety net\u201d hospitals, which care for the poorest patients.\n\nTake UTMB: It is a major teaching hospital because it runs a large education program to train new doctors. Since major teaching hospitals tend to have more specialists and advanced technologies, they generally care for patients who are sicker and require complex treatment.\n\nFor example, UTMB is the only hospital in the region with a trauma center, where a patient might be taken after a serious car accident. UTMB is also considered a safety net hospital because a hefty percentage of its patients have low incomes.\n\nWhat we live in now is an age where your margin is make or break for these hospitals. There\u2019s no such thing as an insignificant penalty now. Dr. Ben Raimer, University of Texas Medical Branch Share this quote\n\nMedicare\u2019s three penalties programs are all different \u2014 and each program has a heavier impact on hospitals like UTMB for different reasons. The penalties are based on data that aren\u2019t current, so hospitals may have improved by the time they are penalized.\n\nHere is a summary of each program:\n\nHospital Readmissions Reduction Program (Readmissions) : If a patient returns to the hospital too soon after discharge, it may mean the hospital didn\u2019t provide good care in the first place. But research suggests patients from poor neighborhoods, and those in worse health, are more likely to be readmitted. Hospitals are penalized for higher-than-average rates of patients readmitted within 30 days\u2014but only for some conditions, like heart failure and pneumonia. Penalized hospitals lose 3 percent of Medicare\u2019s base payment for all in-patient care.\n\n: If a patient returns to the hospital too soon after discharge, it may mean the hospital didn\u2019t provide good care in the first place.

Penalized hospitals lose 3 percent of Medicare\u2019s base payment for all in-patient care. Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) : Paying for care based on volume of services may encourage doctors to order unnecessary tests. Medicare wants to pay for value, not volume. In this program, money that low-performing hospitals lose through penalties \u2014 up to 1.5 percent of Medicare\u2019s base payments for in-patient care \u2014 creates a pool for high-performing hospitals to get bonuses. This year\u2019s pool was about $1.4 billion. Hospitals are assessed on a complex set of quality measures. Major teaching and safety net hospitals are more likely to face penalties.\n\n: Paying for care based on volume of services may encourage doctors to order unnecessary tests.

This year\u2019s pool was about $1.4 billion. Hospitals are assessed on a complex set of quality measures. Major teaching and safety net hospitals are more likely to face penalties. Hospital-Acquired Conditions (HAC): In this program, the quarter of hospitals with the worst rates of certain infections and injuries receive a 1 percent cut to their total Medicare payments for in-patient care. Some experts are concerned the program is structured in such a way that hospitals doing the most to prevent medical errors are the most likely to be penalized.\n\nThe penalties in each program were designed to be small \u2014 but for some hospitals, they add up. Pennsylvania Hospital\u2019s penalties were more than 4 percent. Like UTMB, it is a major teaching hospital with a high portion of low-income people. The hospital declined to comment for this story.\n\nFor UTMB, the combined penalties were more than 2 percent, translating into more than $2.5 million. Next to the hospital\u2019s $1.5 billion operating budget, some would consider the penalty quite small.\n\nRaimer disagrees.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when people saw that as eraser dust. They\u2019d just sweep it away,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we live in now is an age where your margin is make or break for these hospitals. There\u2019s no such thing as an insignificant penalty now.\u201d\n\nRead More: Bill Would Expand Medicare to Cover Weight Management Therapy \u00bb\n\nsection 2 A Focus on Double-Duty Hospitals\n\nHealthline conducted an analysis of Medicare\u2019s 2015 penalties.\n\nOut of the 3,000 hospitals subject to all three penalty programs, we focused on the small group of 159 hospitals that \u2014 like UTMB and Pennsylvania Hospital \u2014 serve as both major teaching and safety net hospitals.\n\nSince these hospitals play dual roles in caring for the poorest and sickest patients, we call them \u201cdouble-duty\u201d hospitals.\n\nOur analysis found that more than 95 percent of double-duty hospitals received a net penalty across Medicare\u2019s penalty programs. Most were fined in all three. By comparison, fewer than 75 percent of other hospitals faced net penalties.\n\nThere are many major teaching hospitals that do not serve large numbers of low-income patients \u2014 and many safety net providers do not have a teaching program. The penalties also had a disproportionate impact on those hospitals, but the biggest impact was on double-duty institutions.\n\nThe sum of the penalties was fairly small. Fewer than 30 double-duty hospitals received combined penalties of more than 2 percent. However, among that group were highly regarded institutions, including Yale-New Haven Hospital and New York Methodist Hospital.\n\nLarge, urban hospitals were also more likely to receive penalties. Thirty-two double-duty hospitals are located in New York City, a hub for medical education that has many high-poverty areas.\n\nHealthline looked deeper at why each Medicare penalty program takes a heavier toll on double duty hospitals in these stories:\n\nFor a closer look at the medical facilities affected, visit our list of double-duty hospitals.\n\nRead More: Medicare Will Pay for Lung Cancer Screenings for Long-Term Smokers \u00bb\n\nsection 2 The Financial Impact on Hospitals\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system is the most expensive in the world, yet reports consistently show that quality of care is worse here than in other wealthy countries. Finding a way to cut costs while improving quality is the Holy Grail of healthcare policy.\n\nMedicare\u2019s penalty programs \u2014 also known as \u201cpay for performance\u201d programs \u2014 are one small part of that quest. As the nation\u2019s largest insurer, Medicare has influence over the policies and financial stability of the vast majority of hospitals. Most hospitals couldn\u2019t stay open without its payments.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason it\u2019s important for researchers to monitor the impact of the penalty programs on hospitals, Jason Hockenberry, Ph.D., an associate professor at Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, told Healthline.\n\nIf one hospital continued to incur penalties on the higher end of the spectrum every year, Hockenberry speculated, \u201cEven if it was a large hospital, that may be enough over the course of five years to put them in financial dire straits.\u201d\n\nAny reduction in expected revenue really turns into fairly significant impacts on choices, staffing, programmatic planning. Dr. Christopher Cargile, UAMS Medical Center Share this quote\n\nHospitals operating on tight financial margins have little room for error, said Dr. Christopher Cargile, chief medical quality officer at UAMS Medical Center in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\n\u201cAny reduction in expected revenue really turns into fairly significant impacts on choices, staffing, programmatic planning,\u201d Cargile said.\n\nUAMS received penalties in all three programs, totaling about $1.8 million. It costs about $600 million to run the hospital, and it has faced budget deficits in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe penalties may seem small relative to the hospital\u2019s overall budget, but they may be the difference between breaking even or not,\u201d Dr. Janis Orlowski, chief health care officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, told Healthline.\n\nAt UTMB, Raimer said, \u201cFor us, $2.5 million more in our budget, I can tell you, would purchase us 30 more nurses. It would allow us to increase our school of nursing.\u201d\n\nHowever, some hospital administrators were less concerned about the financial impact.\n\n\u201cThe penalties are not enough to really hurt per se,\u201d said Imam Nazeeri-Simmons, chief quality officer at San Francisco General Hospital, which received slightly more than $500,000 in penalties. She described it as a \u201cdrop in the bucket\u201d compared to the hospital\u2019s operating costs.\n\nBut she noted that could change as government pay-for-performance programs grow, adding, \u201cEvery one of us realizes this is just the tip of the iceberg as far as the future of healthcare financing.\u201d\n\nRead More: Some Hospitals Overcharging by as Much as 1,000 Percent \u00bb\n\nsection 2 Paying for Performance in Healthcare\n\nMedicare\u2019s pay-for-performance initiatives are expected to expand. In January, the federal agency set a goal to tie 90 percent of its payments to quality indicators by 2018.\n\nThe approach has already trimmed Medicare\u2019s spending. In 2015, readmissions and HAC penalties alone saved nearly $800 million \u2014 funds that would otherwise have gone to hospitals.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced pay-for-performance programs will lead to cheaper, higher-quality healthcare.\n\nA 2013 Harvard Business Review report noted the lack of evidence that such initiatives improve patient health and pointed to the failure of similar policies in education.\n\nA recent Institute of Medicine study also raised concerns about the widespread use of quality metrics that are imperfect and hard to track.\n\nHospital administrators told Healthline they agreed with the idea of linking performance to payment. But many were concerned that Medicare\u2019s penalty programs don\u2019t account for factors such as poverty. They noted that their hospitals were competing with for-profit hospitals that don\u2019t take high-risk patients.\n\nNo one knows at what point a hospital\u2019s budget issues will compromise its ability to operate so much that quality suffers. Several studies have linked tight hospital margins to worse quality.\n\nNo matter which way you look at it, if we don\u2019t have that money, it makes things more difficult for us. Thomas Thomson, St. John\u2019s Episcopal Hospital Share this quote\n\nIt\u2019s the potential catch-22 of pay-for-performance programs. Facilities that might be the most in need of money to improve quality end up facing the highest fines.\n\n\u201cNo matter which way you look at it, if we don\u2019t have that money, it makes things more difficult for us,\u201d said Thomas Thomson, director of external relations at St. John\u2019s Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway, Queens, New York.\n\nLocated in one of the poorest neighborhoods in New York City, St. John\u2019s became the only local option for most medical services after another hospital closed in 2011.\n\nLike many on Healthline\u2019s double-duty list, the hospital faced penalties in all three programs. It has also endured a string of budget crises in the past five years that included closing units, layoffs, sheltering people during Hurricane Sandy, and a cash shortage for day-to-day operations.\n\nSt. John\u2019s has bigger budget concerns than the penalties, Thomson noted. But he said their \u201cunfair impact\u201d is still an issue.\n\nOn the other hand, some hospital administrators said the penalty programs had increased their hospitals\u2019 focus on quality, which led to improvements in patient safety.\n\n\u201cIt has been one of many leverage points for us to improve our quality and safety culture,\u201d Cargile told Healthline. He added that at UAMS, they expect to cut their total penalties in half next year.\n\nNazeeri-Simmonds shared similar news about San Francisco General. The hospital expects to avoid readmissions and HAC penalties next year but to receive a small VBP penalty.\n\nFor others, the penalties may grow. Harris Health System, which runs the county safety net hospitals in Houston, Texas, received $100,000 in penalties this year. But Michael Norby, C.F.O. of Harris Health, said the penalties may go up to $500,000 in 2016.\n\nNorby explained that a brief spike in patient safety issues was responsible for the potential increase in penalties. He added that Harris Health\u2019s quality team had addressed those issues. He expected the penalties to shrink again by 2017.\n\nRead More: Hospitals Open Emergency Rooms Specifically for Senior Citizens \u00bb\n\nsection 2 High Quality Healthcare Is the Ultimate Goal\n\nAdministrators agree that quality of care in hospitals needs to improve. Infections and injuries related to medical care may cause up to 400,000 deaths annually. The question is how to reduce that number.\n\n\u201cHospitals are spending enormous resources targeting specific quality metrics,\u201d Cargile told Healthline. Medicare\u2019s penalty programs are part of the reason that\u2019s happening.\n\nAt the same time, those programs are disproportionately taking funds from hospitals that care for the poorest and sickest patients. For hospitals that can\u2019t escape the cycle of being penalized, Hockenberry speculated the penalties might become meaningful.\n\nAt Harris Health, Norby said the ultimate goal is to get everything right from a quality perspective. But he didn\u2019t expect that the health system would ever win big in pay-for-performance programs.\n\n\u201cAs a safety net, there is just enough stacked against us,\u201d he added.\n\nTo offer feedback about this story, please email jflannigan (at) healthline (dot) com.
