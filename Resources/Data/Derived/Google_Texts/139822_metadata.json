But there was a hitch: The lost jobs were much better paying jobs than those that replaced them.\n\nRelated: Jobs Market Reaches Another Meaningless Milestone\n\nWhile it is no secret the recession wiped out millions of higher paying jobs and forced many former middle class workers into second-rate jobs, the longer term effects of this phenomenon could pose obstacles to continued economic growth, enhanced consumer confidence and increased consumer spending.\n\nThe jobs that vanished in manufacturing, construction, retail trade and other sectors paid an average annual wage of $61,637, according to a new U.S. Conference of Mayors analysis. By contrast, the replacement jobs, in health care, the food and hotel industry and the service industry, pay on average $47,171 per year, according to the report.\n\nThis means that millions of Americans who lost their jobs and struggled to find new ones are now accepting a lower standard of living \u2013 but there could be even more profound implications in the long run. The 23 percent \u201cwage gap\u201d documented in the new study amounts to an estimated $93 billion of lost wages \u2013 a substantial chunk of change and nearly double the 12-percent gap during the 2001-2002 recession.\n\n\u201cWhile the economy is picking up steam, income inequality and wage gaps are an alarming trend that must be addressed,\u201d said Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n\nRelated: Why the Rich Should Call for Income Redistribution\n\nThe numbers are troubling. Average household income declined by 3 percent, while median income fell 5.5 percent between 2005 and 2012, according to the mayors\u2019 report.\n\nThe study forecasts that middle income households \u201cwill continue to fall behind as higher income levels capture a greater share of income gains.\u201d Median household income is projected to increase by 2.5 percent in nominal dollars in 2014 and then by 3.8 percent per year between 2015 and 2017, according to the study. But average income will rise at a slightly higher pace, adding to the growing income inequality.\n\nJames Diffley, senior director of IHS Global Insight and chief author of the new report, said in an interview that even with the economy and job market showing steady improvement, \u201chouseholds are more cautious\u201d and consumer spending is \u201cstill weaker than one would expect\u201d because of the impact of yawning wage gap.\n\n\u201cWe recovered all those jobs, but they\u2019re at lower incomes so consumer spending is lower,\u201d Diffley said. \u201cSo it contributes to the slow pace of recovery compared to the typical rate of recovery.\u201d\n\nRelated: Minimum Wage Hike Comes with Costs\n\nConsumer spending has been erratic over the past year or two, though it increased at a relatively robust 0.4 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis following slower increases of 0.3 percent in May and 0.1 percent in April, according to the Commerce Department.\n\nHarry J. Holzer, professor of public policy at Georgetown University and a former chief economist at the Department of Labor, said today, \u201cIf the wage gap were only limited to the formally unemployed, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it too much, and it might not even last, because as the recovery gains strength we might see more people in [better paying] full-time jobs.\n\n\u201cBut we might well be talking about a bigger phenomenon, a long-term phenomenon affecting the entire labor market,\u201d he added. \u201cWe know there are these wage gaps \u2013 growing gaps between high school graduates and everyone else, and that\u2019s a much bigger cause for concern.\u201d\n\nLeft unabated, the wage gap, moreover, will continue to pose serious budget problems for states and the federal government, as families relegated from the middle class to lower income rely on social services and tax breaks to make ends meet. \u201cIf a big chunk of these [new] jobs are either low-wage jobs or let\u2019s say involuntary part-time jobs, then yes, the government often provides those folks with earned income tax credits, sometimes food stamps, sometimes Medicaid,\u201d Holzer said.\n\nRelated: What Piketty Left Out of His Inequality Argument\n\nThe growing disparity in wages and household income have become grist for Democrats, including President Obama and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who are championing an increase in the minimum wage, more spending on job training and early childhood education, and tax reform to achieve what they say would be a fairer distribution of wealth.\n\nThe median income for U.S. households in 2012 \u2013 the latest year for which detailed income distribution is available from the U.S. Census \u2013 was $51,017. That is the lowest in real terms since 1995, according to the study. Median income had peaked at $56,000 in 1999 and totaled $55,627 in 2007 before the recession. It has declined in each subsequent year.\n\n\u201cThe inequality crisis facing our cities is a threat to our fundamental American values,\u201d said de Blasio, chair of the Mayors\u2019 Cities of Opportunity task force. \u201cAs mayors, we are on the front lines and we must act now.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new study underscores the growing, and potentially dangerous, gap between wages paid by the 8.7 million jobs that vanished during the recession and the newer jobs that replaced them.
