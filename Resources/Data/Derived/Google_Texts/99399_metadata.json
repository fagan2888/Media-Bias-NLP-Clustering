(AP) - Subaru announced Monday it plans to spend $140 million to boost vehicle production at an Indiana factory and add up to 1,200 jobs in the next two years.\n\nThe Lafayette factory will see its production capacity grow by 100,000 vehicles a year from its current 300,000, the company said.\n\nThe production increase comes after Subaru sold a record 52,697 vehicles in the U.S. during August and represents a show of confidence by parent company Fuji Heavy Industries in Subaru\u2019s only assembly factory outside Japan, said Tom Easterday, Subaru of Indiana Automotive\u2019s executive vice president.\n\n\u201cThe substantial increase in our production volume at SIA will also result in new jobs and investment by many of our suppliers across the state of Indiana,\u201d Easterday said.\n\nAbout 3,800 people now work at the factory that currently builds the Subaru Outback SUVs and Legacy sedans. It is expected to start building Impreza sedans by the end of next year under a $400 million investment in new equipment and other improvements that the company announced in 2013.\n\nSubaru\u2019s sales have nearly doubled since 2011 as the company was able to squeeze better gas mileage out of its small all-wheel-drive SUVs. The company sold almost 514,000 vehicles in 2014 and its sales are up 12.5 percent so far this year, according to Autodata Corp.\n\nSubaru\u2019s decision appears to be a prudent move that shows commitment to the American market since its growth has outpaced other automakers in recent years, said Mike Jackson, the head of North American vehicle forecasting for the consulting firm IHS Automotive.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve actually been so constrained in terms of demand over this past 12- to 18-month window that they\u2019ve probably lost out on some potential for sales,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nEasterday said the Lafayette factory has already started hiring for the new positions that it anticipates having fully in place by 2017.\n\nSubaru\u2019s decision is a further boost for the Lafayette factory, which saw an expected hiring spree for the Impreza production stall in late 2013 when Toyota decided not to renew a contract for the plant to produce its Camry midsize cars that ends next year.\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence, who joined Subaru and Lafayette-area officials for Monday\u2019s announcement, said company executives told him during a trip to Japan last week of the decision to expand the factory that opened in 1989.\n\nPence called Subaru\u2019s investment \u201can extraordinary statement of confidence, not only in this operation, but in the people of the state of Indiana, and we are truly grateful for this widening partnership.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Subaru announced Monday it plans to spend $140 million to boost vehicle production at an Indiana factory and add up to 1,200 jobs in the next two years.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Subaru announced Monday it plans to spend $140 million to boost vehicle production at an Indiana factory and add up to 1,200 jobs in the next two years.", "title": "Subaru plans $140M expansion of Indiana factory", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/21/subaru-plans-140m-expansion-of-indiana-factory/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/21/b3a2949080e7ac2a820f6a70670052f2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/21/b3a2949080e7ac2a820f6a70670052f2.jpg", "description": "Subaru announced Monday it plans to spend $140 million to boost vehicle production at an Indiana factory and add up to 1,200 jobs in the next two years.", "card": "summary", "title": "Subaru plans $140M expansion of Indiana factory"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d4e\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - Subaru announced Monday it plans to spend $140 million to boost vehicle production at an Indiana factory and add up to 1,200 jobs in the next two years.\nEasterday said the Lafayette factory has already started hiring for the new positions that it anticipates having fully in place by 2017.\nThe Lafayette factory will see its production capacity grow by 100,000 vehicles a year from its current 300,000, the company said.\nAbout 3,800 people now work at the factory that currently builds the Subaru Outback SUVs and Legacy sedans.\nThe production increase comes after Subaru sold a record 52,697 vehicles in the U.S. during August and represents a show of confidence by parent company Fuji Heavy Industries in Subaru\u2019s only assembly factory outside Japan, said Tom Easterday, Subaru of Indiana Automotive\u2019s executive vice president."}
