Pastor Rick Jones is the new pastor at Yellow Springs United Methodist Church. He will lead today’s worship service beginning at 10:30 a.m. by delivering the sermon, “Timing is Everything.” The morning scripture will be Ecclesiastes 3:1–15. The service will feature a music video of the Christian band Needtobreathe.

Jones was installed with the Yellow Springs Methodists after Pastor Sherri Blackwell was transferred to a church in Bradford, Ohio. Jones has a Masters of Divinity degree and has worked with disabled veterans through Goodwill Enterprises and the Veterans Administration, as well as at CareSource, where he advocates for human wellfare.

Raised in Tremont City, Jones and his family have lived in Fairborn since 1996.

Local Methodist services of about an hour provide a mix of traditional and contemporary styles, including traditional hymns and contemporary choruses, scripture, prayers, a sermon and sharing of joys and concerns. The 15 member church choir presents special music, and a Children’s Time lesson is part of every regular Sunday service. Coffee and fellowship immediately follows the service.
