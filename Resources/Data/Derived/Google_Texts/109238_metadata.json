Below are faith-inspired quotes from quarterbacks Manning and Newton.\n\nAt age 39, the Broncos quarterback, Peyton Manning, will be the oldest quarterback to start in a Super Bowl game. During his career, he has been a five-time MVP for the NFL, and this will be Manning\u2019s fourth Super Bowl (he has one Super Bowl win under his belt from when the Indianapolis Colts beat the Chicago Bears in the 2006 season). He\u2019s the first quarterback in history to reach the Super Bowl with four different coaches and to take two different teams to the Super Bowl multiple times each.\n\nManning says:\n\n\u201c My faith has been number one since I was 13 years old and heard from the pulpit on a Sunday morning in New Orleans a simple question: \u2018If you died today, are you 100 percent sure you\u2019d go to heaven?\u2019\u201d Manning wrote this in his book called \u201c Manning: A Father, His Sons and a Football Legacy \u201d (which he authored with his dad Archie, a former NFL quarterback, and John Underwood). He wrote later in the book : \u201cAnd I committed my life to Christ, and that faith has been most important to me ever since.\u201d \u201cSome players get more vocal about it\u2014the Reggie Whites, for example\u2014and some point to Heaven after scoring a touchdown and praise God after games. I have no problem with that. But I don\u2019t do it, and don\u2019t think it makes me any less a Christian. I just want my actions to speak louder ,\u201d he wrote in the same book, adding: \u201c My faith doesn\u2019t make me perfect, it makes me forgiven, and provides me the assurance I looked for half my life ago.\u201d \u201cFor me generally it had always been the big four: faith, family, friends, and football [.] \u2026 [A]s important as football is to me, it can never be higher than fourth,\u201d he said in \u201cManning.\u201d He also wrote: \u201cAh, but do I \u2018pray for victory?\u2019 No, except as a generic thing. I pray to keep both teams injury free , and personally, that I use whatever talent I have to the best of my ability.\u201d \u201cThere were a lot of firsts, a lot of firsts for me this year. It\u2019s weird in your 18th season to have so many firsts. But when you sign up to play, you sign up for everything,\u201d he told the The Denver Post in January. He added: \u201cYou learn about yourself and how you handle it. That\u2019s been my theme all year: Just keep being a pro. I\u2019ve been through a lot of stuff \u2026 but that\u2019s what I drew on during this time: Be a pro. Handle it. And keep the faith.\u201d\n\nCarolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, 26, won college football\u2019s biggest award, the Heisman Trophy, in 2010. He went on to become the Carolina Panthers\u2019 first overall pick in the 2011 NFL draft and became the NFL\u2019s first rookie to throw for more than 400 yards in his first game.\n\nNewton says:\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t stop smiling because God has his hands on me,\u201d Newton said after a near fatal truck accident in 2014. \u201cI\u2019m on somebody\u2019s fantasy league. And I think it\u2019s the man upstairs. It\u2019s great to walk away from something like that.\u201d \u201cMe being a religious person, God is good . I\u2019m lucky to be standing in front of you guys.\u201d \u201cLife is too short for you not to appreciate it to the fullest; through the good and the bad! I thank you to the people who have been keeping me in their prayers and well wishes for a speedy recovery,\u201d he wrote on Instagram . \u201cI am appreciative for the many great things God has given me to be thankful for. It\u2019s an old clich\u00e9 statement but it says \u2018 God works in mysterious ways !\u2019 \u201d He added on Instagram: \u201cSo if you read this, I challenge you to live life to the fullness everyday! Love the people who are close to you (and don\u2019t be afraid to tell them as well)! Forgive \u2018whoever\u2019 for \u2018whatever\u2019 they did! Trust when I tell you that life is to short for you not to do those things!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just a God thing. I thank God every single day. I\u2019m just His instrument and He\u2019s using me on a consistent basis daily,\u201d Newton said in 2011 after winning a college football national championship game. \u201c He\u2019s using me to extend his word. I\u2019m a prime example of how God can turn something that was bad into something that was very great.\u201d At the Super Bowl media day Monday night, Newton said he was \u201c[a] Super Bowl quarterback, a Heisman Trophy winner, a first-round pick, but more importantly God\u2019s servant .\u201d He went on to thank God and said: \u201cI\u2019m in a position where a lot of people critique every single thing that I do, but yet I\u2019ll be the first to tell you that I\u2019ve made mistakes and whether you\u2019re from Atlanta, whether you\u2019re from California, whether you\u2019re from Georgia, Florida, wherever you\u2019re from, you can be international, you could see that a person made mistakes but yet didn\u2019t linger on those mistakes, and I still had dreams and aspirations and still conquered them all.\u201d\n\nWhile Manning and Newton are both sure to have their game faces on this weekend, the two have spoken humbly of each other this week.\n\n\u201cAnytime you get compared to Peyton Manning, you must be doing something right. I take it for what it\u2019s worth,\u201d Newton told reporters Monday. He said it is a \u201ctremendous honor to be even mentioned and affiliated with the face of the league.\u201d\n\nAs for Manning, he says Newton will be the future face of the NFL. He told reporters Monday about Newton: \u201cHe\u2019s just had this incredible year. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind he\u2019s going to be the MVP on Saturday night. What he\u2019s done in the short time being an NFL quarterback, he\u2019s been awesome. He\u2019s been awesome. That\u2019s the best word I can think of.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a great passer, he\u2019s been a great runner, he\u2019s been a great leader. You don\u2019t go 17-1 as a starting quarterback without being awesome. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s been this year without a doubt.\u201d\n\n>>> Related: How His Faith Ended His Football Career", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here are some faith-inspired quotes from Peyton Manning and Cam Newton.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Here are some faith-inspired quotes from Peyton Manning and Cam Newton.", "title": "14 Inspiring Quotes About Faith From 2 Super Bowl QBs", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/footballphoto.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-08T11:47:32+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1nQqDIh"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Here are some faith-inspired quotes from Peyton Manning and Cam Newton.", "title": "14 Inspiring Quotes About Faith From 2 Super Bowl QBs", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/footballphoto.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "sports", "published_time": "2016-02-05T03:01:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-08T11:47:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Peyton Manning, Cam Newton, Broncos, Panthers, Super Bowl, Super Bowl 50"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf741\"", "article_summary": "During his career, he has been a five-time MVP for the NFL, and this will be Manning\u2019s fourth Super Bowl (he has one Super Bowl win under his belt from when the Indianapolis Colts beat the Chicago Bears in the 2006 season).\nHe\u2019s the first quarterback in history to reach the Super Bowl with four different coaches and to take two different teams to the Super Bowl multiple times each.\nAt age 39, the Broncos quarterback, Peyton Manning, will be the oldest quarterback to start in a Super Bowl game.\nThe Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers have more in common than just playing each other in Super Bowl 50 this weekend in Santa Clara, California: Both teams have quarterbacks who are men of faith.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a great passer, he\u2019s been a great runner, he\u2019s been a great leader."}
