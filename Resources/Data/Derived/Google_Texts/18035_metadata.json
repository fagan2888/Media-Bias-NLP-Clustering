I need basic necessities. I want shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothbrush, toothpaste,\" founder of the Self Esteem Bags Project Allison Smith said.\n\n\"We've got lip gloss, we've got makeup, we've got chap-stick for the boys,\" volunteer Shannon Richmond said.\n\nTo most people, they're everyday items.\n\nBut many Bay County children include hygiene products on Christmas lists through the Gulf Coast Children's Advocacy Center.\n\nOpening one of those lists two years ago inspired Smith to create these Self Esteem Bags.\n\n\"The first thing is what you thought from a 13-year-old girl: Pretty clothes,\" she said. \"The second thing said, my own toothbrush. The third said, deodorant. And one, I cried. I was in the store crying.\"\n\n\"When I heard that story, I left, and called somebody at the chamber and said, 'I need to get her phone number. I need to get involved.' It touched my heart,\" Richmond said.\n\nThe project's been booming since then.\n\nFrom 42 bags in its first year, to a goal of 200.\n\nFor Smith, working with the CAC provides the perfect opportunity to give back during the holidays.\n\n\"I love kids. I'm not going to have any of my own, that's just kind of a decision that we made. But it kills me to think that kids are in need throughout the year anyway, but especially at Christmas,\" Smith said.\n\nAfter sorting through hundreds of items donated by complete strangers, both women say it's all worth it to see the project come together.\n\nThe group will meet up to make the second round of Self Esteem Bags in Lynn Haven on December 7.\n\nSo far, they've compiled 130 bags. Smith says they're running low on boys' items, such as shaving cream, body wash, combs and cologne", "article_metadata": {"description": "Imagine not having access to deodorant or your own tooth brush every morning.
