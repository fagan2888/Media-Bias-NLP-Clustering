YouTube/Screenshot\n\nAcceptance of homosexuality in the U.S. has grown leaps and bounds over the past few decades. Only between 2001 and 2013, moral acceptance of gay and lesbian relations rose from 40 to 59 percent, according to a Gallup Poll. With that also came fewer objections to gay marriage, and the Supreme Court has declined more than a few times to review such cases. With such a change in public perceptions, it\u2019s remarkable that in December 2014 in the United States, homosexuality, for some people, is considered a vile, disgusting habit unnatural to humans.\n\nIt should be obvious who those disgusted people are. Although all who are religious aren\u2019t guilty of hating gays \u2014 some even support gay marriage \u2014 their religions mostly prohibit same-sex relationships. And Pastor Steven Anderson of Faithful World Baptist Church in Tempe, Ariz. is one of the enforcers. In a video from one of his Sunday sermons, he says, \u201cNo homos will ever be allowed in this church as long as I\u2019m the pastor here\u2026 Never!\u201d\n\nReally, it\u2019s incredible how much effort he puts into hating gays and lesbians, ranting about their supposed pedophilia. He even says he has a solution to the AIDS problem, and that it could be gone by Christmas if we did just one thing. \"Here's what the Bible says, Leviticus 20:13, 'If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination,\u201d he read in the video. \u201cThey shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them.' And that, my friend, is the cure for AIDS. It was right there in the Bible all along.\u201d\n\nSo killing all the gays will get rid of AIDS, apparently. Because that makes sense.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ending, aids, easy, killing, all, gays, pastor, steven, anderson, says", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A pastor in Tempe, Ariz. said in a recent sermon that killing gay people could end the AIDS pandemic by Christmas, or at least \"90-something percent\" of it.", "title": "Killing Gays Can End AIDS By Christmas, Pastor Says [VIDEOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/ending-aids-easy-killing-all-gays-pastor-steven-anderson-says-313396", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/12/07/steven-anderson.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A pastor in Tempe, Ariz. said in a recent sermon that killing gay people could end the AIDS pandemic by Christmas, or at least \"90-something percent\" of it.", "title": "Killing Gays Can End AIDS By Christmas, Pastor Says [VIDEOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/ending-aids-easy-killing-all-gays-pastor-steven-anderson-says-313396", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/12/07/steven-anderson.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/07/steven-anderson.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-07T12:42:57-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-07T12:39:10-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A pastor in Tempe, Ariz. said in a recent sermon that killing gay people could end the AIDS pandemic by Christmas, or at least \"90-something percent\" of it."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda903\"", "article_summary": "And Pastor Steven Anderson of Faithful World Baptist Church in Tempe, Ariz. is one of the enforcers.\nA pastor in Tempe, Ariz. said in a recent sermon that killing gay people could end the AIDS pandemic by Christmas, or at least \"90-something percent\" of it.\nIt was right there in the Bible all along.\u201dSo killing all the gays will get rid of AIDS, apparently.\nAlthough all who are religious aren\u2019t guilty of hating gays \u2014 some even support gay marriage \u2014 their religions mostly prohibit same-sex relationships.\nHe even says he has a solution to the AIDS problem, and that it could be gone by Christmas if we did just one thing."}
