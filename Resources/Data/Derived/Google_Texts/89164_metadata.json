And that should not surprise us \u2013 for the Supreme Court has not recognized such a category. \u2026 The Supreme Court has chastened us lower courts for creating, out of whole cloth, new categories of speech to which the First Amendment does not apply. But, that is exactly what the panel\u2019s opinion accomplishes in this case.\u201d\n\nTwo appeals courts also have issued conflicting decisions on the issue.\n\nCalifornia was the first state to make such therapy illegal for minors, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded the therapy, which mostly involves talking, is \u201cconduct\u201d rather than speech. That means it would not be protected by the First Amendment.\n\nBut when New Jersey made the therapy illegal for minors, the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals determined it is speech but concluded it is a special kind of speech that is not protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIn both states, pro-homosexual lawmakers worked to forward laws that prohibit counselors from speaking to minors about ways to overcome unwanted same-sex inclinations, no matter the cause.\n\nThe issue is important in the homosexual community, which is protected now in most parts of the country as a minority, based on the premise that \u201csexual orientation\u201d is innate and, therefore, immutable. However, there is substantial evidence that many have overcome same-sex attractions.\n\nStaver has explained lawmakers and judges \u201chave essentially barged into the private therapy rooms of victimized young people and told them that their confusion, caused by the likes of a Jerry Sandusky abuser, is normal and that they should pursue their unwanted and dangerous same-sex sexual attractions and behavior, regardless of whether those minors desire their religious beliefs to trump their unwanted attractions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case presents questions of national importance, which have split the circuits and resulted in decisions conflicting with this court\u2019s precedents,\u201d Liberty\u2019s filing explained. \u201cThe circuit courts of appeal are split as to whether a law restricting what counselors or healthcare providers may say and what clients or patients may hear in the privacy of the counsel-client or doctor-patient relationship is speech protected by the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe brief continued: \u201cThe law \u2026 infringes the right of licensed mental health professionals to provide competent, consensual counseling carried out via verbal communication \u2013 speech \u2013 in the same manner as every other form of modern mental health counseling.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "A state order mandating that counselors dealing with patients on issues of sexuality must promote same-sex relationships violates the First Amendment and the fundamental principle of mental health counseling, charges a brief filed with the U.S. Supreme Court. \u201c[New Jersey law] limits the communication a professional can provide to a consenting client, despite the client\u2019s [\u2026]", "title": "Can states \u2018nullify\u2019 First Amendment?", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2015/02/can-states-nullify-first-amendment/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2014/05/constitution.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf57f\"", "article_summary": "\u2026 The Supreme Court has chastened us lower courts for creating, out of whole cloth, new categories of speech to which the First Amendment does not apply.\nThe Supreme Court declined the case even despite a powerful dissent from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, which upheld the state censorship.\nAnd that should not surprise us \u2013 for the Supreme Court has not recognized such a category.\nThe brief comes in support of a request that the U.S. Supreme Court step in and affirm the First Amendment, the rights of patients to choose their own counseling goals and to resolve current conflicts in lower court decisions.\nA state order mandating that counselors dealing with patients on issues of sexuality must promote same-sex relationships violates the First Amendment and the fundamental principle of mental health counseling, charges a brief filed with the U.S. Supreme Court."}
