Not everyone goes shopping, but a lot do.\n\n\u201cWe have literally watched the typical time for Thanksgiving dinner go from about 5 p.m. to 3 p.m. so people can catch the sales that are starting that evening.\u201d\n\nSo much for lining up at the doors at dawn the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nFolks who wait until Black Friday for deals at big-box retail outlets such as electronics stores can find themselves aced out of products they seek.\n\nHow did it come to this?\n\nA bit of history\n\nThe notion of the Friday after Thanksgiving being a big retail day goes back 75 years.\n\nWhile President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 had declared the last Thursday in November a day for national thanksgiving, it was President Franklin D. Roosevelt who moved to elongate the holiday shopping period in 1939, when the last Thursday in November fell on Nov. 30, leaving shoppers \u2014 and retailers \u2014 only 24 shopping days until Christmas.\n\nAfter two years of wrangling, it was decided that Thanksgiving would be held on the fourth Thursday of November.\n\nThe retail term \u201cBlack Friday\u201d would not emerge until the 1960s. One version of the term\u2019s origins holds that Philadelphia police coined it to describe the chaos at downtown stores on that day.\n\n\u201cRetail has gotten more sophisticated,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cSales are starting earlier, and consumers are being wooed earlier.\u201d\n\nBlack Friday has eroded the notion that the day after Thanksgiving is a time to revel with leftovers and relatives, where cousins get to know one another and folks can compare how everyone has grown in height or waistline from the previous year.\n\nImpulse and profit\n\nThe day is no longer a breather but, rather, part of a weeks-long mono-holiday. It is the revving of an economic engine that rumbles from Thanksgiving through Christmas to New Year\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cIt seems we\u2019ve commercialized a national holiday in every month of the year,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nMuch of this is a twofold result of the 2008 economic crash and the rise of online shopping, a direct threat to the profits of traditional retailers.\n\nBut Cohen notes that statistically, the percentage of impulse purchases is nearly twice as high at stores than it is online. So opening earlier is just good strategy for brick-and-mortar outlets.\n\nThe National Retail Federation predicts sales in November-December of 2014 (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) will jump 4.1 percent over 2013 to $616.9 billion.\n\nIt would be the first time since 2011 that holiday sales in that period increased more than 4 percent over the previous year.\n\nBarbara Bickart, associate professor of marketing at Boston University\u2019s School of Management, said the expanded Thanksgiving sales season has dual drivers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the lure of great deals for customers, and retailers are feeling the pressure,\u201d Bickart said. \u201cThey want the customers to come to their stores first and stay away from the competition.\n\n\u201cAnd consumers seem drawn to it. For them it\u2019s almost as a game.\u201d\n\nThe media \u2014 print and broadcast alike \u2014 contribute to this.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the stories about the madness at the doors and interviews with customers salivating for deals, but the advice from \u201cexperts\u201d on how to score big in the sales aisles. Smartphone apps help shoppers navigate retail parking lots for open spaces.\n\nOf course, this is a two-edged proposition.\n\nYes, retailers open early on Black Friday and fan the flames. But would they do this if we, the people, weren\u2019t lining up hundreds-deep in front of those stores when the morning sun was still several time zones away?\n\nKate Raymond of Denver hopes to beat Black Friday: She plans to hit Best Buy after a midday Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nThe store near her opens at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day and stays open until 1 a.m.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, she had just emerged from a Best Buy on East Mexico Avenue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the market for a new high-def television,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was in there scouting for flat-screens and trying to get a jump on Thursday evening, when we\u2019ll be shopping.\u201d\n\nBlack Thursday?\n\nBut could there be a backlash to the notion of shopping on Thanksgiving? Two years ago, a Boycott Black Thursday page went up on Facebook.com. To date, it has more than 115,000 \u201cLikes.\u201d\n\nA Wednesday post by Lori Jo Anderson reads: I\u2019m not shopping this Thursday, neither is my family. I don\u2019t want to give money to any company that is turning Thanksgiving into Thanks-grabbing.\n\nNot all businesses combine cranberry sauce and consumerism. National chains such as Costco, Sam\u2019s Club, Nordstrom, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls are shuttered on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nDenver\u2019s Tavern Hospitality Group also has decided to stay dark for the sake of its staff members.\n\n\u201cThis year we reached out to our employees, crunched all the numbers, and decided that the morale benefit outweighs any revenue loss,\u201d said owner and CEO Frank Schultz.\n\nFor a company with 11 locations, many with a major sports-bar emphasis, it was a big decision. Traditionally, their doors have opened on Thanksgiving around 6 p.m., letting people in to watch ballgames or just get away from a packed living room.\n\n\u201cThe whole frenzy of people shopping and going out just isn\u2019t fair to people working in those industries,\u201d Schultz said.\n\nWilliam Porter: 303-954-1877, wporter@denverpost.com or twitter.com/williamporterdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Ah, Thanksgiving: Family, feasting, football \u2014 and frenzied shopping", "title": "Ah, Thanksgiving: Family, feasting, football \u2014 and frenzied shopping", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/26/ah-thanksgiving-family-feasting-football-and-frenzied-shopping/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141126_122713_Thanksgiving-2014-Coverart-1.jpg", "height": 483}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141126_122713_Thanksgiving-2014-Coverart-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-26T20:12:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:45:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Barbara Bickart, associate professor of marketing at Boston University\u2019s School of Management, said the expanded Thanksgiving sales season has dual drivers.\nA bit of historyThe notion of the Friday after Thanksgiving being a big retail day goes back 75 years.\n\u201cFor many people, Thanksgiving Day itself has become as much about shopping as food.\nThen it became a day of family, feasting and football.\nTo date, it has more than 115,000 \u201cLikes.\u201dA Wednesday post by Lori Jo Anderson reads: I\u2019m not shopping this Thursday, neither is my family."}
