Andrew Cuomo to circumvent an \u201cunwilling legislature\u201d to advance his agenda.\n\nIn its appeal, the association claims that the governor violated the state\u2019s separation of powers doctrine, which \u201cdoes not allow for such blatant executive overreach.\u201d\n\nCuomo received backlash across the state after he created a wage board in May that enabled him to implement the hike without approval from the legislature.\n\nThe association argued that the wage board, charged with evaluating the fast food industry to determine whether a wage increase is necessary, did not include anyone from the restaurant industry.\n\n\u201cWithout proper representation and input from the affected industry, a wage board cannot fairly and adequately evaluate the costs, benefits, and consequences of the action it is considering,\u201d the association wrote in its appeal.\n\nActing Labor Commissioner Mario Musolino approved the increase in September, making New York the first state to set its minimum wage at $15 an hour, though the boost applies solely to fast food workers at chain restaurants with at least 30 locations.\n\nCuomo announced the increase during a labor rally with Vice President Joe Biden last month, calling it a victory in the \u201ccrusade for economic justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cRaising the minimum wage to $15 an hour will add fairness to our economy and bring dignity and respect to 2.2 million people, many of whom have been forced to live in poverty for too long,\u201d he said.\n\nJames Sherk, a research fellow in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation, countered Cuomo, contending that the wage hike would instead harm consumers and workers.\n\n\u201cThe average fast food restaurant would have to increase prices almost 40 percent, while cutting employment and hours back by a third, in order to afford this hike,\u201d Sherk said. \u201cThat means higher costs for low- and middle-income families and fewer entry-level jobs for those just starting in the workforce.\u201d\n\nThe challenge marks the National Restaurant Association\u2019s latest effort in its campaign against Cuomo\u2019s wage push.\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed published in May, the group\u2019s president, Dawn Sweeney, called the governor\u2019s plan \u201can assault on an industry that has delivered nearly 800,000 jobs to the state of New York.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "They say N.Y. governor is guilty of \"executive overreach.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "They say N.Y. governor is guilty of \"executive overreach.\"", "title": "Restaurant Industry to Fight New York's Minimum Wage Hike", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151027_NYMinimumWage_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-27T18:46:03+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Wgw5TP"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "They say N.Y. governor is guilty of \"executive overreach.\"", "title": "Restaurant Industry to Fight New York's Minimum Wage Hike", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151027_NYMinimumWage_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "labor", "published_time": "2015-10-27T18:37:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-27T18:46:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "National Restaurant Association, Andrew Cuomo, minimum wage, wage hike, New York Industrial Board of Appeals, Joe Biden"}, "article_summary": "The National Restaurant Association is fighting New York\u2019s anticipated $15-per-hour minimum wage hike in the restaurant industry\u2019s latest wage battle.\nThe association argued that the wage board, charged with evaluating the fast food industry to determine whether a wage increase is necessary, did not include anyone from the restaurant industry.\nJames Sherk, a research fellow in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation, countered Cuomo, contending that the wage hike would instead harm consumers and workers.\nThe group argued that the New York Department of Labor\u2019s order to raise the minimum wage from $8.75 to $15 an hour by 2021 marked a \u201cthinly veiled\u201d attempt by Gov.\n\u201cThe average fast food restaurant would have to increase prices almost 40 percent, while cutting employment and hours back by a third, in order to afford this hike,\u201d Sherk said."}
