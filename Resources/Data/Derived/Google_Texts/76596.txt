Mother Nature could not dampen the spirits of thousands of kids and parents who came out to the 22nd Annual Kids Fest at the Bay County Fair Grounds.

Close to 60 local organizations attended to give kids free entertainment as well as educating parents on different activities that are offered throughout Bay County.

There were ballon animals, arts and crafts, and face painting, but there was one activity that was a kid favorite.

"Bounce house! Because it was really bouncy. I went up and down, up and down," explained Lincoln, a local bounce house enthusiast.

Any proceeds raised from concession sales goes towards the Head Start Program of Bay County.
