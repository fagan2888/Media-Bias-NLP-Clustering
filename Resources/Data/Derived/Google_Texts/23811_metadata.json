Right is District IV Trustee Dr. Carolyn Evans-Shabazz.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under Community, Showcase\n\nHouston Community College Trustee Sandie Mullins said her farewells at the Board of Trrustees meeting Thursday Dec. 17.\n\nMullins lost her race for the Houston City Council District G seat in November to Greg Travis. Her Trustee District VI seat will be filled by Dr. John P. Hansen after Dec. 31.\n\nDr. Hansen and District IV incumbent Carolyn Evans-Shabazz ran unopposed in November. The incumbents of District III Adriana Tamez and District VIII Eva Loredo are both keeping their positions on the board after being re-elected by comfortable margins. Dr. Hansen will be the only new face come January.\n\nThe nine members of the Board of Trustees comprise the official governing body of Houston Community College. Trustees are elected from single-member districts for six-year terms and serve without compensation.\n\nMullins has served six years on the HCC Board of Trustees after being elected in 2009. Each of her colleagues on the board gave their farewells, calling Mullins \u201cinsightful\u201d, \u201cdedicated\u201d and \u201ca cheerleader\u201d.\n\nDistrict I Trustee and Board Chair Zeph Capo said, \u201cWhat I admire you most is your tenacious advocacy for your district. You don\u2019t speak for Sandie Mullins, you speak for district six.\u201d\n\nMullins reflected that their only goal as HCC trustees \u201cis for students to go in and go out within a reasonable budget. To take care of the students and the taxpayers all at the same time.\u201d\n\nAt the reception following her farewell, Mullins said that she plans to continue being involved in the community.\n\nHansen has a Ph.D in economics from Rice University and twenty-two years of experience on the Alief ISD school board, which is also an uncompensated public service position. Dr. Hansen said he doesn\u2019t see his new role at HCC as fundamentally different from his position at Alief ISD.\n\nSince he will be the newcomer to the table, Dr. Hansen said he has been spending time meeting with people so he can obtain a clear picture of the current status of the college and determine for himself what plans are actually in place and \u201chow many of them are just on a sheet of paper somewhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will probably be a little careful for a while, because as the new person on the board, you don\u2019t want to be in the position of assuming you know what everybody else knows,\u201d he added that, \u201cI don\u2019t plan on being in that mode for a long time.\u201d Dr. Hansen said once he believes he\u2019s up to speed, he plans on being a little more aggressive.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t think HCC is doing a bad job, but that there are things HCC could do better. One thing in particular he plans on focusing on is workforce development.\n\nHansen said that as a trustee \u201c\u2026our primary job is to create an environment in which the staff can be professionally successful. Because if they succeed \u2013 by definition \u2013 they will be getting the students to accomplish what, hopefully, they\u2019re capable of,\u201d adding that, \u201cYou can\u2019t force your staff to be successful, but you can create an environment in which they can be.\u201d\n\nCreating a supportive environment for faculty may be particularly crucial in light of the hiring priorities and practices report put together by the faculty senate. Faculty Senate President David White explained in his meeting report that HCC\u2019s common practice of hiring a lot of part-time instructors hurts the college in numerous ways.\n\nWhite discussed how other local colleges are hiring more full-time faculty, which means \u201cevery time that happens, we lose some of our best and brightest part-time faculty because they literally cannot afford to wait for us to hire them full-time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey cannot afford to wait to do the jobs they love here,\u201d added White. He claimed that HCC is also losing faculty to local school districts and jobs outside of academia.\n\nSuch practices negatively affect the college\u2019s accreditation metrics and community image. \u201cIt suggests that we care more about doing it on the cheap, than doing it right,\u201d claimed White.\n\nThe worst-case scenario is that with the Affordable Care Act, Houston Community College could be liable to pay up to a $300 thousand a month fine to the Federal Government because of the college\u2019s part-time hiring practices. \u201cI hope that you\u2019re as scared about that as I am,\u201d said White to the trustees.\n\nThe full Faculty Senate Hiring practices report will be given to the trustees before it will be shared with The Egalitarian.", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Egalitarian", "description": "Houston Community College Trustee Sandie Mullins said her farewells at the Board of Trrustees meeting Thursday Dec. 17.
