Thousands grooved to live bands at Festivals Acadiens et Creoles. Downtown Alive, Rhythms on the River, Bach Lunch, Blackpot Festival, Music & Market, the Mercredi Shows, the Latin Festival, Zydeco Breakfast, Acadiana Symphony Orchestra concerts, KBON Music Festival and more.\n\nImagine if half of the musicians providing those sounds suddenly disappeared. It\u2019s a real possibility.\n\nStatistics show that musicians, with their cyclical incomes, are uninsured at half the rate of the general public. A good number of local music makers are dealing with diabetes, high blood pressure and other significant ailments in emergency rooms.\n\nMoriba Karamoko, an avid local dancer who also works with the Louisiana Consumer Healthcare Coalition, said, just like the general public, musicians can have better health through regular, primary care.\n\n\u201cChronic diseases are hard to manage with primary care,\u201d said Karamoko. \u201cThey\u2019re almost impossible to manage when you\u2019re outside of care. Insurance allows you to secure the regular care that you need for chronic disease management.\n\n\u201cWe had people in the (musicians) workshop last year that have been uninsured most of their professional career and are trying to manage some chronic disease. They\u2019re suffering adverse consequences of the disease and having the disease without a primary care relationship.\u201d\n\nLCHC and the Tipitina\u2019s Music Office Co-Op of Lafayette are hosting a free musicians health insurance workshop at 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Co-Op office, 203 Jefferson St.\n\nThe workshop is not a sales pitch. Musicians will only receive information on health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Enrollment starts Nov. 15.\n\nCommonly called Obamacare. the ACA is a hot button issue in politics. But Karamoko stresses the\n\nACA is a legal resource available to small, independent contractors, like musicians.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to persuade you to like, vote for or embrace Barack Obama,\u201d said Karamoko. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about an option for health insurance. If you find it useful, take advantage of it. If you find it\u2019s not useful, or any of the material I\u2019ve given you is not useful, there\u2019s a trash can right over there. Throw it in the trash and we can still be friends. It\u2019s purely for information. The decision is each individual musician to decide what they want to do.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ve seen people avoid significant medical expenses this past year because they had insurance. I\u2019m talking as little as $1,700 and as much as $17,000. Hernia operations aren\u2019t cheap. As a musician, you\u2019re not doing the same kind of work as a painter does with the risk of falling off the top of a building.\n\n\u201cBut accidents do happen and musicians are involved in accidents.\u201d\n\nKaramoko said 25 musicians attended last year\u2019s sessions. Several now have health insurance for the first time in their professional careers.\n\nKamamoko said those musicians now have better personal and financial health.\n\n\u201cInsurance gives you some protection against the financial insecurity and devastation that comes with high medical debt. The way this country handles medical debt, it can spill over into your attempts to buy a house or secure a business loan to further your career as a musician.\n\n\u201cFrom a health standpoint, coverage gives you access to the prevention service, early diagnosis. Like Wayne Singleton, who\u2019s been very public about his bout with prostate cancer. He benefited from early detection that he got access to from being insured. He\u2019s in a better place today because of that.\n\n\u201cWithout that kind of insurance, his prostate cancer would have gone undetected. He would have found out at a later stage of the disease, which is harder to treat. It would have devastated him financially.\u201d\n\nHerman Fuselier is food and culture editor for the Times of Acadiana and Daily Advertiser.
