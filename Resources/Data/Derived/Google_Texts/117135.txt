BALTIMORE (AP) - Companies offering coverage on the health care exchange in Maryland are proposing to increase rates.

The Baltimore Sun reports (http://bsun.md/1OqzfBd ) that United Healthcare will no longer offer individual plans on the state’s online exchange created under the Affordable Care Act. It will still offer plans in the small-business market.

CareFirst Blue Cross BlueShield has asked regulators for a 12.4 percent increase in its HMO plan next year. It’s seeking a 16 percent increase for its two other plans.

Cigna Health and Life Insurance Co. is asking for a 29.8 percent increase. Evergreen Health Cooperative has requested an 8.1 percent increase and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the Mid-Atlantic States is asking for a 25 percent rate hike.

The insurance commission is expected to decide on the rates by early August.
