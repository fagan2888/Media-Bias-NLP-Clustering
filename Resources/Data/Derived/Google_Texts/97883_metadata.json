He is completing what Ross Perot tried to build in 1992 with his Reform Party.\n\nFor the Washington Republican establishment this is a disaster, much worse than the election of Barack Obama. Because they\u2019re the first people who\u2019ll get run out of town and find out what it\u2019s like to lose their jobs to an alien.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t have the cadre of Republican consultants, pollsters, funders and party organizers that I would argue have been a big part of the problem with our government. They are the party apparatchiks the Trump brigades are partially rebelling against.\n\nMeanwhile, the Super PACs keep raiding their millionaire and billionaire check-writers for more tens of millions of dollars in TV ads denouncing Trump. Can anyone imagine Democrats doing that to Hillary Clinton? Bernie Sanders practically genuflects in front of her.\n\nIf Republicans had spent their $100 million roughing up Clinton rather than Trump, the GOP would be in much better shape and the \u201cTrump can\u2019t win\u201d mantra, already dubious, would be all the less convincing.\n\nInstead, the Republican intelligentsia is thumbing its nose at Trump and even making the banal argument that Hillary in the White House would be better.\n\nHuh? This is the Hillary Clinton who wants to raise tax rates to 50% or more; favors abortion on demand with no exceptions; wants trillions for new spending and debt; would shut down America\u2019s oil, gas and coal production; will double down on ObamaCare; and was the architect of the disastrous foreign policy of leading from behind.\n\nOther than that, she\u2019s conservative enough.\n\nA person\u2019s vote is a matter of moral conscience. And if people feel they can\u2019t vote for Trump because of his policy positions or obnoxious behavior, I respect that totally. I voted against Bush in 1992 because he lied about raising taxes \u2014 and I have no regrets. But the idea of a de facto Obama third term would seem to be the death of the conservative movement.\n\nWhat is more inexplicable is that after two decades of chasing after blue-collar Reagan Democrats, the GOP finally has a candidate who lures them into the party \u2014 only to treat them as outsiders, low-information voters and even racists.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that Republicans don\u2019t seem to be learning anything from Trumpism.\n\nJeb Bush and Trump were the two polar opposites \u200eof this election. Bush was obsessed with raising money and spent all his time pulling in dollars six figures at a time. His idea of a political rally was to go to a posh country-club home, chat with 30 to 50 donors and swoop up checks with lots of zeroes. Trump\u2019s events attract actual voters in the tens of thousands. Bush wouldn\u2019t have won if he\u2019d had a billion dollars.\n\nTrump challenges Republican and conservative orthodoxy on trade, immigration and foreign policy. No one took him seriously because he had rough edges, said offensive things and had never won an election. But lo and behold, a plurality of GOP primary voters liked what he said. The explanation may go back to the famous cereal commercial: \u201cHe likes it! Hey, Mikey!\u201d\n\nOn these pages I\u2019ve criticized Trump\u2019s Fortress America position on immigration and trade. But this year at least, the voters don\u2019t agree with me. They do want the wall. They do want to get tough with China. They do think foreign goods are taking American jobs. They do want to keep out Muslims. They do want a balanced budget and an end to foreign aid. And they won\u2019t be intimidated by the thug tactics of the left.\u200e\n\nIf Trump wins the nomination and then the election, he will do so by forging a new coalition of voters. He will lose many highbrow Republicans, but he will gain millions of independents and blue-collar Democrats \u2014 commonsense workers who\u2019ve been crushed by Obama\u2019s anti-business policies.\n\nThey would be a coalition of voters who want to put America first.
