Organization and agency officials told The Post they\u2019ve already reviewed $3 million worth of IRD expenses and flagged about $1 million in questionable charges.\n\nThe government reimburses contractors for overhead costs only. This does not include expenses like personal dinners and NFL tickets\u2014all of which IRD allegedly tried to pass off as overhead.\n\nThe organization raked in $2.4 billion from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) before being suspended last month after federal investigations revealed IRD was engaged in serious misconduct and improper spending of taxpayer dollars.\n\nThe suspension notice, obtained by The Post, accused IRD of mischarging USAID over a period of \u201cat least four years.\u201d USAID gave IRD 30 days to respond to the suspension notice and questioned why IRD officials who were likely aware of the improper spending practices were still holding their positions.\n\nRelated: America\u2019s $320 Billion Shadow Economy\n\nThen, last Friday, a handful of senior IRD executives suddenly resigned, including its chief financial officer, general counsel and chief administrative officer. The resignations came as investigators from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction intensify their probes into IRD\u2019s handling of taxpayer money.\n\nThe former president of the organization, Arthur B. Keys \u2014 who retired last year \u2014 is one of the primary subjects of the ongoing investigation, as the questionable charges were made on his American Express card, though Keys\u2019 attorney says other employees also used the card so it\u2019s impossible to determine that it was Keys who made the charges.\n\nIRD\u2019s new president, Roger Ervin, told The Post that he\u2019s turned over relevant financial records to the investigators. Meanwhile, the organization says it's in the process of improving financial controls and restructuring their operations.\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, so it\u2019s unclear what will happen to IRD.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One of the government\u2019s largest nonprofit contractors hired to work on humanitarian pr", "title": "Nonprofit Contractor Billed Taxpayers for Booze, NFL Tickets", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/10/Nonprofit-Contractor-Billed-Taxpayers-Booze-NFL-Tickets", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122011_Government_Waste_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/10/Nonprofit-Contractor-Billed-Taxpayers-Booze-NFL-Tickets", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07122011_Government_Waste_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "One of the government\u2019s largest nonprofit contractors hired to work on humanitarian pr", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Organization and agency officials told The Post they\u2019ve already reviewed $3 million worth of IRD expenses and flagged about $1 million in questionable charges.\nThis does not include expenses like personal dinners and NFL tickets\u2014all of which IRD allegedly tried to pass off as overhead.\nRelated: Pentagon\u2019s Fast and Loose Ethics OversightFederal investigators from several agencies are still probing the organization and haven\u2019t released an official report yet.\nExecutives from International Relief and Development allegedly overcharged the government millions of dollars to pay for alcohol, Redskins tickets, dinner and personal travel expenses, The Washington Post first reported.\nIRD\u2019s new president, Roger Ervin, told The Post that he\u2019s turned over relevant financial records to the investigators."}
