NEW ORLEANS (WGNO) – “The Trouble Tree” is a signature staple at Cafe Adelaide’s Swizzle Stick bar. It’s one of Bar Chef Lu Brow’s many delicious delights.

“The reason we call it a ‘Trouble Tree’ is because it starts a little bit of trouble. It’s just so much fun, and really brings on the excitement. We bring them out for special occasions,” Brow said.

“The Trouble Tree” is a great way to sample our signature cocktail known as The Adelaide Swizzle.

What’s inside the drink, you ask?

“Rougaroux rum, club soda, bitters and a secret ingredient that we never tell,” she said.

Tales of the Cocktail is the perfect time to start a little bit of trouble by drinking “The Trouble Tree”.

Another thing, you’ll get in trouble if you call them shots.

“We do NOT call them shots. These are trouble trees or cocktail samples,” she said.

Cafe Adelaide will be holding a special “Hangover Hospital Cocktail Brunch” on Saturday for Tales of the Cocktail.

Bar Chef Lu Brow will be preparing meals and cocktail pairings for guests.
