Why? Because he didn\u2019t want to close the tax loopholes for millionaires and billionaires to pay for the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp hold Mitch McConnell accountable for leading the charge against America\u2019s struggling students. Make a donation to Alison\u2019s campaign right now,\u201d wrote Warren, who is heading to Kentucky later this month.\n\nWhile Beltway commentators remain consumed with the political impact of Obamacare and Bowe Bergdahl, one under-the-radar issue that could gain traction in several Senate races is student loans \u2014 framed on Warren\u2019s terms, as a battle between those who prioritize protecting the wealth of billionaires and those who want to help ordinary Americans still struggling under crushing debt in the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nIn coming days you can expect Grimes to focus specifically on how Mitch McConnell\u2019s filibuster of the student loan bill would impact Kentucky women in particular, linking that to Grimes\u2019 effort to tailor other issues, such as the minimum wage, to a broader argument about women\u2019s pocketbook issues.\n\nWarren\u2019s student loan bill would have allowed millions of students to refinance loans at lower interest rates, paid for by the \u201cBuffett Rule\u201d ending tax breaks for millionaires paying low rates.\n\nMeanwhile, the student loan issue could have interesting resonance in the Senate race in North Carolina, where there are large numbers of students. GOP Senate candidate Thom Tillis initially refused to take a position on the bill after the GOP filibuster, before releasing a statement claiming it has \u201cglaring issues.\u201d Dem Kay Hagan\u2019s campaign responded by hitting Tillis for his involvement in the state legislature\u2019s cuts to education, a key example of the state\u2019s hard turn to the right, which will be a central to the sharp ideological contrast driving this contest.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dem-allied Patriot Majority PAC is up with an ad in Arkansas blasting GOP candidate Tom Cotton for benefiting from student loans to go to Harvard while voting against a measure in the House to lower college borrowing costs.\n\nIn 2012, Elizabeth Warren gave a speech to a roomful of people on why it\u2019s reasonable to expect the rich to give more back to the society that helped enable their success. It went viral and framed an argument over individual initiative, taxes and the social contract that dominated the presidential campaign for months.\n\nThe student loan battle will not come remotely close to that level of impact. But Warren\u2019s framing of this battle will resonate a bit in 2014. McConnell justified his filibuster by sneering that the student loan bill is a \u201cshow vote,\u201d and in an interview with Chris Hayes, Warren responded:\n\n\u201cThere are 40 million Americans dealing with student loan debt\u2026.young people today can\u2019t buy homes, can\u2019t buy businesses, because they\u2019re spending so much on student loan debt\u2026for Mitch McConnell to lead the attack on that just shows whose side he stands on. Mitch McConnell is there for millionaires and billionaires. He is not there for people who are working hard and playing by the rules.\u201d\n\nIn Kentucky, expect a similar case from Grimes, one that will be tied to her attacks on McConnell for refusing to raise the minimum wage for Kentuckians despite being a multi-millionaire himself. In North Carolina, expect a similar case to be made as part of efforts to turn out young voters, a group that traditionally drops off in midterms.\n\nTo be sure, the midterm dropoff problem Dems face is severe \u2014 as is the national political environment \u2014 and an issue like this may not make much difference. But Dems are going for an approach that entails pushing on as many fronts as they possibly can, in hopes of limiting their losses on the margins just enough to hang on to control of the Senate. And student loans will figure into that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Her student loan relief push may resonate in several Senate races.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Her student loan relief push may resonate in several Senate races.", "title": "The Elizabeth Warren effect", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/06/13/the-elizabeth-warren-effect/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/05/19/Editorial-Opinion/Images/2014-05-11T155124Z_01_TOR604_RTRIDSP_3_USA-2072.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/06/13/the-elizabeth-warren-effect/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "elizabeth warren, student loan bill, elizabeth warren student loans, north carolina senate race, arkansas senate race, 2014 senate races,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "elizabeth warren, student loan bill, elizabeth warren student loans, north carolina senate race, arkansas senate race, 2014 senate races,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b97\"", "article_summary": "Today, Elizabeth Warren blasted out a fundraising email to her list of supporters on behalf of Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\u201cMake no mistake about who blocked our student loan bill,\u201d Warren\u2019s missive reads.\nThe student loan battle will not come remotely close to that level of impact.\nAnd student loans will figure into that.\nBecause he didn\u2019t want to close the tax loopholes for millionaires and billionaires to pay for the bill.\u201d\u201cHelp hold Mitch McConnell accountable for leading the charge against America\u2019s struggling students."}
