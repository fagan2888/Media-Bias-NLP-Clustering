( Lewis Geyer / Longmont Times-Call )\n\nHis five long-since grown kids once listened to him share bedtime stories about a boy with a magic knapsack, a boy who pulled inflatable boats, ladders, and the like out of it to overcome obstacles along his thousand-mile journey.\n\nBut given Otto W. Longhenry's 58-year career not as a writer, but as a pilot \u2014 for the U.S. Army Air Corps during the World War II era, United Airlines, oil and mining companies, and as a crop duster out of Platteville \u2014 the likelihood of him celebrating his first novel at 86 seems just as strewn with fairy dust.\n\nOr is it?\n\n\"I feel more relaxed now,\" the freshly minted Longmont author said after getting the first shipment of his book, \"Second Shadow\" (Outskirts Press), in August.\n\nPart of Longhenry's relief comes from working out feelings stirred by a Times-Call story that featured homeless veterans living under bridges in Longmont.\n\nThe novel allowed him to acknowledge his anger at the atrocities of war and explore the complexities of re-entering civilian life through Alvin Bane Charles, the main character, he said.\n\nThe 230-page book that retails for $13.95 is set in Longmont and opens with this Vietnam veteran living in a hidey hole underneath the old flour mill.\n\nThough Charles sustained an accidental head injury working at his family's greenhouse after completing his tour of duty, his unsettling role and reaction to skirmishes along the Ho Chi Minh trail fuel how deranged and alienated he feels in American society.\n\nLonghenry wrote this story to send a message between the lines, he said.\n\n\"Forgive yourself. Under stress, we don't all react the same. This is where the second shadow idea comes in,\" Longhenry continued, referring to Charles' out-of-character dark deeds in combat. \"... When we do transgressions, I can forgive you. You can forgive me. But the hardest person to forgive is yourself.\"\n\nOtto W. Longhenry had a 58-year career as a pilot for the U.S. Army Air Corps during the World War II era, United Airlines, oil and mining companies, and as a crop duster out of Platteville (Lewis Geyer / Longmont Times-Call)\n\nDespite that agenda, the copy is unstilted, according to Brandi Sanchez, the former home services director at Hover Community Senior Independent and Assisted Living where Longhenry lives with his wife, Karen.\n\n\"I'm only 12 chapters in, but this book is incredible,\" she wrote in an email.\n\nPart of the tension comes from Charles trying to do the right thing under the pressure of survival.\n\nEarly lessons he learned from his grandparents, both full-blooded Native Americans who adopted him, guide him throughout.\n\nFor instance, many times Charles \"hears\" his grandfather's voice advising him on how to listen to nature as he navigates the jungle and how to manage escalating conflicts without violence through shrewd calculation.\n\nLonghenry added that growing up in rural Wisconsin outside of Janesville he learned to hunt and to observe nature \u2014 a focus he admires in Native American culture.\n\nWhen he met a local Native American artist who goes by \"Coyote\" in the Longmont Walmart's hardware and paint department, he settled on that identity for his grandfather character.\n\nThe grandfather's wholesome values and level-headed wisdom grounds Charles in the midst of his angst and combat fatigue.\n\n\"Alvin (Charles) didn't want adventures. That was the furthest thing from his mind. But being in the war, I had to put him in different situations that caused him to evolve, to be more self-reliant and not dependent on other people for his survival,\" Longhenry said.\n\nPam Mellskog can be reached at p.mellskog@gmail.com or 303-746-0942.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles-top-stories/ci_26886716/longmont-world-war-ii-vet-era-celebrates-first", "modificationDate": "2014-11-08T22:49:23-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1106/20141106__09TCCLIFw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Pam Mellskog \n  For the Times-Call", "description": "His five long-since grown kids once listened to him share bedtime stories about a boy with a magic knapsack, a boy who pulled inflatable boats, ladders, and the like out of it to overcome obstacles along his thousand-mile journey.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:26886716:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-08T14:41:58-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles-top-stories/ci_26886716/longmont-world-war-ii-vet-era-celebrates-first", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1106/20141106__09TCCLIFw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "His five long-since grown kids once listened to him share bedtime stories about a boy with a magic knapsack, a boy who pulled inflatable boats, ladders, and the like out of it to overcome obstacles along his thousand-mile journey.", "title": "Longmont World War II  era vet celebrates his first novel at 86"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "His five long-since grown kids once listened to him share bedtime stories about a boy with a magic knapsack, a boy who pulled inflatable boats, ladders, and the like out of it to overcome obstacles along his thousand-mile journey.", "title": "Longmont World War II  era vet celebrates his first novel at 86", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/lifestyles-top-stories/ci_26886716/longmont-world-war-ii-vet-era-celebrates-first", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1106/20141106__09TCCLIFw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-08T14:41:58-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2024-11-06T18:18:43-0700", "sailthru.title": "Longmont World War II  era vet celebrates his first novel at 86", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Lifestyles: Top Stories", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Pam MellskogFor", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1106/20141106__09TCCLIFw~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-11-08T14:48:21-0700"}, "article_summary": "\"I feel more relaxed now,\" the freshly minted Longmont author said after getting the first shipment of his book, \"Second Shadow\" (Outskirts Press), in August.\nOtto Longhenry, 86, of Longmont, has written a book called \"Second Shadow.\"\nThis is where the second shadow idea comes in,\" Longhenry continued, referring to Charles' out-of-character dark deeds in combat.\nPart of Longhenry's relief comes from working out feelings stirred by a Times-Call story that featured homeless veterans living under bridges in Longmont.\nThe novel allowed Longhenry to acknowledge his anger at the atrocities of war and explore the complexities of re-entering civilian life through Alvin Bane Charles, the main character, he said."}
