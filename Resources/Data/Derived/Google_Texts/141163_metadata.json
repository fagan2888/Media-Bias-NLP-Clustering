Interested? You might want to decide quickly, and register here; more than half the 100 seats are already gone. Here\u2019s the official invitation text:\n\nYou may be the next Oliver Sacks. You may be a health care provider or caregiver who needs to share some hard-won wisdom with the public. Or who just needs some catharsis to fight burnout.\n\nWhatever your reasons for wanting to write, you\u2019re invited to the official launch of Narrating Medicine, Jan. 26, 7-9 p.m., at WBUR, 890 Commonwealth Ave. in Boston. Light refreshments will be served.\n\nHOUR 1: BRIEF TALKS\n\nCommonHealth co-hosts Carey Goldberg and Rachel Zimmerman introduce Narrating Medicine and explain how it will work. CommonHealth, which averages close to a million clicks a month, will provide editing and audience, including for possible on-air versions of some stories. Writers will share their stories and retain copyright.\n\nWe\u2019ll hear from local luminaries who have already ventured into this territory:\n\nDr. Annie Brewster\n\nDrs. Gene Beresin and Steve Schlozman\n\nDr. Elissa Ely\n\nDr. Elizabeth Gaufberg\n\nDr. Suzanne Koven\n\nDr. David Scales\n\nAnd we\u2019ll hear from a legal expert on the first question many writers have: What about HIPAA?\n\nHOUR 2: WORKSHOPS\n\nPitchfest: Got a story you think you might want to write up? Share a two-minute \u201cpitch\u201d and see what reaction you get.\n\nBookswap: Got good books on medicine and/or writing that you\u2019ve already read? Bring them in and swap them.\n\nBrainstorm: What next? WBUR will host quarterly meetings. Should we hold a \u201cMoth\u201d-like storytelling event? Should we think about a book-length collection?\n\nNetwork: Hobnob, find a writing partner or constructive critic. Sign up for the Facebook group or suggest another online meeting place.\n\nHope you can make it! We\u2019ll update this post if it sells out (except it can\u2019t \u201csell\u201d out because it\u2019s free.)
