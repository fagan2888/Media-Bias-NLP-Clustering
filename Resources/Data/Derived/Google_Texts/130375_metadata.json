Reuters\n\nRead the PDF\n\nHow angry are Americans at Washington? This issue of Political Report looks at levels of public anger over time and particularly going into the 2016 presidential election. With the Supreme Court deliberating controversial cases related to abortion, teachers\u2019 unions, and affirmative action, this issue also examines public opinion of the court and the cases at hand.\n\nHow angry are Americans?\n\nNot as angry as Trump: Donald Trump says he is \u201cvery, very angry.\u201d Bernie Sanders says he is angry, too. But as the 2016 primary season approaches, Americans\u2019 level of anger is similar to what it was going into the 2012 election: 24 percent say they are \u201cangry about the way the federal government works,\u201d compared to 26 percent in February 2012 (ABC/The Washington Post).\n\nThe Supreme Court and its docket\n\nPartisan views of the court: Following high-profile decisions on same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act in 2015, the partisan gap in approval of the court is larger than ever before: 58 percentage points in July 2015 and 41 points in September (Gallup). Gallup\u2019s trends show that shifts in partisans\u2019 approval of the Supreme Court correlate with perceptions of the court\u2019s ideology. In 2015, the percentage describing the court as \u201ctoo liberal\u201d reached a new high at 37 percent, at the same time that Democrats\u2019 approval also increased.\n\nFollowing high-profile decisions on same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act in 2015, the partisan gap in approval of the court is larger than ever before: 58 percentage points in July 2015 and 41 points in September (Gallup).

Abortion: On March 2, the Supreme Court will hear Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Cole, a Texas case related to that state\u2019s restrictions on performing abortions. In an Ipsos/Reuters online survey, between 26 and 36 percent answered \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d to each question bearing on the case, signaling that many people are not closely following the case or have not wrestled with the issues involved.\n\nOn March 2, the Supreme Court will hear Whole Woman\u2019s Health v.

Teachers\u2019 union dues: We have found hardly any survey questions from major pollsters relevant to the central issue of Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association, which the court heard in January. In a May 2015 CBS News/The New York Times poll, a majority (54 percent) said that workers should be able to opt out of union fees, even though they receive the benefits.\n\nWe have found hardly any survey questions from major pollsters relevant to the central issue of Friedrichs v.

Affirmative action: Very few pollsters ask regularly about affirmative action, the practice in question in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin. In 2015, 58 percent said they were in favor of affirmative action programs for minorities (Gallup). In 2013, when the Supreme Court sent Fisher back to the lower court, 64 percent said minorities should not \u201creceive preference in college admissions to make up for past inequalities\u201d (Public Religion Research Institute).\n\nAmerica\u2019s outlook\n\nMore optimistic about the future: For the first time since 2002, people are more positive about the country\u2019s future position than about its past. On a ladder with steps numbered from 0 to 10, with 10 being the best possible situation for the country, Americans on average say the United States stood at 5.2 five years ago, stands at 5 today, and will stand at 5.9 five years from now.\n\nTo view past issues of AEI\u2019s Political Report, visit our archive here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How angry are Americans at Washington?
