They are debris from comet Swift-Tuttle, and they slam into Earth\u2019s atmosphere at 140,000 mph, known for their fireballs.\n\nRELATED: Perseid Meteor Shower: The One Not To Miss, August 11-13\n\n\u2018Fireball Champions,\u2019 Earth Grazers: Perseid Meteors Set Sky Ablaze\n\n\u201cThe radiant sits low in the northeast sky at evening and climbs upward throughout the night,\u201d Earthsky.org says. \u201cThe higher that the radiant is in your sky, the more Perseid meteors that you\u2019re likely to see.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch: The most brilliant moon of 2014, the middle of three successive supermoons this summer, will be arriving almost simultaneously.\n\nRELATED: Video: July Heralds Supermoon Summer, With First of Three Giant Full Moons\n\n\u201cOn August 10, 2014, just as the Perseids are set to peak, the Moon will become full,\u201d said NASA. \u201cMoreover, it will become full just as it reaches the place in its orbit (perigee) that is closest to Earth. The perigee full Moon of August 10th\u2014also known as a supermoon\u2014will be as much as 14 percent closer and 30 percent brighter than other full moons of the year.\u201d\n\nThe moon will be a mere 221,675 miles away, according to Earthsky.org. At is farthest it is 252,088 miles away, Space.com says, with an average distance of about 238,855 miles. Exact full moon will occur on August 10 at 2:09 p.m. EDT, 1:09 p.m. CDT, 12:09 p.m. MDT and 11:09 a.m. PDT, according to Earthsky.org, making the nights of the 10th and 11th the brightest showing. Moonrise is at 7:35 p.m. on the east coast.\n\nGood news for the moon and for romantics, and bad news for those who want to wish upon a star. Or is it?\n\n\"The Perseids are rich in fireballs as bright as Jupiter or Venus,\u201d said Bill Cooke of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office in a statement. \u201cThese will be visible in spite of the glare.\"\n\n\u201cA warm summer night, a moonlit landscape, and an occasional fireball cutting past a supermoon: that's an ensemble with a special beauty all its own,\u201d NASA noted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sky watchers will be treated to a dual show this weekend, though the two spectacular events will be in competition.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/09/video-perseid-meteors-battle-years-biggest-supermoon-sky-smackdown-156321", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/full_moon-shooting_star-thinkstock_image_185792562.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Video: Perseid Meteors Battle Year\u2019s Biggest Supermoon in Sky Smackdown"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-09T10:30-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/09/video-perseid-meteors-battle-years-biggest-supermoon-sky-smackdown-156321", "dc": {"title": "Video: Perseid Meteors Battle Year\u2019s Biggest Supermoon in Sky Smackdown"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Video: Perseid Meteors Battle Year\u2019s Biggest Supermoon in Sky Smackdown"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c7e\"", "article_summary": "The Perseid meteors can rain a good 100 or more meteors per hour into our field of vision, appearing to emanate from the constellation Perseus.\nIt will be an epic battle as the Perseid meteor shower\u2014the biggest, brightest and most fireball-infused of the year\u2014dukes it out with 2014\u2019s most massive supermoon.\nRELATED: Perseid Meteor Shower: The One Not To Miss, August 11-13\u2018Fireball Champions,\u2019 Earth Grazers: Perseid Meteors Set Sky Ablaze\u201cThe radiant sits low in the northeast sky at evening and climbs upward throughout the night,\u201d Earthsky.org says.\nSky watchers will be treated to a dual show this weekend, though the two spectacular events will be in competition.\nGood news for the moon and for romantics, and bad news for those who want to wish upon a star."}
