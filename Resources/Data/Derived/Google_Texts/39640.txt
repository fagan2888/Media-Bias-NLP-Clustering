JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A former Mississippi minister convicted of secretly videotaping women taking showers at his home is asking the state Supreme Court to dismiss the conviction.

The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the appeal by Samuel Allen Nuckolls on Monday in Jackson.

Nuckolls, now 36, was convicted in 2012 and is serving a 10-year sentence. He was ordered to pay more than $80,000 in fines and restitution to victims.

Attorneys for Nuckolls argue in briefs he was charged in 2011 for instances between 2007 and 2009. They argue the two-year statute of limitations had expired. However, prosecutors say the clock didn’t start ticking until Nuckolls transferred the videos to a computer in 2011.
