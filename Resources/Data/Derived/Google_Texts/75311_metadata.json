That includes Comeau\u2019s short-handed goal in Saturday\u2019s 5-1 victory over visiting Edmonton, when Soderberg\u2019s clearing pass sprung Comeau on a breakaway.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of confidence in them,\u201d Roy said Sunday of the Soderberg line. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to put them out in our zone for a faceoff. I\u2019m not afraid to put them against top lines. They\u2019ve been playing really well for us, and actually made the difference in some games.\u201d\n\nSoderberg was acquired from Boston last summer to serve as Colorado\u2019s third-line center \u2014 Duchene and MacKinnon were pegged as the top two centers at the time \u2014 and Comeau was signed as a free agent from Pittsburgh to play right wing anywhere from the first line to the fourth. After parallel slow starts, the two newcomers have found their niche.\n\nMartinsen is the bigger surprise. The 6-foot-3, 220-pound Norwegian has flourished as a top-six grinder, a relentless forechecker and net hound with size.\n\n\u201cWhat I really like about him is his physicality,\u201d Roy said of \u201cMarty,\u201d who is playing in his first year in North America after signing as an undrafted free agent. \u201cHe brings an element that we don\u2019t have and a lot of teams are looking for.\u201d\n\nAll four lines scored Saturday against the Oilers, including a power-play goal created from MacKinnon\u2019s line. What has developed into the third line (based on minutes played) gave Colorado a 4-1 lead, with Jarome Iginla scoring off a pass from linemate Alex Tanguay. John Mitchell centers Iginla and Tanguay.\n\nThe Mikhail Grigorenko-centered fourth line received a goal from right wing Jack Skille to make it 5-1 against Edmonton, with left winger Cody McLeod getting the assist.\n\nColorado has outscored its opponents 16-5 during the five-game winning streak.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers\n\nTORONTO AT COLORADO 7 p.m. Monday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Michael Grabner:\n\nThe first-year Maple Leafs forward had two goals and four points in Toronto\u2019s 5-0 victory at Los Angeles on Saturday, doubling his offensive production for the season. The Austrian also had a goal in his previous game, a 5-4 loss at San Jose. Grabner, 28, was a 2006 first-round draft pick of the Vancouver Canucks. He scored 34 goals for the New York Islanders in 2010-11 and is sitting on 99 for his up-and-down career.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nMaple Leafs:\n\nThey are on a five-game unbeaten streak (3-0-2) and defeated two of the Western Conference\u2019s top teams, St. Louis and Los Angeles, by a combined 9-1. They played into overtime and beyond against New Jersey, Tampa Bay and San Jose. \u2026 The Maple Leafs pounded Colorado 5-1 on Nov. 17 in Toronto, with former University of Denver standout Tyler Bozak and former Avalanche forward P.A. Parenteau combining for three goals and five points. Parenteau scored two goals. \u2026 Goalie Jonathan Bernier got the shutout win at Los Angeles, improving to 1-8-3 this season.\n\nAvalanche:\n\nThe Avs are a league-best 8-2 this month and on their first five-game winning streak since March 25-April 5, 2014. \u2026 Semyon Varlamov will start in goal Monday. He\u2019s looking for his seventh consecutive win, which would be a career high. Varlamov has won six in a row four times. \u2026 Winger Jarome Iginla snapped a nine-game goal-less drought Saturday with his 598th goal. He\u2019s looking to become the 19th NHLer to reach 600. \u2026 Winger Blake Comeau has two shorthanded goals, the most for an Avalanche player since Gabe Landeskog had three in 2012-13.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Avalanche\u2019s lineups shine in winning streak", "title": "Colorado Avalanche\u2019s lineups shine in winning streak", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/20/colorado-avalanches-lineups-shine-in-winning-streak/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151220__BN20151221_Z00_BNSP21HKNAVSp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151220__BN20151221_Z00_BNSP21HKNAVSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-20T19:24:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T00:07:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Avalanche:The Avs are a league-best 8-2 this month and on their first five-game winning streak since March 25-April 5, 2014.\nExcellent goaltending and offensive contributions from all four lines have defined the Avalanche\u2019s five-game winning streak \u2014 the team\u2019s longest since 2013-14, coach Patrick Roy\u2019s rookie season.\nColorado has outscored its opponents 16-5 during the five-game winning streak.\n\u2026 Winger Blake Comeau has two shorthanded goals, the most for an Avalanche player since Gabe Landeskog had three in 2012-13.\nHe scored 34 goals for the New York Islanders in 2010-11 and is sitting on 99 for his up-and-down career."}
