A sobering statistic for a society as technologically advanced as ours. That\u2019s over 200,000 people a year.\n\nThe World Health Organization ranks our health care system as #1 in costliness; but only 31st in quality; 40th in life expectancy and 169th in infant mortality. We pay more for drugs, made here in the United States, than they do in most other countries because of protectionist policies to protect drug company profits.\n\nWith the current political cry of \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d ringing in our ears, health care is a good place to start. Hillary made a valiant try in the Clinton era, and President Obama went way further and enacted the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, as happens with so many good plans, implementation suffered inattention, resulting in a system with a lot of faults.\n\nEvery Republican presidential contender has echoed the cry \u201cRepeal Obamacare\u201d\u2014none has proposed an alternative beyond returning to the status quo, which has proven to be inadequate. Our founding fathers recognized the rights of the people to include life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; and recognized the role of government to ensure these rights. Certainly none is possible without good health.\n\nThe idea that a \u201cjourney of a thousand miles begins with a single step\u201d certainly applies here. Obamacare is a first step, and provides a basis for iterative improvement to achieve a system that is #1. The fact that there are 30 systems out there that are judged superior to ours should provide ample practical experience on which to draw; and the Fed provides the example of an extra-political control agency on which to model a health care agency.\n\nMay all the (remaining) presidential candidates pledge to make our health care system great again.\n\nJohn Sweeney\n\nCobbs Creek, Va.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "gloucester,mathews,va,virginia,news,newspaper,newspapers,sports,business,real estate", "description": "The Gloucester-Mathews Gazette-Journal is a weekly print newspaper and online news source serving Virginia's Middle Peninsula.", "copyright": "Copyright Tidewater Newspapers, Inc., 2010-2012"}, "article_summary": "The World Health Organization ranks our health care system as #1 in costliness; but only 31st in quality; 40th in life expectancy and 169th in infant mortality.\nMay all the (remaining) presidential candidates pledge to make our health care system great again.\nWith the current political cry of \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d ringing in our ears, health care is a good place to start.\nCertainly none is possible without good health.\nObamacare is a first step, and provides a basis for iterative improvement to achieve a system that is #1."}
