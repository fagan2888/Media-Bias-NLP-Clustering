After the Presbyterian Church voted on Friday to divest from three U.S. companies that do business in Israel, the moderator of the Presbyterian church’s 2014 General Assembly, Heath Rada, was grilled by two CNN anchors over the anti-Semitic overtones of the vote.

“You use phrases like ‘ethnic cleansing’ and ‘apartheid,'” said one anchor. “It seems as if the rhetoric at least is not something that speaks to, as you say, your love for your Jewish brothers and sisters.”
