We\u2019ll use the funding from an oil company to make a film that promotes green energy!'\u201d Tickel said defensively, reminding potential crowdfunders that it was really all American money anyway. \u201cWe figured \u2013 What better use of our money than to make a film to encourage changing that whole screwed up system?\u201d\n\nTickel cited O\u2019Keefe\u2019s sting as proof that the pro-fracking movement would stop at nothing to stop them from funding their film.\n\n\u201cApparently, its such a threat \u2013 that they felt the need to try and discredit us \u2013 to scare us \u2013 and to keep this movie from being made. It seems they think this movie \u2013 and the successful movement it aims to document \u2013 might be the most dangerous thing the fracking industry has ever seen. We see that as a vote of confidence that we should make this film,\u201d Tickell wrote. \u201cSo here\u2019s our request \u2013 if you care about the environment, if you want safe drinking water for your kids and if you want to join our mission \u2013 then help us fund this movie.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hollywood Environmentalists Defend Anti-Fracking Film After O'Keefe Sting", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hollywood Environmentalists Defend Anti-Fracking Film After O'Keefe Sting", "title": "Hollywood Environmentalists Defend Anti-Fracking Film After O'Keefe Sting - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/05/20/josh-tickell-AP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/05/21/hollywood-environmentalists-defend-intentions-in-james-o-keefe-sting/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hollywood Environmentalists Defend Anti-Fracking Film After O'Keefe Sting", "creator": "@charliespiering", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2014/05/20/josh-tickell-AP.jpg", "title": "Hollywood Environmentalists Defend Anti-Fracking Film After O'Keefe Sting - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Hollywood Reporter, James O'Keefe,Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "James O'Keefe", "published_time": "2014-05-21T07:51:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd471\"", "article_summary": "We see that as a vote of confidence that we should make this film,\u201d Tickell wrote.\nIn a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, Begely defended Tickell\u2019s actionsRebecca Tickell also defended their actions in the video.\nSince O\u2019Keefe released the video, the Tickells have launched a crowd funding campaign to help them make their anti-fracking film.\nIn a lengthy statement on his crowdfunding site, Tickell defended his intentions.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERA group of Hollywood environmentalists are defending their intentions to create an anti-fracking film funded by oil interests in the Middle East after unwittingly participating in a James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s latest sting."}
