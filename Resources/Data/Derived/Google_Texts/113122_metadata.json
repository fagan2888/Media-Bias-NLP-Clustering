Admission is free; donations to the Ron Cross Memorial Scholarship Fund will be accepted.\n\nThe idea for creating a community band first started in 1996 when Ron Cross, who had recently opened Cross Music, 623 Main St., asked a few musicians to play on a float in the annual Music and Blossom Festival Parade. Original members of the group included: Bill Finch, Conrad and Norma Miller, Lee Allison, Pat and Jean Callahan, Jeri Fry, Dennis Carroll and Dr. Eric Carlson.\n\n\"We sat on tandem trailers with woodwinds in front, drums in the middle and brass in the back, playing The Saint Louis Blues March,\" Dr. Carlson said.\n\nJan Cross, Linda Carlson and the three little Carlson boys decorated the float. The banner on the back of the float read \"Old Timers' Band.\"\n\n\"A couple of years later ,(Finch, Carlson, Carroll and I) started talking about finding a director to form a year-round band, and that's how the whole thing started,\" Con Miller said.\n\nThe Southern Colorado Community Band performed its first concert in 1997 under the direction of Todd Woods, who also taught at Ca\u00f1on City Middle School. Other past directors include Myron Derbaum and Les Hickerson.\n\nMike Nolan has directed the band since 2001. Nolan is originally from Golden. He graduated from UNC, Greeley, and taught music for 31 years, including 29 years in Florence, where he directed the middle school band, the high school band and high school choir, as well as the high school theater.\n\nNolan retired from teaching in 2011, but continues to direct the Community Band. He is popular with musicians, both for his conducting skills and for his playful approach. When asked what he likes most about directing the band, he said, \"Fun, Fun, and Fun.\" Nolan's wife, Stephanie, the director of bands at Ca\u00f1on City High School helps support SCCB.\n\nToday, the band has 55 members who live within a 50 mile radius of Ca\u00f1on City, including musicians from Westcliffe, Pueblo and Pueblo West, as well as Canon City.
