An Activist Explains.\n\nJudging from my email box in recent years \u2014 which often differs on this question with such sources of knowledge as my television or the New York Times \u2014 the conscience of our country lies somewhere near Syracuse, New York. Here\u2019s an email from an activist named Judy Bello, for example:\n\n\u201cBreaking news:\n\n\u201cMaryAnne Grady-Flores was convicted in DeWitt Town Court last night on 2nd Degree Contempt of an Order Of Protection . Grady-Flores, who did not intend to violate the Order despite its immorality and invalidity, was taking pictures of others at the base \u2013 the Ash Wednesday Witnesses \u2013 who engaged in nonviolent civil resistance blocking the front Gate to Hancock base for which they were subsequently acquitted.\u201dIn a heinous abuse of an instrument meant to protect the innocent from violence, Orders of Protection are being used to protect violent transgressions of international and moral law from citizen oversight. While trying to publicize and support a movement to ground the drones and end the wars which take countless innocent lives, Grady-Flores was arrested for noncompliance with an order that does not specify particulars outside of how you might attack another human, something she would never do. She understood the Order to mean that she was forbidden to join the protest.\u201dThe Guilty verdict was proffered by a jury 5 minutes after they had asked the judge for a legal definition of \u2018keep away\u2019, and he had replied that they \u2018are the sole triers of fact\u2019. \u201cMaryAnne Grady-Flores was convicted in DeWitt Town Court last night on 2nd Degree Contempt of an Order Of.

Evans who is the party protected by the OOP, Catholic Priests Father Bill Pickard and Tim Taugher, Catholic Workers Bill Frankel-Streit and Ellen Grady, sister. Grady-Flores also testified on her own behalf.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo, a woman dedicated to nonviolence was convicted of going near a military base, where a Colonel, not feeling safe enough with, you know, the military base, had a legal order of protection against her. Of course this is a legalistic gimmick aimed at denying people their rights to speech and assembly, as at least one court has already ruled. But it isn\u2019t working. These people are continuing to speak and assemble. And they\u2019re refusing to take plea bargains that would keep them out of prison.\n\nI emailed another activist, Jack Gilroy, to ask what\u2019s going on. Here\u2019s what he sent back in response to my questions:\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nWhat is your background as an activist?\n\nMy activism began in 1964 with the Tonkin Bay lies. Later in that decade I took on the job as UpState NY Director of Committee of Responsibility, a group organized by Quaker MD\u2019s who were treating Vietnamese war injured children. After Nixon blocked our confirmed hospital beds and plastic surgeons in upstate NY, my family and I emigrated to Australia. While there teaching high school I had my students help wake up Aussies to French Nuclear testing off the coast of Australia. Other groups (Greenpeace etc) were involved by the sight of fourth form (10th grade) Aussie kids on top of the ABC (Australian Broadcasting System) at the French Consulate in Sydney led to other actions around the country to press the French.\n\nBack in the USA I had my senior high students watch as I climbed a fence into the largest store house of nuclear weapons in the USA. I was in a Santa Clause suit and a bag with candy and hand bills urging federal workers to find a real job\u2026.a life giving job.\n\nEnvironment was major with my students and they commandeered the four corners of the original IBM setting in Endicott NY demanding that IBM pay per pound of hydroflorocarbons emitted each year\u2026IBM the greatest polluter of the Ozone according to the EPA. Locals, with IBM the backbone of the job force, had no idea that their wonder company was doing wrong \u2014 until students contacted media and the story was blasted. Kids can make a difference. (Two years later, President Bush met with IBM officials in the Rose Garden to award them for their winning reduction of ozone pollutants. Students by then were in college or elsewhere and of course, not mentioned.) My main claim to fame is my thousands of students who understood I didn\u2019t buy the lies fed to them by the text books and media bullshit. I hope they are questioning and acting. But being a sheep has its advantages even for the committed.\n\nSo, my activism has been education. Our play, The Bench, a story about apartheid, made it to many schools around the Southern Tier of NY while Mandela was still incarcerated at Robins Island. Today, my play, The Predator, (you helped clean up a few items in it) has been done around the nation in small group settings such as the Pittsburgh Foreign Affairs Council etc. I believe education is the key \u2014 slow, but it works if persistence is one\u2019s forte.\n\nI told you a bit about my activism to close the US Army School of the Americas and my southern jail, federal diesel therapy and various federal prisons for a six month \u2018holiday\u2019. It did close but opened up weeks later with a new name. C\u2019est la vie. C\u2019est la guerre.\n\nWhy do you believe protesting is a strategic tool?\n\n\n\nIt has worked historically. Need I repeat what most people of historical awareness know as fact\u2026.in the past 100 years\u2026.Gandhi, King, Chavez, Walesa, Mandela, Romero, Berrigans, etc.\n\nSilence is the enemy of justice and we have great silence today. Silence is based in fear but is comfortable and safe. Sheepherders are our guides today rather than national leadership. Hiding in the middle of the flock is safe. Few speak out about our murderous ways.\n\nWhat has been accomplished?\n\nIt has been noted that drone action has been cut back in Afghanistan over the past year (as well as in Pakistan, but Hancock targets are in Afghanistan). Have we made a difference? Don\u2019t know, but we\u2019re trying.\n\nSo many eloquent statements have been made in so many trials at DeWitt, the Hancock Killer Drone court room. We hope that at least some local people and base personnel have to have had their consciences pricked. Since our actions, media has perked up info on drones \u2014 we may be part of that nationwide drone talk, especially killer drones, not cutesy drone ideas like delivering packages to one\u2019s door. Most people were ignorant several years ago and most people are still ignorant. But there is a swell of information and we think our actions have contributed to that.\n\nMy good friend, Ed Kinane, a long time justice activist from Syracuse, has much more experience in dealing with the media on the drone issue. Ed says that he takes from activist Dorothy Day who said: \u201cBeing faithful is more important than being effective.\u201d My own take is that Ed and the many that have put themselves on the line have been effective\u2026even if only to their own conscience.\n\nHow have the approaches of the police and the courts changed?\n\n\n\nPolice are doing their job. I once witnessed Federal Marshalls at the Pentagon (back in pre 2001 days) hosing down old ladies who were doing a \u2018die in\u2019 to protest Pentagon support for a school of assassination at Ft Benning. Elizabeth McAllister (widow of Phil Berrigan) was standing next to me and she asked one of the Marshalls if he would do the same thing if it was gasoline. The Marshall turned to Liz and said: \u201cI\u2019d follow my orders, Lady\u201d.\n\nSo cops are doing what they are paid to do. They are not told to stop the killing going on inside of the base so they do what they are told and arrest those who say our government should not be breaking the law of country and God and natural law. But like the pilots who do the killing and the surrounding support people, it\u2019s the system that thrives on doing what they are told to do by the criminals at the top. We need to educate the police to have a conscience and see the real enemy . . . the killers, not those who protest.\n\nCourts are not much different. There is a sense of affinity between the Air Force personnel, smartly dressed, ramrod straight who stand or sit before judge and/or jury and make a fine presentation of patriotism . . . doing the job of heroes. It\u2019s a tough act to question. Judges and jurors have been taught to respect those who kill to keep us safe. The decisions made by the judges have been almost all in favor of the base and the killing Q9 drones and their crews. The one jury trial so far, just last week (May 17th.) rendered a decision in favor of the base. The case was a charge of a violation of an Order of Protection. An OPP is usually used to allow a spouse to keep away an abuser. Now, it is being creatively used at Hancock Air Base as an instrument to prevent First Amendment Rights to be practiced. Mary Anne Grady, a long time nonviolent peace activist, mother of four, every day hard working business woman was at a demo on Ash Wednesday at Hancock to do the media work of photos and video. She did not engage in the demonstration for she was ordered to not go on the base. She is shown in videos on the road in front of the base (cars and joggers going by right next to her) but Hancock Air Base now claims to have a lease on half of the public road that Mary Anne stood on and filmed. She faces a possible severe sentence on July 10th being found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by a Syracuse jury of six. (Mary Anne was told months ago that juries may not be any better than judges \u2014 tens of thousands stand and cheer at Syracuse Basketball games for the military and staff of the 174th Attach Wing at Hancock.)\n\nWhat is your current legal situation?\n\n\n\nMy legal status is a jury trial at DeWitt Court starting at 8:30 a.m. on July 14th. First day mostly picking of jurors and opening statements and second day direct and cross examination, judge advise to jury and decision of guilt or innocence. I could be sentenced to one year in the Jamesville Penitentiary for my nonviolent die to remember those we have killed in Afghanistan (and God and the NSA only know where else). I think there is a chance of winning this one. If so, it could set a precedent. There are many jury trials to follow mine. Schedules go into late 2015\u2026.all for the same action. One judge said: \u201cThis has got to stop\u201d. Former President of Veterans For Peace, Elliott Adams, agreed with the judge. Elliott said, \u201cYes, your honor, it has to stop, we need to stop the killing and you need to be part of that stop effort.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been to most trials and have to say that there is little concern of judges to do anything to stop the assassinations. They are doing their job and following the \u201claw\u201d. Now, we need to prove the so called law is illegal.\n\nWhat would you recommend that people do who share your concern?\n\nHere is what Ed Kinane had to say about recommending what to do. Ed walks the walk. Ed has lived in federal confinement for his peace and justice activism. Ed says:\n\nThat depends on whether they are far or near and where they are in life (in terms of dependents and responsibilities). Our campaign has a whole range of tactics they can join in or support: educate themselves; read some of the key drone books and reports; write letters to the editor\u2026to elected officials\u2026to base commanders; take part in our twice-monthly demos across the road from Hancock; attend the De Witt court when we defendants appear there; take part in annual conferences (usually in April); invite us to speak to their classes, community groups or congregations; contribute $$$ to our bail fund or to such anti-drone groups as codepink; work to pass local resolutions and ordinances restricting surveillance and weaponized drones over local or regional airspace; take part in fact-finding delegations to drone-plagued areas (Pakistan); risk arrest at Hancock, at other drone bases, or other relevant venues (federal buildings, drone research or production facilities, etc.); become a federal tax resister \u2014 i.e.stop paying federal income taxes (much of which goes to the Pentagon war machine).\n\nThis article was originally published on War Is A Crime.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Mint Press News editorial policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judging from my email box in recent years -- which often differs on this question with such sources of knowledge as my television or the New York Times --, Activism, Drones, warfare,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "David Swanson for WarIsACrime.org", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Judging from my email box in recent years -- which often differs on this question with such sources of knowledge as my television or the New York Times --, Activism, Drones, warfare,", "title": "Why Risk Prison To Protest Drone Murders?
