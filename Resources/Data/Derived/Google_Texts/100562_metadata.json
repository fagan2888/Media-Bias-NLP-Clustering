Which? urges 3.9 million households to check usage\n\nMake sure you check your electricity bill to see if you could save with a single electricity tariff\n\nThere are 3.9 million homes in the UK that use an Economy 7 electricity tariff, benefiting from cheaper off-peak energy at night. But Which? research has found that many households could save money by switching to a single electricity tariff.\n\nTo get the most out of Economy 7, you need to use as much of your electricity as possible during your \u2018low\u2019 night-time hours. From our own surveys, however, we found that 46% of you choose to use appliances regardless of whether it\u2019s during your cheaper off-peak hours or not.\n\nWe calculated that Economy 7 customers for five of the Big Six energy companies (the exception is British Gas) would need to use 28-32% of their electricity at night in order to pay less than single electricity customers. This figure rises to 46% for British Gas customers (although British Gas believes this figure should be 44%).\n\nMany households would find it difficult to use that much electricity at night. If you don't have a storage heater, you would probably need to run a tumble dryer plus dishwasher or washing machine every night to get close to using enough - which is noisy and a potential fire risk.\n\nWhatever tariff you're on, make sure you're saving as much money as possible by getting the best energy deal - visit our independent switching site Which? Switch.\n\nBritish Gas Economy 7 customers\n\nIf British Gas customers used only 30% of their electricity at night, they could be losing around \u00a381 a year by staying on Economy 7.\n\nBritish Gas said that it had proactively written to all its Economy 7 customers to tell them if they could save money by switching to a single rate tariff. Whether a customer should switch will also feature on their bills and statements, and customers can make this switch without having to change their meter.\n\nBritish Gas actually offers the cheapest standard single electricity tariff of all the Big Six. But what do its customers have to say about its customer service? We asked 8,500 energy customers about their suppliers so that we can reveal the best and worst energy companies.\n\nWhich? says\n\nWhich? executive director, Richard Lloyd, said: 'It's worrying that customers on Economy 7 tariffs, that are meant to help you save money, could be paying over the odds. If you're unsure whether you're on the right deal get in touch with your energy supplier straight away to check, or look into switching to another company.'\n\nIf you, or anyone you know, is on an Economy 7 tariff, take a look at your electricity bills. You can use them to work out how much energy you're using at night - if this is less than 28%, you could save money by switching to a single electricity tariff.\n\nOur research: we surveyed Which? members on Economy 7 tariffs to find out about their usage. All figures for online, direct debit tariffs calculated using prices as at 15 July 2014 for both Economy 7 and single electricity standard tariffs, including all discounts and VAT. Calculations based on consumption figures for a medium user on Economy 7 (4,600kWh).\n\nMore on this...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Which? reveals how much electricity you need to use at night to benefit from Economy 7, and when to switch tariff to save money on your electricity bills.", "sectionName": "News", "og": {"url": "http://www.which.co.uk/news/2014/08/are-you-overpaying-for-electricity-376545/", "image": "http://www.staticwhich.co.uk/media/images/in-content/energy-bill-concern-377260.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Which? reveals how much electricity you need to use at night to benefit from Economy 7, and when to switch tariff to save money on your electricity bills."}, "contentId": 376545, "robots": "NOODP", "categoryIds": "191894,266140,266142,", "omniturePageName": "home: news: 2014: August: are you overpaying for electricity?, 17 August 2014", "fb": {"pages": 141323599261898}, "timestamp": 160527002500, "keywords": "Economy 7, electricity, electricity bills, time of use tariff, single electricity tariff, standard tariff, economy 7 tariff", "omniturePageType": "news", "categoryId": 213176, "categories": "news,which?-home", "omnitureAccount": "whichdev"}, "article_summary": "urges 3.9 million households to check usageMake sure you check your electricity bill to see if you could save with a single electricity tariffThere are 3.9 million homes in the UK that use an Economy 7 electricity tariff, benefiting from cheaper off-peak energy at night.\nresearch has found that many households could save money by switching to a single electricity tariff.\nBritish Gas actually offers the cheapest standard single electricity tariff of all the Big Six.\nWe calculated that Economy 7 customers for five of the Big Six energy companies (the exception is British Gas) would need to use 28-32% of their electricity at night in order to pay less than single electricity customers.\nBritish Gas Economy 7 customersIf British Gas customers used only 30% of their electricity at night, they could be losing around \u00a381 a year by staying on Economy 7."}
