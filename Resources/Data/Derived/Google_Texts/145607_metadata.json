(AP Photo/Paul Sancya, File)\n\nBy Phil Galewitz, Kaiser Health News\n\nBarred from restaurants, banned on airplanes and unwelcome in workplaces across America, smokers have become accustomed to hiding their habits. So it\u2019s no surprise many may now also be denying their habit when they buy health coverage from the federal health law\u2019s insurance exchanges.\n\nInsurers \u2014 who can charge higher rates in most states to admitted smokers \u2014 are steamed.\n\nThey say the cheating that smokers do to escape tobacco surcharges on their monthly premiums means higher rates for everyone else.\n\nSigns of smokers\u2019 deceit:\n\n\u2014In Idaho, 17 percent of adults smoke regularly, a federal survey shows, but less than 3 percent who bought coverage this year on the state\u2019s insurance exchange paid the tobacco surcharge.\n\n\u2014In Kentucky, more than a quarter of adults smoke regularly, but just 11 percent paid the tobacco surcharge.\n\n\u2014In Minnesota, 18 percent of adults smoke, but less than 5 percent paid the tobacco surcharge.\n\nWide discrepancies like those exist in virtually all states that allow insurers to charge smokers extra on the Obamacare individual insurance market, federal data show.\n\nInsurers say they\u2019re disappointed but not surprised by the figures. They can\u2019t independently check who is a smoker because under the law they rely on the honor system.\n\n\u201cGiven how low these numbers are, it\u2019s hard to believe there is not some misrepresentation or lying going on,\u201d said Cameron Kaplan, assistant professor of health economics at the University of Tennessee. \u201cIt makes sense given the way the law was designed.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act allows insurers to impose surcharges retroactively if they catch someone lying, but it specifically forbids them from dropping coverage to anyone they catch lying about smoking status.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bothersome and a concern,\u201d said Josh Jordan, a spokesman for Blue Cross of Idaho. \u201cIt means nonsmokers will pay more because smokers generally have higher health care costs that were supposed to be partly offset through the surcharge. \u2026 A lack of people paying it means everyone else may pay more.\u201d\n\nAge, county of residence \u2014 and smoking \u2014 are the only factors that insurers can consider in setting rates since the health law prohibits tying premiums to health status. Only eight states, including California and New York, plus the District of Columbia prohibit insurers from charging a tobacco surcharge on the individual market.\n\nIn the 37 states that use the federal insurance exchange, HealthCare.gov, the tobacco surcharge was paid by about 7 percent of 5.1 million consumers who enrolled, according to federal data.\n\nThe health law defines smoking as \u201cusing any tobacco product on average four or more times per week in the past six months.\u201d\n\nAbout 17 percent of U.S. adults smoke cigarettes, which is down from 21 percent a decade ago, other federal data show. Smoking rates are believed to be considerably higher among lower-income Americans and the uninsured \u2014 including those most likely buying coverage on the exchanges, experts say.\n\nIt\u2019s not only Obamacare that\u2019s asking smokers to pay more for health coverage.\n\nLarge employers increasingly do it, too. About 40 percent of employers with more than 1,000 workers had a tobacco surcharge last year, nearly twice the level a decade ago, according to benefits consulting firm Willis Towers Watson. Enforcement typically relies on the honor system, said Jeff Levin-Scherz, national leader at the company, although some companies use blood or saliva tests to identify smokers.\n\nThe main reason for the surcharge is not to penalize smokers but to identify those who could benefit from smoking cessation programs, he said.\n\nClare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry\u2019s trade group, said it\u2019s clear not all smokers are paying the surcharge, but it is needed to help cover smokers\u2019 high health risks. The health law allows states to charge as much as 50 percent more to smokers than nonsmokers, but a handful of states have lower limits, including Kentucky and Colorado.\n\nA study by researchers at University of Tennessee, published in Health Affairs in 2014, found the median insurer surcharge was 10 percent in 2014. Insurers don\u2019t have to impose a surcharge where states allow one, but most do. In Idaho and Kentucky, all the insurers on the state exchanges have it. In Minnesota, about 60 percent of plans have it.\n\nThe low rate of admission to tobacco use hampers insurers in setting adequate premiums for everyone, said Scott Streator, a senior vice president with CareSource, an Obamacare health plan with 120,000 members in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia.\n\nHe wants the Obama administration to consider changes to better validate whether smokers are fessing up on health care applications. Yet, he doesn\u2019t want to make validation so onerous as to deter sign-ups.\n\nThat might only discourage smokers from getting health insurance. Plus, surcharges\u2019 influence as a deterrent to smoking is unsubstantiated.\n\n\u201cPunitive measures like tobacco surcharges have not been proven effective in encouraging smokers to quit and reducing tobacco use,\u201d the American Lung Association asserts.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n(Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a national health policy news service.
