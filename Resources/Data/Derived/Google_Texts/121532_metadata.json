It\u2019s grim finding raises new questions over whether the ANF will actually be able to defend the country on its own. It also calls into question whether the tens of billions used to train and retain these now dwindling troops could have been better spent.\n\nAccording to the report, the force shrunk by 11 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 to 169,000, that figure bumped up a bit at the end of the year to about 173,000\u2014still making it the smallest since 2011.\n\nStories on the ground seem to match the auditors\u2019 dreary findings. A report last fall from Reuters described Afghan police forces that were ill equipped to fight the Taliban on their own, and worried what would happen when the NATO troops disappeared.\n\n\"Sometimes up to 200 Taliban attack our checkpoints and if there are no army reinforcements, we lose the fight,\" Afghan Police Chief Ahmadullah Anwari told Reuters months before the NATO-led coalition ceased its combat mission.\n\nThe latest figures became unclassified after auditors blew the whistle on the Pentagon for suspiciously classifying all documents and information relating to the Afghan Security Forces late last year.\n\nRelated: U.S. Agencies Track Millions Spent Afghan Women\u2019s Programs\n\nSIGAR\u2019s report said that the Pentagon\u2019s records, which were previously classified, had an \u201caccounting error\u201d and didn\u2019t include the correct number of Afghan troops for all of 2014. Officials said they were accidentally counting civilians twice. They apparently caught the error last fall but never bothered to mention it to the auditors. The newly unclassified data had correct information, though auditors suspect the number of Afghan police forces might also contain errors.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. military\u2019s inconsistent reporting on ANSF strength numbers indicates long-standing and ongoing problems with accountability and personnel tracking,\u201d the report said. \u201cGiven that accurate reporting on ANSF strength is an important factor in judging Afghanistan\u2019s ability to maintain security and in determining the pace of U.S. troop withdrawals from the country, and that the United States is paying to train, equip, and sustain the Afghan troops based on these numbers, these inconsistencies are deeply troubling.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the report said that $25 million for women in the Afghan National Forces had not been used.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Since 2002, the United States has poured at least $65 billion into building up, traini", "title": "$65 Billion Later, U.S. Hands the Reins to a Weak Afghan Army", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/04/65-Billion-Later-US-Hands-Reins-Weak-Afghan-Army", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02202013_Afghanistan_National_Army_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/04/65-Billion-Later-US-Hands-Reins-Weak-Afghan-Army", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02202013_Afghanistan_National_Army_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Since 2002, the United States has poured at least $65 billion into building up, traini", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7dd\"", "article_summary": "However, more than a decade later, that plan, along with the Afghan National Security Forces, seems to be slowly falling apart.\nSince 2002, the United States has poured at least $65 billion into building up, training and equipping Afghan National Security Forces so they could stand up against insurgents once U.S. soldiers and their allies returned home.\nThe newly unclassified data had correct information, though auditors suspect the number of Afghan police forces might also contain errors.\nAgencies Track Millions Spent Afghan Women\u2019s ProgramsSIGAR\u2019s report said that the Pentagon\u2019s records, which were previously classified, had an \u201caccounting error\u201d and didn\u2019t include the correct number of Afghan troops for all of 2014.\nThe latest figures became unclassified after auditors blew the whistle on the Pentagon for suspiciously classifying all documents and information relating to the Afghan Security Forces late last year."}
