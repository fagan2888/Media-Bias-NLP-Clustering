Campaigners now say up to a million borrowers face the same situation from lenders across the industry\n\nFarewell: A report claimed today that Wonga's founder Errol Damelin sold a one per cent stake in his firm back to Wonga around the time he left its day-to-day running in November, valued at an estimated \u00a34million\n\nThe 'broad brush' claim was made by Damon Gibbons of the Centre for Responsible Credit, which is campaigning for the Financial Conduct Authority to come to similar agreements with other firms.\n\nHe told the Sunday Mirror the regulator could look back at cases up to six years old, which meant 'at least a fifth of those who have taken out a payday loan in the last years years would be affected' if the problems at Wonga were repeated.\n\nLabour MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned for several years against payday lenders, told MailOnline: 'Wonga is not the bad apple - the industry is a rotten barrel.\n\n'There have been 5million people borrowing from payday lenders and it was about a fifth of Wonga customers that were affected.\n\n'I would be gobsmacked if the Financial Conduct Authority weren't applying the same lessons that they've already done to other lenders.\n\nCampaigning MP Stella Creasy said: 'Wonga is not the bad apple - the industry is a rotten barrel'\n\n'There could be many more people who have been lent money without the companies knowing or caring they they could pay it back.'\n\nThe claims today came amid a report that Wonga's founder, Errol Damelin, took a \u00a34million 'farewell' when he left the day-to-day running of the firm in November last year.\n\nSources told The Sunday Times the South African businessman, who founded Wonga in 2006 before it shot to prominence with heavy marketing campaigns, sold a one per cent stake in Wonga back to the firm.\n\nIndustry analysts told the newspaper the firm would have been worth about \u00a3400million at the time, making Mr Damelin's stake worth around \u00a34million.\n\nIt is believed he was just one of a number of staff members who sold shares back to the firm.\n\nDays before this week's events it emerged Wonga's profits had nosedived by 53 per cent as it counted the cost of the 'fake letters' scandal, which was revealed in June.\n\nThe firm had sent letters to thousands of its customers from non-existent law firms threatening them with legal action if they did not pay their loans back.\n\nA Wonga spokesman declined to comment on Mr Damelin's shares to MailOnline.\n\nWhen the \u00a3220million payout to customers was confirmed this week, Wonga's new chairman Andy Haste said: 'When I joined Wonga I was made aware of concerns the FCA had already expressed around affordable lending, concerns which I shared.\n\n'I committed to ensuring our lending is conducted in a responsible and transparent manner, delivering the best outcomes for our customers.\n\n'I also said this would lead to a tightening of Wonga\u2019s lending criteria and we will now be accepting far fewer applications from new and existing customers.'\n\nStraight talking: A TV advert for Wonga. Campaigners say problems with the industry are not limited to the firm\n\nGillian Guy, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice, agreed with other campaigners - saying the issue went beyond Wonga.\n\n'A lack of checks by lenders is setting a debt trap for borrowers,' she said. 'It is a widespread problem within the industry.\n\n'Citizens Advice has found that in half of payday loans cases reported to us, lenders didn\u2019t ask about people\u2019s personal finances.\n\n'Checking whether someone can actually afford to repay a loan should be at the heart of any credit process.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Payday,loans,written,1million,people,Wonga,founder,walked,4million,payoff,left", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2781153/Payday-loans-written-1million-people-Wonga-founder-walked-4million-payoff-left.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Campaigners say Wonga, which is refunding \u00a3220m to 330,000 borrowers, is only the tip of the iceberg - amid reports its founder Errol Damelin (pictured) made \u00a34m when he left as chief executive.", "title": "Payday loans could be written off for 1million people", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2781153/Payday-loans-written-1million-people-Wonga-founder-walked-4million-payoff-left.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/05/1412513330491_wps_15_Errol_Damelin_CEO_Co_Foun.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2781153/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2781153/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2781153, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Payday,loans,written,1million,people,Wonga,founder,walked,4million,payoff,left", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-10-05T12:56:33.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Dan+Bloom+for+MailOnline", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-10-05T17:03:04.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Payday loans written 1million people Wonga founder walked 4million payoff left"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Campaigners say Wonga, which is refunding \u00a3220m to 330,000 borrowers, is only the tip of the iceberg - amid reports its founder Errol Damelin (pictured) made \u00a34m when he left as chief executive.", "title": "Payday loans could be written off for 1million people", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2781153/Payday-loans-written-1million-people-Wonga-founder-walked-4million-payoff-left.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/05/1412513330491_wps_15_Errol_Damelin_CEO_Co_Foun.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2014/07/1418450360_3690013251001_loan-1.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Campaigners say Wonga, which is refunding \u00a3220m to 330,000 borrowers, is only the tip of the iceberg - amid reports its founder Errol Damelin (pictured) made \u00a34m when he left as chief executive."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ecd\"", "article_summary": "'There have been 5million people borrowing from payday lenders and it was about a fifth of Wonga customers that were affected.\n'Citizens Advice has found that in half of payday loans cases reported to us, lenders didn\u2019t ask about people\u2019s personal finances.\nLabour MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned for several years against payday lenders, told MailOnline: 'Wonga is not the bad apple - the industry is a rotten barrel.\nWonga was ordered this week to refund \u00a3220million in debts to 330,000 customers who took out loans they could not afford to repay.\nScroll down for videoPayout: Wonga was ordered this week to repay \u00a3220million in debts to customers who could not afford them."}
