Eight-year-old Wesley Somers is a typical boy, but he has a lot more on his mind than most kids his age. Wesley knows time with his mom is running out.



“I don't like talking about it that much,” said Wesley Somers.

45-year-old Tricia Somers has liver cancer and it's spreading.

“He's the only thing I got and have to leave him. So it's really hard. I feel really bad that I'm doing that to him,” said Tricia Somers.

The single mom worries about what's going to happen to Wesley when she dies. She found the answer while she was a patient at a Harrisburg, Pennsylvania hospital.

“She came in and I just felt this overwhelming feeling of comfort,” said Tricia Somers.

Nurse Tricia Seaman had taken care of Tricia Somers several times before – when she was in and out of the hospital. One night the nurse got the shock of her life.

“Frantically, I said to Tricia ‘if I die, can you take car of my son? Can you care for my son?'” said Tricia Somers.

“I think my jaw just dropped to the floor,” said Tricia Seaman.

Seaman took the request back to her husband and four kids. It turns out the family wanted to adopt a son anyway. They just didn't know it would happen like this.

“Sometimes God has a plan for our lives. Sometimes we think we know what that plan is, but we really don't,” said Tricia Seaman.

The Seamans said yes and invited Tricia and Wesley to move in with them.

“Getting to know him. He's being really strong in this. But now, he won't have to do it alone,” said daughter Emma Seaman.

“I didn't have anybody until now. Anybody except you mommy, until now,” said Wesley Somers.

Now there's a new family to take care of a little boy who is losing so much.
