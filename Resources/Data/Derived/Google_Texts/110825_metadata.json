They were wrong about trickle down economics \u2013 it\u2019s never worked and never will, as the ballooning wealth gap proves once again. They were wrong about Iraq (where are those WMD\u2019s, anyway?) and wrong about Vietnam before it. They\u2019re even wrong about evolution (in which only 43% of Republicans believe).\n\nBut no error, no misguided application of ideology, no deception is more damaging than the web of lies that conservatives have spun about climate change.\n\nAccording to a recent study by Yale University, only 32% of Americans believe that global warming is happening, and that human beings are responsible for it. This despite a complete \u2013 that\u2019s right, complete \u2013 consensus on that point on the part of scientists not working for the fossil fuel industry. As with evolution, there is a unanimous consensus among independent scientific experts, with uncertainties limited to size and scope.\n\nIndeed, the distance between informed and ignorant is widening. Only a year prior, the Pew Research Center found that 45% of Americans \u201cbelieved\u201d \u2013 why is this a belief? \u2013 that humans are causing climate change.\n\nWhy the gap? As described in exhaustive detail in Naomi Oreskes\u2019 and Eric Conway\u2019s Merchants of Doubt, Chris Mooney\u2019s The Republican War on Science, James Hoggan and Richard Littlemore\u2019s Climate Cover-Up, and a shelf full of books that only liberals read, billions of dollars have been spent by the fossil fuel industry, and fossil fuel industrialists like the Koch Brothers, to cast doubt on the reality of anthrogenic climate change.\n\nThere is no doubt. A recent study found that between 1998 and 2002, there were 928 peer-reviewed scientific articles describing how human activity has caused climate change. There were 0 denying it.\n\nMeanwhile, another study found that of the 141 books denying climate change \u2013 none of which were scientifically peer reviewed \u2013 130 of them were written by conservative think tanks funded by Big Oil, or by authors affiliated with them.\n\nIn other words, the \u201cdebate\u201d about climate change isn\u2019t among scientists. It\u2019s between scientists and industry lackeys who are paid to lie.\n\n\u201cLie\u201d may be too strong a word. How about \u201cdistort\u201d? Or \u201cselectively report\u201d? Or maybe just \u201csay stupid stuff\u201d?\n\nCase in point: the chilly weather this winter. By now, everyone who doesn\u2019t rely on Fox News for fair and balanced opinion knows about the \u201cpolar vortex.\u201d As shown in this computer model by WeatherBELL analytics, the cold air we\u2019re experiencing is because arctic air has been displaced from the Arctic. In New York, we\u2019re shivering. In Alaska, they\u2019re (relatively) burning up, with temperatures in the 50s and 60s.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the polar vortex got spinning in the first place because of climate change \u2013 more specifically, extremely unusual warming in the stratosphere in polar regions, likely due to ice melt, which is, of course, a result of global warming.\n\nIn other words, not only does this cold winter not disprove climate change; it proves it.\n\nOf course, the paid ignoramuses over at Fox News are having a field day with the icy roads in Atlanta and the blizzards in Tennessee. Ha Ha! Where\u2019s that Global Warming now?\n\nThat is an answerable question. Global Warming is \u201cin\u201d the hot air over Alaska, which has pushed cold air down to the Lower 48. That\u2019s why the weather is so weird. This may be climatology, but it sure isn\u2019t rocket science.\n\nMost American Jews vote Democratic, and political beliefs being what they are \u2013 which is to say, forms of community consensus rather than rationally deduced positions \u2013 most Jews understand the basic logic of climate change, although there has not, to my knowledge, been a survey establishing this.\n\nYet in our community\u2019s public discourse on the issue, we mistake the proper response.\n\nFrankly, it doesn\u2019t much matter if you recycle, or offset your carbon footprint, or switch to a hybrid car, if governments can\u2019t take meaningful actions to reduce or offset greenhouse gas emissions. If China doesn\u2019t play, we all lose. If power plants don\u2019t change, we all lose. If carbon sequestration doesn\u2019t happen, we all lose. And each of these steps (three among many that are needed) requires collective action.\n\nNo amount of personal virtue will prevent climate catastrophe. As long as the Republicans and other conservatives cling to the strategy of denial, even mockery, of climate change, we will get nowhere. There\u2019s no point in urging climate change believers to be ever more environmentally correct in their behavior if we don\u2019t vote out the politicians who obstruct the change we need.\n\nThe free market won\u2019t save the Earth either. Yes, it may upset some conservatives, libertarians and Tea Partiers that government-led action is necessary to solve this particular problem. But that only points to the flaws in their ideologies. This is just not a problem that the Invisible Hand will solve.\n\nIf, as Jews, we believe that destroying the Earth\u2019s climate is ethically or religiously wrong; and if we believe it to be the defining crisis of our time; then we must recognize that voting for climate change deniers is ethically or religiously wrong.\n\nThat partisan message is rarely proclaimed from the pulpits of American synagogues, where shalom bayit (getting along at \u201chome\u201d) is understandably a paramount virtue. But the reason it\u2019s a partisan message is because conservatives have made climate change, which is a scientific fact, into a partisan issue.\n\nThey are wrong to do so, even if they are motivated by millions of industry dollars. And until conservatives start actually conserving, it is wrong not to call them on this latest instance of willful blindness \u2013 like so many that have gone before.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.128x79": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.forward.com/images/128x79/w-niagaraclimatechange-020714-1423642558.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Jay Michaelson", "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives were wrong on slavery, women\u2019s suffrage, segregation and gay rights.
