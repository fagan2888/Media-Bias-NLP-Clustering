They put in hours upon hours of unpaid time and energy in a tireless effort to advance important issues to help people like you and me, including:\n\nSupporting family caregivers and the older loved ones who count on them to stay at home longer\n\nWorking to help Americans retire with confidence\n\nFighting to ensure you pay only what is reasonable and justified for your utility bill\n\nHelping hardworking Americans gain affordable access to health care by expanding Medicaid.\n\nLaurie from Hawaii \u2014 Family Caregiving Volunteer\n\nFrom advocating for caregivers at the state legislature to organizing a conference for nearly 500 people \u2014 Laurie is a super volunteer. She got involved with AARP back in 2009, just as she became a caregiver for her mother.\n\nSince then she has been fighting for other caregivers by working to help pass legislation, like the Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable (CARE) Act \u2014 a commonsense solution to help family caregivers from hospital to home. The CARE Act is currently being considered by the Hawaii state legislature.\n\nWhen asked why the CARE Act is important to her, Laurie shared:\n\n\u201cThe CARE Act, it affects people that I know personally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSherri from New Hampshire \u2014 Medicaid Expansion Volunteer\n\nAs cochair of AARP New Hampshire\u2019s all-volunteer Capitol City Strike Force, Sheri is at the center of fighting to help Granite Staters keep their access to affordable health care. The state granted this access in 2014, by expanding Medicaid, and the action had to be reauthorized this year. Sheri went to work at the state capitol to help protect tens of thousands of people who were at risk of losing the care they count on. And her hard work paid off. Earlier this year, Gov. Maggie Hassan signed a bill extending Medicaid expansion for another two years.\n\nSheri explained that her fight for this bill was incredibly personal. Her son, who passed away last month, was able to get the health care he needed because of Medicaid expansion in New Hampshire:\n\n\u201cBecause of Medicaid expansion, he was able to live much longer with his health condition. Medicaid expansion kept him alive.\u201d\n\nMarvin from Missouri \u2014 Utilities Volunteer\n\nMarvin has been volunteering with AARP for over a decade. Recently, he was instrumental in fighting against an unfair customer charge increase for electric customers in Independence, Mo.\n\nMany utility companies across the country have a \u201ccustomer charge,\u201d or mandatory monthly fee, that remains the same \u2014 no matter how much electricity you use. This means when a utility company raises its customer charge, your bill goes up before you even turn the lights on.\n\nMarvin\u2019s utility company, Independence Power and Light, was trying to increase the monthly customer charge from $4.14 to $14.50. But, thanks in part to his testimony in front of the city council, the increase was stopped. He said:\n\n\u201cI think utility increases become unfair to the public, especially seniors.\u201d\n\nMarilyn from Connecticut \u2014 Retirement Security Program and Family Caregiving Volunteer\n\nFighting to make sure Connecticut residents can retire with confidence and family caregivers have the support they need \u2014 Marilyn does it all.\n\nOver the last year, Marilyn has been an advocate for a Retirement Security Program \u2014 also called Work and Save \u2014 that would give workers a convenient way to save for the future at their job. A win-win-win that benefits workers, employers and the state, the program is being considered by the Connecticut legislature.\n\nMarilyn has also been working to make sure family caregivers have the support and resources they need. A big part of her volunteering has focused on outreach to the Hispanic community, which is especially important to her, because \u201cwe tend to care for our own families within our own homes, and let\u2019s face it, it gets very tiring sometimes.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s also been fighting for caregivers at the state capitol, working to pass legislation that would support them. Last year she helped get the CARE Act passed, and this year she is helping to make sure caregivers have workplace flexibility, because caring for a loved one shouldn\u2019t mean losing your pay. She said:\n\n\u201cI knew that AARP was very much involved with legislation that was taking place here in Connecticut. That\u2019s what really got me interested in volunteering with AARP.\u201d\n\nThank you to Laurie, Sherri, Marvin, Marilyn and ALL our amazing AARP volunteers who devote so much of their time and energy to help others.\n\nTo stay up to date on our AARP advocacy in the states, sign up for the AARP Advocates e-newsletter or visit your state Web page.\n\nElaine Ryan is the vice president of state advocacy and strategy integration (SASI) for AARP.
