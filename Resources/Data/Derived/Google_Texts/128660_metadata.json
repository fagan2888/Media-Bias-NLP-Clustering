Jackson County will open an office in Wanblee, on the part of Pine Ridge Indian Reservation it overlaps, and Dewey County will re-open the office it had in past elections in Eagle Butte, on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.\n\nAs a result, voters in those areas will be able to cast in-person absentee ballots during the last 11 days of South Dakota\u2019s 46-day window for doing so. The state\u2019s two other reservation satellite offices are in Pine Ridge village and in Mission, on the Rosebud reservation.\n\nDewey County had seemed poised not to open an office in 2014. \u201cIt required some pushing,\u201d said Cheyenne River tribal member and voting-rights advocate Julie Garreau, who described negotiating issues with the state and county, including election-worker training and access to the voter database. \u201cBut it worked out.\u201d\n\nImportantly, both offices will open by October 20, South Dakotans\u2019 last day to register for the 2014 election, said attorney Matthew Rappold, of Mission, South Dakota: \u201cThis is definitely on the radar of the get-out-the-vote folks.\u201d\n\nRappold\u2019s clients, including Ogala Nation Vice President Tom Poor Bear and additional Wanblee residents, had sued for their office under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The matter was settled through mediation before Magistrate Judge Veronica Duffy, who published a notice on October 15 saying that \u201cthe parties succeeding in resolving the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction.\u201d The agreement applies to this year\u2019s office.\n\nRELATED: Oglala VP: \u2018Our Civil Rights Are Being Violated\u2019\n\n\u201cThe rest of the suit, for a permanent injunction for a satellite office during future elections, is ongoing,\u201d said Rappold. \u201cWe will ensure the county meets its responsibility to provide the polling place.\u201d He was confident his clients would prevail. \u201cWe have a strong case, and they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe county\u2019s lawyer, Sara Frankenstein, of Rapid City, participated in the mediation; at press time, she had not responded to requests for a comment.\n\nThe increased voting access is a breakthrough for Wanblee residents. In sworn depositions, the plaintiffs described the cost and difficulty of the long trip to the county seat where they used to cast early ballots. They recounted hostility\u2014waiting at the courthouse or in restaurants as whites were served first, being cursed on the streets, being followed in stores, and more. \u201cKadoka feels like a different country to me,\u201d said plaintiff Cheryl Bettlyoun.\n\nIs voting by mail an option? Plaintiff Don Doyle was dubious, saying he did not believe mail-in ballots would necessarily be counted.\n\nJackson County election official Vicki Wilson, who has cited cost and election-safety issues as barriers to manning a Wanblee office, refused to comment on the settlement.\n\nRELATED: Supreme Court Decision Rolls Back Voting Rights for S.D. Indians\n\nA fifth South Dakota jurisdiction, Buffalo County, has declined to open an office in Fort Thompson, on the Crow Creek Sioux Reservation. Elections official Elaine Wulff said that costs for the polling place were reimbursable under the state\u2019s Help America Vote Act plan but would contribute to using up the county\u2019s HAVA allocation.\n\n\u201cThe Americans who need help voting are among the 1,400 mostly Native residents of Fort Thompson, not the 14 white people in county seat Gann Valley, who can walk across the street to vote,\u201d said Greg Lembrich, legal director of Native-led voting-rights group Four Directions.\n\nFour Directions, which has fought for Native voting access in several states, isn\u2019t giving up, said Lembrich: \u201cWe continue to pursue an office in Fort Thompson.\u201d\n\nSaid Julie Garreau of the new reservation satellite offices, \u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two more South Dakota counties have agreed to provide Indian-reservation polling places during the state\u2019s pre-election early-voting period.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/18/surprise-11th-hour-native-vote-agreements-157409", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/jackson_county_courthouse_-_stephanie_woodard1.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Surprise 11th-Hour Native-Vote Agreements"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-10-18T12:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "Surprise 11th-Hour Native-Vote Agreements"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/10/18/surprise-11th-hour-native-vote-agreements-157409", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "2014 Elections, Elections, Stephanie Woodard, Native American Voting Rights, Native American Voting, American Indian Voting, Native Voting, Early Voting, Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, Satellite Offices, Rosebud Indian Reservation, Julie Garreau, Matthew Rappold, Get-Out-The-Vote, Tom Poor Bear, Oglala Nation Vice President, Voting Rights Act, Veronica Duffy, Sara Frankenstein, Cheryl Bettlyoun, Don Doyle, Vicki Wilson, Crow Creek Sioux Reservation, Elaine Wulff, Help America Vote Act, Greg Lembrich, Four Directions", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Surprise 11th-Hour Native-Vote Agreements"}, "article_summary": "The state\u2019s two other reservation satellite offices are in Pine Ridge village and in Mission, on the Rosebud reservation.\nRELATED: Supreme Court Decision Rolls Back Voting Rights for S.D.\nJackson County election official Vicki Wilson, who has cited cost and election-safety issues as barriers to manning a Wanblee office, refused to comment on the settlement.\nRELATED: Oglala VP: \u2018Our Civil Rights Are Being Violated\u2019\u201cThe rest of the suit, for a permanent injunction for a satellite office during future elections, is ongoing,\u201d said Rappold.\nThis week, two more South Dakota counties have agreed to provide Indian-reservation polling places during the state\u2019s pre-election early-voting period."}
