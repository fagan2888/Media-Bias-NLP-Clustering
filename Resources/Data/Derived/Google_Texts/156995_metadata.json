Right now there are more important things to worry about.\u201d\n\nProtester Wellington Magalhaes, a resident of a favela climbing up Rio\u2019s hills, says he will be actively cheering for Brazil\u2019s rivals.\n\n\u201cA victory for the Brazil team would be a victory for the government. It would be a slap in the face of the people,\u201d Magalhaes said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see Brazil lose 10 to nothing. Just think of the repercussions of that.\u201d\n\nSuch antagonistic sentiments turned into confrontational demonstrations on Thursday, as thousands blocked the roads of Brazil\u2019s biggest city, Sao Paulo, burning tires and shouting slogans against the World Cup.\n\nThe angers against the tournament and team stem from a mix of grievances both over the World Cup and within Brazilian society generally.\n\nMany are enraged by the government spending some $11 billion on the tournament, while its schools and hospitals are in desperate need of repair.\n\nOthers are angered by the corporate nature of the games.\n\nBrazil\u2019s biggest stadium, the Maracana in Rio, has been effectively privatized, rented for 35 years to a consortium including one of Brazil\u2019s richest men.\n\nMeanwhile, police forcibly evicted a group of indigenous squatters near the ground to make room for development.\n\nSoccer\u2019s world governing body FIFA has also come under fire for its aggressive marketing demands. Brazil agreed to create zones around stadiums where only FIFA and its partners can sell goods.\n\n\u201cFootball is a passion and a love for people in the favelas. But how does this cup help the poor?\u201d Magalhaes asked. \u201cThe Brazilian government uses football as an opium to keep people happy. Well, we are tired of that.\u201d\n\nPerhaps his social commentary is not surprising. Even though millions have climbed out of poverty in recent years during successive left-leaning governments, Brazil still ranks among the world\u2019s most unequal countries. Many here doubt that souped-up stadiums for global soccer tourneys and the 2016 Olympics are a huge priority.\n\nHowever, those wishing doom on Brazil\u2019s team may be disappointed.\n\nAs home nation and with a talented generation of players, Brazil is the betting favorite to take the cup, with average odds of 3 to 1 \u2014 ahead of Argentina, Germany and reigning champ Spain.\n\nBut coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has already complained that protests could put players off, \u201cbig time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf [protests] are normal, without smashing things up, then that is democracy. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right time,\u201d Scholari said last month.\n\nIt is difficult to predict how big \u2014 or how aggressive \u2014 the demonstrations will be.\n\nDuring the confederations soccer tournament last year, hundreds of thousands marched against spending for the country\u2019s mega sporting events. At times, peaceful rallies have devolved into chaotic riots and brutal crackdowns.\n\nBut while demonstrators are organizing against the World Cup games in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, there is little sign of marches in the other 10 host cities.\n\nThe protesters also received some bad press coverage when a cameraman filming a rally in February was killed by a firecracker.\n\nStill, protesters understand that with the eyes of the world on Brazil, even small disturbances could make a lot of noise.\n\nA Sao Paulo member of a radical movement known as the Black Bloc said they aim to push through police barriers in the zones around the stadiums.\n\n\u201cThey are going to try to get into the exclusion zones by any way, and there are going to be clashes,\u201d said the Black Bloc affiliate, who would only identify himself by the alias A.M. because of the risk of arrest. \u201cThere is a clear objective. If they get into the zone, they have won.\u201d\n\nOutside of the protest movement, feelings toward the cup are more mixed.\n\nIn a favela in Sao Paulo, laborer Higo Carvalho said he was critical of the World Cup spending but would cheer on the Brazil team.\n\n\u201cDespite the bad things in Brazil, I am still a patriot,\u201d Carvalho said.\n\nGeneral enthusiasm for Brazil\u2019s squad appears to be more muted than in recent years \u2014 with fewer people wearing T-shirts or painting the roads with the team colors.\n\nHowever, some believe that once the party gets started, soccer mania will return.\n\n\u201cPeople here love to party and they love to be hosts,\u201d said Matias de Padua, owner of a sportswear shop in downtown Rio.\n\n\u201cOnce the games start, and people arrive from all over the world, and there is great football being played, people are going to put aside their problems. It is going to be a carnival. And Brazil is going to win the World Cup.\u201d\n\nThis article was written by Ioan Grillo and published by Global Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The heresy on the street is: \u2018I\u2019d love to see the Brazil team lose every game.\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Global Post", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The heresy on the street is: \u2018I\u2019d love to see the Brazil team lose every game.\u2019", "title": "Some Brazilians Want Their Country To Lose The World Cup", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/heres-aome-brazilians-want-country-lose-world-cup/190895/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Brazil-Corruption-and_Muha.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-05-16T07:50:27-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The heresy on the street is: \u2018I\u2019d love to see the Brazil team lose every game.\u2019", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Brazil-Corruption-and_Muha.jpg", "title": "Some Brazilians Want Their Country To Lose The World Cup", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "World Cup", "published_time": "2014-05-17T05:00:37-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-16T07:50:27-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "In a favela in Sao Paulo, laborer Higo Carvalho said he was critical of the World Cup spending but would cheer on the Brazil team.\nThe angers against the tournament and team stem from a mix of grievances both over the World Cup and within Brazilian society generally.\nBut while demonstrators are organizing against the World Cup games in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, there is little sign of marches in the other 10 host cities.\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see Brazil lose 10 to nothing.\nDuring the confederations soccer tournament last year, hundreds of thousands marched against spending for the country\u2019s mega sporting events."}
