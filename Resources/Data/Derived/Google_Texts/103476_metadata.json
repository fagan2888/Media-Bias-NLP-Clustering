In fact, the Patriots own a 33-game winning streak against AFC opponents on their home turf, making Sunday\u2019s Peyton Manning vs. Tom Brady showdown all the more enticing. We scoured the web to give you the most comprehensive preview available for the game. Here\u2019s what we dug up:\n\nBill, your thoughts on the weather forecast?\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say based on the forecasts we\u2019ve gotten so far this year, none of them have been even very close to what game conditions were. There was 100 percent chance of rain last week and the only water I saw was on the Gatorade table. \u2026 We played down in Miami two years ago and there was a zero percent chance of rain \u2013 zero \u2013 and it rained. I\u2019m just telling you. If I did my job the way they do theirs, I\u2019d be here about a week.\u201d\n\nFriendly reminder: Broncos\u2019 D doesn\u2019t do nice:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s defense. We\u2019re not nice,\u201d said Broncos defensive lineman Derek Wolfe. \u201cWe\u2019re not nice people. I\u2019m not a nice guy. I might be nice if you come up and say \u2018Hi\u2019 to me, but if I see you when I have full pads on, I\u2019m not very nice.\u201d\n\nMost important stats to know for Sunday:\n\nJohn Elway: Manning turns it up for Brady\n\n\u201cEven though Peyton\u2019s got it pretty much cranked all the time anyway, obviously there\u2019s the rivalry and the competitiveness that they both have. They see each other on each side of the field, there\u2019s going to be a little more meaning to it, because it\u2019s going to be made a bigger deal, and rightfully so. You\u2019re talking about the two greatest quarterbacks that have played the game.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s revisit all Tom vs. Peyton meetings \u2026.:\n\n\u2026 but examine which quarterback \u201cwon\u201d the game-within-the-game by using the 10-point must system from boxing. You can thank Bill Barnwell for this.\n\nWhy Tom and Peyton need each other:\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for Brady, we\u2019d have to think of Manning as a celebrity, but if it weren\u2019t for Manning, we\u2019d have to think of Brady as a guy doing a job \u2014 or worse: as a guy who signs paperwork, who wakes up worried in the middle of the night, who gets stuck in traffic, who waits on hold, who wonders where time is going, who feels unexplained pain in his tooth.\n\nIs Peyton, at 38, getting better?\n\n\u201cPeyton Manning IS getting better at playing regular-season professional football. \u2026 But Manning is also getting worse at playing football.\u201d So says Bill Simmons.\n\nAqib Talib is a Bronco this time. Guess who\u2019s happy.\n\n\u201cIf we would\u2019ve had Aqib last year, it would\u2019ve been different,\u201d linebacker Von Miller said. \u201cBut we got him this year, so we just got to go out there and play.\u201d\n\nBut Talib almost wasn\u2019t a Bronco\n\n\u201cI definitely came close, man,\u201d Talib said yesterday by phone. \u201cIt was a negotiation, and it came down to the language of the contracts. I just went with what I feel was best with me and my family. I can\u2019t remember the logistics and everything. It wasn\u2019t bad at all. The offer wasn\u2019t bad. It was just the language of the offer, how the payout comes. It was some language that I wasn\u2019t trying to hear.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to relive this sack:\n\nTale of the tape\n\nBased on a true story \u2026\n\nThanks, Bill.\n\nIt\u2019s SOOOOOO yesterday\n\nA single play in last season\u2019s AFC championship game drew Bill Belichick\u2019s wrath. The New England boss called Welker\u2019s collision with cornerback Aqib Talib intentional, \u201cone of the dirtiest plays I have seen.\u201d Belichick and Welker traded praise, not barbs, Wednesday, both saying they have moved on. \u201cWay past that,\u201d Belichick said. \u201c(I have) a lot of respect for Wes and what he did for us, what he\u2019s done for the Broncos and what he\u2019s done throughout his career.\u201d\n\nThe debate is supposedly over\n\n\u201cFor those people devoted to the stats, the data, the truth; for those people devoted to the Cold, Hard Football Facts, there is no debate: Tom Brady is an empirically superior quarterback.\u201d\n\nAll of Peyton\u2019s TDs \u2026 for the other team:\n\nAfter Manning threw touchdown pass No. 510, we unveiled a complex breakdown of all of his career TDs, by location, receiver, distance and more. On Friday, Deadspin broke down all of his pick-sixes.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bill Belichick,Broncos,Patriots,Peyton Manning,Tom Brady", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Peyton Manning and Tom Brady face off yet again at Gillette Stadium on Sunday.
