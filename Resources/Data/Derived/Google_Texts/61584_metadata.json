Wilke, 76, and Jeffrey Wilke, 50. The elder Wilke was a retired carpenter, the younger man an Air Force veteran.\n\nThey lived in a house at 4807 Farnam St. Their bodies were discovered Friday morning \u2014 one inside the home, one outside.\n\nPolice have ruled out foul play, said Officer James Shade, a police spokesman.\n\nFamily members visited the home Saturday.\n\nSoza, a niece of Ronald Wilke, said police told the family it appeared that Jeffrey suffered a heart attack inside the house.\n\nPerhaps in shock or seeking help, Ronald Wilke \u2014 who had a history of heart problems \u2014 went outside and later collapsed and died, Soza said. His body was found in a row of shrubs.\n\nPolice have said the men had been dead for some time before a neighbor spotted Ronald Wilke\u2019s body and called police.\n\n\u201cHe might have freaked out about finding his son, came out here, fell and had a heart attack,\u201d Soza said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very odd.\u201d\n\nAnn Wilke, mother of Echo and sister-in-law of Ronald Wilke, said it was \u201ca big relief\u2019\u2019 to be told that the men died of natural causes. \u201cIt could have been much worse.\u201d\n\nAuthorities declined to comment on the causes of death, saying they are awaiting autopsy results.\n\nSoza and Ann Wilke live in Fremont. They said they weren\u2019t close to Ronald and Jeffrey Wilke, but they were still shocked at the news.\n\nJeffrey Wilke had back problems and had recently undergone surgery.\n\n\u201cThe son was in bad shape,\u201d said Warren Swanson, who lived across the street. \u201cHe was in a lot of pain.\u201d\n\nSwanson said he and Ronald Wilke used to share a cup of coffee nearly every day on their front porches, where they\u2019d chat about politics, work and family.\n\nBut after Wilke\u2019s wife, Linda, died of cancer in 2007, he became withdrawn, Swanson said.\n\n\u201cIt hit him hard,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cHe quit coming over for coffee and he kind of kept to himself.\u201d\n\nFamily members said that before retiring, Ronald Wilke had worked in construction for one of the Kiewit companies.\n\nJeffrey Wilke was the father of twin sons. Soza said her family was trying to reach out to the boys.\n\nSwanson said Jeffrey Wilke doted on his now-teenage sons.\n\n\u201cHe worshiped those boys,\u201d he said. \u201cJust loved them. He\u2019d do anything for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Police said they won\u2019t speculate officially until receiving autopsy results.", "title": "Father, son found near 48th and Farnam likely died of heart attacks", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/father-son-found-near-th-and-farnam-likely-died-of/article_b3108d1e-759d-5090-94ec-c4fde29cc628.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/ec/3ec0b265-6473-5228-b570-117bc2656258/53330b020d684.image.jpg?resize=760%2C464", "height": 464}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Police said they won\u2019t speculate officially until receiving autopsy results.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce67f\"", "article_summary": "Perhaps in shock or seeking help, Ronald Wilke \u2014 who had a history of heart problems \u2014 went outside and later collapsed and died, Soza said.\nFamily members said Saturday that a father and son whose bodies were found at a midtown Omaha home both died of natural causes.\nOmaha police identified the men as Ronald D.
