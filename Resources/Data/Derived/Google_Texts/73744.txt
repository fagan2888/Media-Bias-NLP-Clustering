Real Goods Solar Inc. was handed a delisting notice from the Nasdaq exchange after the troubled Louisville-based residential solar installer’s stock closed below $1 per share for 30 consecutive trading days.

Real Goods Solar, which does business as RGS Energy, disclosed the notice Thursday in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

RGS Energy’s stock (Nasdaq: RGSE) closed down 2 cents, or 2.4 percent, at 74 cents on the abbreviated Christmas Eve trading day. Shares last finished above $1 in early November, prior to the company’s reporting of a $4.3 million net loss on $10.4 million in revenue for the third quarter.

RGS Energy has until June 20, to regain compliance by maintaining a closing share price of $1 or more for 10 consecutive business days.

RGS Energy and its stock have stuggled with in recent years. The company faltered amid an increasingly competitive solar energy industry.

In the past 18 months, RGS Energy made restructuring attempts that included pulling out of the commercial solar market, closing offices and making a greater push into leasing programs.
