The Republican even endorsed allowing local law enforcement to \u201carrest federal officials attempting to implement\u201d the federal health care law.\n\nObviously, nothing became of these extremist positions, and Ernst was never able to act on her ridiculous beliefs. But the hyper-conservative ideas she embraced clearly haven\u2019t faded from Republicans\u2019 minds. The Charleston Gazette reported this week:\n\nIn another salvo against the federal Affordable Care Act, some Republicans in West Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates want to make it a crime for state and federal officials to enforce the health-care law. Under the GOP-backed bill (HB2509), federal employees would face felony charges, while state workers would be arrested for a misdemeanor offense, if they try to administer any federal regulations under the Affordable Care Act. The legislation also declares the federal health-care law \u201cinvalid\u201d in West Virginia.\n\nPerry Bryant, who heads West Virginians for Affordable Health Care, told the paper, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to oppose the Affordable Care Act, but it\u2019s another thing to make it a criminal act for people to do their job. This is really an extreme piece of legislation, as extreme as anything I\u2019ve seen this session.\u201d\n\nOr any session, really. The notion that a state can simply nullify a federal law it doesn\u2019t like is absurd \u2013 the last time states considered this approach, the question was resolved by the Civil War. The \u201cnullification\u201d crowd lost.\n\nThe notion that West Virginia Republicans could make it a literal crime to enforce American law in America is simply bonkers.\n\nAnd yet, the proposal has the support of a half-dozen GOP lawmakers in West Virginia and was taken up by the state House Health and Human Resources Committee on Tuesday.\n\nMaking matters slightly worse, it\u2019s not at all clear why West Virginia Republicans would be so desperate to destroy the law \u2013 it\u2019s currently working very well statewide. Just this week, we learned that West Virginia\u2019s uninsured rate has dropped to 10.9% , down from 17.6% in 2013.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the sharpest improvements of any state in the nation, and it\u2019s the direct result of West Virginia embracing Medicaid expansion through the ACA and creating its own state-based exchange marketplace. Even if the Affordable Care Act were a disaster in West Virginia, states can\u2019t just pick and choose which federal laws they\u2019ll honor and which they\u2019ll nullify. But the truth of the matter is that the ACA is a great success in the state.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Several West Virginia Republicans believe they can make it a literal crime to enforce American law in America.
