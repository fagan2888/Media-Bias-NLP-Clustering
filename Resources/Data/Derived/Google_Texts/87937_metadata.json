D. History student, told the Daily News Journal that his job as a graduate assistant, a position that pays only $14,000 annually, requires a 20-hour work week, but he is unable to attain on-campus grant-funded research positions like many assistants do.\n\n\u201cLast spring because of the ACA, the HR department issued a policy that the most we could work is 29 hours, which would be 9 hours above our assistantships. Now they're saying we can't do that anymore,\" Fletcher told the Daily News Journal.\n\nAs Campus Reform previously reported, the University of Kansas has reduced the number of hours student employees can work from 30 hours per week to 20, a move to ensure compliance with the ACA.\n\n\u201cThe revised [KU] policy seeks to balance the necessity for students to make academic progress while managing potential fiscal liabilities with ACA,\u201d Diane Goddard, KU vice provost for administration and finance wrote in an email early this month.\n\nCapping hours associated with on-campus employment is quickly becoming the norm. Since 2012, at least 111 colleges and universities have limited adjunct professor course loads, capped student employment hours, or reduced hours for part-time faculty according to a list compiled by Investor\u2019s Business Daily.\n\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter: @CalebBonham", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5854/Banned.jpg", "description": "\"[E]ffective beginning with the fall semester, we will no longer allow part-time employees, or those receiving monthly stipends from the university, to accept multiple work assignments on campus.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Campus Reform", "description": "\"[E]ffective beginning with the fall semester, we will no longer allow part-time employees, or those receiving monthly stipends from the university, to accept multiple work assignments on campus.\"", "title": "Universities nationwide limit student employment to comply with Obamacare", "url": "http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=5854", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5854/Banned.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "image": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5854/Banned.jpg", "fb": {"admins": 19226500, "app_id": 127484367480}, "keywords": ",MTSU, Middle Tennessee State University, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, ACA,College work, University work, student work, Caleb Bonham", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "description": "\"[E]ffective beginning with the fall semester, we will no longer allow part-time employees, or those receiving monthly stipends from the university, to accept multiple work assignments on campus.\""}, "twitter": {"description": "Universities nationwide limit student employment to comply with Obamacare", "card": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/5854/Banned.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf96\"", "article_summary": "Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) is restricting student work because of compliance issues associated with the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare.\nSince 2012, at least 111 colleges and universities have limited adjunct professor course loads, capped student employment hours, or reduced hours for part-time faculty according to a list compiled by Investor\u2019s Business Daily.\n\"[E]ffective beginning with the fall semester, we will no longer allow part-time employees, or those receiving monthly stipends from the university, to accept multiple work assignments on campus.\"\nThe Daily News Journal reports that graduate assistants are now restricted from picking up research work funded through grants to the university.\nCapping hours associated with on-campus employment is quickly becoming the norm."}
