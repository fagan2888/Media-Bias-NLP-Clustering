In the past year alone, they\u2019ve added 2.85 million members.\n\nRelated: Little Credit Union Uncovers Massive Tax Fraud\n\nMany of these new members have left their banks in the years since the financial crisis.\n\n\u201cPeople are still feeling bruised from the downturn,\u201d Mike Schenk, chief economist at CUNA, told The Fiscal Times. \u201cCredit unions didn\u2019t engage in the type of [subprime] lending that led to the financial crisis.\u201d\n\nConsumers are increasingly realizing the numerous benefits of the smaller, often more personal credit unions over banks. In 2013, trust in credit unions, as measured by the Chicago Booth Kellogg School Financial Trust Index, was at 62 percent, while trust in national banks was at 28 percent.\n\nFor many Americans, though, credit unions still seem to be a secret society of sorts.\n\nThere are roughly 7,000 credit unions in the U.S., all not-for-profit financial cooperatives owned and controlled by members, which means they don\u2019t issue stocks or pay dividends to stockholders. Each member typically gets a vote, no matter how much money is in that individual\u2019s checking account.\n\nRelated: The Secret to Scoring Free Checking\n\nAny profit is returned to members in the form of lower loan rates, higher savings rates and lower fees. For instance, nearly three-quarters of the nation\u2019s credit unions offer standalone free checking accounts, which are available at only 38 percent of large banks.\n\nOne of the main worries of potential credit union customers is that there aren\u2019t as many branches and ATMs available compared with large national banks. But more than 5,000 locations now participate in a shared-branch network, where credit union customers can bank (without added fees) at other branches throughout the country.\n\nThe same thing goes for ATMs. There are nearly 30,000 surcharge-free ATMs nationwide that credit union customers can use and find through the smartphone app, ATM Locator by Co-op Financial Services.\n\nJust like with any bank, consumers\u2019 money is insured \u2013 by the National Credit Union Administration instead of by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\nTo be sure, credit unions may seem too good to be true \u2013 and there are some limitations to keep in mind. While joining credit unions has become easier and looser than in the past when they were limited strictly to specific groups of customers \u2013 to those with either a religious, industry or company affiliation, for example \u2013 many still have specific rules and membership requirements.\n\nTo find the closest credit union near you, click here.
