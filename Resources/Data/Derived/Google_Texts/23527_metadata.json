The remote-controlled bomb blew up Ibrahim\u2019s convoy as he drove through Cairo\u2019s Nasr City district, according to security officials.\n\nJust hours after the attack, Ibrahim appeared on state TV and called the attack a \u201ccowardly assassination bid\u201d and a \u201cdespicable attempt\u201d at taking his life. At least three explosive devices were detonated by a remote control near his car, shortly after he left his home in Nasr on Thursday morning.\n\nAn interior ministry official said that Ibrahim, who is completely unharmed, missed the explosion by a few mere seconds. According to Ibrahim, his guards were injured, as well as one police officer who is currently in critical condition and another who lost his legs.\n\nAlthough the attack hasn\u2019t been claimed by anyone or a group as of yet, it marks the first attack on a senior government official since a coupe toppled the Islamist President, Mohamed Morsi, in early July. Once the president was ousted, a myriad of violent confrontations erupted between security forces and Morsi\u2019s Islamist supporters. Egyptian prosecutors recently ordered Morsi to stand trial on murder-related charges as a result of the deaths between Brotherhood loyalists and anti-Morsi protesters.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the military and police have killed a combined 1,000 protesters since Morsi was forced out.\n\nDr. Amr Darrag, a senior official of the Brotherhood, responded to the recent attack and says his group \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the attempt on Ibrahim\u2019s life. Darrag told Al Jazeera, an Arabic television network, \u201cWe reaffirm our peaceful approach, which is clear in all our protests.\u201d\n\nIbrahim said that he has been informed of current plans to kill him and has taken steps toward protection by using an armored car for transportation, provided by General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, head of the armed forces. Ibrahim said the attackers involved are \u201cforeign elements.\u201d\n\nWhen Ibrahim was asked by reporters if the attack was a precedent of a \u201cnew wave of terrorism\u201d for Egypt, he replied, \u201cWhat happened today is not the end but the beginning.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "egypt bombing, interior minister, mohamed ibrahim, bomb attack", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After an unsuccessful apparent attempt to kill Egypt\u2019s interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim, officials look for the responsible party.", "title": "Egypt\u2019s Interior Minister Targeted By Bomb Attack; Mohamed Ibrahim Survives, 2 Dead", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/egypts-interior-minister-targeted-bomb-attack-mohamed-ibrahim-survives-2-dead-255648", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/05/egypts-interior-minister-escapes-death-bomb-cairo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After an unsuccessful apparent attempt to kill Egypt\u2019s interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim, officials look for the responsible party.", "title": "Egypt\u2019s Interior Minister Targeted By Bomb Attack; Mohamed Ibrahim Survives, 2 Dead", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/egypts-interior-minister-targeted-bomb-attack-mohamed-ibrahim-survives-2-dead-255648", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/05/egypts-interior-minister-escapes-death-bomb-cairo.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/05/egypts-interior-minister-escapes-death-bomb-cairo.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-05T13:24:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-05T13:24:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After an unsuccessful apparent attempt to kill Egypt\u2019s interior minister Mohamed Ibrahim, officials look for the responsible party."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae1e\"", "article_summary": "A bomb targeted at Egypt's interior minister, Mohamed Ibrahim, has killed at least two people and wounded 10, but left the minister unscathed.\nJust hours after the attack, Ibrahim appeared on state TV and called the attack a \u201ccowardly assassination bid\u201d and a \u201cdespicable attempt\u201d at taking his life.\nDr. Amr Darrag, a senior official of the Brotherhood, responded to the recent attack and says his group \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d the attempt on Ibrahim\u2019s life.\nAn interior ministry official said that Ibrahim, who is completely unharmed, missed the explosion by a few mere seconds.\nThe remote-controlled bomb blew up Ibrahim\u2019s convoy as he drove through Cairo\u2019s Nasr City district, according to security officials."}
