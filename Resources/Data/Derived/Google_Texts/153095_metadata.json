The primary focus was on two media consultants: the late Bob Squier, a Democrat; and Bob Goodman, Republican. One ad of which Goodman was especially proud was for a fellow in Kentucky running against Todd Hollenbach, Sr., the incumbent judge/executive of Jefferson County. Produced in 1977, the spot featured a farmer complaining about taxes that he claimed Judge Hollenbach had raised and then lied about.\n\nAs he mucked out a barn and his faithful horse whinnied, the farmer declared, \u201cMaybe Hollenbach ought to have my job, because in my business, I deal with that kind of stuff every day.\u201d Then he threw a shovel of manure right at the camera. Hollenbach lost to the candidate who approved this message: Mitch McConnell.\n\nMcConnell has been shoveling it ever since, but perhaps never as stunningly as on Tuesday, when he spoke from the floor of the U.S. Senate. The now-majority leader of the so-called greatest deliberative body in the world blustered, as he has several times in the last couple of weeks, that Senate Republicans would never, ever consider an appointment by President Obama to replace the still-dead Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nThe President, McConnell then said, \u201chas every right to nominate someone, even if doing so will inevitably plunge our nation into another bitter and avoidable struggle.\u201d\n\nExcuse me, Senator, the bitter and undeniably avoidable struggle was created by you on the Saturday that Scalia\u2019s corpse was found. The body was barely cold when you crassly announced that the duly-elected President of the United States should not name the judge\u2019s successor but must leave it to the next president more than 300 days from now.\n\nMcConnell continued, \u201cEven if he never expects that nominee to be actually confirmed but rather to wield as an election cudgel, he certainly has the right to do that.\u201d Again, Senator, it\u2019s you who is wielding the blunt object.\n\nAnd then the Majority Leader had the chutzpah, as they say down home in his Bluegrass State, to add that Barack Obama also \u201chas the right to make a different choice. He can let the people decide and make this an actual legacy-building moment rather than just another campaign roadshow.\u201d\n\nOh brother, look who\u2019s talking. Of all the pompous, insincere bloviation; ignoring courtesy, tradition let alone the U.S. Constitution in the name of Senator McConnell\u2019s own misbegotten ambitions.\n\nPsychiatrists call this \u201cprojection,\u201d the defensive method by which people take their own negative beliefs or feelings and attribute them to someone else otherwise known as shifting blame. In McConnell\u2019s case, add to it a megadose of the cynical manipulation and crass opportunism characteristic of most of his political career.\n\nNot that it was always so. McConnell began his political life as a liberal Republican remember them?, interning for legendary Kentucky senator and statesman John Sherman Cooper. He supported the Equal Rights Amendment and collective bargaining. Friends say he was pro-Planned Parenthood and he even wrote an op-ed piece in the Louisville Courier-Journal favoring campaign finance reform.\n\nFormer McConnell press secretary Meme Sweets Runyon told Jason Cherkis and Zach Carter at The Huffington Post, \u201cHe was kind of a good-government guy. He thought the government could do good and could be a solution.\u201d\n\nBut once Mitch McConnell got to Washington as an elected senator and the mood of the Republican Party shifted right, so did he. Delay and obstruction became stepping stones. At the same time, the man who New York Times columnist Gail Collins famously described as having \u201cthe natural charisma of an oyster,\u201d developed a Jekyll-and-Hyde style of self-serving pragmatism bashing government from Capitol Hill but using all of its perks to bolster support among his constituents.\n\nIt\u2019s worth quoting at length what Cherkis and Carter wrote in 2013: \u201cUp until the tea party-led ban on earmarks a few years ago, McConnell played out this dichotomy across Kentucky. In Washington, he voted against a health care program for poor children. In Kentucky, he funneled money to provide innovative health services for pregnant women. In Washington, he railed against Obamacare. In Kentucky, he supported free health care and prevention programs paid for by the federal government without the hassle of a private-insurance middleman.\n\n\u201cThis policy ping-pong may not suggest a coherent belief system, but it has led to loyalty among the GOP in Washington and something close to fealty in Kentucky. It has advanced McConnell\u2019s highest ideal: his own political survival.\n\n\u201cMcConnell\u2019s hold on Kentucky is a grim reminder of the practice of power in America, where political excellence can be wholly divorced from successful governance and even public admiration,\u201d the Huffington Post reporters continued. \u201cThe most dominant and influential Kentucky politician since his hero Henry Clay, McConnell has rarely used his indefatigable talents toward broad, substantive reforms. He may be ruling, but he\u2019s ruling over a commonwealth with the lowest median income in the country, where too many counties have infant mortality rates comparable to those of the Third World. His solutions have been piecemeal and temporary, more cynical than merciful.\u201d\n\nAnd so it goes. \u201cHe privileges the scoreboard above all,\u201d The New Yorker\u2019s Evan Osnos wrote in 2014. \u201cAsked about his ideological evolution, he explained simply, \u2018I wanted to win.\u2019\u201d\n\nTailoring his positions to adjust to the shifting seasons, what sets Mitch McConnell apart is that his motives aren\u2019t really ideological but so baldly about holding onto personal power. His opposition to Obama\u2019s naming of a Scalia replacement puts the majority leader in solid with the far-right Republicans he purportedly so dislikes but who have threatened his job security over the last few years, both at home and in DC.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, McConnell is desperate to keep a conservative majority on the Court to preserve the unbridled flow of campaign cash that the Citizens United decision let loose and that he so successfully has tapped for himself and the GOP. Unlike the young man who penned that campaign finance reform op-ed back in Louisville, fundraising has become his favorite thing, and he\u2019s scary good at it.\n\nAs his former Republican Senate colleague Alan Simpson said, \u201cWhen he asked for money, his eyes would shine like diamonds. He obviously loved it.\u201d\n\nAnd even if a Democrat holds onto the White House next year, chances are McConnell \u2014 the man who once said that the most important thing was to make Barack Obama a one-term president \u2014 will still play a power broker role in determining which Supreme Court candidate will successively run the 60-vote supermajority gauntlet needed for Senate approval. It\u2019s good to be king.\n\nBut if he wants us all to wait for a Republican president to choose the next appointment to the Court, he might want to think twice. Donald Trump bows before no man \u2014 just ask him \u2014 and he shovels muck even better than that farmer who helped Mitch McConnell win his first public office.\n\nMichael Winship is the Emmy Award-winning senior writer of Moyers & Company and BillMoyers.com, and a former senior writing fellow at the policy and advocacy group Demos.
