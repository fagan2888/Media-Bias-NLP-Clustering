From reporter Hannah DeClerk on the celebration at Pike Park:

Hundreds of community members celebrated the re-opening of Pike Park Saturday, to mark the park’s centennial and $400,000 in renovations.

The dedication kicked off under bright skies with a ribbon cutting and speech by Mayor Mike Rawlings followed by various performances including a mariachi band and folklorico dancers.

The Dallas Mexican American Historical League, a non-profit dedicated to preserving the century-old narrative of the city’s largest ethnic group pushed to spruce up the park located in the remnants of the old Little Mexico neighborhood near downtown.

“People want to come out here, and for those who grew up here, when you start talking to people you start seeing connections,” said League member Albert Gonzalez.

The park also has strong ties to the Dallas Jewish community. Debra Polsky of the Dallas Jewish Historical Society seemed pleased, by the commitment to restore the park “and make it a place where there really are programs and opportunities for children who live in this neighborhood.”

Many of those attending said visiting the park brought back childhood memories. Longtime friends Mary-Alice Contreras and Robbie Martinez reminisced about times when they played there as children.

“There was always so much stuff going on. We would come here on the weekends and play hoops. And there was always celebrations, our biggest one was Cinco De Mayo,” Contreras said.

Marisela Carvajal said she was nicknamed “Queen of Pike Park” when she was 15-years-old. “Let me tell you,Pike Park was our community center. It was where I learned to swim, play softball and do everything,” Carvajal said. “This event is awesome because it shows there are people who care about the history who want to keep this memory alive.”
