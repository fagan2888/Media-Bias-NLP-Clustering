Home Depot shoppers beware: The retail chain reported that its payment systems at stores nationwide and in Canada were hacked, leaving untold numbers of customers who use debit and credit cards at financial risk.

Reuters reported that it’s not clear yet if debit PINs were captured by the hackers.

Home Depot said in a statement that the breach doesn’t seem to have spread to Mexico or to website shoppers. The retailer also said the breach could have occurred as far back as April.

Company officials have been working with the U.S. Secret Service to investigate, Reuters said.
