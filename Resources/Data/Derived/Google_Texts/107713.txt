It didn't have the allure of a presidential primary, but Tuesday's municipal elections in every county in Missouri decided a number of pocketbook issues and put people in place on area school boards. Here are the results.

Voters in Springfield voted overwhelmingly voted to renew two sales taxes used to support infrastructure in the city. The 1989 1/4 Capital Improvement sales tax and 1996 1/8 cent Transportation sales tax were both approved by 86% of the vote.

Voters also elected Charles Taylor and Alina Lehnert to the Springfield School Board. The board had two open seats with five candidates running. Taylor and Lehnert both got 28% of the vote.

Nixa Schools added Glenn Scott and Mike Copeland to the school board with 36% and 32% of the vote, respectively.

Voters in the village of Merriam Woods voted to make their community a 4th class city. The issue won by 68% of the vote.

Willard Schools will receive a $5.5 million dollar bond after Greene County voted yes.

Also, an interesting result for the Willard Alderman Ward One. No one filed for the position, but someone wrote in the name Donna Stewart. If she turns out to be a qualified candidate, she will be Ward One's new Alderman.

Nationally, Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders are projected to be the winners in the Wisconsin primary on Tuesday.
