After it is approved, Senate leaders are expected to put the legislation on the floor in the upper chamber.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nUnlike other legislation that needs support from 60 senators to overcome a filibuster, this bill will be passed under budget reconciliation rules, meaning it only needs 51 votes to advance. With 54 Republicans in the Senate, it\u2019s likely the measure will head to President Barack Obama\u2019s desk for a certain veto.\n\nRepublican leaders have been saying since last year that they would consider using reconciliation to repeal the law. But until now, the timeline and legislative path forward had been uncertain and conservatives have questioned whether leaders were serious about using it on Obamacare.\n\nEven though the measure will never become law, Republicans argue that forcing Obama to veto a bill that gets rid of some of Obamacare\u2019s most unpopular provisions \u2013 such as the individual mandate and taxes \u2013 amounts to a political victory. Plus, any headway they can make this year could serve as a legislative roadmap for what the GOP could accomplish if they sent a Republican to the White House in 2017.\n\n\"If we pass this package, we can finally get a bill that takes apart Obamacare through the Senate,\" Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan said after his committee approved part of the bill on Tuesday.\n\nThe House bill would repeal Obamacare\u2019s individual and employer mandates, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, and unspent money in the Prevention and Public Health Fund. It would also repeal the Cadillac and medical device taxes and the law\u2019s requirement that large companies auto-enroll employees in health insurance. It would also defund Planned Parenthood for one year.\n\nBudget reconciliation, which is used relatively infrequently, was last deployed by Democrats in 2010 to pass a portion of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI think it should be called \u2018wreck-onciliation,\u2019\u201d said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), \u201cbecause it is a wreck for those 14 million families [with coverage under the ACA], it is a wreck for those children who have relied on the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, and it is a wreck for people who will be paying 20 percent higher insurance premiums than they would be if this bill were not passed.\u201d\n\nThe path forward looks like this: One House committee has already approved its portion of the bill. Two more committees are scheduled to take up the legislation this week. Next week, the House Budget Committee is expected to combine the bills. From there, House leaders are expected to bring the legislation to the floor for a vote. At that point, it would go to the Senate for a vote on the floor.\n\n\u201cWe have to do the same bill as the House for it to be reconciled,\u201d said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cMy expectation is we\u2019ll consider the House bill once they pass it.\u201d\n\nOnce in the Senate, the legislation would also have to undergo review by the Senate parliamentarian to ensure that the bill abides by the complex rules for reconciliation, such as having a direct impact on the budget.\n\nDuring the Senate parliamentarian\u2019s review \u2013 called a \u201cByrd bath\u201d because the rules are named for former Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd \u2013 some provisions of the bill could be eliminated.\n\nBrianna Ehley contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Republicans have agreed on a plan to use a fast-track budget procedure to send a repeal to the president\u2019s desk.", "title": "GOP full throttle on Obamacare repeal", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/republicans-obamcare-repeal-veto-214244", "image": "http://static.politico.com/49/85/da5240044fc7a8164dd242323e0a/150929-paul-ryan-js-629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Republicans have agreed on a plan to use a fast-track budget procedure to send a repeal to the president\u2019s desk.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b38\"", "article_summary": "| John Shinkle GOP full throttle on Obamacare repeal Republicans have agreed on a plan to use a fast-track budget procedure to send a repeal to the president\u2019s desk.\nThe House bill would repeal Obamacare\u2019s individual and employer mandates, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, and unspent money in the Prevention and Public Health Fund.\nAfter it is approved, Senate leaders are expected to put the legislation on the floor in the upper chamber.\nRepublican leaders have been saying since last year that they would consider using reconciliation to repeal the law.\nFrom there, House leaders are expected to bring the legislation to the floor for a vote."}
