ORONO, Maine — A data breach discovered last week has exposed the personal information of more than 900 current and former University of Maine students, the university announced Wednesday.

UMaine spokeswoman Margaret Nagle said the information was on a laptop computer and the media card used by a faculty member who discovered the laptop was missing from a checked bag during a flight from Seattle to Boston on Feb. 10. The name of the faculty member was not released.

The faculty member immediately reported the theft to police.

All students potentially affected were enrolled in physics courses at the university as far back as 1999.

A total of 941 student records containing addresses, grades and other information were on the laptop. Of those, 604 records of students enrolled from 1999 to 2007 included Social Security numbers. The remaining 337 did not include Social Security numbers, Nagle said.

The University of Maine System General Counsel has notified the Maine attorney general’s office of the information breach, as is required under the state’s Notice of Risk to Personal Data Act.

Nagle said that as of Wednesday there was no indication the data were used. She said the affected students were offered one free year of credit monitoring, alerts regarding credit changes and identity theft insurance through Experian Information Solutions.
