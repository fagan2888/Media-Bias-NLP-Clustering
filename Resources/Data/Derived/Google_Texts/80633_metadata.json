The high prices are due to the difficulty in finding those models, which were limited editions in their time,\u201d said Djassem Haddad, who started the site vintagemobile.fr in 2009.\n\nHaddad had been eyeing a niche market, but since last year, sales have taken off, he said.\n\nOver the past two to three years, he has sold some 10,000 handsets, \u201cwith a real acceleration from the beginning of 2013\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe ageing population is looking for simpler phones, while other consumers want a second cheap phone,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the top-sellers on the website is the Nokia 8210, with a tiny monochrome screen and plastic buttons, at $90.\n\nIronically, the trend is just starting as the telecommunications industry consigns such handsets to the recycling bins, hailing smartphones as the way ahead.\n\nFinnish giant Nokia, which was undisputedly the biggest mobile phone company before the advent of Apple\u2019s iPhone and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy, offloaded its handset division to Microsoft this year after failing to catch the smartphone wave.\n\nBut it was probably also the supposedly irreversible switch towards the smartphone that has given the old school phone an unexpected boost.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "description": "THEY fit in a pocket, have batteries that last all week and are almost indestructible: old-school Nokias, Ericssons and Motorolas are making a comeback as consumers tire of fragile and overly-wired smartphones.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "NewsComAu", "description": "THEY fit in a pocket, have batteries that last all week and are almost indestructible: old-school Nokias, Ericssons and Motorolas are making a comeback as consumers tire of fragile and overly-wired smartphones.", "title": "Old-school mobiles make comeback with consumers paying top dollar for Nokia brick phones", "url": "http://www.news.com.au/technology/oldschool-mobiles-make-comeback-with-consumers-paying-top-dollar-for-nokia-brick-phones/story-e6frfrnr-1226931678318", "image": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2014/05/26/1226931/678225-b70853e4-e47a-11e3-ba62-a129b4e220c3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2014/05/26/1226931/678225-b70853e4-e47a-11e3-ba62-a129b4e220c3.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@newscomauHQ", "id": "@newscomauHQ"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273", "app_id": 113758722003364}, "articleid": 1226931678318, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "news.com.au", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Mon May 26 14:41:11 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Mon May 26 14:41:11 EST 2014", "author": "Network Writers, wires"}, "keywords": "phone calls, school phone, tiny monochrome screen, handset division, Network writers, recycling bins, smartphone wave, niche market, text messaging, old-school mobiles, top dollar, battery life, Retro mobile fans, telecommunications industry, real acceleration, plastic buttons, Motorola, Inc., Nokia Corporation, Microsoft Corporation", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde653\"", "article_summary": "VideoImage Nokia Lumia under hammer test A Nokia Lumia 900 is put to the test of being hammered on with nails and more.\n\u201cThe ageing population is looking for simpler phones, while other consumers want a second cheap phone,\u201d he said.\nAmong the top-sellers on the website is the Nokia 8210, with a tiny monochrome screen and plastic buttons, at $90.\nThe high prices are due to the difficulty in finding those models, which were limited editions in their time,\u201d said Djassem Haddad, who started the site vintagemobile.fr in 2009.\nWith no apps, video calls or smiley faces, handsets like the Nokia 3310 or the Motorola StarTec 130 allow just basic text messaging and phone calls."}
