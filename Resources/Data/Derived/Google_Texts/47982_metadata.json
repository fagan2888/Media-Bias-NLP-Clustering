The researchers attributed these statistics to the possibility that many individuals with mental illness are unable to maintain homes, end up in jail, or quite simply don\u2019t receive the proper care and aid to get their feet on the ground.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising,\u201d Sita Diehl, director of state policy at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, told The Washington Post. \u201cWe knew that mental health services really took it on the chin during the recession. Employment rates have already been dismal to begin with, and when the supports were eroded, people with mental illness lost support and lost jobs.\u201d\n\nMary Giliberti, the executive director of NAMI, says that a lot could be improved if certain mental health resources and solutions were utilized. \u201cThese statistics paint a pretty bleak picture,\u201d she told USA Today. \u201cWe think we can do a lot better.\u201d One of these resources is a program known as supported employment, in which a mentally ill individual receives guidance to work. The program costs about $4,000 per person. However, fewer than 2 percent of people in the public mental health system receive this help, mostly because gathering the funds for it is difficult.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that people with mental health issues would benefit from employment; having a job could give them a sense of purpose and boost self-esteem. Giliberti believes that it\u2019s better to spend $4,000 on supported employment than to deal with the even more expensive consequences later: \u201cWork is critical to identity, to dignity, to who you are,\u201d she told USA Today. \u201cWhen we are funding work, we are decreasing the cost of future treatment.\u201d\n\nMental Health vs. Physical Health Care\n\nIs it true that mental health in the U.S. is simply not receiving as much attention as it should be? Back in 2013, former Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius noted that with the Affordable Care Act and the Mental Health Parity and Addictions Equity Act, the U.S. had made \u201chistoric advances in ensuring that mental illness is treated the same as any other illness.\u201d The Mental Health Parity act highlighted the fact that mental health had historically not received as much attention or been valued as much as it should be in America, and Obamacare plans to change that.\n\nThe rate of disabled people who were unemployed was at 13.4 percent in 2012, compared to the 7.9 percent rate of unemployment among people who aren\u2019t disabled, according to a Labor Department report. But it\u2019s still the mentally ill whose unemployment rates are the highest, possibly because there isn\u2019t as much stigma placed on physically disabled people as much as there is placed on individuals suffering from bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, ADHD, or depression. USA Today reports that a 2006 survey found that 62 percent of Americans were unwilling to work with someone with schizophrenia.\n\nHowever, the mental health parity law as well as new insurance options under the Affordable Care Act will provide new opportunities for the mentally ill to keep their mental health benefits without having to remain on Social Security programs. This might offer a better chance for individuals to work full-time jobs without losing their benefits.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mentally ill, unemployment", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new report says that 80 percent of people with a mental illness are unemployed, despite the existence of \u201csupportive employment.\u201d", "title": "Why Are 80% Of Adults With Mental Illness Unemployed?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/80-adults-mental-illness-are-unemployed-does-mental-health-still-take-back-seat-physical-health", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/10/mental-illness.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new report says that 80 percent of people with a mental illness are unemployed, despite the existence of \u201csupportive employment.\u201d", "title": "Why Are 80% Of Adults With Mental Illness Unemployed?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/80-adults-mental-illness-are-unemployed-does-mental-health-still-take-back-seat-physical-health", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/10/mental-illness.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/10/mental-illness.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-10T17:09:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T17:09:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new report says that 80 percent of people with a mental illness are unemployed, despite the existence of \u201csupportive employment.\u201d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd2a7\"", "article_summary": "Physical Health CareIs it true that mental health in the U.S. is simply not receiving as much attention as it should be?\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising,\u201d Sita Diehl, director of state policy at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, told The Washington Post.\nPeople struggling with mental health issues are likely to suffer quite the disadvantage in the workplace, according to a new study.\nHowever, the mental health parity law as well as new insurance options under the Affordable Care Act will provide new opportunities for the mentally ill to keep their mental health benefits without having to remain on Social Security programs.\n\u201cWe knew that mental health services really took it on the chin during the recession."}
