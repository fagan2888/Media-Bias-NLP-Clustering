The news was widely seen as Bush laying down a marker: Other potential candidates without that kind of fund-raising muscle might want to rethink their plans.\n\nPerhaps Bush\u2019s move was meant to flush out the small fry, but it might just have attracted a shark instead. According to The Wall Street Journal, two-time presidential candidate and 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who has said multiple times in public that he is not planning to run again, told a group of donors in New York that he is now seriously considering it.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush Is Making 20 GOP Presidential Hopefuls Scramble\n\nAccording to reporters Patrick O\u2019Connor and Beth Reinhard, Romney spoke to the group of \u201ca few dozen top GOP donors\u201d in Manhattan on Friday and told them that turmoil overseas and his concerns about the state of the U.S. economy have prompted him to consider a third run for the Oval Office.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nUntil now, Jeb Bush appeared to have the field more or less to himself when it came to courting the traditional Republican establishment, including large business interests. But those groups lined up solidly behind Romney in 2012, so his entry into the 2016 sweepstakes would change the race dramatically.\n\nOn Thursday night, National Review\u2019s Eliana Johnson reported that close confidants of Romney said that the former Massachusetts governor had become more open to running again. According to Johnson, they said that the Romney camp was not concerned about Jeb Bush\u2019s fundraising abilities, given their candidate\u2019s extensive national network of backers from his 2012 run.\n\nStill, the fact that Romney chose Friday, of all days, to suggest that top donors might want to keep their powder dry until he makes his decision can\u2019t help but suggest a certain concern about Jeb Bush siphoning off some of his financial support.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, a Bush spokesperson told Business Insider that the Bloomberg\u2019s reported $100 million goal was overstated and that the actual goal was \u201cfar more modest.\u201d But if Romney is really getting into the race, the Bush camp might need the cash.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On Friday morning, Bloomberg News reported that former Florida Governor and expected 2", "title": "Mitt Romney vs. Jeb Bush: The 2016 Fundraising Fight Has Started", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/09/Mitt-Romney-vs-Jeb-Bush-2016-Fundraising-Fight-Has-Started", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-07-31T211634Z_1_CBRE86U1N4100_RTROPTP_2_ROMNEY5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/09/Mitt-Romney-vs-Jeb-Bush-2016-Fundraising-Fight-Has-Started", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-07-31T211634Z_1_CBRE86U1N4100_RTROPTP_2_ROMNEY5.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "On Friday morning, Bloomberg News reported that former Florida Governor and expected 2", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb3e\"", "article_summary": "WHY THIS MATTERSUntil now, Jeb Bush appeared to have the field more or less to himself when it came to courting the traditional Republican establishment, including large business interests.\nOn Friday morning, Bloomberg News reported that former Florida Governor and expected 2016 candidate for the GOP presidential nomination Jeb Bush planned to raise $100 million for his political action committee in the first quarter of 2015.\nBut those groups lined up solidly behind Romney in 2012, so his entry into the 2016 sweepstakes would change the race dramatically.\nThe news was widely seen as Bush laying down a marker: Other potential candidates without that kind of fund-raising muscle might want to rethink their plans.\nAccording to Johnson, they said that the Romney camp was not concerned about Jeb Bush\u2019s fundraising abilities, given their candidate\u2019s extensive national network of backers from his 2012 run."}
