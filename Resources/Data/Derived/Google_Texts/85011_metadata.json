Some of those challenges were \"fast tracks\" \u2014 the teams were notified by text message to show up an activity within a set time frame.\n\nThe activities and challenges represented a wide variety of skills, from leathercrafting to sport fishing. The youth, who ranged in age from 8 to 15 years old, practiced tying fishing knots as well as mimicking bird calls and giving livestock shots.\n\nThe final product of the Come Alive Outside landscaping project includes a four-leaf clover outlined in rock.

The program, which is sponsored by John Deere and presented by JP Horizons, was founded in 2010 as a way to get professional landscape companies more involved in drawing children back to nature.\n\nThe challenge for participating chapters was to plan and execute a CAO community event, such as an event focused on unstructured play, a park renovation project, an activity bringing senior citizens outdoors or creating an awareness of healthy lifestyles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the teams in the scavenger hunt, the event was a landscaping project in the outdoor space in front of the Extension Office. With materials donated by local businesses, the youth built retaining walls, moved soil and planted a variety of perennial flowers and bushes, with help from 4-H and horticulture agent Brian Kailey and summer intern Bryant Klem. The supporting sponsors will be honored with a landscape plaque for their contributions.\n\nMembers of the \"Gold Diggers\" team use a syringe filled with colored water and an orange to practice intramuscular injections during the MQA (Meat Quality Assurance) activity for the Logan County Scavenger Hunt on July 23. (Sara Waite / Sterling Journal-Advocate)\n\nAlso as part of the challenge, the chapter has to make a video about their CAO project and post it online. The video submissions will then be put on the Come Alive Outside website, where the public will be invited to vote for their favorite project from Sept. 29 to Oct. 3. The chapters that receive at least 200 votes will move on to the judging stage by John Deere leadership, professional landscape contractors and JP Horizons. The top three chapters win prizes of $1,000 for first place, $500 for second place, and $300 for third place.\n\nKailey said more information will be provided when the voting period nears.\n\nScavenger hunt teams work on leathercraft projects.
