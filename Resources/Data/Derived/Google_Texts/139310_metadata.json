Well, there\u2019s the fact that five years of Obamanomics has brought America to its lowest civilian workforce participation rate from about the decade average at the beginning of the June 2009 recovery to a 36-year low. The passage of ObamaCare turned out to be the most competent part of the whole thing, and the rollout has been an utter disaster. On top of that, our foreign policy is at its lowest ebb since Jimmy Carter, and it\u2019s clear now that the Obama administration didn\u2019t bother to prepare for threats in places where even a child could see them. Plus, there\u2019s that whole Lie of the Year \u2014 \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep your plan.\u201d\n\nThe President has another theory. Apparently he thinks that people suddenly discovered his ethnicity:\n\nObama\u2019s election was one of the great markers in the black freedom struggle. In the electoral realm, ironically, the country may be more racially divided than it has been in a generation. Obama lost among white voters in 2012 by a margin greater than any victor in American history. The popular opposition to the Administration comes largely from older whites who feel threatened, underemployed, overlooked, and disdained in a globalized economy and in an increasingly diverse country. Obama\u2019s drop in the polls in 2013 was especially grave among white voters. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s some folks who just really dislike me because they don\u2019t like the idea of a black President,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNow, the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because I\u2019m a black President.\u201d The latter group has been less in evidence of late.\n\nEr \u2026 riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight. In order to buy this nonsense, one would have to believe that millions of people approved of him despite his ethnicity for several years before deciding over the last few months to discover their inner Bull Connor. And that just coincided with Obama\u2019s biggest blunders and the exposure of his dishonesty in selling ObamaCare to the public.\n\nBesides that, conservatives need to shut up about subsidiarity and devolved powers because of the Civil War:\n\n\u201cThere is a historic connection between some of the arguments that we have politically and the history of race in our country, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to disentangle those issues,\u201d he went on. \u201cYou can be somebody who, for very legitimate reasons, worries about the power of the federal government\u2014that it\u2019s distant, that it\u2019s bureaucratic, that it\u2019s not accountable\u2014and as a consequence you think that more power should reside in the hands of state governments. But what\u2019s also true, obviously, is that philosophy is wrapped up in the history of states\u2019 rights in the context of the civil-rights movement and the Civil War and Calhoun. There\u2019s a pretty long history there. And so I think it\u2019s important for progressives not to dismiss out of hand arguments against my Presidency or the Democratic Party or Bill Clinton or anybody just because there\u2019s some overlap between those criticisms and the criticisms that traditionally were directed against those who were trying to bring about greater equality for African-Americans. The flip side is I think it\u2019s important for conservatives to recognize and answer some of the problems that are posed by that history, so that they understand if I am concerned about leaving it up to states to expand Medicaid that it may not simply be because I am this power-hungry guy in Washington who wants to crush states\u2019 rights but, rather, because we are one country and I think it is going to be important for the entire country to make sure that poor folks in Mississippi and not just Massachusetts are healthy.\u201d\n\nThe answer to that is that people in Massachusetts should have their resources go to taking care of people in Massachusetts, not because they don\u2019t care about people in Mississippi, but because they can\u2019t control outcomes there. When states and communities retain control of their own resources, they have much more accountability as to how the resources get used and their effectiveness in resolving the issues. There is room for the federal government in these efforts, but by and large the federal government\u2019s bureaucractic overhead and lack of accountability offers far more opportunity for bloat, misuse, abuse, and waste. The principle of subsidiarity allows more resources to go to the needy rather than bureaucrats, and has the added benefit of cutting lobbyists off at the knees.\n\nBy the way, Obama and the Democrats just usurped the role of states in regulating health insurance. How\u2019s that working out? Who\u2019s been held accountable at the federal level for the failures? Exactly.\n\nThe Civil War has been over for 149 years. Wickard vs Filburn has only been with us half that time, and that\u2019s what led to the massive overgrowth of federal power, not the end of the Civil War. The principle of subsidiarity in American government survived for many decades past that point, and survived well until the Supreme Court rewrote the Constitution.\n\nAt any rate, blaming his sudden drop in popularity after several years of inflated approvals despite the performance of his administration is a demagogic dodge. Obama\u2019s low approval numbers are a direct and rational result of the performance of his administration, from his failed stimulus to the Lie of the Year, from the Russian \u201creset\u201d to Benghazi and his Syria collapse, and especially after the utterly incompetent rollout of a web portal after 42 months of development. This is just whining from the Commander in Chief, and an insult to the same Americans who elected him twice to the office.\n\nBut hey, if you want to distract people from your own failures, blame the people for noticing those, I suppose.\n\nUpdate: My friend Teresa Kopec added this thought:\n\n@EdMorrissey I would say that the \u201cstate\u2019s rights\u201d argument was used post the Civil War into the Jim Crow years which many people still \u2014 Teresa Kopec (@TeresaKopec) January 20, 2014\n\n@EdMorrissey alive lived through and are therefore rightfully suspicious of which I think was his point. \u2014 Teresa Kopec (@TeresaKopec) January 20, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n@EdMorrissey I think people forget things like Loving v Virginia was settled in 1967. (Only year before I was born and I\u2019m only 45!) \u2014 Teresa Kopec (@TeresaKopec) January 20, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a fair point, and I do think some conservatives are too quick to dismiss the fact that government-sponsored racism \u2014 apartheid of a sort, really \u2014 is still within living memory of many Americans. That, however, does not mean that people who believe in smaller government and subsidiarity are proto-racists who want to reimpose Jim Crow, and that\u2019s suddenly Obama\u2019s approval-ratings problem. Both of those are nonsense.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there\u2019s some folks who just really dislike me because they don\u2019t like the idea of a black President.\u201d", "title": "Obama: My low approval ratings might be kind of racist, or something", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/20/obama-my-low-approval-ratings-might-be-kind-of-racist-or-something/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-20T13:01:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-20T15:27:58+00:00"}, "keywords": "approval rating, Barack Obama, Benghazi, ObamaCare, Obamanomics, reset button, Syria,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Obama: My low approval ratings might be kind of racist, or somethingposted at 8:01 am on January 20, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyHow to explain Barack Obama\u2019s dramatically declining approval numbers?\nThe Civil War has been over for 149 years.\nIn the electoral realm, ironically, the country may be more racially divided than it has been in a generation.\nWickard vs Filburn has only been with us half that time, and that\u2019s what led to the massive overgrowth of federal power, not the end of the Civil War.\nObama lost among white voters in 2012 by a margin greater than any victor in American history."}
