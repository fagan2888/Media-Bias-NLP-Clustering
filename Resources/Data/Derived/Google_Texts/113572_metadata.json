Allen, a Republican, joins a crowded primary ballot with a total of nine candidates, including incumbent Democrat Lois Capps, vying to make the top two in the June 3 primary election.\n\nOthers challenging Capps include Orcutt Democrat Paul Coyne, candidate Steve Isakson with no party affiliation, and Republicans Santa Barbara City Councilman Dale Francisco, cattle rancher Justin Fareed, former actor Chris Mitchum, Nipomo businesswoman Alexis Stuart, and publisher Sandra Marshall.\n\nAllen cited the need for real healthcare reform as one of the issues motivating him to run, in a statement from his campaign. In particular, Allen has been critical of Obamacare \u2014 articulating some of the law\u2019s lesser known, but still disastrous effects on patients and health care in a recent Wall Street Journal editorial. \u201cThe law wasn\u2019t written by a blue-ribbon panel of experts, it was done by politicians and special interests in backrooms, and Lois Capps was one of them,\u201d said Allen.\n\nAllen continued that we need new leadership to fix Washington. \u201cCongress needs more people who can bring professional experience to bear on complex issues, rather than career politicians who are out of touch with what people need,\u201d concluded Dr. Allen.\n\nAllen is a former Surgical Director at the Children\u2019s Heart Institute in Houston. He practiced medicine for 29 years and specialized in pediatric cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery, and cardiothoracic vascular surgery. Recognized as a prominent medical researcher, Allen has published over 80 scientific papers. He is a member of Alpha Omega Alpha Medical Honor Society, won research awards at UCLA and the University of Illinois, and the Board of Trustee\u2019s Academic award from the Chicago Medical School. He received the Golden Scalpel Teaching Award and most recently was a visiting professor of surgery at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine.\n\nIn addition to his professional career in health care, Allen and his wife, actress Jaclyn Smith, have founded their own business. Their venture has given him an understanding of the problems often faced by small businesses, he said in the campaign statement. Allen and Jaclyn have two grown children and are active in several non-profit and charitable organizations.\n\nShare this post!", "article_metadata": {"pinterest": "nohover"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e8c\"", "article_summary": "Dr. Brad Allen announces candidacy for CongressPediatric heart surgeon, Dr. Brad Allen announced his candidacy this week for California\u2019s 24th Congressional District.\n\u201cCongress needs more people who can bring professional experience to bear on complex issues, rather than career politicians who are out of touch with what people need,\u201d concluded Dr. Allen.\nHe practiced medicine for 29 years and specialized in pediatric cardiac surgery, thoracic surgery, and cardiothoracic vascular surgery.\nAllen cited the need for real healthcare reform as one of the issues motivating him to run, in a statement from his campaign.\nIn addition to his professional career in health care, Allen and his wife, actress Jaclyn Smith, have founded their own business."}
