Singer and multi-instrumentalist Mica Levi wonderfully scored last year’s Under the Skin (our favorite film of 2014), and now she returns with Micachu & The Shapes for a new album, Good Bad Happy Sad .

Check out the first single,“Oh Baby,” a soulful, drone-scape, that previews the more industrial textures explored on the new album.

Good Bad Happy Sad is due September 11 on Rough Trade. Below is the track listing, tour dates, and all that good stuff. Now excuse me, but I gotta run and pick up my new Clozapine prescription that the doctor said would help with my humor issues. Thanks a lot, OBAMACARE!!
