(The union has not officially negotiated a solution to that macabre possibility, though Mr. Mulgrew, in the webinar, said, \u201cIf that happens, we\u2019ll work it out.\u201d)\n\nAnother fear is about the union\u2019s promise to the city that it could deliver $1.3 billion in health care savings. The union has said that it can achieve those cuts by finding more efficient ways to deliver care and streamline the administration of benefits.\n\nBut if it does not succeed, a mediator could make the cuts, or possibly require teachers to contribute to their premiums, negating one of the union\u2019s most dearly held benefits, free health insurance.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was purposefully vague, or if they aren\u2019t sure themselves how this is going to work out, said Colleen Torres, a fourth-grade teacher at Public School 261 in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, who plans to vote no. \u201cWhen we asked how it would pan out, there were no answers.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nStill others wondered about another feature of the contract, more time for parent-teacher communication, a priority for the new schools chancellor, Carmen Fari\u00f1a. Not only will it cut into their time for helping struggling students, teachers said, but it also presents a steep hurdle for teachers who already struggle to get parents\u2019 attention.\n\nTo be sure, many teachers said their problems with the deal would not keep them from affirming it, and even those who thought they would vote no believed it would ultimately pass. One risk, many said, is that they could do worse, a feeling especially held by younger teachers with fresh memories of having no job at all. Some teachers also said they did not want to alienate a mayor they considered friendly to labor, and did not want the union put to the back of a long line of municipal unions also awaiting new contracts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI would be deeply shocked if it doesn\u2019t pass, even with all the concerns,\u201d said Peter Vilbig, an English teacher at Midwood High School, who plans to vote yes. \u201cFrom a political standpoint, it\u2019s the best deal we can get.\u201d\n\nIf the agreement is approved, the starting salary would rise to $56,709 by the end of the contract, from $45,530, and the top salary would rise to $119,471 from $100,049. The raises would be the first in four years, though many teachers, particularly those starting out, saw their pay go up by thousands of dollars in the intervening years because of so-called step increases to boost their pay based on experience.\n\nUnder the deal, select teachers could earn $7,500 to $20,000 per year in additional pay for taking on leadership roles, such as coaching colleagues in other schools, and teachers accepting assignments at short-staffed schools would be eligible for $5,000 bonuses. The city would also gain more authority to remove some of the 1,200 teachers who make up the so-called absent teacher reserve, a pool of teachers who do not have permanent positions but still draw full salaries.\n\nLeaders of one caucus within the union, the Movement of Rank and File Educators, have decided to vote no on the contract and are hosting informal discussions to urge members to think critically before voting.\n\n\u201cIt seems misleading to me that our union is saying, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry, your health care costs won\u2019t go up,\u2019 when that isn\u2019t something they can promise,\u201d said Megan Moskop, 27, a teacher at Middle School 324 in Washington Heights who is a caucus member.\n\nA rejection of the contract would be an embarrassment to Mr. Mulgrew, who in last Monday\u2019s webinar found himself defending several questions about the retroactive raises, saying that despite what many members thought, the money was not automatically entitled to them and was something he had to fight for.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the city\u2019s money; we work for the city,\u201d Mr. Mulgrew said. \u201cSo, once again, I can\u2019t stress this enough, we work this out through negotiations. Retroactivity is not a God-given right.\u201d\n\nIn the history of the union, a contract has been rejected only once before, in 1995, when teachers objected to a two-year wage freeze at the same time Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said he would support large raises for himself and other city administrators. After some modifications, teachers later approved the contract, buying the argument that the city\u2019s financial condition required the freeze.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Mulgrew said it is a \u201cvery good contract,\u201d and one he is cautiously optimistic will pass. Carefully tending the point that his members should not view the new mayor, or the chancellor, as they did the previous ones, he added: \u201cLittle glimmers of sunshine are starting to shine through as we move forward.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAs for Mr. Rosen, the history teacher in Manhattan, he said teachers believed the contract would ultimately pass. \u201cMost people have some issues with it, but when you have a lot of complicated issues, not all are going to be happy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf no one\u2019s happy, then usually the negotiation\u2019s been a success.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140525220120, "twitter": {"description": "With less than two weeks before ballots are counted, details about
