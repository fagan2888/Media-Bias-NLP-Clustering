Designed in the Rocky Mountains, these water bottles are made without harmful or leaching materials and chemicals, and feature a stainless steel or environmentally-friendly plastic body, eliminating the need for a water-contaminating liner and coating. Plastics found in the lids and tops are 100 percent recyclable. Vacuum seal insulation technology ensures that your water will stay cold, but the bottle wonâ€™t sweat. And a sustainable plant-based attachable filter removes giardia and cryptosporidium, transforming any water into drinking water, the manufacturer says. Available in Aqua Vessel Insulated and Aqua Vessel Ultra Light. From $12.95 to $39.95, at retailers and online.
