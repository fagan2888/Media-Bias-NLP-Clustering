Without the new enrollment period, taxpayers with no insurance would pay a penalty for the entire year.\n\nThe agency said this week that the need for such an enrollment category has become apparent as more California taxpayers are finding out they will have to pay a tax penalty this year because they did not have insurance last year. Covered California hopes the special enrollment category will encourage uninsured residents to become insured this year.\n\n\u201cAt this point, they can\u2019t avoid the penalty. But we can help them minimize it to the maximum extent possible,\u201d said Lizelda Lopez, a Covered California spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that this is the first time that taxes and health care are going hand in hand,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cMany (taxpayers) do not know that the Affordable Care Act includes a penalty if you don\u2019t have insurance.\u201d\n\nThe most recent open enrollment period for an exchange health plan ended on Feb. 15, though people who started the enrollment process before the deadline were given an extension to Feb. 22. The next open enrollment period won\u2019t come around until sometime in the fall.\n\nPeople who do not have coverage in 2015 will be fined on next year\u2019s tax returns. However, they can reduce the penalty by purchasing coverage before April 30.\n\nFor example, those who enroll on April 30 likely will not receive health coverage until the beginning of June. Their tax penalty would likely be for five months, Lopez said.\n\nThis year, taxpayers who chose to go without health insurance in 2014 must pay the penalty, which was $95 per adult and $47.50 per child, or 1 percent of their adjusted growth income \u2014 whichever is higher. Next year, the penalty increases to $325 per adult and $162.50 per child (up to $975 per family) or 2 percent of adjusted income, whichever is higher.\n\nIn addition, there are a number of \u201clife events\u201d that allow people to enroll in health insurance outside the fixed enrollment periods, essentially at any time of the year.\n\nSuch circumstances include those who have had a baby that they want to add to a plan; those who get married and want to add a spouse to a plan; people who moved outside their plan\u2019s coverage area; young people who can no longer be on their parents\u2019 plan because they turned 27; and those who have lost a job and their health insurance.\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Martin Espinoza at 521-5213 or martin.espinoza@pressdemocrat.com.
