Obamacare\u2019s exchanges than analysts initially had predicted, according to a new analysis released last week that suggests the massive health law has not been the economic spoilsport critics had feared.\n\nWhile congressional budget scorekeepers had projected that 21 million people should be using the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges at this point, only about 13 million have actually signed up.\n\nAnd the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health think tank, says that number will top out at just 14.7 million paying customers in the next few years.\n\nSEE ALSO: D.C. appeals court grapples with Congress\u2019 \u2018Obamacare exemption\u2019\n\nThere are a number of reasons why the numbers are lower, but Kaiser said one factor is that employers haven\u2019t dropped the 6 million workers that the Congressional Budget Office had predicted would be cut off their job coverage by now.\n\n\u201cThe economy has been growing and employment has been growing, so most employers still are offering coverage to their employees,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University in Virginia who closely tracks the implementation of health care reform. \u201cIt\u2019s heavily tax-subsidized, and employees still expect it.\u201d\n\nThe White House also has taken notice.\n\nSEE ALSO: Only 15 percent say Obamacare has helped them directly; a quarter see harm: poll\n\n\u201cIn fact our businesses have created jobs every single month since I signed that \u2018job killing\u2019 Obamacare bill,\u201d President Obama said Friday at a meeting with his economic team.\n\nKaiser theorized that incentives for employers to keep offering health benefits \u201care more powerful than expected, at least so far.\u201d Obamacare requires employers with 50 or more workers to provide affordable health coverage or pay fines \u2014 an \u201cemployer mandate\u201d that was twice delayed, but will be fully implemented this year.\n\nObamacare critics say the lower number of people enrolled in the exchanges is a sign of sickness in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCongressional Republicans say premiums are going up in many places \u2014 not down \u2014 while out-of-pocket costs tied to some offerings leave enrollees \u201cfunctionally uninsured.\u201d\n\nAnd critics say the Obama administration has managed to artificially tamp down on losses from employer-based coverage by letting employers keep substandard plans.\n\nMr. Obama is hoping to cement the health law\u2019s gains this year, before he has to turn the reins over to a successor, and is trying to build interest in the exchanges.\n\nInsurers want more people to sign up for the exchanges to spread out the risk, fearing they\u2019ve exposed themselves financially because too many sicker customers snapped up plans early on.\n\nKaiser said if every state attracted the same level of interest in the exchanges as the 10 best-performing states, than enrollment could reach 16.3 million.\n\nThe analysis, released Friday, assumes that about 10 percent wouldn\u2019t pay their premiums, so actual enrollment should land just below 15 million over the next several years.\n\nOne year ago, the CBO forecasted 24 million enrollees for both 2017 and 2018.\n\n\u201cJudging by the experience of the top performing states, there is considerable room for enrollment growth over the next several years,\u201d the Kaiser analysis said. \u201cHowever, even if all states signed people up at the rate of the top 10 states, enrollment would still fall well short of projections by CBO, suggesting that those forecasts may have been unrealistic.\u201d\n\nKaiser said enrollment has been tamped down by an array of factors, beyond the miscalculation about employers.\n\nSome people think plans on the exchanges are still too expensive, while people who made too much money to get subsidized bought plans off the exchange, even though those plans have to comply with Obamacare\u2019s rules, too.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House also let people renew their bare-bones plans through late 2017, after millions of people complained that Obamacare kicked them off non-compliant coverage, despite assurances that \u201cif you like your health plan, you can keep it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Businesses are dumping far fewer of their employees into Obamacare's exchanges
