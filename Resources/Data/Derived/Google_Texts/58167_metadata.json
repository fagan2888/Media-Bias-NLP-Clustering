It closed off its borders to travelers from high-risk Ebola countries. According to International SOS, an international company which helps countries manage travel-related health and security risks, Senegal closed its land borders and restricted air entry back in August:\n\nSenegal on 21 August closed its land border with Guinea, while the country\u2019s sea and air borders will also be closed to vessels and aircraft from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\n\n\nSenegal has banned flights from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\nNow, some people might look at this and say, \u201cBig deal. There was only one case in Senegal in the first place. Keeping one case from transmitting the disease isn\u2019t all that hard.\u201d\n\nMaybe. But it\u2019s a feat that the United States failed to achieve, and the U.S. doesn\u2019t even have to worry, like Senegal does, about having a land border with a country like Guinea, where a full-blown Ebola outbreak was declared back in March.\n\nSenegal had 1 Ebola case, zero transmissions, zero deaths. Their outbreak is over. The U.S., not so much\u2026\n\n\u2014 Abby D. Phillip (@abbydphillip) October 17, 2014\n\nSenegal, however, isn\u2019t the only African country to have successfully battled the Ebola epidemic. If no new cases are identified in Nigeria, WHO plans to declare that country Ebola free on Monday, October 20. And how did Nigeria respond to the epidemic? It also implemented selective air travel bans according to the Wall Street Journal:\n\nNigeria and Ivory Coast on Monday restricted flights from Ebola-infected countries, underscoring fears of the virus in West Africa spreading globally by air travel.\n\n\n\nThe Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority suspended Gambia Bird Airlines Ltd. until it \u201cput in place acceptable and satisfactory measures to contain the spread of Ebola virus,\u201d according to a letter seen by The Wall Street Journal. There have been no recorded cases of Ebola in Gambia, the tiny West African nation where the airline is based. But the airline does fly to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia\u2014the three countries bearing the brunt of an Ebola outbreak. The airline didn\u2019t return calls seeking comment.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 17 Oct 2014 10:10:34 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "The World Health Organization just announced that Senegal has \"ended Ebola transmission\" within its borders.
