In the placebo group, roughly 12 percent of people saw a 50 percent reduction the number of migraines. Overall, the researchers found a \u201ctherapeutic gain\u201d of 26 percent, which roughly means that for every three people that use the device, one person should expect migraine relief half the time.\n\n\u201cCefaly provides an alternative to medication for migraine prevention,\u201d said Christy Foreman, director of the Office of Device Evaluation at the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in an agency news release. \u201cThis may help patients who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing migraines or treating attacks.\u201d\n\nCritically speaking, migraines are closer to seizures than to ordinary headaches. They\u2019re classified as a chronic neurological disorder, finding roots in both the genetic and the environmental. Some 10 percent of the global population suffers from migraines, and they can last anywhere from two hours to three days.\n\nScience hasn\u2019t pinned down the exact mechanism that makes migraines so painful, but they speculate that an abnormally excited cerebral cortex mixed with ill-firing pain neurons makes for the splitting sensation. Cefaly is designed to stimulate the branches of the trigeminal nerve \u2014 suspect number one when it comes to migraines, sitting right behind the forehead. Users place the battery-operated headband on an adhesive electrode for 20 minutes, no more than once a day.\n\nThe 2012 study included migraine sufferers who experienced more than two attacks per month and who hadn\u2019t used medication to treat the migraines for more than three months prior to using Cefaly. While overall migraine prevalence reduced marginally, when subjects did get migraines they were just as bad as without medication. And between the first use and the three-month mark, subjects saw a tiny (but statistically significant) drop in the number of migraine days, from 6.94 to 4.88.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, a separate study of patient satisfaction, including 2,313 Cefaly users, found 53 percent of people were happy with the product\u2019s performance. The most common complaints involved the stimulation\u2019s unpleasant feeling, sleepiness during the treatment, and headaches after treatment.\n\n\"New therapies are needed\u201d in migraine research, wrote Dr. Eishi Asano, associate professor of pediatrics and neurology at Wayne State University, in a related editorial, \u201cAnd further studies of neurostimulation using innovative study designs are warranted to explore the optimum way to create an acceptable evidence base for widespread use of this potentially valuable treatment.\u201d\n\nIn other words, we can do better than 12 people having 50 percent fewer migraines, especially when 700,000,000 people\u2019s mental health is at stake.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cefaly, migraine device, device for migraines, cefaly migraines, cefaly treat migraines, migraine headache relief", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new tiara-shaped device used to treat migraines has received FDA approval despite lukewarm results in a tiny study.", "title": "Device To Treat Migraines Works 50% Of The Time, 25% Of The Time", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cefaly-device-migraines-receives-fda-approval-despite-lackluster-performance-testing-271052", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/12/cefaly.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new tiara-shaped device used to treat migraines has received FDA approval despite lukewarm results in a tiny study.", "title": "Device To Treat Migraines Works 50% Of The Time, 25% Of The Time", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cefaly-device-migraines-receives-fda-approval-despite-lackluster-performance-testing-271052", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/12/cefaly.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/12/cefaly.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-03-12T10:17:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-12T10:17:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new tiara-shaped device used to treat migraines has received FDA approval despite lukewarm results in a tiny study."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02da\"", "article_summary": "Cefaly, a new transcutaneous, tiara-shaped device used to treat migraine headaches received formal approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Wednesday.\nIn the placebo group, roughly 12 percent of people saw a 50 percent reduction the number of migraines.\nWhile overall migraine prevalence reduced marginally, when subjects did get migraines they were just as bad as without medication.\nWhat\u2019s more, a separate study of patient satisfaction, including 2,313 Cefaly users, found 53 percent of people were happy with the product\u2019s performance.\n\u201cThis may help patients who cannot tolerate current migraine medications for preventing migraines or treating attacks.\u201dCritically speaking, migraines are closer to seizures than to ordinary headaches."}
