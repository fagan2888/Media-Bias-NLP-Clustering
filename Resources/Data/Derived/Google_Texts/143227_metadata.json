The Back Nine Grill in Rochester is tacking a 3 percent tax onto all meals as a way of showing customers how the extra $2.50-an-hour increase is affecting the business:\n\nMisspelled 'Coumo' tax hits food tabs \u201cWe spelled his name wrong purposefully. We know that\u201d https://t.co/7ui3qWUj8m pic.twitter.com/af7pvZpmtq \u2014 Rochester D and C (@DandC) March 5, 2016\n\nA different place upstate, the American Diner near Syracuse, has the \"Dictator Obama/NYS Special (King Cuomo)\" breakfast special \u2014 two eggs and some toast for $3.59 plus $27.99 in taxes. A third spot upstate, the restaurant at Belhurst Castle, has also added a surcharge that's 4.75 percent, but it looks considerably more official \u2014 right below the real tax, the receipt claims a \"NYS Labor Surcharge\" is occurring. It also helps that Belhurst Castle's fee spells all of the words correctly, unlike Back Nine's \"Coumo tax.\"\n\nBack Nine's owner says the reason for calling the governor out by name is pretty obvious. \"I guess what I do is blame Cuomo for signing the bill, so that is why I used his name,\" he told the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, before adding: \"We spelled his name wrong purposefully. We know that.\" He says the surcharge brings in $300 to $400 a month, enough to offset a week's wages. The tax's days might be numbered, though, because Aquilina appears to live by the mantra that the customer is always right: \"I do know firsthand that three [customers] refused to pay it, and I said, 'Fine. That's no problem. I'll take it off your bill.'\"\n\n[Democrat & Chronicle]", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Really, a $27.99 tax on two eggs and some toast?", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Grub Street", "description": "Really, a $27.99 tax on two eggs and some toast?", "title": "Restaurants Are Adding \u2018Cuomo Taxes\u2019 to Protest New York\u2019s Wage Increase", "url": "http://www.grubstreet.com/2016/03/cuomo-taxes-restaurants.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/03/07/07-andrew-cuomo.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Really, a $27.99 tax on two eggs and some toast?", "creator": "@clintrainey", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2016/03/07/07-andrew-cuomo.w190.h190.2x.jpg", "title": "Restaurants Are Adding \u2018Cuomo Taxes\u2019 to Protest New York\u2019s Wage Increase", "site": "@grubstreet", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Grub Street", "fb": {"app_id": 206283005644}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/grubstreet/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Grub Street", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "andrew cuomo, new york, surcharges, tipped minimum wage", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/grubstreet", "tag": "andrew cuomo,new york,surcharges,tipped minimum wage", "published_time": "2016-03-07T22:35:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, andrew cuomo, new york, surcharges, tipped minimum wage", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "It also helps that Belhurst Castle's fee spells all of the words correctly, unlike Back Nine's \"Coumo tax.\"\nHe says the surcharge brings in $300 to $400 a month, enough to offset a week's wages.\nBack Nine's owner says the reason for calling the governor out by name is pretty obvious.\n\"I guess what I do is blame Cuomo for signing the bill, so that is why I used his name,\" he told the Rochester Democrat & Chronicle, before adding: \"We spelled his name wrong purposefully.\nA third spot upstate, the restaurant at Belhurst Castle, has also added a surcharge that's 4.75 percent, but it looks considerably more official \u2014 right below the real tax, the receipt claims a \"NYS Labor Surcharge\" is occurring."}
