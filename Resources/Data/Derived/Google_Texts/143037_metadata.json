A long string of snafus, broken promises, frequent instances of backsliding, revisions, and extensions count for nothing: all\u2019s well that ends well. To point out that we weren\u2019t even close to the \u201cend\u201d was said to be sour grapes, an unwillingness to face reality: ObamaCare had succeeded.\n\nWall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan had an interesting response in a column titled \u201cA Catastrophe Like No Other: The president tries to put a good face on ObamaCare.\u201d\n\nShe began with a succinct summary of the \u201cdaily argument\u201d:\n\n\u201cSeven point one million people have signed up!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut six million people lost their coverage and were forced onto the exchanges! That\u2019s no triumph, it\u2019s a manipulation. And how many of the 7.1 million have paid?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say, but 7.1 million is a big number and redeems the program.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it a real number?\u201d\n\n\u201cYour lack of trust betrays a dark and conspiratorial right-wing mindset.\u201d\n\nNoonan could have added a litany of other problems and examples of misdirection in the President\u2019s remarks besides this one we read later in the column:\n\n\u201cWhat the bill declared it would do\u2014insure tens of millions of uninsured Americans\u2014it has not done. There are still tens of millions uninsured Americans. On the other hand, it has terrorized millions who did have insurance and lost it, or who still have insurance and may lose it.\n\nFor instance, the President\u2019s happy-talk presentation ignores that premiums are not going down, for most people, but up\u2026substantially. At the same time deductibles are also increasing\u2026substantially. There is every reason to believe the increases will be even larger next year.\n\nHer larger point is this.\n\n\u201cSupport it or not, you cannot look at ObamaCare and call it anything but a huge, historic mess. It is also utterly unique in the annals of American lawmaking and government administration.\u201d\n\nBut it is crucial to remember that Obama and his administration and his congressional allies knew perfectly well that ObamaCare was a boon to the abortion industry. As NRLC has pointed out, when Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, an array of long-established laws, including the Hyde Amendment, had created a nearly uniform policy that federal programs did not pay for abortion or subsidize health plans that included coverage of abortion, with narrow exceptions. However, key provisions of the 2010 Obamacare health law sharply departed from that longstanding policy. Among other objectionable provisions, the Obamacare law authorized massive federal tax subsidies to assist many millions of Americans to purchase private health plans that will cover abortion on demand.\n\nLikewise, they knew that rationing was built-in to ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cObamacare authorizes Washington bureaucrats to create one uniform, national standard of care that is designed to limit what private citizens are allowed to spend to save their own lives,\u201d explained Burke Balch, J.D., director of the Robert Powell Center for Medical Ethics. \u201cWe are convinced most Americans do not believe that the government should limit the right of Americans to use their own money for health care necessary to save their lives. Yet, that is exactly what Obamacare does.\u201d\n\nBeyond any discussion of the inflated claims for ObamaCare\u2019s enrollment \u201csuccess,\u201d we must never forget that there are components that were deliberately built in to provide massive abortion subsidies and to ensure rationing of health care.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Obama068-300x248.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd601e\"", "article_summary": "However, key provisions of the 2010 Obamacare health law sharply departed from that longstanding policy.\nAmong other objectionable provisions, the Obamacare law authorized massive federal tax subsidies to assist many millions of Americans to purchase private health plans that will cover abortion on demand.\nA long string of snafus, broken promises, frequent instances of backsliding, revisions, and extensions count for nothing: all\u2019s well that ends well.\n\u201cSupport it or not, you cannot look at ObamaCare and call it anything but a huge, historic mess.\nFor instance, the President\u2019s happy-talk presentation ignores that premiums are not going down, for most people, but up\u2026substantially."}
