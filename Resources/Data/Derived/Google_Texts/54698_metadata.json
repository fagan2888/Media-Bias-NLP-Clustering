In that era, girls were expected to become nurses, teachers, or secretaries, or enroll in college to obtain a good old \u201cM-r-s\u201d degree.\n\nShe departed from the expected to establish her business and become her own boss, and this month Wholesale Unlimited Inc. is marking its 50th anniversary.\n\nWith 50 employees, a warehouse and seven stores, including smaller \u201cexpress\u201d locations, the business has come quite a distance since the early days when Betty Nagamoto delivered beef jerky and pepperoni sticks to mom-and-pop retail accounts out of her red 1958 Volkswagen Beetle.\n\nThe company now offers some 450 snack products, said Marc Honma, Betty\u2019s son and company president.\n\nIt is easier to describe flavor categories than types of items, given the huge selection.\n\nFlavors are savory, salty, or spicy with chewy or crunchy textures, and still include beef jerky.\n\nThe sweet snacks also run the gamut of flavors and textures, from crunchy to soft, chewy to melt-in-your-mouth crumbly, and include dark-chocolate-covered almonds in luminous metallic-looking jewel tones.\n\nSome of the snacks are housemade or house-blended, some are obtained through local companies, and others are sourced from overseas.\n\nThe Wholesale Unlimited signature line of Betty\u2019s Best cookies comes in various flavor combinations from best-selling corn flake to white chocolate chip macadamia nut, and all-butter shortbread cookies (or the lighter-in-texture all-butter shorties). Many other flavors make a shopper\u2019s decision-making a bit challenging.\n\nIncreased demand, not just from retailers but from consumers requesting direct sales, meant Betty Honma would outgrow her VW Bug. From a facility in Nuuanu, she moved the company to bigger digs in Mapunapuna, though in a slightly different location from the current Ahua Street shop.\n\nBeyond Oahu\u2019s shores, Wholesale Unlimited products are available around the islands and in many mainland states as well.\n\nWholesale Unlimited offers a range of gift baskets to its individual and corporate clients ranging from $18.95 to $60, but also will prepare smaller amounts of goodies for party favors or centerpieces for a variety of occasions, from fancy to fun and casual.\n\nMarc Honma, 44, grew up with the company and knew only that life. He spent some years on the mainland, returning to Hawaii \u201c11 or 12 years ago,\u201d and became president about two years ago.\n\nNow in charge of the family business, his view of the company, and of his mother, has deepened.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always known she was pretty amazing,\u201d?he said, but added that her hard work, coupled with support from the family, immediate and extended, as well as the employees and customers over the decades, all added up to the business\u2019 success and longevity.\n\n\u201cYou can see it in the loyalty of our employees .and our repeat customers,\u201d?he said. It is the customers the company seeks to thank with its 50th anniversary scratch card promotion. As with all Hawaii contests offering prizes, no purchase is necessary, and cards can be obtained via a stamped, self-addressed envelope. However, customers making purchases can scratch off their cards right at the register and redeem them right away for free products, or redeem the discount during the next visit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great business,\u201d?Honma said. \u201cYou\u2019re just making people happy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Honolulu Star-Advertiser, http://www.staradvertiser.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Changing your whole life path based on a chance conversation likely would be something your parents would counsel you against doing.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Changing your whole life path based on a chance conversation likely would be something your parents would counsel you against doing.", "title": "Snack company marks 50 years of tasty treats", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/6/snack-company-marks-50-years-of-tasty-treats/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/05/f9a50602f2506218780f6a7067001045.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/05/f9a50602f2506218780f6a7067001045.jpg", "description": "Changing your whole life path based on a chance conversation likely would be something your parents would counsel you against doing.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Snack company marks 50 years of tasty treats"}, "Author": "ERIKA ENGLE", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc53\"", "article_summary": "Beyond Oahu\u2019s shores, Wholesale Unlimited products are available around the islands and in many mainland states as well.\nThe company now offers some 450 snack products, said Marc Honma, Betty\u2019s son and company president.\nIncreased demand, not just from retailers but from consumers requesting direct sales, meant Betty Honma would outgrow her VW Bug.\nIt was nevertheless the choice Betty Honma (nee Nagamoto) made in 1965, when she decided against completing her studies toward a teaching degree at the University of Hawaii.\nShe departed from the expected to establish her business and become her own boss, and this month Wholesale Unlimited Inc. is marking its 50th anniversary."}
