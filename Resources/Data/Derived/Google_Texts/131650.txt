Seven former Vineland Developmental Center nurses are charged with criminal neglect over a female resident who required a hand amputation because a broken finger was not properly treated, authorities said on Tuesday.

An indictment issued last month states that the seven failed to "permit any act" to aid the "physical or mental health" of resident Wendy Hart, who is described as a "severely physically and mentally handicapped client."

The indictment also alleges that five of the seven nurses acted to "knowingly destroy, falsify, remove, conceal any writing or record or uttered any writing or record knowing it contained a false statement or information." Their purpose was to "deceive or injure anyone and, or, to conceal wrongdoing," it states.

Seventy-six former Woodbridge Developmental Center residents were moved to the Vineland facility since 2012 prior to the state closing the Rahway Avenue facility on Jan. 1 of this year.

Authorities told The Daily Journal that the alleged mistreatment took place in April 2012 at the state facility, located on East Landis Avenue. The N.J. Department of Human Services oversees the state system of developmental centers.

"A resident had a fractured finger that was not cared for properly and resulted in a hand amputation," department spokeswoman Pam Ronan said.

A June 2012 state Department of Health and Human Services report detailed a review of the incident.

The resident was seen by an orthopedic surgeon on April 27, 2012. The physician reported he had observed "the affected left hand to be tightly wrapped with 4 (to) 5 Ace bandages, with no fingers exposed."

The bandage "was wrapped so tight only God could have removed it," the doctor stated.

When the bandages were removed, the doctor reported, the split was improperly placed and the hand was "mummified" and "clearly gangrenous."

The former workers charged with endangering the welfare of a disabled person/third degree include two registered nurses, Margie Levick and Parul Patel; and five licensed practical nurses, Tracie Pitts-Byrd, Yvonne Downing, Towanda Marrero, Geraldine Rothmaller, and Shiree Cephas.

In addition, one charge of falsifying or tampering with records/fourth degree and one charge of official misconduct/second degree are filed against Pitts-Byrd, Rothmaller, Marrero, Downing, and Cephas. The three-count indictment was issued on April 22.

An arraignment hearing was held Monday in Cumberland County Superior Court before Judge Robert Malestein for some defendants. Malestein issued a bench warrant for one defendant, Cephas, who did not appear as scheduled.

Additional arraignments are scheduled for June 15 for Levick, Patel and Rothmaller.

According to the indictment, the alleged crimes took place during the period April 23-27, 2012.

All seven nurses were fired from the center, along with one practical nurse who is not criminally charged. The firings are under appeal at the N.J. Office of Administrative Law.

The licensed practical nurses are members of American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 2215. The registered nurses are believed to be members of Communications Workers of America Local 1040.

Joe Waite, associate director of AFSCME Local 2215, on Tuesday questioned the filing of the charges so long after the event.

"It's terrible, I understand, and am very sympathetic to the patients," Waite said. "But for criminal charges to be brought three years after the fact and not even have a hearing at the OAL or at licensure to even contest? The system is broken. There is no fairness."

No one could be reached at CWA Local 1040 for comment.

The Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office declined comment on the case.
