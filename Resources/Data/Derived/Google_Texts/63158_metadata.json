He made just 15 tackles, his fewest since 2010. Hatcher turned 33 on July 12. The Washington Redskins have him under contract through 2017. Hatcher\u2019s four-year deal is off to a bad start.\n\n\n\nContinuing the everything-is-sunny-in-Richmond theme, Hatcher said things will be better this season for him and the team. There is little room for the Redskins\u2018 defense to be worse. It tied for 29th in the league in points allowed last season. Washington was also 20th in yards allowed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not even focusing on a bounce-back year, I\u2019m focusing on the being the best Hatcher I can be to help this defense get better,\u201d Hatcher said. \u201cI\u2019m not focused on last year at all. That kills some players, that they just focus on last year. I forgot about last year, there\u2019s nothing I could do about it. I was banged up, there\u2019s nothing I could do about it. My season starts [now].\u201d\n\nHatcher played 13 games last season \u2014 tied for a career low \u2014 but was hurt much of the year and finished it on injured reserve because of a right knee injury. He said he feels great now.\n\nHe also provided warnings. Hatcher pointed out that the Redskins have acquired more talent, yet that didn\u2019t mean much beyond paper. He said he had been on teams with multiple capable pieces, which provided perspective of how the season could play out if that talent isn\u2019t interested in work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely been on a team with this much talent, but we wasn\u2019t very good,\u201d Hatcher said. \u201cWe had the guys to do it, but we didn\u2019t make it happen. Same thing this year. We\u2019ve got every chip in place. So, we\u2019ve just got to come out here, make it come off paper and come alive. It all depends on us.\u201d\n\nHatcher tried to sidestep questions about last season, insisting he was looking forward. Though, he did concede things multiple things went wrong in 2014.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of stuff,\u201d Hatcher said. \u201cNot going to go into detail about it, but it\u2019s just all about the right approach if you want to put together a winning football team.\u201d\n\nHatcher would only go as far to say that they \u201cdidn\u2019t have the right approach\u201d last season.\n\nEntering his 10th season, Hatcher acknowledged he\u2019s no longer a \u201cspring chicken.\u201d During training camp, he\u2019ll manage his body with the consideration that September is much more important than August.\n\nConsidering the amount of defensive line help brought in during the offseason, the Redskins are managing him as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hatcher said things will be better this season for the Redskins, whose defense ranked statistically among the worst teams in the league last year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hatcher said things will be better this season for the Redskins, whose defense ranked statistically among the worst teams in the league last year.", "title": "Jason Hatcher looks forward after saying defense had  \u2018wrong approach\u2019 last season", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/2/jason-hatcher-looks-forward-after-saying-defense-h/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/04/redskins-vikings-footballjpeg-09f80.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/04/redskins-vikings-footballjpeg-09f80.jpg", "description": "Hatcher said things will be better this season for the Redskins, whose defense ranked statistically among the worst teams in the league last year.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Jason Hatcher looks forward after saying defense had  \u2018wrong app"}, "Author": "Todd Dybas", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jason Hatcher, Washington Redskins"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8cd\"", "article_summary": "Entering his 10th season, Hatcher acknowledged he\u2019s no longer a \u201cspring chicken.\u201d During training camp, he\u2019ll manage his body with the consideration that September is much more important than August.\nRICHMOND \u2014 Jason Hatcher\u2019s sack total last season was half of what it was the season before with the Dallas Cowboys.\nThe Washington Redskins have him under contract through 2017.\nContinuing the everything-is-sunny-in-Richmond theme, Hatcher said things will be better this season for him and the team.\nHatcher pointed out that the Redskins have acquired more talent, yet that didn\u2019t mean much beyond paper."}
