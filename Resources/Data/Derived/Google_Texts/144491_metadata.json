The annual total of police killings hasn\u2019t been below 200 since 2004.\n\n\u201cPolice always used to come with guns cocked, but more of them are calmer now and have a better attitude,\u201d said Susan Ramsay, a mother of three in the rough east Kingston neighborhood of Rockfort. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where I prefer seeing the police around here than not seeing them.\u201d\n\nThere seems to be a mix of reasons for the reduction, but perhaps the biggest is a new-found fear among officers of prosecution by an independent agency that investigates allegations against police.\n\nThe Independent Commission of Investigations was created in 2010 after security forces killed 70 civilians in Kingston during an operation to capture a fugitive gang leader. Police had disputed the agency\u2019s authority, but last year the courts ruled it has the right to arrest and charge officers, previously the role of an internal police bureau and public prosecutors.\n\nThe increasingly robust commission is now advancing high-profile investigations against lawmen, including a probe of 11 officers in a single police division in the central parish of Clarendon. After those officers were hit with murder charges earlier this year, a big drop in police-related fatalities followed across Jamaica. There also were two successful convictions this year of police personnel who failed to cooperate with commission investigators.\n\n\u201cA clear message is being sent that all police killings are being rigorously investigated and that the Jamaica Constabulary Force must cooperate fully,\u201d said Robin Guittard, Caribbean campaigner at Amnesty International.\n\nHamish Campbell, a former Scotland Yard commander who is the investigative agency\u2019s deputy commissioner, said reducing fatal shootings has been helped by a significant drop in early morning raids. Heavily armed and often masked officers would roll into slums before dawn on raids that frequently ended in bloodshed, though police went unscathed.\n\n\u201cThe tactic was not tenable and the greater majority of the public recognized it for what it really was,\u201d Campbell said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jamaica sees success in curbing killings by police", "title": "Jamaica sees success in curbing killings by police", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jamaica sees success in curbing killings by police", "title": "Jamaica sees success in curbing killings by police", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/07/jamaica_sees_success_in_curbing_killings_by_police/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/jamaica-police-killings.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jamaica sees success in curbing killings by police", "title": "Jamaica sees success in curbing killings by police", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/jamaica-police-killings.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "DAVID McFADDEN", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "After those officers were hit with murder charges earlier this year, a big drop in police-related fatalities followed across Jamaica.\n\u201cA clear message is being sent that all police killings are being rigorously investigated and that the Jamaica Constabulary Force must cooperate fully,\u201d said Robin Guittard, Caribbean campaigner at Amnesty International.\n\u201cThe tactic was not tenable and the greater majority of the public recognized it for what it really was,\u201d Campbell said.\nThe annual total of police killings hasn\u2019t been below 200 since 2004.\nHeavily armed and often masked officers would roll into slums before dawn on raids that frequently ended in bloodshed, though police went unscathed."}
