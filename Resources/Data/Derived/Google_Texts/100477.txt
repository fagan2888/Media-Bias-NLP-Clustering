Many polls show that 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney would outperform Democrat Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head matchup, but conservative pundit Charles Krauthammer thinks a lot of that support is buyer's remorse."The pro-Romney vote is more of an anti-Obama vote â€“ like I wish I had a second shot at that one, and how did I get it so wrong? I don't think it really is an endorsement of him," Krauthammer said Monday on Fox News Channel's "Special Report."Krauthammer did say he thinks Romney would make a good president, but added, "I don't think he'd be any stronger a candidate this time around [in 2016] than he was in 2012."
