While these criticisms are ostensibly directed at Barack Obama\u2019s worldview, as Mr. Giuliani later said, they appear to reflect \u2014 or exploit \u2014 the tendency to associate being American with being white.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s loyalty to the United States has been questioned in this way since he reached the national stage. Just as people wrongly doubted that the president was born here, many prominent figures in national politics have smeared him as disloyal, often by suggesting that he is on the side of Islamic extremists (which plays on the related myth that he is Muslim rather than Christian).\n\nIn 2006, the commentator Debbie Schlussel pointed to his middle name, Hussein, noted that Mr. Obama\u2019s father was a Muslim and asked, \u201cWhere will his loyalties be?\u201d As the 2008 presidential campaign heated up, the Illinois senator was described, for instance, as a possible \u201cManchurian candidate\u201d (Ann Coulter) or \u201csleeper agent\u201d who might not be \u201cpro-American\u201d (Dick Morris).\n\nPhoto\n\nSuggestions of disloyalty continued after Mr. Obama entered the White House. As conservative pundits continued making hyperbolic accusations, top Republican officials began to chime in more aggressively with similar rhetoric. The president was accused, among other things, of \u201cundermining this country\u2019s national defense on purpose\u201d (Representative John Fleming of Louisiana) and \u201csympathizing with attackers\u201d of the American embassy in Egypt (the Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus). Others raised loaded questions about Mr. Obama\u2019s allegiances, saying, \u201cI just don\u2019t know whose side he\u2019s on\u201d (Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma), or \u201cI can\u2019t tell,\u201d when asked if Mr. Obama \u201cactually switched sides in the war on terror\u201d (former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld).\n\nWhatever his intentions, Mr. Giuliani\u2019s statement reflects the ease with which people dissociate Mr. Obama and other African-Americans with American identity, especially those who don\u2019t like him. A 2005 study examined this pattern using the Implicit Association Test, which measures the associations between concepts using differences in response timing during a categorization task. People tend to respond faster when categorizing paired stimuli that are congruent with their implicit associations (for instance, \u201cthin people\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d versus \u201cfat people\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d) than those that are incongruent (the opposite pairings). In the study in question, the authors found response timing patterns that suggested that African-Americans as a group are \u201cless associated with the national category \u2018American\u2019 than are white Americans\u201d relative to the category \u201cforeign\u201d \u2014 a pattern that holds for other nonwhite groups such as Asian-Americans and Latinos.\n\nThese tendencies seem to translate into perceptions of Mr. Obama as being less American among his opponents. A study conducted during the 2008 election reported that supporters of both Mr. Obama and John McCain tended to implicitly associate their preferred candidate more closely with America, but these tendencies were especially pronounced among Republicans, who were \u201cfar more likely to dissociate Obama from the nation \u2026 than Democrats did with McCain.\u201d The pattern of associating Mr. Obama with America less than political counterparts like Mr. McCain and Hillary Clinton was found in another study to be stronger when Mr. Obama\u2019s race was highlighted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nGiven how closely bound up questions of American identity are with race, the debate that Mr. Giuliani revived, which is now drawing in Republican presidential contenders and pundits, threatens to make the 2016 campaign another racially fraught episode in the Obama presidency.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150221100745, "twitter": {"description": "Rudolph Giuliani\u2019s comments this week weren\u2019t a new tactic.
