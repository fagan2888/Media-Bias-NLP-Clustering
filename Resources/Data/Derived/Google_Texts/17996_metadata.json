He is autistic, severely autistic. Restaurants, doctors offices, dentist offices, have told us don\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\nFor 18 years Justin lived with his family. But he was a danger to himself and others.\n\n\u201cIt was the hardest thing we ever had to do, but we had to, to save his life,\u201d said Wallace.\n\nThey moved Justin into the Austin State Supported Living Center 12 years ago.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s away from traffic, he\u2019s away from fireworks, all the things that can set him off.\u201d\n\nBut soon, Justin and dozens more won\u2019t be calling the facility home anymore.\n\nFamilies and guardians received a letter from the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services (DADS) explaining the center\u2019s decision to reduce the number of residents. The center\u2019s administrator cites a long struggle to recruit and retain staff in Austin.\n\nNew admissions were halted in March of 2012, bringing the average number of residents from 344 to 274. The overall goal is to reduce the facility\u2019s census to 150-160 residents.\n\nThe home closures are happening in two stages. The first stage will impact about 72 residents, with a target date of Dec. 1, 2014. The second stage will impact about 50 more residents, with a target day of June 2015.\n\n\u201cIf he could be in the community, he\u2019d be right here at my house,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cHe can\u2019t be in the community, because the community really doesn\u2019t want him there. That\u2019s what people don\u2019t like to talk about.\u201d\n\nHe wishes there had been a public hearing or discussion on the issue.\n\n\u201cFact is the state has made a commitment to take care of those who can\u2019t take care of themselves,\u201d Wallace added. \u201cCome up with more money if you have to.\u201d\n\nHe says while there\u2019s no perfect solution to the problem, there has to be one better than this.\n\nAdministrators say the decision didn\u2019t come lightly, but believe getting the facility to a more manageable size is in the best interest of staff and residents. They said it has been difficult to find enough workers, meaning current employees racked up more than 187,000 hours of overtime so far this fiscal year. They say that equates to $2.5 million in overtime paid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Austin State Supported Living Center (AuSSLC) is closing several homes on its campus, which will eventually impact more than 100 of its \u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488539168", "og": {"site_name": "KXAN.com", "description": "The Austin State Supported Living Center (AuSSLC) is closing several homes on its campus, which will eventually impact more than 100 of its residents.", "title": "State supported living center closure forces dozens out", "url": "http://kxan.com/2014/06/11/state-supported-living-centers-shutting-down-impacting-dozens/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvkxan.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/ausslc.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Austin State Supported Living Center (AuSSLC) is closing several homes on its campus, which will eventually impact more than 100 of its residents.", "title": "State supported living center closure forces dozens out", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkxan.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/ausslc.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@KXAN_News", "site": "@kxan_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "msapplication-tooltip": "Austin News & Weather - Austin Texas, Round Rock, TX", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.kxan", "fb": {"app_id": 1700724863485098, "pages": 46541548036}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "KXAN.com", "google-site-verification": "TOUaqAtzSxABm640WZ3y3-lSxo9q4IYLt49vxevsvHI", "keywords": "Austin, Health, Local, Mobile, News, Top Video,,Amanda Brandeis", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KXANnews", "published_time": "2014-06-11T15:24:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-12T04:06:10+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kxan.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1f076c9b4fe849f39a5e507e2b3d4de3?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5a8\"", "article_summary": "The Austin State Supported Living Center.\nThey moved Justin into the Austin State Supported Living Center 12 years ago.\nRelated Coverage Oft-criticized state home to move residentsAUSTIN (KXAN) \u2014 The Austin State Supported Living Center (AuSSLC) is closing several homes on its campus, which will eventually impact more than 100 of its residents.\n\u201cFact is the state has made a commitment to take care of those who can\u2019t take care of themselves,\u201d Wallace added.\nStephen Wallace is a father of one of the residents and says the news is very disappointing."}
