SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) â€” A large bobcat was on the prowl for birdies at the Waste Management Phoenix Open.

The bobcat sauntered between the first and second holes Friday afternoon, seemingly comfortable not far from the fans who packed the grounds on TPC Scottsdale's Stadium Course.

There was plenty of other wildlife on hand, too. A crane patrolled the lake on the 17th and 18th holes and a heron flew away when Smylie Kaufman hit a shot from the water on 17.

An estimated crowd of 160,415 attended the tournament Friday, breaking the second-round record of 123,674 set in 2014.
