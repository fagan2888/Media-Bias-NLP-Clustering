Police are investigating after two men with gunshot wounds were dropped off at a Wichita hospital.

Officers were called around 4:20 Saturday morning to Wesley Medical Center at 550 North Hillside. One man had suffered a gunshot wound to the right thigh; the other had been shot in the groin.

Sgt. Brian Sigman said the two men have been uncooperative with police. They declined to say where the shooting happened and who dropped them off at the hospital.

The two men have since been treated and released.

Anyone with information is asked to call Wichita police.
