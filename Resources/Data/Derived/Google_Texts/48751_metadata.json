Most Republicans, including virtually all the other GOP presidential contenders during their careers, signed it.\n\nThe written pledge to never raise the taxes of Americans makes a promise real, Norquist believes, although some who signed it in good faith have later chided Norquist for locking them into an ironclad commitment they never intended.\n\nRelated: Grover Norquist: No New Taxes, No Time, No Way\n\nJeb Bush, however, did not sign the Norquist pledge while governor of Florida (1999-2007), and neither did his father and brother during their political careers. And on Saturday Bush\u2019s spokesperson shook things up a bit when she said Jeb Bush has no intention of signing the Norquist pledge or any other tax pledge if he seeks the 2016 GOP nomination.\n\n\u201cIf Gov. Bush decides to move forward, he will not sign any pledges circulated by lobbying groups,\u201d Kristy M. Campbell told ABC News.\n\nTo which Norquist retorted on Twitter, \u201cReally? Jeb Bush thinks all American taxpayers (to whom the pledge is written) are a \u2018lobbying group\u2019?\u201d\n\nThis could be intra-party squabbling except for one sticking point. President George H.W. Bush famously said, \u201cRead my lips. No new taxes,\u201d at the Republican National Convention in 1988 when he accepted the GOP nomination. That pronouncement publicly cemented his platform and helped him win the White House.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush's Success at CPAC: More Than Convincing\n\nBut it later came back to haunt him.\n\nIn 1990 during budget negotiations with the Democratic-controlled Congress to reduce the national deficit, Bush compromised as part of the deal and ultimately broke his tax pledge, which was gleefully exploited by opponents. Bush lost his reelection bid in 1992 to Bill Clinton.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s spokesperson said that during his years as Florida governor he did not raise taxes. He cut them each year for a total of over $19 billion in tax relief. \u201cHe does not support raising taxes and believes cutting taxes and reforming the tax code will lead to greater economic growth and more prosperity for Americans,\u201d Campbell told ABC News.\n\nNorquist rejected that argument on Twitter: \u201cThose who refuse to sign, raise taxes when pushed hard enough by spenders.\u201d\n\nHe added this general comment for good measure: \u201cMemo to Politicians waffling on taxes: A tax hike is a pay cut for the American people. A tax cut is a pay hike for the American people.\u201d\n\nRelated: At CPAC, Softball Questions for GOP 2016 Frontrunners\n\nMaybe Norquist, who has never been elected to any office, is making something of nothing. Maybe he\u2019s trying to revive his pledge, puff himself up or grab a little free post-CPAC publicity. Maybe this is his way of judging the crowded GOP field.\n\nOne thing is for sure: Norquist at CPAC took time during a media interview to deliver some serious advice for the presumptive candidate. If you really want to make progress toward 2016, reintroduce yourself to Americans, Norquist advised Jeb. You have name recognition, but it is both a positive and a negative. So tell people where you want to go and what you want to do. Why? You\u2019re \u201cout of shape\u201d as a candidate, haven\u2019t held elective office in nearly 10 years and most Americans don\u2019t have a clue what you did in Florida as governor.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Jeb Bush and Grover Norquist are having a spat over taxes.", "title": "Why Jeb Bush Won\u2019t Follow the Herd on Taxes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/01/Why-Jeb-Bush-Won-t-Follow-Herd-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-bush-jeb_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/01/Why-Jeb-Bush-Won-t-Follow-Herd-Taxes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-politics-bush-jeb_1.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Jeb Bush and Grover Norquist are having a spat over taxes.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd3b7\"", "article_summary": "Jeb Bush and Grover Norquist are having a spat over taxes.\nJeb Bush thinks all American taxpayers (to whom the pledge is written) are a \u2018lobbying group\u2019?\u201dThis could be intra-party squabbling except for one sticking point.\nAnd on Saturday Bush\u2019s spokesperson shook things up a bit when she said Jeb Bush has no intention of signing the Norquist pledge or any other tax pledge if he seeks the 2016 GOP nomination.\nJeb Bush\u2019s spokesperson said that during his years as Florida governor he did not raise taxes.\nRelated: Grover Norquist: No New Taxes, No Time, No WayJeb Bush, however, did not sign the Norquist pledge while governor of Florida (1999-2007), and neither did his father and brother during their political careers."}
