LEBANON, Pa., Oct. 25 (UPI) -- Murry's Inc. has issued a recall of 31,689 pounds of gluten-free breaded chicken products that may be contaminated with staphylococcal enterotoxin.

The recall includes 12-ounce boxes of Bell & Evans Gluten Free Breaded Chicken Breast Nuggets and 10.5-ounce boxes of Bell & Evans Gluten Free Breaded Chicken Breast, both with a best-by date of Aug. 9, 2015.

Both items have a P-516 establishment number inside the U.S. Department of Agriculture mark of inspection.
