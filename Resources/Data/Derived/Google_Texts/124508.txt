Medical Imaging Biz Schryver Expands

PE firm Revelstoke Capital backs Schryver, which previously acquired Quality Mobile X-Ray

Private equity-backed Schryver Medical Sales and Marketing LLC has acquired Main Street Clinical Laboratory Inc. and On-Site Imaging Solutions Inc.

Southaven, Mississippi-based Main Street provides testing services to physicians and other health care providers. On-Site, headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas, offers mobile-imaging services to nursing homes, hospice centers, correctional facilities and home health patients. Terms of the transactions were not disclosed.

Schryver, headquartered in Denver, provides mobile-imaging diagnostics, clinical-laboratory services, oxygen therapy and medical-equipment rental services. The latest acquisitions help Schryver to expand in the southeast U.S. The business previously acquired Nashville-based Quality Mobile X-Ray in January.

Schryver is backed by Denver private equity firm Revelstoke Capital Partners. The firm has made a handful of other acquisitions recently, picking up rehab center Crossroads Holding LLC in January, partnering with Yukon Partners for an investment in Encore Rehabilitation Services, also in January, and purchasing training company Career Step LLC in February. Revelstoke also sold Accelecare Wound Centers to Healogics in March.

Perkins Coie LLP and Winston & Strawn LLP provided legal advice to Schryver for the acquisitions. Hyden Miron & Foster PLLC was On-Site's legal counsel.

The deal comes at a time when health care technology demands dealmaker attention. The Affordable Care Act has increased the amount of patients in the U.S. health care system, and technology provides a way for doctors and hospitals to pare down costs.
