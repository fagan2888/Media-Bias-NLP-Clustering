I believed I could keep my health insurance plan. I feel lied to.\u201d\n\nThat all seems like a modest price to pay for the incredibly tiny number of previously uninsured people who are flocking to ObamaCare\u2019s broken websites to sign up for insurance coverage, or at least put something in the online shopping cart, or maybe click on a couple of buttons until they see an error message. (If the true number of ObamaCare enrolles is about 2.6 million people, as industry experts suspect, and only 20 percent of them were previously uninsured, ObamaCare is one of history\u2019s worst examples of return on investment for the American people.)\n\nBut how much worse does \u201cdoc shock\u201d get when entire hospitals are closing? The Daily Caller reports \u201cthe fourth Georgia hospital in two years is closing its doors due to severe financial difficulties caused by ObamaCare\u2019s payment cuts for emergency services.\u201d\n\nThe Lower Oconee Community Hospital is, for now, a critical access hospital in southeastern Georgia that holds 25 beds. The hospital is suffering from serious cash-flow problems, largely due to the area\u2019s 23 percent uninsured population, and hopes to reopen as \u201csome kind of urgent care center,\u201d CEO Karen O\u2019Neal said. Many hospitals in the 25 states that rejected the Medicaid expansion are facing similar financial problems. Liberal administration ally Think Progress has already faulted Georgia for not expanding Medicaid as Obamacare envisioned. But the reality is more complicated. The federal government has historically made payments to hospitals to cover the cost of uninsured patients seeking free medical care in emergency rooms, as federal law mandates that hospitals must care for all patients regardless of their ability to pay.\n\nObamaCare was falsely billed as the cure for such \u201ccost shifting,\u201d when in reality it\u2019s increasing the burden on emergency rooms. Forcing the Affordable Care Act through Congress required states to be given the option of rejecting the Medicaid expansion that would theoretically have replaced these emergency room visits with a certified welfare plan. Now we\u2019ve got the worst of both worlds. ObamaCare is such a disaster that the old, sloppy approach of letting the indigent use hospitals as free clinics, with the cost offset by government support and higher insurance premiums, might actually have been more efficient. It\u2019s a cure that\u2019s worse than the disease, a \u201creform\u201d more expensive and chaotic than the problems it was supposed to solve.\n\nIf you like your plan, you can\u2019t keep your plan. If you like your doctor, you can\u2019t keep your doctor. You\u2019re most likely not going to save money on health insurance, especially if you try to use your \u201cbenefits\u201d and run into those massive out-of-pocket costs. And the number of uninsured Americans is scarcely going to change at all.\n\nUpdate: CBS News in Minnesota captures an encounter between ObamaCare perpetrators and a skeptical citizen who remembers all those sweaty promises of lower insurance premiums:\n\nThe lawmakers fielded other questions as well, talking debt and immigration reform, but it was the question about the struggling health care law that everyone in the audience wanted to see answered, and two out of the three Democrats on the dais seemed hesitant to tackle. The question: \u201cI thought the Affordable Care Act would save $2500 per family. What happened?\u201d After Sen. Klobuchar and Rep. Walz looked at each other, laughter broke out in the room. Rep. Peterson quickly picked up the microphone to say, \u201cI voted \u2018no\u2019, so I\u2019ll let these guys handle that,\u201d to the applause of the crowd. Both Klobuchar and Walz said they were aware of the problems, and wanted to find ways to fix it. Walz says, \u201cThis health discussion has got to be broader, it\u2019s got to point out where there are weaknesses and failures, it\u2019s got to make sure we\u2019re not leaving people behind or distorting the system. But don\u2019t pretend there was some type of safe harbor before this where everything was just peachy keen.\u201d\n\nOf course, none of these ObamaCare scam artists said anything about \u201cweaknesses and failures\u201d when they were shoving this crap bill down America\u2019s throat. They were the ones who spoke of peachy keenness.\n\nThey didn\u2019t say, \u201cSure, millions of people will lose their insurance coverage, but others will benefit, so the suffering will all be worthwhile\u201d or \u201cYes, many of you will pay far more for coverage, especially if you\u2019re the sort of healthy individual who would normally expect to pay less under a rational insurance system, but it\u2019s important to redistribute your wealth in the name of social justice.\u201d They explicitly denied those possibilities and promised nobody would lose coverage, nobody would lose their doctor, most people would pay less, and the whole thing wouldn\u2019t cost taxpayers a nickel.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to love this final, desperate fallback position from the ObamaCare scam squad: we didn\u2019t have utopia before, so all the failures of our scheme are justified. The choice is between the horrific failure of the Affordable Care Act and a safe harbor in the land of Oz, and since there aren\u2019t any boats leaving for Oz, we\u2019ll just have to embrace teh suck and live with the ACA.\n\nHere\u2019s another \u201cdoc shock\u201d story from an irrelevant anecdote who lives in California, courtesy of CBS News:\n\nJulia Turner is surprised that she even has to search for a doctor. When she signed up for a policy through Covered California late last year, her long-time physician was listed as participating in her Blue Shield plan. It turned out; however, that he is not accepting patients with her Blue Shield policy, purchased on the Covered California exchange. When Turner called around to find someone else to treat her, she got more frustration. \u201cThe only doctors accepting new patients are urgent care clinics,\u201d Turner told KPIX 5 ConsumerWatch. None of the doctors are located in the city in which she lives. Instead, Turner said, \u201cThey are in areas of East Oakland that have a lot of violence.\u201d\n\nWonderful. You don\u2019t mind driving a hundred miles, and taking your life into your hands, for the greater glory of Barack Obama\u2019s \u201csignature achievement,\u201d right, citizen?\n\nRise by the anecdote, fall by the anecdote. President Obama is especially fond of marching a dozen people on stage, proclaiming them to be sainted ObamaCare \u201cwinners,\u201d and claiming their happiness with the system (which occasionally turns out to be embarrassingly transitory) justify limitless expense, and the dissolution of American constitutional liberty. Now let\u2019s confront every Democrat running for re-election with real live human stories of ObamaCare disaster, and watch the fun as they turn up their noses at these kulaks and explain how personalized stories suddenly don\u2019t matter a bit.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "A \"reform\" far worse than any of the problems it was supposed to solve.", "title": "More fun with ObamaCare: lost drugs, closed hospitals, and agonizing pain | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hospital_closed-480x305.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/02/19/more-fun-with-obamacare-lost-drugs-closed-hospitals-and-agonizing-pain/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "A \"reform\" far worse than any of the problems it was supposed to solve.", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hospital_closed-480x305.jpg", "description": "A \"reform\" far worse than any of the problems it was supposed to solve.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2684\"", "article_summary": "I believed I could keep my health insurance plan.\n(If the true number of ObamaCare enrolles is about 2.6 million people, as industry experts suspect, and only 20 percent of them were previously uninsured, ObamaCare is one of history\u2019s worst examples of return on investment for the American people.)\nObamaCare was falsely billed as the cure for such \u201ccost shifting,\u201d when in reality it\u2019s increasing the burden on emergency rooms.\nMany hospitals in the 25 states that rejected the Medicaid expansion are facing similar financial problems.\nLiberal administration ally Think Progress has already faulted Georgia for not expanding Medicaid as Obamacare envisioned."}
