The Broncos will visit with their first free-agent player of the coach Gary Kubiak era.

The free agent is former Kubiak player James Casey, a tight end and fullback who was released last week by the Philadelphia Eagles. Casey will meet with the Broncos on Thursday, according to an NFL source.

Casey, 30, also is scheduled to visit with the Arizona Cardinals this week, according to a Phoenix radio station.

Kubiak was the Houston Texans’ coach when he selected Casey from Rice in the fifth round of the 2009 draft. The 6-foot-3, 240-pound Casey played four seasons for Kubiak in Houston, where he was a blocker and special-teams player who occasionally caught a pass.

A free agent in 2013, Casey signed a three-year, $14.6 million deal with Philadelphia. Not bad for a guy who now has 72 career catches and two rushing attempts in six seasons.

It’s possible the Broncos would use Casey primarily as a fullback and special-teams player. The Broncos have not employed a fullback in recent years, but Kubiak said last week during the NFL scouting combine in Indianapolis that he wants one for his offensive system.
