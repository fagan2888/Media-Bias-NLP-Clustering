Including his roster bonus, Roethlisberger will take in more than $35 million this year from the Steelers, making him the top-paid player for 2015, according to Spotrac.com.\n\nDespite being the reigning Super Bowl champion, Brady ranks 40th.

Last year, the average salary in the league was just over $2 million. The average salary for the top 100 players in the NFL is $11.6 million, 29 percent less than that of the top MLB players and 13 percent less than NBA\u2019s best.\n\nThe lowest paid players in the NFL made a relatively meager $420,000, reports Forbes. That\u2019s less than one percent of the $44 million NFL President Roger Goodell takes home, and reflects a salary cap system that has teams investing the bulk of their money into their top few players.\n\nStill, even the lowest-paid NFL players are making far more money than the typical American worker, although their careers are far shorter. The average NFL career lasts an average of just 3.5 years, with total earnings of $6.7 million, according to USA Today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SEE THE 15 HIGHEST PAID NFL PLAYERS FOR 2015", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The New England Patriots may have defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first game o", "title": "The 15 Highest Paid NFL Players for 2015", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/13/15-Highest-Paid-NFL-Players-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/maxresdefault.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/13/15-Highest-Paid-NFL-Players-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/maxresdefault.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The New England Patriots may have defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first game o", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "CLICK HERE TO SEE THE 15 HIGHEST PAID NFL PLAYERS FOR 2015\nCLICK HERE TO SEE THE 15 HIGHEST PAID NFL PLAYERSNot all NFL players make money as much money as the sport\u2019s stars, of course.\nThe lowest paid players in the NFL made a relatively meager $420,000, reports Forbes.\nStill, even the lowest-paid NFL players are making far more money than the typical American worker, although their careers are far shorter.\nThe average NFL career lasts an average of just 3.5 years, with total earnings of $6.7 million, according to USA Today."}
