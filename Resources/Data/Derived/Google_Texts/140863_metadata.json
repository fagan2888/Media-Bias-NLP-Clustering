Schofield v. Loureiro Engineering Associates, Inc., 2015 Conn. Super. LEXIS 1262 (Super. Ct., D. Waterbury, Docket No. CV 146024702S, May 22, 2015).\n\nPlaintiff Ronald Schofield began work for the Company on April 1, 2014. A little over two weeks later he was directed to take a drug test. (The decision is silent as to reason for the test.) The test relied on hair analysis. Schofield was not informed he would be subject to drug testing after he was employed. As a result of the drug testing, he was terminated.\n\nSchofield brought suit against the Company alleging violations of the state drug testing laws. He also claimed, alternatively, that he was fired in violation of public policy.\n\nThe employer moved to strike each of Schofield\u2019s claims based on violations of statutory provisions. The court agreed with the employer, based on \u201ca plain reading of the statutes,\u201d and held that \u201cthe drug testing statutes in question apply only to urinalysis testing and do not cover an employee who is subjected to other forms of drug testing.\u201d The statute relied upon by Schofield in his first count, Connecticut General Statutes \u00a731-51u, prohibits employers from determining an employee\u2019s eligibility for various personnel actions (including adverse actions) solely on the basis of a positive drug test result unless the employer has given the employee a \u201curinalysis drug test,\u201d and a positive result was confirmed in a second, independent \u201curinalysis drug test,\u201d as specified in the statute. The statute relied on by Schofield in his second count, \u00a731-51v, prohibits employers from requiring prospective employees from being required to submit to a \u201curinalysis drug test\u201d unless the prospective employer is informed in writing at the time of application of the employer\u2019s intent to conduct such a drug test, among other things. Schofield\u2019s third count relied on \u00a731-51x, which provides that no employer may require an employee to submit to a \u201curinalysis drug test\u201d unless the employer has reasonable suspicion that the employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol, as defined in the law. The court relied on a 2008 Superior Court decision that had reached the same conclusion as to \u00a731-51x \u2013 specifically, that saliva testing, hair follicle testing, or any other valid non-urinalysis drug tests did not violate the statute. The court in Schofield found no difficulty in extending the rationale to \u00a7\u00a731-51u and 31-51v.\n\nThe court, nevertheless, found \u201cthe logic of plaintiff\u2019s position is readily understood and the seemingly irrational inconsistency which flows from disparate protections [of the statutes] made evident in this opinion are undeniable,\u201d but concluded that any remedy lies with the legislature, not the courts. Having stricken plaintiff\u2019s statutory claims, the court permitted plaintiff to plead a common-law claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Connecticut drug testing laws apply only to urinalysis and not to drug test using hair specimens which led to employee\u2019s termination", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Connecticut&amp;rsquo;s drug testing laws apply only to urinalysis drug tests and not to a drug test using hair specimens which led to an employee&amp;rsquo;s termination, a Connecticut trial court has held.&amp;", "title": "Connecticut Drug Testing Statutes Do Not Apply To Hair Tests, Court Holds", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/connecticut-drug-testing-statutes-do-not-apply-to-hair-tests-court-holds", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1123/Chemicals%20in%20a%20Beaker_2.jpg?itok=KGY_HnOp", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Connecticut, Follicle Test, Urinalysis, Workplace Drug Screening, Schofield v.
