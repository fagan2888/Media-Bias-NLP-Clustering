Though perhaps in response to that conundrum, \"the hospice and palliative care movement keeps gaining momentum.\"\n\nHere are four trends that drive this gain in momentum, according to Morrison:\n\nGreater care coordination. An increased focus on the continuum of care on the part of payers and providers will power a greater interest in partnership with palliative care and hospice organizations, Morrison says, noting the example of managed care organizations operated by Medicare and Medicaid. Morrison also predicts that more hospice organizations will consolidate into larger entities.\n\nValue-based shift. As incentives increase for health systems to focus on patient outcomes rather than patient volume, expect to see more large healthcare organizations develop \"integrated palliative and hospice care services,\" Morrison writes. Indeed, research has already indicated that training staff in palliative care measures can help improve patient outcomes, FierceHealthcare has reported, which should be of interest to organizations eager to adapt to the federal government's transition to value-based payment models.\n\nExpanded hospice care scope. As it evolves, hospice care will serve a much wider patient base than its original focus of terminal cancer patients, Morrison says, fueled in part by an increased national policy focus on Alzheimer's and dementia. Along similar lines, the scope of palliative care also has expanded to include not just dying patients but those managing chronic conditions in all age groups.\n\nIncreased number of organizations. The most recent data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization indicates that the number of hospice organizations as well as the number of patients they serve have increased from 2009 to 2013, Morrison says. And a future increase in the supply of such care options may be aided by organizations like the Hospice and Palliative Care Nurses Association, which has spearheaded the effort to train more healthcare professionals to care for patients with serious illnesses, according to FierceHealthcare.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPalliative care manages chronic conditions and provides comfort\n\nDying in America: Healthcare leaders must bolster end-of-life care discussions, efforts\n\nPalliative care training can improve patient outcomes\n\nEnd-of-life care, planning fails patients\n\nCampaign promotes education, credentialing for hospice and palliative care\n\nDocs who would use hospice themselves more likely to talk end-of-life care with patients", "article_metadata": {"description": "A recent study\u00a0took the healthcare industry to task\u00a0for failing to provide adequate end-of-life planning and reduce patient suffering, yet there may be hope amid the gloom thanks to an increased emphasis on hospice and\u00a0palliative care, futurist Ian Morrison, Ph.D., writes in an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0for\u00a0Hospitals & Health", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A recent study\u00a0took the healthcare industry to task\u00a0for failing to provide adequate end-of-life planning and reduce patient suffering, yet there may be hope amid the gloom thanks to an increased emphasis on hospice and\u00a0palliative care, futurist Ian Morrison, Ph.D., writes in an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0for\u00a0Hospitals & Health", "title": "4 reasons hospice, palliative care gaining momentum", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/4-reasons-hospice-and-palliative-care-gaining-momentum/2015-03-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,end-of-life care,Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association,Hospice Care,Hospitals & Health Networks Daily,Ian Morrison,palliative care,Patient Care & Outcomes,value-based care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe018e\"", "article_summary": "Though perhaps in response to that conundrum, \"the hospice and palliative care movement keeps gaining momentum.\"\nAn increased focus on the continuum of care on the part of payers and providers will power a greater interest in partnership with palliative care and hospice organizations, Morrison says, noting the example of managed care organizations operated by Medicare and Medicaid.\nExpanded hospice care scope.\nAlong similar lines, the scope of palliative care also has expanded to include not just dying patients but those managing chronic conditions in all age groups.\nAs incentives increase for health systems to focus on patient outcomes rather than patient volume, expect to see more large healthcare organizations develop \"integrated palliative and hospice care services,\" Morrison writes."}
