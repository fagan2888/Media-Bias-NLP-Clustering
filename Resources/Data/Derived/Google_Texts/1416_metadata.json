You know, we don\u2019t even need a Republican Party if they\u2019re gonna do this. You know, just elect Democrats, disband the Republican Party, and let the Democrats run it, because that\u2019s what\u2019s happening anyway,\u201d he said.\n\n[RELATED: Reps. Amash, Massie Blast Congressional Spending Bill for \u2018Unconstitutional\u2019 Surveillance Measures]\n\nLimbaugh complained that the Republicans who overwhelmingly won congressional elections in 2010 and 2014 on promises to cut spending instead became obsessed with avoiding disagreements with establishment Democrats that could result in a government shutdown, making it impossible for Republicans to use Congress\u2019 power of the purse as leverage in negotiations.\n\n\u201cEverything Obama wanted, everything he asked for [in the budget], he got. You go down the list of things, it\u2019s there,\u201d complained Limbaugh.\n\n[RELATED: Limbaugh on Trump: \u2018A Genuine Conservative Would Not Go after Cruz This Way\u2019]\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd this is causing some people to wonder if they just dreamed all that stuff about Boehner resigning. And then other people are wondering if they even dreamed all that stuff about the Republicans winning the largest number of seats they\u2019ve had in Congress since the Civil War. We had two midterm elections in 2010 and 2014, which were landslide victories for the Republican Party. The Democrat Party lost over a thousand seats nationwide in just those two elections. People went to the polls in droves wanting exactly what was rubber-stamped [in the bill] [to be] stopped.\u201c", "article_metadata": {"description": "After the Republican-led Congress passed a $1.1 trillion omnibus budget bill, which was subsequently signed into law by President Obama, conservative talk", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Barry Donegan", "og": {"site_name": "Ben Swann's Truth In Media", "description": "After the Republican-led Congress passed a $1.1 trillion omnibus budget bill, which was subsequently signed into law by President Obama, conservative talk", "title": "Rush Limbaugh Says 'Disband the Republican Party' for Passing Omnibus Bill", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1919, "identifier": "http://truthinmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RushLimbaugh1.jpg", "height": 1079}, "url": "http://truthinmedia.com/rush-limbaugh-disband-republican-party-for-passing-omnibus-bill/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After the Republican-led Congress passed a $1.1 trillion omnibus budget bill, which was subsequently signed into law by President Obama, conservative talk", "title": "Rush Limbaugh Says 'Disband the Republican Party' for Passing Omnibus Bill", "image": "http://truthinmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/RushLimbaugh1.jpg", "creator": "@BenSwann_", "site": "@BenSwann_", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 801708913249498, "pages": 124075334324092}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BenSwannRealityCheck", "section": "Government Accountability", "tag": "Rush Limbaugh", "published_time": "2015-12-22T16:58:37-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/barry.donegan"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "You know, just elect Democrats, disband the Republican Party, and let the Democrats run it, because that\u2019s what\u2019s happening anyway,\u201d he said.\nYou know, we don\u2019t even need a Republican Party if they\u2019re gonna do this.\n\u201cThere is no Republican Party!\nWe had two midterm elections in 2010 and 2014, which were landslide victories for the Republican Party.\nPeople went to the polls in droves wanting exactly what was rubber-stamped [in the bill] [to be] stopped.\u201c"}
