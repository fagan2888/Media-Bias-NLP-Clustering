It\u2019s almost a war on work. And that\u2019s insane; at the very, very least, we ought to be helping people get out of the system and into paid employment,\u201d Harvey said Monday as the authors discussed the results of their study at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nThey said their research, illustrated by numerous interviews with welfare recipients, led them to conclude that the current benefits structure traps many enrollees in the very poverty they wish to escape.\n\nConyers said that despite expectations that many of the nation\u2019s poor prefer being unemployed, the \u201cvast majority of the people that I interviewed would much rather be working\u201d than be on welfare.\n\nShe added that welfare programs \u201cput people in a position where work is a threat rather than a reward.\u201d\n\nIf income from a job does not cover the value of the food, housing, and health care assistance they receive, many \u201cmake a very rational decision, based on the incentives, to not work,\u201d Conyers said.\n\n\u201cThe worst thing, it seems to me, that you can do to somebody is to put them in a situation where they\u2019re gonna be in a perpetual cycle of dependency and poverty. That\u2019s cruel, and we shouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Harvey said.\n\nHe argued that the \u201cplethora of benefits\u2014housing, food, etc.\u2014is very patronizing\u201d and public assistance programs should allow people to \u201cmake their own decisions about their own lives.\u201d\n\nThe DKT Liberty Project, founded by Harvey, works to \u201creassert citizens\u2019 rights to their own property, to their freedom of movement and of speech, and to their personal privacy.\u201d\n\nHarvey, a libertarian, is chairman of DKT International, a nonprofit birth control advocacy organization. Conyers, who has a master\u2019s degree in management, studies welfare, inequality, and civil liberties as director of policy studies at the DKT Liberty Project.\n\nAccording to the publisher, the authors propose reforms including \u201ccreating wage subsidies for low-income workers, increasing apprenticeships, privatizing welfare, and fixing the Earned Income Tax Credit.\u201d\n\nConyers said human \u201chappiness requires work and earned success, and \u2026 welfare systems get in the way of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most surprising thing to me \u2026 is the central importance of work to a decent life,\u201d Harvey said, adding:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Welfare programs \u201cput people in a position where work is a threat rather than a reward,\u201d the co-author of a new book says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Welfare programs \u201cput people in a position where work is a threat rather than a reward,\u201d the co-author of a new book says.", "title": "Welfare System Is 'Anti-Work,' Researchers Say", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160329_Welfare_Barillas.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-29T22:58:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/22YWZzF"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Welfare programs \u201cput people in a position where work is a threat rather than a reward,\u201d the co-author of a new book says.", "title": "Welfare System Is 'Anti-Work,' Researchers Say", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160329_Welfare_Barillas.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "welfare", "published_time": "2016-03-29T16:51:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-29T22:58:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Welfare, poverty, war on work, work, benefits, unemployment, Phil Harvey, Lisa Conyers, Cato Institute, The Human Cost of Welfare"}, "article_summary": "The war on poverty is a war on work, the authors of a new book that criticizes the nation\u2019s welfare system assert.\nConyers, who has a master\u2019s degree in management, studies welfare, inequality, and civil liberties as director of policy studies at the DKT Liberty Project.\nPhil Harvey, chief sponsor of the DKT Liberty Project, and Lisa Conyers, a policy analyst for the project, conducted a nationwide study of anti-poverty programs for their book, \u201cThe Human Cost of Welfare: How the System Hurts the People It\u2019s Supposed to Help.\u201d\u201cThe present system is anti-work.\nIt\u2019s almost a war on work.\nThey said their research, illustrated by numerous interviews with welfare recipients, led them to conclude that the current benefits structure traps many enrollees in the very poverty they wish to escape."}
