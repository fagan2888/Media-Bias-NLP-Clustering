But the newest Fox News poll tells us that whatever voters think of the Republicans in Congress, they overwhelmingly want Obama to do his job and work with his rivals to govern. Obama\u2019s increasing insistence on using executive orders to legislate, re-writing some existing laws and simply ignoring others, got failing grades across the board. Some 74 percent of the registered voters surveyed said the president using executive orders to get around Congress is not how things are supposed to work in our republic. That includes 54 percent of Democrats. Even when asked to set aside their views on how the government is supposed to work, by a wide margin (60 percent to 37 percent) voters still disapproved.\n\n[\u201cYou have a president who is claiming the right to basically rewrite or ignore or negate federal laws and that is a very dangerous thing.\u201d \u2013 Constitutional attorney Jonathan Turley on the \u201cKelly File.\u201d Watch here.]\n\nBaser instincts - Why does Obama persist in flouting or dictating laws when voters are opposed to the practice? Some have posited that it is a result of Obama\u2019s famously insular nature. But what National Journal\u2019s Ron Fournier has called Obama\u2019s \u201cwhite flag syndrome\u201d does have its upside. The president has kept his foundering health law lurching forward by using executive orders to delay particularly damaging or disruptive components and done so without having to alienate the liberal base that launched him into the White House and continues to fund his hugely expensive grass-roots and community organizing efforts. Democrats in the poll approved of Obama\u2019s constitutional circumventions by a 66-31 percent margin.\n\nPlease stop helping - From Fox polling maven Dana Blanton: \u201cSome 60 percent of voters think that over the last five years the federal government\u2019s policies have increased the income gap between the rich and everyone else. \u2026the poll finds a 52-percent majority believes Obama\u2019s economic policies encourage \u2018class warfare. \u2019And by a 55-39 percent margin, voters think it\u2019s a bad idea for the government to \u2018spread the wealth\u2019 from the people who make more money to the people who make less.\u201d\n\nLeft, right assail Obama\u2019s new limits on political activity - WaPo: \u201cConservatives call it a scheme to silence President Obama\u2019s critics. Liberals complain the administration risks trampling on the First Amendment. Protests are coming from all directions over the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to curb secretive groups that play an increasingly dominant role in American politics.\u201d\n\nThe Judge\u2019s Ruling: Protecting the free press - Judge Andrew Napolitano considers A New Assault on the Freedom of the Press: \u201cIn the clash between government secrecy and public transparency, the Framers placed a value judgment in the First Amendment. Since the press is the eyes and ears of the public, and since the public needs to know what the government is doing so it can make informed decisions when electing people to the government, publishers and reporters are immune from criminal prosecution and civil liability for lifting the veil on the governments\u2019 secrets. An informed public is more likely to make better decisions than an ignorant one.\u201d\n\nYOU\u2019D BETTER HAVE A PEN: OBAMACARE SITE DOWN FOR YOUTH ENROLLMENT DAY\n\nBuzzFeed: \u201cSaturday is National Youth Enrollment Day for Obamacare, a day designed to help make up for youth recruitment time lost while HealthCare.gov was down last year\u2026 The day will also feature a HealthCare.gov outage that came as a surprise to the White House allies who have been planning Feb. 15 enrollment activities for weeks\u2026 The Obamacare website outage begins at 3 p.m. ET and carries on through Tuesday at 5 a.m. ET. While the Social Security system is down for maintenance, HealthCare.gov users will not be able to formally send in an application for health insurance, though they will be able to browse plans and, the enrollment groups say, calculate what insurance will cost for their family\u2026 The Obamacare recruitment groups say they\u2019ll have paper applications ready for those who can\u2019t use the website to apply and will direct potential enrollees to Navigators during the outage.\u201d\n\nSad state of affairs - While the administration was cheering increased ObamaCare enrollment numbers from January, deeper data dives tell consumers of big troubles ahead. From the Cleveland Plain Dealer: \u201cUninsured Ohioans, like Americans everywhere, stepped up their pace of enrollment in Affordable Care Act health insurance plans during January, with nearly 3.3 million people nationwide now signed up for a plan, new figures from the Obama administration show. The administration painted the uptick as good news, and stressed that a growing share of people signing up for coverage, or 25 percent nationwide, are young adults between the ages of 18 and 34. Young, healthy enrollees are important because they do not use as much heath care as older Americans, offsetting the older Americans' costs. But state-specific data suggest that Ohio is behind the curve and its health insurers may not see such a young-enrollee advantage. If the trend holds, and it may not, it could affect heath costs and future premiums.\u201d\n\nPoorer counties lack options - \u201cHundreds of thousands of Americans in poorer counties have few choices of health insurers and face high premiums through the online exchanges created by the health-care law, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal of offerings in 36 states. Consumers in 515 counties, spread across 15 states, have only one insurer selling coverage through the online marketplaces, the Journal found. In more than 80% of those counties, the sole insurer is a local Blue Cross & Blue Shield plan. Residents of wealthier, more populated counties in the U.S. receive lower-priced choices than those living in counties with a single insurer.\n\nHouse panel hits Obama over ObamaCare delays - Washington Examiner: \u201cRepublicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee are pressing the Obama administration for information on the latest Obamacare delay for businesses. Rep. Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican who chairs the panel, along with five other committee Republicans wrote a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew asking for documents related to the Obama administration\u2019s authority to make the changes to the law without Congress\u2019 consent, as well as communications between Treasury, Health and Human Services, and the White House about the delay decision\n\nAnother ObamaCare attack ad for a pro-ObamaCare Dem - Fox News: Just two years ago, Florida Democratic Rep. Joe Garcia was calling ObamaCare a \u201cstrong, affordable health care system\u201d -- but amid the health care overhaul\u2019s troubled rollout, he\u2019s changing his tune. A Democratic Super PAC has launched an ad on Garcia\u2019s behalf touting him as a lawmaker who \u201ctook the White House to task\u201d over the \u201cdisastrous\u201d rollout of the health law\u2019s website, and says he is working to fix ObamaCare.\n\n[Poll Watch: Fox News will release new polls \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d at 6 p.m. ET. Topics include ObamaCare and whether Congress should continue to investigate IRS targeting of conservative groups.]\n\nCRUZ BRUSHES BY MCCONNELL PRIMARY\n\nAP: \u201cLegislation to raise the nation's borrowing authority with no strings attached was short of the 60 votes it needed to advance - a threshold [Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas] demanded - and without a few conversions, Republicans would be blamed for its failure. The stock market was watching. After what seemed like an eternity, a grim-faced Sen. Mitch McConnell, the party leader who faces a tea party challenge back home, finally voted yes. An equally grim-faced Sen. John Cornyn, the party's No. 2 leader and Cruz's Texas colleague, changed his vote from no to yes. Cruz showed no mercy in exposing Republican leaders to widespread criticism from their primary challengers over a procedural vote on the debt limit after their pronouncements about the imperative of spending cuts. It could have been a simple 50-vote requirement, with Democrats delivering the votes to lift the debt limit, but Cruz insisted. Pressed after the vote about what he made his leaders do, Cruz was unapologetic. \u2018It should have been a very easy vote,\u2019 he told reporters. \u2018In my view, every Senate Republican should have stood together.\u2019 He added that the verdict on McConnell \u2018is ultimately a decision ... for the voters in Kentucky.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nRemember when? - In a statement, Cruz warned \u201cThere are too many members of Congress who think they can fool people and they will forget about it the next week. But sometimes, come November, the people remember.\u201d\n\n[Ed. note: Cruz has pledged not to get involved in primaries against his fellow Republican senators. This came about as close to the edge as that promise would allow.]\n\nDeMint-McConnell feud hits airwaves in Kentucky - The Senate Conservatives Fund, a group founded by former Sen. Jim DeMint to defeat moderate Republicans in Senate races, is spending donor dollars to target DeMint\u2019s longtime rival, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. The group, which helped Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, defeat a moderate frontrunner in that state\u2019s 2012 primary, calls McConnell a \u201cbully\u201d in a new ad. The spot compares McConnell to Obama administration officials accused of harassing the president\u2019s foes. The ad features images of former IRS executive Lois Lerner as a narrator says, \u201cBullying. Threats. Intimidation. The IRS? No. Try Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican Leader. That\u2019s right. Mitch McConnell is trying to bully and intimidate conservatives just like the IRS is.\u201d McConnell spokeswoman Allison Moore has criticized the group saying they are engaging in \u201cconservative cannibalism.\u201d She said in a statement: \u201cActual conservatives would realize they made a mistake by endorsing Matt Bevin, when it was revealed that he\u2019s a con-man, but this group has money to make.\u201d\n\nBut Bevin trails badly ahead of May primary - Politico:\u201c\u2026GOP polling firm Wenzel Strategies, finds Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell leading Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes by just 1 point, 43 percent to 42 percent-well within the margin of error\u2026Still, McConnell leads his primary challenger, businessman Matt Bevin, 59 percent to 17 percent. These numbers are fairly consistent with other polling in the race, all of which has shown a close race between McConnell and Grimes and a big gap between McConnell and Bevin in the primary-a recent poll from the Courier-Journal had Grimes up 4 points\u2026\u201d\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nNew Republic\u2019s Isaac Chotiner asks Why Hillary Clinton Continues to Get a Free Pass. \u201cThe point isn\u2019t that one should have no sympathy for Hillary Clinton, or that she did not put an important focus on gender issues when running the State Department. People... are complex. But those who care about women\u2019s issues should ask the same questions of Hillary Clinton that they would of anyone running for president.\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Mary Landrieu, D-La., for her support of ObamaCare. From Breitbart (with link to video): \u201cThe \u2018Mailbox\u2019 ad \u2018looks and feels distinctly different than typical political advertising,\u2019 because it visually tells the stories of families and individuals whose worlds are about to get rocked as they face the uncertainty, anxiety, and, in some cases, the devastation that will come after they are notified that their insurance plans have been canceled \u2018due to the Affordable Care Act.\u2019 Many Americans and Louisianans never expected that their plans would ever be canceled because President Barack Obama had promised them, \u2018If you like your healthcare plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your healthcare plan, period.\u2019\u201d\n\nGILLESPIE GETS SUPER PAC\n\nNational Journal: \u201cRepublican Senate candidate Ed Gillespie, who helped co-found the American Crossroads super PAC with GOP strategist Karl Rove, won\u2019t be relying on Rove\u2019s group as his chief outside booster in his Virginia campaign.

Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) has surged ahead among Republican challengers, trailing Mrs. Clinton by single digits, a McClatchy-Marist Poll released Wednesday found. In a Clinton-Ryan matchup, 52% favored Mrs. Clinton while 44% backed Mr. Ryan, who was the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee. The poll showed the gap has narrowed from 53%-40% in December. Support for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2026 dropped in the last month, with undecided voters largely heading to the Clinton camp. In this month\u2019s poll, Mr. Christie trails Mrs. Clinton by 21 percentage points, with 37% of the vote and 6% undecided. In January, Mr. Christie trailed the Democrat by 13 percentage points, with 12% undecided. Mrs. Clinton also holds a 14-point lead over former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and a 17-point lead over Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas). Her lead on former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2014who said last month he is still considering a bid\u2014widened to 20% from 12% in December. She also leads Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) by 20 points, up from 15 points in December. Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) trails the former first lady by 21 percentage points.\u201d\n\n[Huntsmania, 2016 edition - MSNBC personality Joe Scarborough told radio host Hew Hewitt Wednesday he is not ruling out a 2016 presidential bid.]\n\nGAY REPUBLICAN INCLUDES PARTNER IN WEB AD\n\nWSJ: \u201cCarl DeMaio is one of three openly gay Republicans running for Congress this year, and he would be at least the third to serve in the House if he wins.

There is, however, a tantalizing bit of unofficial business for a president whose wife and daughters will be away on their own travels, leaving him alone on Presidents\u2019 Day weekend in a secluded oasis where the forecast is calling for mostly sunny skies and a temperature of 89 degrees. After seeing off the king, administration officials said, Mr. Obama plans to stay on for two days at Sunnylands to play a few rounds of golf at the estate\u2019s recently refurbished nine-hole course, which has been played by presidents from Dwight D.
