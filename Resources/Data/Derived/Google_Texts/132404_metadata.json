Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), who sponsored the amendment to restore the credit, which expired last year.The PTC also survived an attempt by Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) to strip the bill of all of its alternative energy provisions. Toomey used the \u201cwinners and losers\u201d argument, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should force taxpayers to subsidize inefficient, uncompetitive forms of energy.\u201dToomey\u2019s amendment was rejected on a 6-18 vote, garnering support from many Republicans, including Sen.(R-Iowa). Grassley sponsored the first bill two decades ago for the PTC.\"I used to be the father of the wind energy tax credit; I suppose now I'm the grandfather,\" Grassley joked.A House Appropriations subpanel will hold a hearing on the 2015 budget request for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE).Tommy Beaudreau, director of the Interior Department's BOEM, will testify along with Brian Salerno, director of BSEE. The discussion could turn to the possibility of Interior opening up the Atlantic to offshore oil-and-gas exploration.\n\nNEWS BITES:\n\n\n\nNatural gas... Residential and commercial consumption of natural gas set a record average this winter, the Energy Information Administration said on Thursday.\n\n\n\nAccording to data from Bentek Energy, cold weather drove total consumption up by 8 percent above last winter's levels. Residential and commercial consumption rose even higher, however, jumping 14 percent this winter, driving their share of total U.S. consumption to over 50 percent.\n\n\n\nPTC phase-out... Sen. John Thune John ThuneSelf-driving cars: The next great leap in automotive safety Overnight Tech: Senate panel poised to advance email privacy bill Senators to House: FAA reauthorization would enhance airport security MORE (R-S.D.), whose state ranks No. 2 in terms of wind-energy production, proposed an amendment to phase the PTC out over five years, but he withdrew it, acknowledging that it is not germane to a bill about two-year extensions.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a nascent industry, it is maturing. It\u2019s generating billions of dollars in revenue, and powering the equivalent of more than 15 million American homes,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nInstead, Thune said he wished to make a PTC phase-out part of a conversation about comprehensive tax reform. Wyden and Grassley both signaled a willingness to work with him on the issue.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs an industry gets more mature, instead of waiting until its mature to make a final decision, we ought to start ahead of the curve and I\u2019d like to encourage members of this committee to think in terms of what Sen. Thune has suggested,\u201d Grassley said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt also fits the longer-term tax reform vision of parity between energy sources, a level playing field,\u201d said Wyden.\n\n\n\n\n\nAROUND THE WEB:\n\n\n\nA federal report released this week concluded that Arch Coal Inc. continued operations at a Kentucky mine despite indicators of danger, which killed a worker in 2013, SNL Financial reports.\n\n\n\nEnergy issues, including local fracking, is becoming a major issue in the race between Rep.
