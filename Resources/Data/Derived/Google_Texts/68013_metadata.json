But Obamacare has also opened the door to alternative providers of insurance, and one company in particular could reap the biggest rewards from potential customers who want more coverage than the Affordable Care Act will give them.\n\nIn the following video, Dan Caplinger, The Motley Fool's director of investment planning, notes that the market for voluntary insurance benefits looks like it could take off in the near future, leaving supplemental-insurance specialist Aflac (NYSE: AFL ) to reap big profits. Aflac offers a wide range of supplemental policies that cover everything from specific diseases like cancer to special incidents like accidental injuries. Dan notes that many anticipate that workers will want more of these voluntary insurance policies as Obamacare imposes high out-of-pocket costs and deductibles. With rivals MetLife (NYSE: MET ) and Prudential (NYSE: PRU ) looking to get into the voluntary insurance business, Aflac has a head-start in leading the way toward greater profitability thanks to Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Traditional health insurers have had to adapt to the Affordable Care Act, but other money-making opportunities are still available.
