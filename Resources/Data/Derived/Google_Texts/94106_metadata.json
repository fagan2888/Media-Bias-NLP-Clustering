It started with a date at a caf\u00e9 and ended with a date at a caf\u00e9, and in between there was a relationship that took place mostly at a private clinic. I don\u2019t know his full name, his phone number, or where he lives. He doesn\u2019t know any of that about me. Money was never exchanged between us, as the clinic\u2019s administrators handled logistics and finances. Now that it\u2019s over I am heartbroken, because while I understand what I experienced was therapeutic role play, it felt very real in my head.\n\nI\u2019m a 44-year-old spinster. I hate that word \u2013 \u201cspinster\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s the most succinct way of describing me. I turned to Surrogate Partner Therapy (SPT) in a desperate attempt to change my life, because I could count the number of sexual encounters I\u2019d had on one hand. Dating makes me extremely anxious. I haven\u2019t experienced any obvious trauma, like rape or molestation. I have no physical handicap. The reasons for my anxiety are complex and nuanced, a combination of screwed-up circumstances and family dynamics, augmented by self-imposed physical obstacles along the way, like weight gain and scars. Habits of living alone and being independent are part of who I am now. I make the most of my situation by traveling and investing in various forms of personal growth. But these habits have built a shield around me over the years, and this shield was suffocating me.\n\nI\u2019ve been hyper-sensitive about intimacy and sex since I was a teenager, so overwhelmed that I usually preferred to go without. In my 20s and 30s it was less of a priority; I had time to work it out. But as I edged into my 40s, I couldn\u2019t ignore it anymore. I could no longer accept my current state of being.\n\nI had tried online dating; clearly any woman can get laid if she really wants to. I didn\u2019t experience any intimacy. It was more like something I was proving to myself. I felt like I was constantly lying, pretending to be someone I\u2019m not. A confident, experienced, sexy woman. She\u2019s not me. I needed a fundamental change in my character or attitude. How much can people change? How much can I? I have no idea.\n\nSo I started to consider SPT. It sounded lurid at first, but so did the mere thought of really talking about sex. SPT was right for me, because it\u2019s an emotional challenge, albeit one with a major physical component to it. Sex is a straightforward, set goal, but the physical intimacy is a clear result of a deep emotional one. I told a small circle of friends, mostly women but also a couple of their husbands. They encouraged me, though a few were shocked at first. But ultimately, they all seemed to think I was courageous to try it. In truth I am a coward and a fool to have reached my 40s without benefiting from one of life\u2019s fundamental joys. It took me years of \u201cregular\u201d therapy before I was even willing to consider it.\n\nBut I was ready to admit defeat and face my problems. It was clear in my first meetings at the clinic that these therapists have seen the likes of me often enough, to the point where I sometimes felt like a stereotype. The sexually stumped neurotic woman who focuses on her career instead of love.\n\nI was given a talk therapist I\u2019ll call A. While I spend my days online, or buried in presentations and spreadsheets, A. sits around talking about sex and relationships. The ease with which she discusses the most intimate of details is astounding. Over time it became contagious.\n\nA. met me at the clinic, which is located on a quiet city side street. Most people walking past the clinic have no idea it is an oasis for the likes of me, because from the outside it looks like a law firm, or a dentist\u2019s office. There is a huge, old ficus tree right in front of the entrance. It has an uneven, thick trunk with roots bulging out of it like strained veins.\n\nI met with the head of the clinic only once. She is a renowned, global leader in her field and has a strong, stern, austere presence. She spent the first few minutes of our meeting quietly going over my talk therapist\u2019s notes, while I sat there watching her read about me. I was terrified and ended up sobbing throughout most of the session. She was impressively observational, pinpointing my anxiety so quickly it felt almost embarrassing. I later told my sex surrogate partner this story and he reverently explained she\u2019s a Dumbledore: wise, knowledgeable and the epitome of goodness. The Dumbledore of intimacy and sex.\n\nS., my surrogate, was selected for me out of a group of male surrogates in the clinic\u2019s team. I made only one request, which was that he not be too thin. Not that S. is fat, but I am, or have been, and body image is a major problem for me. I didn\u2019t want to feel more self-conscious than I was going to anyway.\n\nAlthough the time I spent with S. was a lot more conversational than physical, I was beyond nervous in the beginning. My left eye started twitching lightly in the days before our first date. I meet with men on my own all the time, but that\u2019s for work. This was different. I spent most of our first date actively distracting myself from crying. There was no obvious reason to be upset, because S. came across as a warm, kind man. Comfortable in his own skin, which is more than I could ever say about myself. He seemed to be the opposite of me, to the point where I was concerned we\u2019d have nothing in common. But I am accustomed to lying to men about my predicament and in this case he already knew about it, so all the energy I usually devoted to insincerity became a welcome, available resource. I shifted it toward dealing with the moment. The opportunity to speak honestly and openly with S. was a huge relief.\n\nS. is a 38-year-old artist. The clinic\u2019s surrogates must all have other sources of income, so besides his work as a musician, S. also teaches art and film to kids. And he\u2019s a bartender, although I don\u2019t know where. He\u2019s originally French and has gorgeous hazel eyes.\n\nOur last date \u201coutside,\u201d before sessions at the clinic, was on the beach. S didn\u2019t own a bathing suit because he prefers to mostly skinny dip at night, but he made an exception in my case and kept his underwear on. We went into the water for a while and then hung out drinking cold beers he brought, ending up in an intense discussion about the meaning of intimacy. S. has had numerous sexual partners \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t tell me how many, but I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s in the triple digits. So I shot off a statement about it not being intimacy if he can experience it with so many women. He seemed to take it in stride, but I felt awful, like I\u2019d crossed a line. Rude and judgmental. Childish, cynical and mean. I became anxious about the whole thing in the following days.\n\nSPT includes a report from the surrogate about every session, which my talk therapist read to me in between sessions. I always met with her after seeing S. He also met with her after every single session we had together. They were essentially a therapeutic team.\n\nIt turned out he\u2019d enjoyed our discussion at the beach. In fact, he said it had been our best date up to that point. I couldn\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t hit me back with the obvious rejoinder \u2014 it\u2019s definitely not intimacy if you don\u2019t have it with anyone at all. But S. didn\u2019t get offended as easily as I do; sex and intimacy are a few of his favorite conversation topics. I\u2019ve naively gone through life thinking there is a single correct definition for intimacy, one that is morally superior and therefore clearly the right choice for me. That day I came to realize it was a completely subjective term and started to think about what it really meant to me as an individual.\n\nThe more I got to know S., the more preoccupied I became with this whole relationship being fake. I was growing attached to him. But at the end of each date, we both went back to our \u201creal\u201d lives. I had no way of communicating with him in between sessions. I was a job and therefore he probably felt some of what I feel about my own job, which isn\u2019t all good. He\u2019d never meet my friends or family. He wouldn\u2019t visit my great apartment.\n\nWhen S. saw I was having a hard time trusting the process, he tried to comfort me. He suggested that what we had between the two of us was more real than everything else going on around us and compared it to when the kids he\u2019s teaching ask him whether scenes in a fictional movie are real. He tells them it doesn\u2019t really matter because it\u2019s real to them in the moment. So I stopped concerning myself with what he was up to when I wasn\u2019t around. I stopped debating his motives or questioning his sincerity. He was helping me deal with my problem and very much present in doing so. That\u2019s the only thing that mattered. Every other date I\u2019d ever been on was a big lie and a waste of time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I turned to sex therapy out of desperation.
