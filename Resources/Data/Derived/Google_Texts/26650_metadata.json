The House Energy and Commerce Committee just started the first of several congressional hearings on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s website, but this will not be a normal discussion between lawmakers and Obama administration officials.\n\nLet\u2019s note at the outset that there\u2019s nothing wrong with congressional oversight hearings. On the contrary, this is one of Congress\u2019 key functions, and even those who champion \u201cObamacare\u201d have no reason to complain about lawmakers checking up on the administration and demanding the best possible performance.\n\nBut therein lies the rub: that\u2019s not quite what Republicans have in mind today. Alec MacGillis had a good piece on this the other day.\n\nGenerally, holding a hearing demanding to know why a new program isn\u2019t functioning better implies that \u2026 you want it to function. Until now, Republicans have managed to oppose Obamacare totally, to undermine its implementation left and right while casting symbolic votes for repeal and, just recently, engaging in an immensely costly charade to press for the \u201cdefunding\u201d of the law. But now that the law is actually going into effect, seizing on its deficiencies takes on a different aspect: It means, at some basic level, accepting the goals of the law as worth achieving\n\nTheoretically, that\u2019s exactly right. The ostensible point of today\u2019s hearing \u2013 the first of several such panels that will all make the same point \u2013 is that Congress is dissatisfied with the well-publicized website glitches and wants the administration to do much better.\n\nBut the trouble is, Republicans are crying what Matt Miller aptly described as \u201c crocodile tears .\u201d\n\nTo listen to Republican laments about Healthcare.gov\u2019s terrible launch, you\u2019d think the GOP was deeply concerned that people who need affordable health insurance are being denied this essential protection thanks to the administration\u2019s incompetence. But of course nothing could be further from the truth. What conservative officials, pundits and advocates are screaming is closer to the following: How dare you totally screw up something that we think shouldn\u2019t exist!\n\nI\u2019ve watched Congress for quite a while, and I\u2019ve been to more congressional hearings than I can count, and I honestly can\u2019t think of anything similar to the charade we\u2019ll see today. The Republican majority is complaining about the functionality of a website that they\u2019d just as soon destroy. They\u2019re furious Americans are struggling to sign up for benefits that Republicans don\u2019t want them to have. They\u2019re demanding better performance of a system they\u2019ve spent years deliberately trying to sabotage, and have no intention of trying to help fix.\n\nThe hearing will give the appearance of a committee that wants to see improvements, except those responsible for calling the hearing \u2013 the one who\u2019ll complain the loudest \u2013 don\u2019t want improvements at all. Their stated preference would be that the website that doesn\u2019t work as it should to stay that way indefinitely.\n\nAnd so what is, exactly, the point of the exercise? Part of this is simply an excuse to grandstand. Republicans took a beating when they shut down the government, and so they\u2019ll take advantage of the opportunity today to release some frustration and go on the offensive by shouting at Obama administration officials for a few hours. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be quite cathartic.\n\nThe other part is to advance the GOP\u2019s public-relations goals. A hearing like this produces media coverage that questions the administration\u2019s competence, while possibly even discouraging consumers from signing up for coverage \u2013 which is the Republicans\u2019 ultimate goal anyway.\n\nTo see the hearings\u2019 theatrics as a sincere exercise related to substance and oversight is to overlook every relevant detail. If Republican policymakers want to talk about playing a constructive role in improving the system, making federal law more effective, and easing the process through which Americans get coverage, there\u2019s ample room for that conversation.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "To see the Obamacare hearings in Congress as a sincere exercise related to substance and oversight is to overlook every relevant detail.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/complaints-the-sake-complaining", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "To see the Obamacare hearings in Congress as a sincere exercise related to substance and oversight is to overlook every relevant detail.", "title": "Complaints for the sake of complaining", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/complaints-the-sake-complaining", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/article-teasers/2013-10-24_0953.jpg?itok=XzVggZ0a", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/complaints-the-sake-complaining", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/article-teasers/2013-10-24_0953.jpg?itok=S6t-Lenl", "height": 553}, "title": "Complaints for the sake of complaining", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "To see the Obamacare hearings in Congress as a sincere exercise related to substance and oversight is to overlook every relevant detail."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-24T09:57:30-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Complaints for the sake of complaining", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/complaints-the-sake-complaining", "published": 1, "date": "10/24/2013 09:57:30 EDT", "tags": "affordable-care-act,obamacare,rachel-maddow-show"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "To see the Obamacare hearings in Congress as a sincere exercise related to substance and oversight is to overlook every relevant detail.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "The Republican majority is complaining about the functionality of a website that they\u2019d just as soon destroy.\nLet\u2019s note at the outset that there\u2019s nothing wrong with congressional oversight hearings.\nTo see the hearings\u2019 theatrics as a sincere exercise related to substance and oversight is to overlook every relevant detail.\nGenerally, holding a hearing demanding to know why a new program isn\u2019t functioning better implies that \u2026 you want it to function.\nBut therein lies the rub: that\u2019s not quite what Republicans have in mind today."}
