“Our critics are always like, ‘She wore red for Republicans.’ They don’t cover it when you wear blue,” the hose of Fox News's “The Kelly File” says in a glowing profile published Thursday in The New York Times Magazine “Oh, she’s a secret Democrat,” Kelly whispered to the mag as she “mimed an expression of total horror.”The Times shadowed Kelly, 44, as she weighed her wardrobe options last November ahead of midterm election night. Rummaging through a rack of eight different outfits in her New York office, Kelly said, “I don’t really like wearing royal blue or red because it’s so anchor-y.”In the end, Kelly opted for a decidedly nonpartisan option: a black skirt suit paired with a white blouse. “Black is classic and you always want to be a little classic on election night, you know?”
