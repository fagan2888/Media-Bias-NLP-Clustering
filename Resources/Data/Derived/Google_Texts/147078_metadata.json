It is no laughing matter that millions of Americans\u2019 lives have been thrown into anxious chaos as they lose their health insurance, their doctors, their money, or all three. Nor is it particularly amusing to think of the incredible waste of time and tax dollars that has gone into Obamacare\u2019s construction. And the still-unfolding violence that this misbegotten legislation will visit on the economy and our liberties is not funny either. This very magazine has been downright funereal about the brazen and unconstitutional seizure of one-sixth of the economy, and rightly so.\n\nBut come on, people.\n\nIf you can\u2019t take some joy, some modicum of relief and mirth, in the unprecedentedly spectacular beclowning of the president, his administration, its enablers, and, to no small degree, liberalism itself, then you need to ask yourself why you\u2019re following politics in the first place. Because, frankly, this has been one of the most enjoyable political moments of my lifetime. I wake up in the morning and rush to find my just-delivered newspaper with a joyful expectation of worsening news so intense, I feel like Morgan Freeman should be narrating my trek to the front lawn. Indeed, not since Dan Rather handcuffed himself to a fraudulent typewriter, hurled it into the abyss, and saw his career plummet like Ted Kennedy was behind the wheel have I enjoyed a story more.\n\nAlas, the English language is not well equipped to capture the sensation I\u2019m describing, which is why we must all thank the Germans for giving us the term \u201cschadenfreude\u201d \u2014 the joy one feels at the misfortune or failure of others. The primary wellspring of schadenfreude can be attributed to Barack Obama\u2019s hubris \u2014 another immigrant word, which means a sinful pride or arrogance that causes someone to believe he has a godlike immunity to the rules of life.\n\nThe hubris of our ocean-commanding commander-in-chief surely isn\u2019t news to readers of this website. He\u2019s said that he\u2019s smarter and better than everyone who works for him. His wife informed us that he has \u201cbrought us out of the dark and into the light\u201d and that he would fix our broken souls. The man defined sin itself as \u201cbeing out of alignment with my values.\u201d We may be the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for, but at the same time, everyone has been waiting for him. Or as he put it in 2007, \u201cEvery place is Barack Obama country once Barack Obama\u2019s been there.\u201d\n\nIn every tale of hubris, the transgressor is eventually slapped across the face with the semi-frozen flounder of reality. The Greeks had a god, Nemesis, whose scythe performed the same function. It was Nemesis who lured Narcissus to the pool where he fell in love with his own reflection. Admittedly, most of Nemesis\u2019s walk-on roles were in the Greek tragedies, but in the modern era, comeuppance-for-the-arrogant is more often found in comedies, and the \u201crollout\u201d of Healthcare.gov has been downright hilarious. (I put quotation marks around \u201crollout\u201d because the term implies actual rolling, and this thing has moved as gracefully as a grand piano in a peat bog.) But, as the president says, \u201cit\u2019s more than a website.\u201d Indeed, the whole law is coming apart like a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 yacht in rough waters. The media feeding frenzy it has triggered from so many journalistic lapdogs has been both so funny and so poignant, it reminds me of nothing more than the climax of the classic film Air Bud, when the lovable basketball-playing golden retriever finally decides to maul the dog-abusing clown.\n\nDuring the government shutdown, Barack Obama held fast, heroically refusing to give an inch to the hostage-taking, barbaric orcs of the Tea Party who insisted on delaying Obamacare. It was a triumph for the master strategist in the White House, who finally maneuvered the Republicans into revealing their extremism. But we didn\u2019t know something back then: Obama desperately needed a delay of Healthcare.gov. In his arrogance, though, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to admit it. The other possibility is that he is such an incompetent manager, who has cultivated such a culture of yes-men, that he was completely in the dark about the problems. That\u2019s the reigning storyline right now from the White House. Obama was betrayed. \u201cIf I had known,\u201d he told his staff, \u201cwe could have delayed the website.\u201d\n\nThis is how you know we\u2019re in the political sweet spot: when the only plausible excuses for the administration are equally disastrous indictments.\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Katrina, it took about five minutes for liberals to cast the chaos and confusion of the disaster as a searing indictment of not just the Bush administration but of conservatism itself. Whatever the merits of that argument (and there are not many), Katrina was at least a surprise. The October 1 deadline for Obamacare was set by Obama\u2019s own administration years ago \u2014 and it caught them completely off guard. The president may now claim that he knew nothing, but he must have wondered why Henry Chao, Healthcare.gov\u2019s chief project manager, set the bar of success at sea level last March: \u201cLet\u2019s just make sure it\u2019s not a Third World experience.\u201d At this point, it could only be more of a Third World experience if Healthcare.gov required enrollees to pay with chickens.\n\nRegardless, if Obama were a tenth as good a politician as he thinks he is, he could have blamed the delay he desperately needed on his political enemies, calling them \u201chostage-takers\u201d even as he secretly understood they had rescued his most beloved hostage from his own incompetence. Instead, on September 26, he went out and told an adoring audience: \u201cOn October 1, millions of Americans . . . will finally be able to buy quality, affordable health insurance. In five days.\u201d \u201cStarting Tuesday,\u201d he added, Americans will be able to \u201ccompare and purchase affordable health-insurance plans, side by side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak \u2014 same way you shop for a TV on Amazon. You just go on and you start looking, and here are all the options.\u201d\n\nCome on, that\u2019s hilarious.\n\nOkay, maybe he didn\u2019t know then what bad shape the website was in. But how to explain the president\u2019s remarks three weeks after the debut of Healthcare.gov? Even if it\u2019s true that the president only hears about bad news from the newspapers, by then the papers were full of reports that Healthcare.gov worked about as well as a Somali superconducting supercollider. Obama knew that Healthcare.gov was a fiasco, and that the \u201cnavigators\u201d used the same broken website that consumers had spent days poking at like Chinatown chickens in an abandoned tic-tac-toe machine, desperately but fruitlessly trying to get some reward.\n\nAnd yet the president strode out into the Rose Garden anyway and told millions of Americans they could buy their coverage by phone. He told them the 1-800 operators were standing by. He told them it would take only 25 minutes to apply. None of these things were true. In his mind, Obama surely thought he was putting the issue to rest, like Zeus declaring that Odysseus would make it home alive. But here\u2019s the thing: All that Zeus needs to do to make something happen is to say it. When Barack Obama says things, reality doesn\u2019t bend to his will. Somehow, Barack Obama has been led to believe that his job is simply to go out and say things, as if saying things alone could change facts on the ground. So while I\u2019m sure he thinks he sounded like the voice of eternal truth, in reality he sounded like the infomercial spokesman played by Chevy Chase in the old Saturday Night Live skit:\n\nWIFE (GILDA RADNER): New Shimmer is a floor wax!\n\nHUSBAND (DAN AYKROYD): No, new Shimmer is a dessert topping!\n\nWIFE: It\u2019s a floor wax!\n\nHUSBAND: It\u2019s a dessert topping!\n\nWIFE: It\u2019s a floor wax, I\u2019m telling you!\n\nHUSBAND: It\u2019s a dessert topping, you cow!\n\nSPOKESMAN [enters quickly]: Hey, hey, hey, calm down, you two. New Shimmer is a floor wax and a dessert topping! Here, I\u2019ll spray some on your mop . . . and some on your butterscotch pudding . . .\n\nHUSBAND [eating while wife mops]: Mmmmm, tastes terrific!\n\nWIFE: And just look at that shine! But will it last?\n\nSPOKESMAN: Hey, outlasts every other leading floor wax, two to one. It\u2019s durable, and it\u2019s scuff-resistant.\n\nHUSBAND: And it\u2019s delicious!\n\nBut not as delicious as the tears of his praetorian guard. First of all, every day Jay Carney looks even more like a little boy who put on his dad\u2019s suit. You have to wonder what goes on in his mind, as a former journalist, when he tells his former colleagues that \u201cthe American forces have been completely destroyed with minimal Iraqi casualties.\u201d (Oh, wait, that was Baghdad Bob. I get them confused.) And what about Dan Pfeiffer going on the Sunday shows to insist that no American should believe his or her lying eyes?\n\nOn October 1, Media Matters for America \u2014 David Brock\u2019s sweatshop for twentysomethings who couldn\u2019t get an internship at the DNC \u2014 raced to defend the crashed website as a sign of success, in keeping with the idea that all Obama failures are further proof of his awesomeness: \u201cRight-Wing Media Frantically Spin Obamacare Exchange Success Into Failure.\u201d Taking their cues from the White House, MMFA insisted that the administration\u2019s only mistake was failing to appreciate just how popular the program would be. \u201cRight-wing media were quick to jump on the problems, declaring them a sign of the law\u2019s shortcomings rather than its popularity,\u201d cackled MMFA\u2019s Samantha Wyatt. She went on to mock various Fox News journalists and, of course, Rush Limbaugh for calling the disastrous launch a disaster. Meanwhile, Ezra Klein called the initial popularity of the site exactly \u201cwhat the Republicans were afraid of.\u201d Now even Klein has turned on the White House \u2014 more in sorrow than in anger, to be sure. When the White House has lost Ezra Klein . . . well, it still has the cast of Morning Joe. No, wait \u2014 even they have abandoned the president. Heh.\n\nTo be sure, there was some apparent plausibility to the claim that the website was working only too well, because the White House lied so confidently about what was going on. Few critics grasped at first that this was going to be the Charlie Sheen of IT launches \u2014 a spectacularly mortifying failure, punctuated with desperate shrieks of \u201cWinning!\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until later that we learned that, of the uncountable hordes flocking to the federal exchanges that first day, the number who actually registered for an insurance plan totaled exactly six. At that rate, Obamacare would reach its target of 7 million enrollees around the year 5013, or 3022 a.o. (Anno Obamae).\n\nObviously, the website will get better. It could hardly get worse, short of a finding that it causes irritable bowel syndrome. Indeed, on the second day, the number of enrollees hit 248, according to the same leaked contractor memos. But the site needs to be able to handle tens of thousands of enrollees per day.\n\nMore recent numbers suggest that the federal exchange has enrolled about 27,000 customers since October 1, which amounts to about half an enrollee for each Obamacare \u201cnavigator.\u201d (Someone in the White House is surely thinking, \u201cHey, let\u2019s just hire another 14,000,000 navigators! Problem solved.) In order to rationalize that dismal performance the White House now must insist that they always knew the numbers would be tiny at the outset.\n\nHere\u2019s a number that isn\u2019t tiny: Five million people \u2014 and counting \u2014 have lost their health insurance, despite the president\u2019s years of \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d promises. The president has apologized, sort of. He says he\u2019s \u201csorry\u201d that people have found themselves in a bad situation because of \u201cassurances\u201d he made. But no one has lost their insurance because of the president\u2019s assurances, they\u2019ve lost their insurance because of the president\u2019s law. If a captain has the lifejackets filled with cement, his assurance that \u201cyou can keep your lifejacket\u201d is only half the crime. Obama knew the lifejackets wouldn\u2019t work. In 2010 he admitted that 8 to 9 million people in the individual market might \u201chave to change their coverage\u201d because of the law. And that\u2019s just the individual market. Millions more will eventually lose the insurance they like because of Obamacare, according to the administration\u2019s own internal estimates.\n\nThe cancellations aren\u2019t a bug, they\u2019re a feature, and the president lied about it over and over again.\n\nAnd now the Democratic panic has begun. Terry McAuliffe almost lost his bid for Virginia governor because of Obamacare. Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina has seen her double-digit lead against a generic Republican all but vanish. Henry \u201clet\u2019s avoid a Third World experience\u201d Chao is now insisting he never got the memo warning of \u201climitless\u201d security problems. And, just this week, the big dog himself, Bill Clinton, announced he thinks Obama should honor the \u201ccommitment\u201d the federal government made to Americans that they can keep their health insurance. Clinton\u2019s brazenness is a marvel to behold, given that he surely knew all along that Obama\u2019s \u201cincorrect promise\u201d \u2014 to borrow the New York Times\u2019 latest desperate euphemism \u2014 was a lie and yet he happily defended the law. Moreover, he knows that honoring that commitment would, in fact, permanently gut Obamacare.\n\nWhich is one reason why Republicans are proposing a law that would do exactly that with the \u201cKeep Your Health Care Plan\u201d Act. This creates a miserable predicament for Democrats. As Jim Geraghty writes: \u201cCan you picture the ads? Senator [Insert Democrat Here] voted for the Obamacare law that took away your health insurance . . . and then voted against the Keep Your Health Plan Act.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are in the opening stages of the crab-in-a-trap phase. When crabs are caught in a trap they will try to climb out of their predicament. The problem is that other crabs will grab the would-be-escapee and pull them down. When the really nasty infighting starts, as countless Democrats look to fix or delay the law, I\u2019m looking forward to pointing out that such an agenda was once considered \u201cextreme,\u201d even \u201cracist,\u201d by Democrats. Or to quote Harry Reid from last September: \u201cObamacare has been the law for four years. Why don\u2019t they get a life and talk about something else?\u201d\n\nIt would be great fun to watch Reid say something similar to the throngs of panicked fellow Democrats racing for the exits like the Irish peasants below decks on the Titanic. Reid, of course, is just desperate to buy time. He hopes to make it to November 30, the appointed date when the White House still insists it will be able to say, \u201cBehold the power of this fully functional website!\u201d Politically speaking, with every day still producing another terrible story for the White House, that is the sort of timeline that would make Godot look punctual. And that\u2019s if they hit the deadline. So far, the press has been unable to produce a prominent IT expert willing to say on the record that the target date is feasible. Jay Carney is sticking to that promise, but the musky stench of fear, sweat, and urine wafting from the podium makes it hard for all but the true believers to put much stock in his words.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius makes the most of that copy of Web Sites for Dummies that a protester handed her at a town-hall meeting last week. Then what?\n\nWe have a hint from Colorado, where the state\u2019s own version of Healthcare.gov has been up and running. Al Jazeera America interviewed one of Colorado\u2019s exchange navigators a month after the debut. When asked how many people she had signed up, she replied, \u201cSo far, no one. Thus far everybody has taken a look at the rates and they\u2019ve walked out the door. There\u2019s sticker shock. They just can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Medicaid has been driving most of the enrollments, and those who have ended up in private plans are older and poorer on average than the planners had hoped.\n\nEvery day, the supposedly conspiratorial right-wing smear that Obama cared more about economic redistribution than he did about the middle class or economic growth looks more reasonable. Surely we\u2019re allowed to say, \u201cWe told you so\u201d?\n\nAs a matter of public policy and fiscal health, this is a mixed bag. It\u2019s good that poor sick people without insurance coverage are getting something. On the other side of the scale, we have the fact that the country is racing toward entitlement-fueled bankruptcy. So if you can overlook that, yippee!\n\nBut as a political and ideological matter, this is beyond fantastic. For years we\u2019ve been told that Democrats were more \u201creality-based,\u201d that \u201cfacts have a liberal bias,\u201d in the words of Paul Krugman, and that if they could just have their way, they could fix all of our problems. No one represented this arrogant promise more than Barack Obama himself. But, with an irony so rich it would be made of Corinthian leather if it was a car seat, the only way he could get his signature legislation passed was to baldly and brazenly lie about it, over and over and over again. He created a rhetorical cloud castle where no one would lose his insurance, every family would save thousands of dollars, and millions of the uninsured would suddenly get coverage. Anyone who doubted this was called a fool or a liar, or even a racist. It was, in the parlance of liberalism, a \u201cfalse choice\u201d to assert that Obamacare couldn\u2019t be a floor wax and a dessert topping.\n\nAnd all of this \u2014 every bit of it \u2014 is their own fault. The bedraggled cadres of Obama\u2019s defenders are valiantly trying to blame it all on Republican sabotage: The Obama administration had to keep the whole thing secret for fear of \u201cfeeding the opposition,\u201d in the words of a Washington Post reconstruction of the debacle. But when you read the stories, if you replace phrases like \u201ckeep the Republicans from finding out\u201d with the more accurate \u201ckeep the public from finding out,\u201d you\u2019ll get a better sense of things. The Obama White House, by which I mean the Obama campaign, was desperate to keep voters from grasping the scope of its misinformation campaign until after the election. And then, after the election, it was afraid to let the public know what they\u2019d been misinformed about.\n\nThe argument against gloating holds that conservatives should want Obamacare to succeed even though we said all along it couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s such an odd argument, particularly since the Democrats\u2019 lies were of the first order, in that Obama\u2019s aides actually debated and discussed them, no doubt presenting them to focus groups like a jar of \u201cnew Shimmer, now an erectile-dysfunction treatment and paint thinner all in one!\u201d\n\nWhen a product is brought to market and the market discovers \u2014 as it eventually has to \u2014 that the advertising wasn\u2019t merely a tissue of lies but a geological stratum of lies, the utterly fair and justified response from the critics is \u201cI told you so!\u201d \u2014 not \u201cLet\u2019s make this thing bipartisan now.\u201d That\u2019s particularly true when the president continues to lie. On September 26 he said, \u201cIf you already have health care, you don\u2019t have to do anything\u201d to keep your plan. On November 3 he said, \u201cWhat we said was you could keep [your plan] if it hasn\u2019t been changed.\u201d Who knew that dozens of flat declarative statements \u2014 \u201cYou can keep your plan. Period\u201d \u2014 were trailed by a cloud of asterisks like so many invisible fireflies?\n\nIf Obamacare had been a shining success from Day One, do you think the Democrats would be in the mood to share the credit? Then why should Republicans be in more of a mood to share the blame?\n\nFeel free to cross your fingers that reality will bend to the gravitational pull of Obama\u2019s stellar ego, his invincible hubris. As for me, I\u2019ll be sitting on the sidelines cheering on Nemesis, with joy in my heart.\n\n\u2014 Jonah Goldberg is the author of The Tyranny of Clich\u00e9s, now on sale in paperback.

Clinton\u2019s brazenness is a marvel to behold, given that he surely knew all along that Obama\u2019s \u201cincorrect promise\u201d \u2014 to borrow the New York Times\u2019 latest desperate euphemism \u2014 was a lie and yet he happily defended the law. Moreover, he knows that honoring that commitment would, in fact, permanently gut Obamacare.\n\nWhich is one reason why Republicans are proposing a law that would do exactly that with the \u201cKeep Your Health Care Plan\u201d Act. This creates a miserable predicament for Democrats. As Jim Geraghty writes: \u201cCan you picture the ads? Senator [Insert Democrat Here] voted for the Obamacare law that took away your health insurance\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0and then voted against the Keep Your Health Plan Act.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are in the opening stages of the crab-in-a-trap phase. When crabs are caught in a trap they will try to climb out of their predicament. The problem is that other crabs will grab the would-be-escapee and pull them down. When the really nasty infighting starts, as countless Democrats look to fix or delay the law, I\u2019m looking forward to pointing out that such an agenda was once considered \u201cextreme,\u201d even \u201cracist,\u201d by Democrats. Or to quote Harry Reid from last September: \u201cObamacare has been the law for four years. Why don\u2019t they get a life and talk about something else?\u201d\n\nIt would be great fun to watch Reid say something similar to the throngs of panicked fellow Democrats racing for the exits like the Irish peasants below decks on the Titanic. Reid, of course, is just desperate to buy time. He hopes to make it to November 30, the appointed date when the White House still insists it will be able to say, \u201cBehold the power of this fully functional website!\u201d Politically speaking, with every day still producing another terrible story for the White House, that is the sort of timeline that would make Godot look punctual. And that\u2019s if they hit the deadline. So far, the press has been unable to produce a prominent IT expert willing to say on the record that the target date is feasible. Jay Carney is sticking to that promise, but the musky stench of fear, sweat, and urine wafting from the podium makes it hard for all but the true believers to put much stock in his words.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume HHS secretary Kathleen Sebelius makes the most of that copy of Web Sites for Dummies that a protester handed her at a town-hall meeting last week. Then what?\n\nWe have a hint from Colorado, where the state\u2019s own version of Healthcare.gov has been up and running. Al Jazeera America interviewed one of Colorado\u2019s exchange navigators a month after the debut. When asked how many people she had signed up, she replied, \u201cSo far, no one. Thus far everybody has taken a look at the rates and they\u2019ve walked out the door. There\u2019s sticker shock. They just can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Medicaid has been driving most of the enrollments, and those who have ended up in private plans are older and poorer on average than the planners had hoped.\n\nEvery day, the supposedly conspiratorial right-wing smear that Obama cared more about economic redistribution than he did about the middle class or economic growth looks more reasonable. Surely we\u2019re allowed to say, \u201cWe told you so\u201d?\n\n#page#As a matter of public policy and fiscal health, this is a mixed bag. It\u2019s good that poor sick people without insurance coverage are getting something. On the other side of the scale, we have the fact that the country is racing toward\u00a0entitlement-fueled bankruptcy. So if you can overlook that, yippee!\n\nBut as a political and ideological matter, this is beyond fantastic. For years we\u2019ve been told that Democrats were more \u201creality-based,\u201d that \u201cfacts have a liberal bias,\u201d in the words of Paul Krugman, and that if they could just have their way, they could fix all of our problems. No one represented this arrogant promise more than Barack Obama himself. But, with an irony so rich it would be made of Corinthian leather if it was a car seat, the only way he could get his signature legislation passed was to baldly and brazenly lie about it, over and over and over again. He created a rhetorical cloud castle where no one would lose his insurance, every family would save thousands of dollars, and millions of the uninsured would suddenly get coverage. Anyone who doubted this was called a fool or a liar, or even a racist. It was, in the parlance of liberalism, a \u201cfalse choice\u201d to assert that Obamacare couldn\u2019t be a floor wax and a dessert topping.\n\nAnd all of this \u2014 every bit of it \u2014 is their own fault. The bedraggled cadres of Obama\u2019s defenders are valiantly trying to blame it all on Republican sabotage: The Obama administration had to keep the whole thing secret for fear of \u201cfeeding the opposition,\u201d in the words of a Washington Post reconstruction of the debacle. But when you read the stories, if you replace phrases like \u201ckeep the Republicans from finding out\u201d with the more accurate \u201ckeep the public from finding out,\u201d you\u2019ll get a better sense of things. The Obama White House, by which I mean the Obama campaign, was desperate to keep voters from grasping the scope of its misinformation campaign until after the election. And then, after the election, it was afraid to let the public know what they\u2019d been misinformed about.\n\nThe argument against gloating holds that conservatives should want Obamacare to succeed even though we said all along it couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s such an odd argument, particularly since the Democrats\u2019 lies were of the first order, in that Obama\u2019s aides actually debated and discussed them, no doubt presenting them to focus groups like a jar of \u201cnew Shimmer, now an erectile-dysfunction treatment and paint thinner all in one!\u201d\n\nWhen a product is brought to market and the market discovers \u2014 as it eventually has to \u2014 that the advertising wasn\u2019t merely a tissue of lies but a geological stratum of lies, the utterly fair and justified response from the critics is \u201cI told you so!\u201d \u2014 not \u201cLet\u2019s make this thing bipartisan now.\u201d That\u2019s particularly true when the president continues to lie. On September 26 he said, \u201cIf you already have health care, you don\u2019t have to do anything\u201d to keep your plan. On November 3 he said, \u201cWhat we said was you could keep [your plan] if it hasn\u2019t been changed.\u201d Who knew that dozens of flat declarative statements \u2014 \u201cYou can keep your plan. Period\u201d \u2014 were trailed by a cloud of asterisks like so many invisible fireflies?\n\nIf Obamacare had been a shining success from Day One, do you think the Democrats would be in the mood to share the credit? Then why should Republicans be in more of a mood to share the blame?\n\nFeel free to cross your fingers that reality will bend to the gravitational pull of Obama\u2019s stellar ego, his invincible hubris. As for me, I\u2019ll be sitting on the sidelines cheering on Nemesis, with joy in my heart.\n\n\u2014 Jonah Goldberg is the author of The Tyranny of Clich\u00e9s, now on sale in paperback.

It is no laughing matter that millions of Americans\u2019 lives have been thrown into anxious chaos as they lose their health insurance, their doctors, their money, or all three. Nor is it particularly amusing to think of the incredible waste of time and tax dollars that has gone into Obamacare\u2019s construction. And the still-unfolding violence that this misbegotten legislation will visit on the economy and our liberties is not funny either. This very magazine has been downright funereal about the brazen and unconstitutional seizure of one-sixth of the economy, and rightly so.\n\nBut come on, people.\n\nIf you can\u2019t take some joy, some modicum of relief and mirth, in the unprecedentedly spectacular beclowning of the president, his administration, its enablers, and, to no small degree, liberalism itself, then you need to ask yourself why you\u2019re following politics in the first place. Because, frankly, this has been one of the most enjoyable political moments of my lifetime. I wake up in the morning and rush to find my just-delivered newspaper with a joyful expectation of worsening news so intense, I feel like Morgan Freeman should be narrating my trek to the front lawn. Indeed, not since Dan Rather handcuffed himself to a fraudulent typewriter, hurled it into the abyss, and saw his career plummet like Ted Kennedy was behind the wheel have I enjoyed a story more.\n\nAlas, the English language is not well equipped to capture the sensation I\u2019m describing, which is why we must all thank the Germans for giving us the term \u201cschadenfreude\u201d \u2014 the joy one feels at the misfortune or failure of others. The primary wellspring of schadenfreude can be attributed to Barack Obama\u2019s hubris \u2014 another immigrant word, which means a sinful pride or arrogance that causes someone to believe he has a godlike immunity to the rules of life.\n\n#ad#The hubris of our ocean-commanding commander-in-chief surely isn\u2019t news to readers of this website. He\u2019s said that he\u2019s smarter and better than everyone who works for him. His wife informed us that he has \u201cbrought us out of the dark and into the light\u201d and that he would fix our broken souls. The man defined sin itself as \u201cbeing out of alignment with my values.\u201d We may be the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for, but at the same time, everyone has been waiting for him. Or as he put it in 2007, \u201cEvery place is Barack Obama country once Barack Obama\u2019s been there.\u201d\n\nIn every tale of hubris, the transgressor is eventually slapped across the face with the semi-frozen flounder of reality. The Greeks had a god, Nemesis, whose scythe performed the same function. It was Nemesis who lured Narcissus to the pool where he fell in love with his own reflection. Admittedly, most of Nemesis\u2019s walk-on roles were in the Greek tragedies, but in the modern era, comeuppance-for-the-arrogant is more often found in comedies, and the \u201crollout\u201d of Healthcare.gov has been downright hilarious. (I put quotation marks around \u201crollout\u201d because the term implies actual rolling, and this thing has moved as gracefully as a grand piano in a peat bog.) But, as the president says, \u201cit\u2019s more than a website.\u201d Indeed, the whole law is coming apart like a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 yacht in rough waters. The media feeding frenzy it has triggered from so many journalistic lapdogs has been both so funny and so poignant, it reminds me of nothing more than the climax of the classic film Air Bud, when the lovable basketball-playing golden retriever finally decides to maul the dog-abusing clown.\n\nDuring the government shutdown, Barack Obama held fast, heroically refusing to give an inch to the hostage-taking, barbaric orcs of the Tea Party who insisted on delaying Obamacare. It was a triumph for the master strategist in the White House, who finally maneuvered the Republicans into revealing their extremism. But we didn\u2019t know something back then: Obama desperately needed a delay of Healthcare.gov. In his arrogance, though, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to admit it. The other possibility is that he is such an incompetent manager, who has cultivated such a culture of yes-men, that he was completely in the dark about the problems. That\u2019s the reigning storyline right now from the White House. Obama was betrayed. \u201cIf I had known,\u201d he told his staff, \u201cwe could have delayed the website.\u201d\n\nThis is how you know we\u2019re in the political sweet spot: when the only plausible excuses for the administration are equally disastrous indictments.\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Katrina, it took about five minutes for liberals to cast the chaos and confusion of the disaster as a searing indictment of not just the Bush administration but of conservatism itself. Whatever the merits of that argument (and there are not many), Katrina was at least a surprise. The October 1 deadline for Obamacare was set by Obama\u2019s own administration years ago \u2014 and it caught them completely off guard. The president may now claim that he knew nothing, but he must have wondered why Henry Chao, Healthcare.gov\u2019s chief project manager, set the bar of success at sea level last March: \u201cLet\u2019s just make sure it\u2019s not a Third World experience.\u201d At this point, it could only be more of a Third World experience if Healthcare.gov required enrollees to pay with chickens.\n\n#page#Regardless, if Obama were a tenth as good a politician as he thinks he is, he could have blamed the delay he desperately needed on his political enemies, calling them \u201chostage-takers\u201d even as he secretly understood they had rescued his most beloved hostage from his own incompetence. Instead, on September 26, he went out and told an adoring audience: \u201cOn October 1, millions of Americans\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0will finally be able to buy quality, affordable health insurance. In five days.\u201d \u201cStarting Tuesday,\u201d he added, Americans will be able to \u201ccompare and purchase affordable health-insurance plans, side by side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak \u2014 same way you shop for a TV on Amazon. You just go on and you start looking, and here are all the options.\u201d\n\nCome on, that\u2019s hilarious.\n\n#ad#Okay, maybe he didn\u2019t know then what bad shape the website was in. But how to explain the president\u2019s remarks three weeks after the debut of Healthcare.gov? Even if it\u2019s true that the president only hears about bad news from the newspapers, by then the papers were full of reports that Healthcare.gov worked about as well as a Somali superconducting supercollider. Obama knew that Healthcare.gov was a fiasco, and that the \u201cnavigators\u201d used the same broken website that consumers had spent days poking at like Chinatown chickens in an abandoned tic-tac-toe machine, desperately but fruitlessly trying to get some reward.\n\nAnd yet the president strode out into the Rose Garden anyway and told millions of Americans they could buy their coverage by phone. He told them the 1-800 operators were standing by. He told them it would take only 25 minutes to apply. None of these things were true. In his mind, Obama surely thought he was putting the issue to rest, like Zeus declaring that Odysseus would make it home alive. But here\u2019s the thing: All that Zeus needs to do to make something happen is to say it. When Barack Obama says things, reality doesn\u2019t bend to his will. Somehow, Barack Obama has been led to believe that his job is simply to go out and say things, as if saying things alone could change facts on the ground. So while I\u2019m sure he thinks he sounded like the voice of eternal truth, in reality he sounded like the infomercial spokesman played by Chevy Chase in the old Saturday Night Live skit:\n\n\nWIFE (GILDA RADNER): New Shimmer is a floor wax!HUSBAND (DAN AYKROYD): No, new Shimmer is a dessert topping!WIFE: It\u2019s a floor wax!HUSBAND: It\u2019s a dessert topping!WIFE: It\u2019s a floor wax, I\u2019m telling you!HUSBAND: It\u2019s a dessert topping, you cow!SPOKESMAN [enters quickly]: Hey, hey, hey, calm down, you two.

It is no laughing matter that millions of Americans\u2019 lives have been thrown into anxious chaos as they lose their health insurance, their doctors, their money, or all three. Nor is it particularly amusing to think of the incredible waste of time and tax dollars that has gone into Obamacare\u2019s construction. And the still-unfolding violence that this misbegotten legislation will visit on the economy and our liberties is not funny either. This very magazine has been downright funereal about the brazen and unconstitutional seizure of one-sixth of the economy, and rightly so.\n\nBut come on, people.\n\nIf you can\u2019t take some joy, some modicum of relief and mirth, in the unprecedentedly spectacular beclowning of the president, his administration, its enablers, and, to no small degree, liberalism itself, then you need to ask yourself why you\u2019re following politics in the first place. Because, frankly, this has been one of the most enjoyable political moments of my lifetime. I wake up in the morning and rush to find my just-delivered newspaper with a joyful expectation of worsening news so intense, I feel like Morgan Freeman should be narrating my trek to the front lawn. Indeed, not since Dan Rather handcuffed himself to a fraudulent typewriter, hurled it into the abyss, and saw his career plummet like Ted Kennedy was behind the wheel have I enjoyed a story more.\n\nAlas, the English language is not well equipped to capture the sensation I\u2019m describing, which is why we must all thank the Germans for giving us the term \u201cschadenfreude\u201d \u2014 the joy one feels at the misfortune or failure of others. The primary wellspring of schadenfreude can be attributed to Barack Obama\u2019s hubris \u2014 another immigrant word, which means a sinful pride or arrogance that causes someone to believe he has a godlike immunity to the rules of life.\n\n#ad#The hubris of our ocean-commanding commander-in-chief surely isn\u2019t news to readers of this website. He\u2019s said that he\u2019s smarter and better than everyone who works for him. His wife informed us that he has \u201cbrought us out of the dark and into the light\u201d and that he would fix our broken souls. The man defined sin itself as \u201cbeing out of alignment with my values.\u201d We may be the ones we\u2019ve been waiting for, but at the same time, everyone has been waiting for him. Or as he put it in 2007, \u201cEvery place is Barack Obama country once Barack Obama\u2019s been there.\u201d\n\nIn every tale of hubris, the transgressor is eventually slapped across the face with the semi-frozen flounder of reality. The Greeks had a god, Nemesis, whose scythe performed the same function. It was Nemesis who lured Narcissus to the pool where he fell in love with his own reflection. Admittedly, most of Nemesis\u2019s walk-on roles were in the Greek tragedies, but in the modern era, comeuppance-for-the-arrogant is more often found in comedies, and the \u201crollout\u201d of Healthcare.gov has been downright hilarious. (I put quotation marks around \u201crollout\u201d because the term implies actual rolling, and this thing has moved as gracefully as a grand piano in a peat bog.) But, as the president says, \u201cit\u2019s more than a website.\u201d Indeed, the whole law is coming apart like a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 yacht in rough waters. The media feeding frenzy it has triggered from so many journalistic lapdogs has been both so funny and so poignant, it reminds me of nothing more than the climax of the classic film Air Bud, when the lovable basketball-playing golden retriever finally decides to maul the dog-abusing clown.\n\nDuring the government shutdown, Barack Obama held fast, heroically refusing to give an inch to the hostage-taking, barbaric orcs of the Tea Party who insisted on delaying Obamacare. It was a triumph for the master strategist in the White House, who finally maneuvered the Republicans into revealing their extremism. But we didn\u2019t know something back then: Obama desperately needed a delay of Healthcare.gov. In his arrogance, though, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to admit it. The other possibility is that he is such an incompetent manager, who has cultivated such a culture of yes-men, that he was completely in the dark about the problems. That\u2019s the reigning storyline right now from the White House. Obama was betrayed. \u201cIf I had known,\u201d he told his staff, \u201cwe could have delayed the website.\u201d\n\nThis is how you know we\u2019re in the political sweet spot: when the only plausible excuses for the administration are equally disastrous indictments.\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Katrina, it took about five minutes for liberals to cast the chaos and confusion of the disaster as a searing indictment of not just the Bush administration but of conservatism itself. Whatever the merits of that argument (and there are not many), Katrina was at least a surprise. The October 1 deadline for Obamacare was set by Obama\u2019s own administration years ago \u2014 and it caught them completely off guard. The president may now claim that he knew nothing, but he must have wondered why Henry Chao, Healthcare.gov\u2019s chief project manager, set the bar of success at sea level last March: \u201cLet\u2019s just make sure it\u2019s not a Third World experience.\u201d At this point, it could only be more of a Third World experience if Healthcare.gov required enrollees to pay with chickens.\n\n#page#Regardless, if Obama were a tenth as good a politician as he thinks he is, he could have blamed the delay he desperately needed on his political enemies, calling them \u201chostage-takers\u201d even as he secretly understood they had rescued his most beloved hostage from his own incompetence. Instead, on September 26, he went out and told an adoring audience: \u201cOn October 1, millions of Americans\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0will finally be able to buy quality, affordable health insurance. In five days.\u201d \u201cStarting Tuesday,\u201d he added, Americans will be able to \u201ccompare and purchase affordable health-insurance plans, side by side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak \u2014 same way you shop for a TV on Amazon. You just go on and you start looking, and here are all the options.\u201d\n\nCome on, that\u2019s hilarious.\n\n#ad#Okay, maybe he didn\u2019t know then what bad shape the website was in. But how to explain the president\u2019s remarks three weeks after the debut of Healthcare.gov? Even if it\u2019s true that the president only hears about bad news from the newspapers, by then the papers were full of reports that Healthcare.gov worked about as well as a Somali superconducting supercollider. Obama knew that Healthcare.gov was a fiasco, and that the \u201cnavigators\u201d used the same broken website that consumers had spent days poking at like Chinatown chickens in an abandoned tic-tac-toe machine, desperately but fruitlessly trying to get some reward.\n\nAnd yet the president strode out into the Rose Garden anyway and told millions of Americans they could buy their coverage by phone. He told them the 1-800 operators were standing by. He told them it would take only 25 minutes to apply. None of these things were true. In his mind, Obama surely thought he was putting the issue to rest, like Zeus declaring that Odysseus would make it home alive. But here\u2019s the thing: All that Zeus needs to do to make something happen is to say it. When Barack Obama says things, reality doesn\u2019t bend to his will. Somehow, Barack Obama has been led to believe that his job is simply to go out and say things, as if saying things alone could change facts on the ground. So while I\u2019m sure he thinks he sounded like the voice of eternal truth, in reality he sounded like the infomercial spokesman played by Chevy Chase in the old Saturday Night Live skit:\n\n\nWIFE (GILDA RADNER): New Shimmer is a floor wax!HUSBAND (DAN AYKROYD): No, new Shimmer is a dessert topping!WIFE: It\u2019s a floor wax!HUSBAND: It\u2019s a dessert topping!WIFE: It\u2019s a floor wax, I\u2019m telling you!HUSBAND: It\u2019s a dessert topping, you cow!SPOKESMAN [enters quickly]: Hey, hey, hey, calm down, you two. New Shimmer is a floor wax and a dessert topping! Here, I\u2019ll spray some on your mop . . . and some on your butterscotch pudding . . .HUSBAND [eating while wife mops]: Mmmmm, tastes terrific!WIFE: And just look at that shine! But will it last?SPOKESMAN: Hey, outlasts every other leading floor wax, two to one. It\u2019s durable, and it\u2019s scuff-resistant.HUSBAND: And it\u2019s delicious!\n\n\nBut not as delicious as the tears of his praetorian guard. First of all, every day Jay Carney looks even more like a little boy who put on his dad\u2019s suit. You have to wonder what goes on in his mind, as a former journalist, when he tells his former colleagues that \u201cthe American forces have been completely destroyed with minimal Iraqi casualties.\u201d (Oh, wait, that was Baghdad Bob. I get them confused.) And what about Dan Pfeiffer going on the Sunday shows to insist that no American should believe his or her lying eyes?\n\nOn October 1, Media Matters for America \u2014 David Brock\u2019s sweatshop for twentysomethings who couldn\u2019t get an internship at the DNC \u2014 raced to defend the crashed website as a sign of success, in keeping with the idea that all Obama failures are further proof of his awesomeness: \u201cRight-Wing Media Frantically Spin Obamacare Exchange Success Into Failure.\u201d Taking their cues from the White House, MMFA insisted that the administration\u2019s only mistake was failing to appreciate just how popular the program would be. \u201cRight-wing media were quick to jump on the problems, declaring them a sign of the law\u2019s shortcomings rather than its popularity,\u201d cackled MMFA\u2019s Samantha Wyatt. She went on to mock various Fox News journalists and, of course, Rush Limbaugh for calling the disastrous launch a disaster. Meanwhile, Ezra Klein called the initial popularity of the site exactly \u201cwhat the Republicans were afraid of.\u201d Now even Klein has turned on the White House \u2014 more in sorrow than in anger, to be sure. When the White House has lost Ezra Klein\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0well, it still has the cast of Morning Joe. No, wait \u2014 even they have abandoned the president. Heh.\n\nTo be sure, there was some apparent plausibility to the claim that the website was working only too well, because the White House lied so confidently about what was going on. Few critics grasped at first that this was going to be the Charlie Sheen of IT launches \u2014 a spectacularly mortifying failure, punctuated with desperate shrieks of \u201cWinning!\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until later that we learned that, of the uncountable hordes flocking to the federal exchanges that first day, the number who actually registered for an insurance plan totaled exactly six. At that rate, Obamacare would reach its target of 7 million enrollees around the year 5013, or 3022 a.o. (Anno Obamae).\n\n#page#Obviously, the website will get better. It could hardly get worse, short of a finding that it causes irritable bowel syndrome. Indeed, on the second day, the number of enrollees hit 248, according to the same leaked contractor memos. But the site needs to be able to handle tens of thousands of enrollees per day.\n\nMore recent numbers suggest that the federal exchange has enrolled about 27,000 customers since October 1, which amounts to about half an enrollee for each Obamacare \u201cnavigator.\u201d (Someone in the White House is surely thinking, \u201cHey, let\u2019s just hire another 14,000,000 navigators! Problem solved.) In order to rationalize that dismal performance the White House now must insist that they always knew the numbers would be tiny at the outset.\n\n#ad#Here\u2019s a number that isn\u2019t tiny: Five million people \u2014 and counting \u2014 have lost their health insurance, despite the president\u2019s years of \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d promises. The president has apologized, sort of. He says he\u2019s \u201csorry\u201d that people have found themselves in a bad situation because of \u201cassurances\u201d he made. But no one has lost their insurance because of the president\u2019s assurances, they\u2019ve lost their insurance because of the president\u2019s law. If a captain has the lifejackets filled with cement, his assurance that \u201cyou can keep your lifejacket\u201d is only half the crime.\u00a0\u00a0Obama knew the lifejackets wouldn\u2019t work.\u00a0In 2010 he admitted that 8 to 9 million people in the individual market might \u201chave to change their coverage\u201d because of the law. And that\u2019s just the individual market. Millions more will eventually lose the insurance they like because of Obamacare, according to the administration\u2019s own internal estimates.\n\nThe cancellations aren\u2019t a bug, they\u2019re a feature, and the president lied about it over and over again.\n\nAnd now the Democratic panic has begun. Terry McAuliffe almost lost his bid for Virginia governor because of Obamacare. Senator Kay Hagan of North Carolina has seen her double-digit lead against a generic Republican all but vanish. Henry \u201clet\u2019s avoid a Third World experience\u201d Chao is now insisting he never got the memo warning of \u201climitless\u201d security problems. And, just this week, the big dog himself, Bill Clinton, announced he thinks Obama should honor the \u201ccommitment\u201d the federal government made to Americans that they can keep their health insurance. Clinton\u2019s brazenness is a marvel to behold, given that he surely knew all along that Obama\u2019s \u201cincorrect promise\u201d \u2014 to borrow the New York Times\u2019 latest desperate euphemism \u2014 was a lie and yet he happily defended the law. Moreover, he knows that honoring that commitment would, in fact, permanently gut Obamacare.\n\nWhich is one reason why Republicans are proposing a law that would do exactly that with the \u201cKeep Your Health Care Plan\u201d Act. This creates a miserable predicament for Democrats. As Jim Geraghty writes: \u201cCan you picture the ads? Senator [Insert Democrat Here] voted for the Obamacare law that took away your health insurance\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0and then voted against the Keep Your Health Plan Act.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are in the opening stages of the crab-in-a-trap phase. When crabs are caught in a trap they will try to climb out of their predicament. The problem is that other crabs will grab the would-be-escapee and pull them down. When the really nasty infighting starts, as countless Democrats look to fix or delay the law, I\u2019m looking forward to pointing out that such an agenda was once considered \u201cextreme,\u201d even \u201cracist,\u201d by Democrats.
