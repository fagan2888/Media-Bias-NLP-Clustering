Riley & Co. to buy bankrupt Wet Seal.\n\n\"Versa Capital is pleased to have prevailed in our effort to acquire Wet Seal's business,\" CEO Gregory Segall said.\n\nVersa, headquartered in Philadelphia, has invested in several other retail businesses, including Sport Chalet, Avenue, Eastern Mountain Sports and Bob's Stores. Mergers & Acquisitions reported the firm was raising a fund in February.\n\nWet Seal filed a motion on March 13 with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in Wilmington for a replacement $20 million DIP from Mador Lending LLC, an affiliate of Versa. Wet Seal says it needs the court to approve the new financing because Versa's auction success could cause its B. Riley loan to mature soon \u0096 five days after B. Riley's plan sponsorship agreement is terminated, according to court papers.\n\nA hearing on the DIP is scheduled for March 18.\n\nWhen Wet Seal filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 16, it filed a DIP motion under which B. Riley, a Los Angeles investment firm, would provide the DIP loan to get the retailer through its bankruptcy case, and in the end, give B. Riley an 80 percent stake in the business.
