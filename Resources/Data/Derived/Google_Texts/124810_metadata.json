REID / KITSAP SUN Tanya Spoon gives a tour Wednesday of her Manette Clinic, which is under construction in Bremerton. MEEGAN M. REID / KITSAP SUN\n\nBy Tad Sooter, Kitsap Sun\n\nBREMERTON, Wash. \u2014 Tanya Spoon had begun to feel less like a nurse and more like an assembly line worker.\n\nPatients cycled through her Silverdale, Washington, office in rapid succession. Spoon sometimes saw 25 a day, eking out what time she could for each visit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a mill,\u201d the nurse practitioner said, \u201clike a patient mill.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that patients were getting bad care, Spoon said. She just knew she could give them better care with more time. But paying the bills at a small family practice meant keeping the patient mill churning.\n\n\u201cI love giving good patient care,\u201d Spoon said. \u201cPart of my struggle with the system in place is I couldn\u2019t give the kind of care I wanted to give.\u201d\n\nSo about a year ago, Spoon began plotting an escape. She\u2019ll depart Silverdale, where she worked alongside Dr. William Minteer, to open a clinic Sept. 1 in Bremerton.\n\nFor Spoon, The Manette Clinic represents both a new medical practice and a new way of practicing medicine. The clinic will operate under what\u2019s called a direct primary care model. Patients will pay a flat monthly fee \u2014 $55 for single adults, $120 for families \u2014 to cover their primary care needs, things like routine physicals, sick visits, mental health counseling and sutures.\n\nTheir health insurance will never be billed for services at the clinic, though patients will be encouraged to carry catastrophic plans. Labs, medications and some vaccines will cost extra.\n\nPatients will have 24/7 access to Spoon by phone and email, and when they come to clinic for appointments their visits will last at least 20 minutes. Minteer will help at the clinic part time.\n\nBy cutting out insurance companies and dealing with patients directly, Spoon believes she can deliver more personalized care and keep her patients healthier.\n\n\u201cI think that kind of care is missing,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is get that back.\u201d\n\nA DIRECT APPROACH\n\nSpoon is far from the only disillusioned provider turning to direct primary care as an alternative to the standard fee-for-service system.\n\nThe direct care model emerged in Seattle in the 1990s, pioneered by Dr. Garrison Bliss. Bliss went on to found Qliance, a health clinic chain that expanded the direct care model to serve employees at major companies like Expedia.\n\nIn 2007, Washington became the first state to pass legislation defining and regulating direct patient-provider relationships. Direct care can even be offered through the state\u2019s health exchange, provided it\u2019s coupled with a high deductible plan. About 30 direct care practices were operating in the state in 2014, according to an Office of the Insurance Commissioner report.\n\nDirect practices appeal to providers like Spoon who feel the fee-for-service model, in which insurance carriers reimburse providers for individual visits and procedures, promotes a rushed, quantity-over-quality approach to care. Dr. Jared Hendler, a primary care physician who\u2019s practiced in Bainbridge Island, Washington, for 36 years, believes the fee-for-service model stifles relationships with patients and leads to more errors.\n\n\u201cThe faster you work, the more you\u2019re overworked, the more mistakes you make,\u201d he said.\n\nHendler knows the \u201cpatient mill\u201d feeling well. At one point his island practice served more than 3,000 patients. He\u2019d see 40 on some days.\n\n\u201cI was running around like a lunatic,\u201d Hendler recalled. \u201cI had to find a different system. For a small office, it really was impossible to continue.\u201d\n\nAbout seven years ago Hendler switched to a direct care model, setting up a monthly membership fee based on age, and no longer billing insurance. His patients \u2014 all of them \u2014 left.\n\n\u201cIt was a really new concept,\u201d Hendler said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t connect to it.\u201d\n\nHendler now has about 100 patients, enough for his practice to break even. Like many direct care providers in the state, he took a hit from the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, as more people became insured and others felt a squeeze from rising premium costs. Direct practices reported a 35 percent drop in patients in 2014, according to the insurance commissioner report.\n\nHendler hasn\u2019t collected a paycheck since switching to a direct care model. The change still was worth it, he said. He can spend as much time as he needs with patients, giving them the kind of care he would want to receive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept for no pay.\u201d\n\nA NEW CLINIC\n\nSpoon, a Manette resident herself, believes she\u2019s penciled out a business plan that will make her new clinic profitable.\n\nShe and Minteer saw about 4,000 patients in Silverdale. The Manette Clinic will open with about 600 patients. Spoon offered memberships to her existing patients first and plans to open admissions to the public by the end of August. The clinic had about 300 sign-ups as of last week.\n\nWith a fraction of the patients, she\u2019ll rely on low overhead to turn a profit. Cutting out insurance companies means far less paperwork and a smaller front office staff, Spoon said.\n\nSince patients will pay month-by-month, and can drop their membership at any time, Spoon will have added incentive to keep them healthy and happy.\n\n\u201cCustomer service has to come first,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s sometimes difficult from a provider standpoint.\u201d\n\nThe Manette Clinic is positioned to grow if Spoon\u2019s experiment proves successful. She took over an 1,800-square-foot former real estate office near the Manette Bridge, with enough space for more disillusioned docs to join her.\n\n\u201cI think other providers are going to want to come along and do this,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "A new way of practicing medicine", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/entertainment/life/a-new-way-of-practicing-medicine-ep-1234598033-362046751.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/manetteclinic01_22798805_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 448}, "type": "article", "description": "BREMERTON, Wash. \u2014 Tanya Spoon had begun to feel less like a nurse and more like an assembly line worker.", "title": "A new way of practicing medicine"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/manetteclinic01_22798805_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "BREMERTON, Wash. \u2014 Tanya Spoon had begun to feel less like a nurse and more like an assembly line worker.", "site": "https://twitter.com/knoxnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A new way of practicing medicine"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-kns-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4176\"", "article_summary": "For Spoon, The Manette Clinic represents both a new medical practice and a new way of practicing medicine.\n\u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s sometimes difficult from a provider standpoint.\u201dThe Manette Clinic is positioned to grow if Spoon\u2019s experiment proves successful.\nThe direct care model emerged in Seattle in the 1990s, pioneered by Dr. Garrison Bliss.\nDirect care can even be offered through the state\u2019s health exchange, provided it\u2019s coupled with a high deductible plan.\nHendler hasn\u2019t collected a paycheck since switching to a direct care model."}
