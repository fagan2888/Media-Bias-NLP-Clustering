Bridich said Sunday afternoon, in an interview with MLB Network radio, that he hasn\u2019t made a decision on Weiss\u2019 future.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got another year on his contract, everybody knows that,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have meetings and sit down and talk and see what the right fit is.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time or place yet to say 100 percent yes or no. He\u2019s got to have a part in that too. We\u2019ll let the season play out before we make that determination.\u201d\n\nWeiss, who has a 203-269 record as skipper of the Rockies, last month said that he wants to at least manage through his contract.\n\n\u201cYes. I want to see this thing through. I\u2019ve got a lot invested here. I\u2019ve spent 14 years with this organization. I love this coaching staff. I think the staff has really done a great job.\n\n\u201cAnd I like the players, what they\u2019re made of. We have got to get better, of course, but I think there is a good foundation. I like the makeup of these guys and the way they compete. I love that part of it.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies hired Weiss on a one-year contract in 2013 him to replace Jim Tracy. After that season, they gave Weiss a contract extension through 2016. But his boss then was GM Dan O\u2019Dowd, who left after last season and was replaced by Bridich.\n\nHere\u2019s a clip of Bridich\u2019s radio interview:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Jeff Bridich,Walt Weiss", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Jeff Bridich said Sunday afternoon, in an interview with MLB Network radio, that he hasn't made a decision on Walt Weiss' future.", "title": "GM Jeff Bridich: Walt Weiss' future with Rockies not certain", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/09/20/walt-weiss-future-with-rockies-not-certain-gm-jeff-bridich-will-let-the-season-play-out/20947/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/06/walt-weiss-betancourt-495x413.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Jeff Bridich said Sunday afternoon, in an interview with MLB Network radio, that he hasn't made a decision on Walt Weiss' future.", "title": "Walt Weiss\u2019 future with Rockies not certain; GM Jeff Bridich \u2018will let the season play out\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/09/20/walt-weiss-future-with-rockies-not-certain-gm-jeff-bridich-will-let-the-season-play-out/20947/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/06/walt-weiss-betancourt-495x413.jpg", "creator": "@nickgroke", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Jeff Bridich said Sunday afternoon, in an interview with MLB Network radio, that he hasn't made a decision on Walt Weiss' future."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf71\"", "article_summary": "Walt Weiss told The Denver Post last month, without blinking, that he wants to return next season to manage the Rockies.\nBridich said Sunday afternoon, in an interview with MLB Network radio, that he hasn\u2019t made a decision on Weiss\u2019 future.\nI love that part of it.\u201dThe Rockies hired Weiss on a one-year contract in 2013 him to replace Jim Tracy.\nAfter that season, they gave Weiss a contract extension through 2016.\nBut his boss then was GM Dan O\u2019Dowd, who left after last season and was replaced by Bridich."}
