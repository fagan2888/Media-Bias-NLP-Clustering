Rick Perry and Attorney General Greg Abbott have fought the federal government on health care, voting rights and environmental regulations. On spending, new programs and regulations, federal officials have been hard-pressed to find friendly ears in the Lone Star State.\n\nNow, with Perry fading from the state\u2019s political scene, the 2014 contest for governor could determine whether Texas takes a different approach to the White House and the federal government.\n\nAbbott, the likely Republican contender for governor, promises much of the same, saying he would make sure Texas isn\u2019t \u201csucked into a California-style form of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be going from the general on the battlefield to the commander in chief of these operations,\u201d said Abbott, who often jokes that his job consists almost entirely of suing the federal government. \u201cI will continue the efforts to ensure that we get government out of ruining the lives of people and out of their pockets and pocketbooks.\u201d\n\nWendy Davis, the likely Democratic nominee for governor, says she would view the federal government as more friend than foe. And she criticized the glee that Abbott seems to take in tackling the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part and parcel of what\u2019s wrong in politics today, the idea that we brag about the fact that we sue, that we create an adversary, when we could be working together to show that we are big enough, to show that we are wise enough and thoughtful enough to sit down at the table with people that we disagree with and find a way to help the communities that we serve,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people understand in Texas that that\u2019s not working for us.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of the biggest disagreements between the two. And it\u2019s sure to be a major focus for many voters, partly because it reflects the national political debate over the Affordable Care Act and the polarized reaction to President Barack Obama, whose unpopularity in Texas could be a major drag on Davis\u2019 efforts.\n\nHealth care\n\nThe health care law remains the biggest source of contention between the Obama administration and Texas leaders. Perry and Abbott are against the law. Abbott was among the attorneys general who unsuccessfully challenged the law last year, and Perry has steadfastly refused to have state government participate in its implementation.\n\nAbbott said recently that his administration would never support spending Texas resources to help implement the program. He opposes the expansion of Medicaid to cover more of the working poor, even though the federal government has offered to pay most of the cost of the added benefit.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the disaster of how the federal government operates being captured by the disastrous Obamacare law,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cWe know that people, family and businesses know far better how to run their lives than government.\u201d\n\nDavis says that stance hurts Texans who need help. She said the new health care law would not only provide health care for the uninsured but boost jobs in the medical industry.\n\n\u201cThis will be a very distinct difference going forward in the general election, whether we take $100 billion of Medicaid expansion in Texas,\u201d she said. \u201cOur tax dollars that we\u2019ve paid in that will go elsewhere if we don\u2019t reclaim it, that\u2019s going to be a key issue.\u201d\n\nDavis said that Texas, at the least, should \u201cget our tax dollars back to Texas.\u201d\n\nAbbott says that too much federal interference will lead to bigger state budgets that aren\u2019t sustainable in the long term.\n\n\u201cI will continue to ensure that Texas doesn\u2019t get sucked into a California-style form of government that has too close of a relationship to the big government programs coming out of D.C.,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth candidates expect to raise tens of millions of dollars and cruise in their primaries, though each faces opposition. At least four other Republicans are seeking the nomination, including former state party chairman Tom Pauken. Davis has one opponent so far. The deadline for candidates to join the race is Dec. 9, and the primaries are in March.\n\nVoter ID\n\nAbbott has also been active in defending the state\u2019s voter identification law and its redistricting plan, both of which the Obama administration has challenged in court.\n\nDavis supports federal efforts to declare the voter ID law unconstitutional, arguing that it disproportionately harms minority voters. And she has fought Abbott on the state\u2019s approach to redistricting, including an original Senate redistricting plan that tore apart Davis\u2019 Senate district to make it more Republican.\n\nDavis won that fight, but last year, Abbott won a Supreme Court ruling that spared Texas Republicans from implementing federally drawn maps that would have been favorable to Democrats.\n\nVarious redistricting issues are still pending in court, but next year\u2019s elections will be held with congressional and legislative districts largely similar to the current ones.\n\nAbbott defends the voter ID law, which requires voters to show photo identification at the polls. He argues it\u2019s a good step to secure elections but allows ample ways for voters to obtain the proper ID.\n\nDavis said that with the lawsuits, Abbott is wasting taxpayer money to \u201cpad his political r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re paying for both sides of that equation,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow Gromer Jeffers Jr. on Twitter at @gromerjeffers.\n\nWORKING WITH WASHINGTON\n\nWhere Democrat Wendy Davis and Republican Greg Abbott, the leading candidates for governor, stand on working with Washington:\n\nAFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\nAbbott: Rejects the law and would fight any effort to use Texas resources to implement it.
