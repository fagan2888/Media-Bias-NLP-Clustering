Daily Caller reported the Sunflower State health care adviser not only had a bench warrant out for her arrest in Shawnee County, but also a troubled financial history including bankruptcy in 2003 and a 2007 civil charge from Midwest Checkrite. Wells was not aware of the bench warrant until she was contacted by Daily Caller.\n\nNavigators are tasked with helping the uninsured sign up for health insurance through the online federal insurance exchange.\n\nJon Stewart, chief executive officer for HCHC, said Wells was up front about her debt problems early on in the hiring process. As far as he\u2019s concerned, it\u2019s a good thing.\n\n\u201cThis actually puts her in a position to be really sensitive to the needs of these folks,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nThe warrant for Wells\u2019 arrest didn\u2019t show up in a background check conducted for the Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved, which helps run the navigator program in Kansas alongside HCHC. Stewart said the background check was intended to reveal felony convictions and \u201cperson-to-person\u201d crimes, not Wells\u2019 unpaid civil debt.\n\nThe Lawrence Journal-World reports:\n\nThe warrant stemmed from $5,236.59 in unpaid debt Wells had accumulated at Stormont Vail HealthCare in Topeka, she said. Wells said the debt was the result of a hospital stay from when she was uninsured. She added that she wasn\u2019t aware of the warrant until the Daily Caller reporter contacted her, and she has since rectified the issue with the courts and the warrant is no longer active.\n\nSen. Robert Olson, R-Olathe, said Kansas should have followed states like Missouri, Florida, Tennessee and Ohio in instituting greater control and regulation of Obamacare navigators. Olson is chair of the Senate Financial Institutions and Insurance committee.\n\n\u201cI definitely think we should have, and that\u2019s something we need to think about doing, because someone that can\u2019t pay their own bills and has the problems this lady has \u2026 sounds to me like she can\u2019t even handle her own business, let alone the people of the state of Kansas,\u201d Olson said.\n\nHe floated the idea of implementing greater oversight from the Senate to ensure quality candidates fill such positions in the future.\n\nLinda Sheppard, director of health care policy and analysis for the Kansas Insurance Department, said her agency doesn\u2019t have the authority to exert greater control over navigators, but \u201ccertainly the Legislature could take a look at this issue if the interest is there.\u201d\n\nContact Travis Perry at travis@kansaswatchdog.org, or follow him on Twitter at @muckraker62.
