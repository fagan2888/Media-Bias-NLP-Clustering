An important pioneer of virtual reality who currently does research for Microsoft, he\u2019s become a media sensation in spite of his understated, almost shy manner.\n\nHis latest book, published in the U.S. last May, covers an enormous amount of ground in what\u2019s often a personal and eccentric style. \u201cWho Owns the Future?\u201d describes in especially stark terms the Internet\u2019s false promise to artists \u2013 \u201ctrinkets tossed into the crowd spread illusions and false hopes\u201d \u2014 and the larger creative class. \u201cThe clamor for online attention only turns into money for a token minority of ordinary people, but there is another new, tiny class of people who always benefit,\u201d he writes on the book\u2019s opening page. \u201cThose who keep the new ledgers, the giant computing services that model you, spy on you, and predict your actions, turn your life activities into the greatest fortunes in history.\u201d\n\nThe book received mostly positive reviews, though some objected to his proposed solution \u2013 that citizens be reimbursed with micro-payments whenever their personal information led to the generation of revenue. Since people\u2019s Facebook preferences help companies sell, for instance, and the work of human translators provide the basis for online translation programs, these people should be compensated: \u201cA new kind of middle class, and a more genuine, growing information economy, could come about if we could break out of the \u2018free information\u2019 idea and into a universal micro-payment system.\u201d\n\nWe spoke to the Berkeley-based Lanier about \u201cWho Owns the Future?,\u201d the explosion of surveillance, Amazon\u2019s policies, Kickstarter and his role as a critic both inside and outside the beast.\n\nLet\u2019s start by talking about \u201cWho Owns the Future.\u201d The book got a lot of attention, became a sort of manifesto for some people; it also got mixed reviews. Some were very approving and others argued with your point of view. My sense is that the most criticism came from your argument that we needed a system of micro-payments, that we needed people to be reimbursed for data collection, and I wonder if that criticism made you rethink your suggestion at all?\n\nWell, look, that\u2019s exactly where the criticism should lie. In general, there\u2019s a meta point I want to make: Criticism is easy and coming up with a better solution is hard. And if what I wanted to do was be well liked \u2026\n\nI mean, you can present any position and you can find people who are sympathetic with you. So you could do a Google-knows-best book and there will be people who like that \u2014 or you can do this is all horrible and some people will like that. The much harder thing to say is here are some problems, and here is maybe a better way to do things. And of course it\u2019s essential, if you\u2019re going to propose solutions, critics have to be critical of those solutions.\n\nSo on the one hand, I absolutely would expect any alternative presented by anybody who\u2019s concerned and thinks differently to be subject to rigorous criticism \u2014 and that goes for anything, not just this stuff, but for global climate change, or population issues or fresh water, any of the big challenges we face. So I think it\u2019s great, I think exactly the right thing happened. I appreciate the criticism. The only kind of criticism I don\u2019t appreciate is the people who are convinced of a kind of inevitability to the way things are. That the way we think of technology is the only way we could think of technology. The way technology evolves is some kind of deterministic thing that couldn\u2019t be any different than it was. Those people I have no patience for.\n\nBut if there are people who are critical, I want them to be critical, but I want them to take the same responsibility I did. And if they believe I pointed out a real problem, I want them to go to the trouble to think of a different approach.\n\nFair enough. Because you\u2019re talking about criticism, I want to expand that idea a little bit. You say in the book that you don\u2019t want to be \u201can academic or a remote observer.\u201d What tradition do you see yourself in? Do you see yourself as a social critic, and if so what earlier figures or eras do you see yourself connected to?\n\nThat\u2019s a really interesting question and it\u2019s one I\u2019ve asked myself a lot, and the truth is I have trouble finding an answer. It\u2019s actually kind of tricky. I think there are some ways in which our situation is similar to the past and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time describing how I think our world today is similar to the world at the end of the 19th century.\n\nAfter industrialization and before unionization came along, with child labor and endless workdays and pollution and everything?\n\nTo a degree. I don\u2019t want to overstate it. But there are some structural similarities, some pattern similarities. But I have a little trouble really coming up with precedents. I mean, I\u2019m interested, for instance, in physicists who became alarmed about the spread of nuclear weapons and attempted to become politically active because they felt they had an obligation to.\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting lineage; who are you thinking of specifically?\n\nWell, I just think it would be ridiculous and pretentious of me to compare myself to any specific person but a variety of central physicists in our time, some of whom I\u2019ve had the privilege of knowing, became active in trying to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation. And some didn\u2019t, some viewed it as an inevitability.\n\nOn the side of the ones who didn\u2019t see, who saw it as an inevitability, I knew Edward Teller a bit, and spoke with him a number of times about it. And he was an amazing visualizer, he was actually a really interesting creative guy, but I disagreed with his take on the politics of it. He was a little too lost in a sense of inevitability that might have been a bit colored by the benefits he received from his position and so forth \u2026 so that definitely had an impact on me.\n\nAt the same time, so I have a friend named Bill Joy who is another sort of technology figure. He created a lot of the basic foundations of UNIX that are in everything; part of what he did is in your phone and all that. And he also helped start the Sun Microsystems Co., which was one of the giants for a while.\n\nAnyway, he wrote an essay called \u201cWhy the Future Doesn\u2019t Need Us\u201d where he was talking about how our technological deterministic past is leaving people behind, and he ended up just kind of getting depressed and disabled himself from a sense of gloom about it. And I really think if you allow yourself to get lost in looking at the dangers without getting involved in potential solutions, you make yourself vulnerable to a disabling depression. And if you are a sort of remote intellectual who just observes things, you can feel a little superior in that way when you have that feeling, but when you\u2019re a technologist who tries to fix things, it\u2019s terribly depressing to be in that position, so I think you really have to struggle.\n\nI\u2019m thinking a little bit of the criticisms that have come from people like Evgeny Morozov who doesn\u2019t like \u201csolutionism,\u201d as he calls it. And the problem with that is it leaves you with this like \u2026 if you reject that, if you think solutionism in itself is a problem \u2026 It sort of defines you as either incompetent, where you\u2019re saying, well, I could never be a technologist. Or you have to become a Rousseauian fundamentalist or something where everything is going backwards and everything forward and future-looking must be worse than anything past oriented \u2026?\n\nYou end up in a sort of depressing cul-de-sac. So I\u2019ve been trying to chart a middle course where I still love technology. I\u2019m still basically a technologist, I still want to make the world better \u2014 and yet I also want to be a realist about how we can screw things up and how we have screwed things up. I want to try to synthesize all of that in one package, and that is really hard to do. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m doing it effectively but I\u2019m certainly trying. It is actually hard to know exactly what precedent that follows on.\n\nAnother thing that makes up the foundation of your argument is the middle class: You argue throughout this book that the middle class is not a natural, inevitable class. It\u2019s something that was built by various kinds of interventions \u2014 unions, tax codes, copyright, tenure, things like that. It goes against some kinds of economic theory. I wonder what the roots of your thinking are \u2014 could you explain that a little bit, it\u2019s a very important, and in some ways counterintuitive, notion.\n\nWell, I mean, the position I take is not that middle classes can never arise naturally but that they often have not, and arguably don\u2019t. And this actually, it\u2019s a question that\u2019s unresolved in economics. There\u2019s tremendous passion about this question. But if we look at, say ,the controversy over Piketty\u2019s book \u2014\n\nWe\u2019re talking about Thomas Piketty\u2019s \u201cCapital in the 21st Century\u201d\u2026\n\nYeah, I looked at that book and my first reaction was, I\u2019m too lazy to have done this but I\u2019m so glad he did all this work of gathering all this data. And there was a sense of like, duh, of course, I mean everybody kind of knows this. And yet for those who hold a different belief, they\u2019re gonna henpeck his data and try to find holes in it, and I suggest that\u2019s what\u2019s going on right now to try to create doubt about it.\n\nAnyway, there\u2019s not a consensus about whether middle classes arise naturally, there\u2019s not even a consensus over whether they\u2019re desirable, which is more shocking to me. Whether they do arise naturally under some circumstances or not, I think we can all agree that they don\u2019t always arise naturally, at the very least. And at that point, we can ask the question of whether they\u2019re desirable.\n\nI view them as not only desirable but necessary for any kind of stable, sustainable economy or for viable democracy. And if we get that far then we should recognize that creating a strong middle class is a necessary moral, ethical and practical, pragmatic project that it fires on all cylinders. That whatever your belief system \u2014 whether you like markets better than government, or government better than markets, or some sort of societal vision better than either of those. Whatever the hell you believe in, whatever you like, middle classes are your friend and I believe that we can get to that point and become interested in how to promote them even if we might not agree entirely on every step to get there. I think all the roads converge at that point.\n\nThe left and the right have had different takes on the middle class. Marxism and related strains obviously champion the proletariat or the workers over the burghers. And some kinds of right/ Adam Smith-inspired or Joseph Schumpeter-driven economic and political thought championed what we now call the \u201cjob creators.\u201d It seems to me that the two political extremes have overlooked the middle class, which as you say is the basis for virtually everything. It\u2019s almost like we need to rethink what the middle class means, what its role is in the whole thing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon Q&A: Tech visionary Jaron Lanier on Thomas Piketty, Jeff Bezos and Amazon, how to save the creative class", "author": "Scott Timberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon Q&A: Tech visionary Jaron Lanier on Thomas Piketty, Jeff Bezos and Amazon, how to save the creative class", "title": "Jaron Lanier on Internet and middle class: \u201cWe have screwed things up\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/01/jaron_lanier_on_internet_and_middle_class_we_have_screwed_things_up/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/jaron_lanier2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon Q&A: Tech visionary Jaron Lanier on Thomas Piketty, Jeff Bezos and Amazon, how to save the creative class", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/jaron_lanier2.jpg", "title": "Jaron Lanier on Internet and middle class: \u201cWe have screwed things up\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Jaron Lanier on Internet and middle class: \u201cWe have screwed things up\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, amazon, Art in Crisis, Comcast, Editor's Picks, Evgeny Morozov, Facebook, Glenn Greenwald, innovation, Jaron Lanier, Jeff Bezos, Kickstarter, Thomas Piketty, virtual reality", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc41\"", "article_summary": "Another thing that makes up the foundation of your argument is the middle class: You argue throughout this book that the middle class is not a natural, inevitable class.\nIt\u2019s almost like we need to rethink what the middle class means, what its role is in the whole thing.\nThe left and the right have had different takes on the middle class.\nAnd if we get that far then we should recognize that creating a strong middle class is a necessary moral, ethical and practical, pragmatic project that it fires on all cylinders.\nThe only kind of criticism I don\u2019t appreciate is the people who are convinced of a kind of inevitability to the way things are."}
