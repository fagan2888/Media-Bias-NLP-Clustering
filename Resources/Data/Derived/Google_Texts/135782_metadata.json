Then there are the small-town dogs who think they own the alleys, and like to pick on newbie dogs.\n\nTwo years ago, Ruth Pettigrew moved to Hotchkiss in western Colorado, population 1,400, in part because it bills itself as the \u201cfriendliest town around.\u201d To her surprise, she discovered a pattern of unfriendliness when she and her leashed pets encountered other canines in town, she told the North Fork Merchant Herald.\n\n\u201cMy own dogs have been attacked three times \u2014 unprovoked \u2014 all by dogs that were without supervision,\u201d she reports. Neighbors advised her to \u201cget bigger dogs\u201d and \u201ccarry a weapon,\u201d \u201cdrive elsewhere,\u201d or keep her dogs \u201cinside a fence.\u201d So Pettigrew realized she (and her dogs) needed to be in \u201ccombat-fitness\u201d shape.\n\nWhat does the well-dressed dog walker wear when expecting trouble from aggressive dogs? Pettigrew suggests that you and your dogs don Kevlar bulletproof vests, strap Tasers and Mace to your arms, and hang a bat or club from a belt. And wear steel-toed boots on your feet \u2014 it\u2019s a jungle out there.\n\nWriters on the Range is a service of High Country News (hcn.org).\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Marston: Walking your dog?
