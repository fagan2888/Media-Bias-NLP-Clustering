This analysis found that 26,000 illegal aliens who were released instead of removed went on to commit another 58,000 crimes soon after release.

In the face of these dangers, Border Patrol agents continue to show exemplary restraint and professionalism. Since 2010, agents have been assaulted with rocks 1,713 times. In these situations, agents responded and used deadly force 43 times which regrettably resulted in the death of 10 individuals.\n\nAccording to the Police Executive Research Forum, preventing Border Patrol agents from defending themselves against stone-casting or even Molotov-cocktail-tossing illegal aliens \u201ccould create a more dangerous environment [for officers] in rural or desolate areas, often alone, where concealment, cover, and egress is not an option.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security commissioned PERF\u2019s paper and quickly ignored it.\n\nBorder Patrol officers may not shoot at \u201ca moving vehicle merely fleeing from agents.\u201d Similarly, as the Daily Caller revealed, agents \u201cshould not place themselves in the path of a motor vehicle or use their body to block a vehicle\u2019s path.\u201d\n\nFisher now wants to deploy Tasers, pepper spray, and pellet guns as alternatives to the Border Patrol\u2019s standard firearms, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThis whole thing sounds like a line from Monty Python and the Holy Grail (\u201cRun away!
