Foster, Ph.D. for the Heritage Foundation\u2019s site under the title \u201cMake the Tax Cuts Permanent.\u201d That was back in June of 2008.\n\nAs Dr. Foster was penning that fairy tale, Lehman Brothers had just lost $2.8 billion in the second quarter of 2008. They had already laid off thousands of people. They were weeks away from total collapse.\n\nThe housing bubble burst before the ink was dry on the Heritage Foundation\u2019s rosy report. Foster wrote, \u201cTax relief helped to restore robust economic growth following the Clinton recession.\u201d\n\nIn short: they were wrong. Really wrong. Outrageously, egregiously, shockingly wrong.\n\nThis same billionaire David Koch-affiliated group said in 2001 the Bush tax cuts would effectively pay off the federal debt; substantially increase family income; increase personal savings; create more job opportunities.\n\nSeriously, pay off the federal debt. They said that. It\u2019s still on the Internet.\n\nWhat the unpaid-for Bush tax cuts did, along with two wars lobbed onto a credit card, is create more debt the Republicans now pretend is a sharknado, bubonic, mandatory abortion, Muslim, science-based, Happy Holidays, minorities-voting, greenhouse-gas-reducing, gay weddings plague.\n\nSo as credibility goes - the well-funded Heritage Foundation has very little. And they played a huge, well-documented role in the recent government shutdown. Why? They opposed ObamaCare and want it defunded.\n\nDidn\u2019t they tout the individual mandate starting in 1989? Wasn\u2019t that the conservative alternative to HillaryCare? Isn\u2019t RomneyCare in Mass-achusetts based on the mandatory private insurance model the Heritage Foundation had been championing for decades?\n\nYes. Why are they opposed to it now? Hmm.\n\nStuart Butler, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation, in an op-ed last year, denied the Heritage Foundation invented ObamaCare: He wrote, \u201cBut the version of the health insurance mandate Heritage and I supported in the 1990s had three critical features. First, it was not primarily intended to push people to obtain protection for their own good, but to protect others. Like auto damage liability insurance required in most states\u2026 Second, we sought to induce people to buy coverage primarily through the carrot of a generous health credit or voucher, financed in part by a fundamental reform of the tax treatment of health coverage, rather than by a stick.\n\n\u201cAnd third, in the legislation we helped craft that ultimately became a preferred alternative to ClintonCare, the \u2018mandate\u2019 was actually the loss of certain tax breaks for those not choosing to buy coverage, not a legal requirement,\u201d Butler concluded.\n\nSo Butler is saying that if ObamaCare was intended to protect others instead of for your own good, he\u2019d support it? Because the other two he lists are in ObamaCare/The ACA: tax incentives and \u201closs of certain tax breaks\u201d is basically the fine for not having insurance next year.\n\nDid our government really shut down because the best think-tank-parsing they can come up with is that the motives for being covered aren\u2019t altruistic?\n\nIn a word: yes.\n\nThe tea party/Heritage Foundation/Koch brothers trinity have co-opted the Revolutionary War\u2019s Gads-den Flag, the yellow flag with a rattle snake warning \u201cdon\u2019t tread on me.\u201d A more apt illustration would be a snake eating its own tail while accusing Obama of cannibalism.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse for the country: when conservatives don\u2019t get their way - or when they do?\n\nDuring the government shutdown, Republicans in the House were parroting the Heritage Foundation and Dr. Foster once again about the debt ceiling. Basically, that defaulting on the nation\u2019s debt - the debt the Heritage Foundation claimed would be wiped out by tax cuts they pushed \u2013 wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. The title of Foster\u2019s January directive was, \u201cDebt Ceiling: Default Not at Issue, Federal Spending Is.\u201d\n\nIn 2008 when the sky was actually falling, the Heritage Foundation said it was sunny and reason to keep unpaid-for tax cuts (during a time of war) permanent.\n\nIn Vegas the house loves bad gamblers. There the Heritage Foundation would get their room comped and a free pass to the all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.\n\nBut outside of a casino, their ideas are clearly not beneficial to the House. Or the rest of the country.\n\n\u2011 Tina Dupuy\u2019s nationally syndicated columns are distributed exclusively by Cagle Cartoons, Inc.", "article_metadata": {"msvalidate.01": "6F0F769B18C1F1E5145E5D36120FA2DD", "google-site-verification": "Z9m9q_xL4Yy_Msowqv-zI38cEeVjdxTAdaVjki3tOdU", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailysunnews.com/news/2013/oct/23/heritage-foundation-group-cried-individual-mandate/", "type": "article", "title": "Heritage Foundation the group that cried individual mandate"}, "viewport": "width=1020", "description": "\u201c(The Bush tax cuts) produced a more growth-oriented tax policy for the long term, helping the economy to weather current storms arising in the housing and capital markets,\u201d wrote J.D.
