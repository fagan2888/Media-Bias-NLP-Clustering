Lisa Randall, a Harvard cosmologist, speculates that the comet did not act alone: That a disc of dark matter at the heart of the galaxy knocked the comet out of orbit and sent it on its path toward the earth. The solar system\u2019s orbit through the Milky Way allowed this disc to trigger comet strikes every 30-35 million years \u2014 which coincides with periodic waves of extinctions on earth.\n\nBut what is dark matter and why does it have anything to do with us? Randall explains how this might have worked \u2014 complete with charts \u2014 in \u201cDark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe.\u201d\n\n\u201cA good theory is an act of the informed imagination \u2014 it reaches toward the unknown while grounded in the firmest foundations of the known,\u201d Maria Popova wrote of Randall\u2019s book in The New York Times Sunday Book Review. \u201cIf correct, Randall\u2019s theory would require us to radically reappraise some of our most fundamental assumptions about the universe and our own existence.\u201d\n\nWe spoke to Randall from New York City. The interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nSo you were concerned with the density of dark matter, and gave a lecture about your research. How did you end up dealing with the dinosaurs?\n\nI was giving a talk in Arizona, and [physicist] Paul Davies said, \u201cSo is this what was responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs?\u201d Or something of that nature. I had no idea what he was talking about. But then he told me about the weak evidence for periodicity that\u2019s in the crater record.\n\nWhat it really boiled down to is \u2014 is there something in our galactic environment that could trigger periodic meteor strikes? There\u2019s some marginal evidence that large-impact craters occur on a periodic basis \u2014 between 30 and 35 million years. Small stuff hits all the time. But the question is whether, with large stuff, there\u2019s something predictive there \u2014 that it\u2019s not just random. The suggestion for this is the Oort Cloud. Thousands of times farther away than Earth is from the sun, is a bunch of icy bodies that are very weakly bound \u2026 They are so far from the sun that its gravitational force keeps them in a weakly-bound orbit. And they turn into long-period comets. Sometimes their paths get so distorted that they enter the inner solar system.\n\nAnd sometimes, if you have some kick, it might go out of the orbit altogether. So the question becomes, \u201cWhat could trigger comet strikes \u2014 the dislodging of objects \u2014 on a periodic basis?\u201d\n\nOther people had tried to answer this question. But nothing on the ordinary matter sector seemed to work. But if there is this dark disc, as the solar system goes around the Milky Way, it also bobs up and down, along the galactic plane \u2026 How often it does that has to do with what\u2019s in the galactic plane, because that\u2019s the force that makes [the solar system] go up and down. Without dark matter, it would do it every 55 or 60 million years \u2014 much too slowly. But if there is dark matter, it would happen much more quickly \u2026 The idea is that [the solar system] goes through this dark disc, and that would trigger comet strikes.\n\nSo the comet would be already going through the solar system, but it\u2019s this dark-matter disc that would send it our way \u2026\n\nThat would send it out of its orbit. Some of them would go outside the solar system altogether. Some of them would go hurtling toward the inner solar system, where it could hit the earth.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about dark matter for a minute. It\u2019s sort of an unfortunate name, isn\u2019t it?\n\nI think so. It\u2019s dark in the sense of being obscure. But dark stuff we see, because it absorbs light. That\u2019s why I prefer the term \u201ctransparent matter.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s nothing really evil about dark matter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon talks to a Harvard cosmologist about the theory behind her new book \u201cDark Matter and the Dinosaurs\"", "author": "Scott Timberg", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon talks to a Harvard cosmologist about the theory behind her new book \u201cDark Matter and the Dinosaurs\"", "title": "What really wiped out the dinosaurs: \u201cIt\u2019s only when you have large aggregations of dark matter that it can have this enormous effect\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/05/what_really_wiped_out_the_dinosaurs_its_only_when_you_have_large_aggregations_of_dark_matter_that_it_can_have_this_enormous_effect/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/dinosaur_fossils.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon talks to a Harvard cosmologist about the theory behind her new book \u201cDark Matter and the Dinosaurs\"", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/dinosaur_fossils.jpg", "title": "What really wiped out the dinosaurs: \u201cIt\u2019s only when you have large aggregations of dark matter that it can have this enormous effect\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "What really wiped out the dinosaurs: \u201cIt\u2019s only when you have large aggregations of dark matter that it can have this enormous effect\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, dark matter, Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs: The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe, Dinosaurs, Editor's Picks, extinction, Lisa Randall, Physics, Science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s why I prefer the term \u201ctransparent matter.\u201dBut there\u2019s nothing really evil about dark matter.\nBut what is dark matter and why does it have anything to do with us?\nSo you were concerned with the density of dark matter, and gave a lecture about your research.\nWithout dark matter, it would do it every 55 or 60 million years \u2014 much too slowly.\nLet\u2019s talk about dark matter for a minute."}
