New depositions and court records suggest that staff at Park Royal Hospital in Fort Myers may have lied to police and lawyers about their screening of the job application of a man who admitted sexually assaulting mentally-ill patients in 2013, according to court records reviewed by the Naples Daily News.

Benjamin Bland was sentenced to five years in prison last year, and the lawyer of 11 women who are suing the hospital said a confidential settlement isnâ€™t yet finalized, according to the Daily News. Officials from the facility owners, Acadia Healthcare, did not reply to interview requests from the Daily News.
