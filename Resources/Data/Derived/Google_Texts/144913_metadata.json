Prior, MD, and colleagues wrote in an analysis of the program, published in the Jan. 13 issue of JAMA.\n\nPrior, who is a practicing internist and program co-administrator, said the Franklin County experience shows that community-wide cardiovascular prevention programs can reduce mortality, morbidity, and costs even in poor, high-risk areas.\n\nHe noted that the Affordable Care Act should create new opportunities to implement and measure the effects of community-wide comprehensive cardiovascular prevention efforts similar to the Franklin County model.\n\n\"The classic healthcare model is to treat patients when they show up, but a lot of people never show up or they show up only when they are really sick,\" he told MedPage Today. \"With the concentration on community health in the Affordable Care Act there should be more opportunity for community-based efforts to remove barriers to preventive cardiovascular care.\"\n\nNurses, Volunteers Met Patients Where They Were\n\nPrior said the Franklin Cardiovascular Health Program (FCHP) was conceived in the late 1960s, and the program expanded with increased grant support in subsequent decades.\n\nThe FCHP adapted a community-based clinic model that included nurses and trained community volunteers to provide services such as blood pressure monitoring and smoking cessation help at a variety of sites including town halls, church basements, schools, and work sites.\n\n\"Early encounters emphasized screening, but FCHP staff also encouraged return for monitoring, counseling, and periodic rescreening,\" Prior and colleagues wrote in JAMA.\n\nMonitoring results were sent to the patient's physician, and people with uncontrolled medically-treatable cardiovascular risk factors were sent to their physician. Electronic tracking helped FCHP staff follow patients, inform physicians, and assess outcomes.\n\nOutcomes and measures examined in the observational study included resident participation; hypertension and hyperlipidemia detection, treatment, and control; smoking quit rates; hospitalization rates from 1994 through 2006, adjusted for median household income; and mortality rates from 1970 through 2010, adjusted for household income and age.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2010, more than 150,000 FCHP patient encounters were recorded in Franklin county, which had just 22,444 residents in 1970 and 30,768 in 2010, averaging more than five encounters per resident.\n\nIn the first four years of FCHP, about 50% of the county's residents were screened for hypertension. Cholesterol screening was introduced in 1986, and 40% of the county's adults had been screened through the program within 5 years.\n\nRates of hypertension and cholesterol control improved dramatically, and smoking and cardiovascular hospitalization rates declined during the 4 decade period.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nBetween 1975 and 1978 hypertension control in the county increased by 24.7%.\n\nBetween 1986 and 2010 cholesterol control rose by 28.5%.\n\nBetween 1996 and 2000 smoking quit rates increased by 21%\n\nBetween 1996 and 2000, 17 fewer hospital discharges than expected per 1,000 Franklin County residents occurred (adjusted for household income).\n\nFranklin County Death Rate Lower Than Expected\n\nTotal mortality for Franklin County, adjusted for household income, was greater than expected in the the 1960s (observed - expected [O - E], 7.9/100,000; P=0.36), but there were significantly fewer deaths than expected between 1970-1989 (O - E, -60/100,000; P<0.001) and 1990-2010 (O - E, -41.6 deaths/100,000; P=0.005).\n\nThe researchers noted that Franklin County mortality rate divergences from the state of Maine averages were greater when adjusted for income.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Franklin County age- and income-adjusted mortality rates were not significantly different from the rest of the state, but during 1970-1989, despite static relative income, mortality rates in the country were the lowest in Maine (O - E, -60.4 deaths/100,000; 95% CI minus 97.9-minus 22.8; P<0.001). During 1990-2000, relative income in the country declined compared with other Maine counties, but Franklin County continued to show lower mortality than predicted by income (O - E, -41.6 deaths/100,000; 95% CI minus 77.2-minus 5.8; P=0.005), with rates comparable with those of more affluent counties, the researchers noted.\n\nThey further noted that two recent national analyses -- the Institute for Health Care Improvement's Counties of Interest Health Outcomes analysis and the latest County Health Rankings and Roadmaps report -- both identified Franklin County as having \"unusually favorable current health indicators compared with the rest of Maine.\"\n\n'Franklin County Model Could Work in Other Areas'\n\nIn an editorial published in the same issue of JAMA, Darwin R. Labarthe, MD, MPH, and Jeremiah Stamler, MD, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, wrote that there is good evidence to suggest that the community-wide outreach was largely responsible for the improved outcomes in Franklin County.\" Demonstrated reductions in total and cardiovascular mortality contrast with the concurrent experience of other Maine counties and the state as a whole,\" they wrote. \"Attribution of outcomes to the overall intervention program is far more plausible than the alternative interpretation of no effect.\"\n\nThey also wrote that there is reason to believe the Franklin County model can be successful in other low-income rural and even urban areas.\n\n\"The Franklin County, Maine, program demonstrates significant accomplishments in one northern U.S. rural community that have made a difference in cardiovascular outcomes,\" they wrote. \"The experience deserves consideration as a model for other communities to emulate, adapt, and implement.\"\n\nFrom the American Heart Association:\n\nThe Franklin Cardiovascular Health Program (FCHP) was funded by the Franklin Memorial Hospital and grants from the Federal Health Underserved Rural Area grant program, the Bingham Program, the Regional Medical Program, Maine Bureau of Health, Maine Department of Human Services, the United Way and others. Researchers N. Burgess Record, MD, and Sandra S. Record, RN, reported that they and Franklin Memorial Hospital hold minority interests in a company formed to develop and market the software used in FCHP.\n\nReviewed by F.
