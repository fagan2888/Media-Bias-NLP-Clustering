A man woke up early Thanksgiving morning to his dog barking--then saw the smoke.

The fire was burning outside the homeowner's front door, according to Springs police, who were called out to the home on the 3000 block of Purgatory Drive to investigate. The man dumped water on the fire and was able to get much of it out before firefighters arrived.

The fire is now being investigated as arson. The homeowner told police he and a friend got in an argument over the phone shortly before he went to bed, and believes the friend started the fire.

Police tell 11 News they are still investigating what led up to the fire, but have confirmed it was intentionally started.

The homeowner, who is in his 60s or 70s, was taken to the hospital as a precaution. He did not suffer any significant injuries.
