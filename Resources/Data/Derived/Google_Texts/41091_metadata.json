Now, open enrollment is back for those still in need.\n\n\"I'm one of the lucky ones,\" retired military officer Gilda Williams said. \"A lot [people] never had health care until the Affordable Care Act was passed.\"\n\nWilliams doesn't need the ACA. But she's done her homework and she urges her uninsured family members to sign up for the health coverage.\n\n\"For me, those are the people I took care of as a doctor. It's personal for me,\" said Karen DeSalvo, acting assisting secretary of health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \"My sister, last year, for the first time in years got health insurance on the market place and it's a relief for all of our family.\"\n\nDeSalvo is a former New Orleans health commissioner and said an estimated 100,000 Louisianans enrolled in the market place last year.\n\n\"This is a chance for people who have been going to bed at night worrying if they are going to go bankrupt because they're going to get sick, to not have to have that fear anymore,\" DeSalvo said.\n\nDeSalvo said that the plan includes care, hospitalization and medicines. She added that about six out of 10 people have enrolled for less than $100 a month.\n\n\"It's actually cheaper than that in some situations,\" Williams added. \"It depends on the individual's income.\"\n\nDeSalvo said that compared to other cities, New Orleans clinics, hospitals and health departments did a terrific job getting people of all walks of life to enroll.\n\n\n\n\"You have a high number of people who work part time jobs. But the way the program is set now everybody will have the opportunity,\" Williams said.\n\n\n\nHere are some key dates to remember:\n\n\n\nDec. 31 - Coverage ends for 2014 marketplace plans\n\n\n\nJan. 1 - Coverage can begin for 2015 marketplace plans\n\n\n\nFeb. 15 - Open enrollment ends\n\n\n\nFurther information can be found on the Healthcare.gov website.
