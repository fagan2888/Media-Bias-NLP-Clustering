But results from a new study conducted by researchers at Johnson & Johnson show we may be soon be able to prevent this deadly disease from spreading. Six out of 12 monkeys in which a vaccine was tested not only resisted the virus, but also produced antibodies against it.\n\n\u201cDespite great progress in HIV treatments, HIV remains one of the greatest global health threats of our time, with millions continuing to be infected each year,\u201d said Dr. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer and worldwide chairman of pharmaceuticals for Johnson & Johnson. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to develop a vaccine that prevents HIV in the first place.\u201d\n\nProducing an HIV vaccine has been so difficult not only because the virus kills the immune system\u2019s T cells, which are supposed to mount an attack against invading pathogens, but also because it employs a number of tactics to evade the immune system. The virus can also mutate incredibly quickly, making it difficult for immune cells to identify it, and it\u2019s able to acquire proteins in the body that mask it from an immune response. The vaccine currently being tested may counter all these factors, though.\n\nFor the study, the researchers used a two-pronged approach. They first gave 12 rhesus monkeys an injection with a modified version of the common cold, called adenovirus 26, which was meant to prime their immune systems \u2014 it also contained genetic bits of the monkey version of HIV, known as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Once this injection initiated an immune response, the monkeys were given another injection with proteins from the virus that normally help it stay hidden. Together, the injections worked to jumpstart the immune system and help it identify and fight large doses of the virus in six of the 12 monkeys. Some also began producing antibodies to the virus. And when the researchers tested the vaccine with a combined form of SIV and HIV, known as SHIV, 40 percent of the monkeys became protected.\n\nSIV isn\u2019t identical to HIV, however, they\u2019re similar enough to develop vaccines with, lead author Dr. Dan Barouch of the Ragon Institute at Harvard, MIT, and Massachusetts General Hospital, told NBC News. And the findings are promising enough that Johnson & Johnson has begun enrolling 400 human volunteers to begin phase 1 trials.\n\n\u201cI do think that their results are impressive,\u201d Dr. Mary Marovich, director of the vaccine research program at the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, told NBC. \u201cEven protecting half of the people who are exposed to the virus would be a major accomplishment. It could ultimately end the epidemic when you use in combination with other measures.\u201d\n\nSource: Barouch D, Alter G, Broge T, et al.
