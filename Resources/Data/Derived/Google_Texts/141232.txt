Like Ebola or disco, ObamaCare is the gift that just keeps on giving. It's an incredible success story that isn't just wrecking havoc across the lives of middle class people who had health insurance before ObamaCare wrecked theirs, it's also trashing socialized medicine everywhere.

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, aka ObamaCare, Uncle Sam will cut more than $800 million in payments to the city’s Health and Hospitals Corp, by Fiscal Year 2019. The president’s signature law slashes federal payments that long helped out hospitals serving lots of patients who lack insurance. The idea was that the law would boost coverage so dramatically the aid would be unnecessary. Except that illegal immigrants don’t qualify for ObamaCare coverage — and they make up a big chunk of the city’s uninsured population.

One more reason Obama needs to urgently legalize and ObamaCareize illegal aliens. And if this is happening here, you know it's happening in every major city with a big illegal population.

In ObamaCare’s first full year, New York was supposed to see its ranks of uninsured drop 7.2 percent. Oops: It only fell 1.3 percent. But the federal subsidies are dropping anyway. So the Health and Hospitals Corp. faces huge shortfalls that will leave it with just $44 million in cash reserves in FY 2019, down from $1 billion this year. In short, the city’s entire public-hospital system is headed to fiscal collapse, even with new taxpayer subsidies.

ObamaCare. It really, really works (at destroying things).
