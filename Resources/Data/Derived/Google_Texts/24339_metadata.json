On that day alone, 977 athletes were treated; the next day, 1,247 athletes were treated, exceeding the 1,600 athletes that were treated at the Special Olympics held in Korea four years ago. Organizers hoped to treat all 6,500 athletes this year.\n\nAthletes were given hearing aids, eyeglasses, and other items that had been donated by health care companies. Take-home gift bags filled with items like electric toothbrushes and new sneakers were provided.\n\nEvent organizers say that some of the Special Olympics athletes they meet have never been examined by any kind of doctor before.\n\nSince its founding, the Special Olympics Healthy Athletes has provided more than 1.6 million free health examinations that have been conducted in more than 130 countries.\n\nA few of the athletes left this year\u2019s Games with the ability to hear for the very first time.\n\n\u201cOn Sunday [July 26], 21 athletes received hearing aids for the first time in their lives,\u201d John Ohanesian, Director of Medical Services for the 2015 Special Olympics, told the Associated Press. \u201cIncluding three who couldn\u2019t hear at all until they got the hearing aids.\u201d\n\nA basketball player from India, born without ear canals, was one of the athletes treated. Dennis Van Vliet, an audiologist, told the Associated Press that he fit the basketball player\u2019s head with a device that transmits inner ear vibrations as sound to the brain.\n\n\u201cShe could hear right away,\u201d he said.\n\nOther athletes were tested by physical therapists on their strength, endurance and flexibility.\n\n\u201cThis has been really good for our athletes. Getting glasses [is] a big problem for our people, and now they have them,\u201d Ivory Coast swim team coach Akani Brou told the Associated Press. \u201cAnd after this, when we leave, we know they\u2019ll be really healthy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last week, 6,500 athletes from 165 nations traveled to Los Angeles to compete in the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Last week, 6,500 athletes from 165 nations traveled to Los Angeles to compete in the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.", "title": "Free Health Exams Offered to Special Olympics Athletes", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150804_SpecialOlympics.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-04T20:49:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KOmOMH"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Last week, 6,500 athletes from 165 nations traveled to Los Angeles to compete in the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games.", "title": "Free Health Exams Offered to Special Olympics Athletes", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150804_SpecialOlympics.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "sports", "published_time": "2015-08-04T16:05:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-04T20:49:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Special Olympics, World Games, healthcare, health clinic"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9881\"", "article_summary": "The Special Olympics Healthy Athletes Program, officially organized in 1997 to promote public health and serve those with intellectual disabilities, set up a makeshift medical clinic to provide free health care to athletes throughout the week.\nNot as widely known is the fact that many of the Special Olympics athletes do not have access to pristine health care.\nEvent organizers say that some of the Special Olympics athletes they meet have never been examined by any kind of doctor before.\nSince its founding, the Special Olympics Healthy Athletes has provided more than 1.6 million free health examinations that have been conducted in more than 130 countries.\nOn that day alone, 977 athletes were treated; the next day, 1,247 athletes were treated, exceeding the 1,600 athletes that were treated at the Special Olympics held in Korea four years ago."}
