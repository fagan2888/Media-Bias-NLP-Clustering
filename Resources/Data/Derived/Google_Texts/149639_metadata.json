They could either receive $100 that day or they could choose to wait an entire year for $500 dollars, if they could successfully follow one rule: They couldn\u2019t drink sugary beverages, including soda, sports drinks, or even juice for an entire year.\n\n\u201cWe called it the no-pop challenge,\u201d Jon\u2019s father Jason Sarisky said, according to the Associated Press. Jon and his brother weren\u2019t overweight children, and sugary beverages weren\u2019t a problem in their household. The yearlong challenge began as a way to teach the children self-discipline and the value of delayed gratification.\n\nJon Sarisky succeeds soda pop challenge.

He remember his last soda vividly and savored the Fanta Orange. \u201cI didn\u2019t brush my teeth until I couldn\u2019t taste it anymore,\u201d Jon said.\n\nThe contract Jon's parents wrote up resembled a binding law document, equipped with legal jargon that could intimidate any 11-year-old's reading skills. \u201cFor the purposes of this contract, the term \u2018drink\u2019 means to take a liquid into the mouth by means of a cup, bottle, straw or any other such device normally used for drinking. Consuming cereal, soup, and other such liquid foods is considered \u2018eating,\u2019 not drinking.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe parameters of the agreement were set in stone and made very clear. Jon, who was 10 years old and in sixth grade, and his parents signed the document with a start date of Jan. 4, 2014. \u201cAttempts to circumvent the spirit of this agreement are fraudulent and strictly prohibited,\u201d the contract concluded. \u201cThis is a zero-tolerance agreement. Therefore, under no circumstances will child receive a \u2018second chance.\u2019 Child takes full responsibility for honoring and upholding this contract.\u201d\n\nChoosing immediate reward over delaying gratification is one of the root problems when it comes to overeating and impulsive decisions. The inability to choose the larger delayed gratification reward, such as the $500, is not just a simple matter of poor self-control. According to Psychology Today, humans are what they believe they are; stigmatizing themselves is counterproductive to achieving goals.\n\nIf Jon didn\u2019t believe he had the willpower to survive a year without sugary liquids, then he wouldn\u2019t have made it. But instead, the anticipation of the future reward activates the medial orbital frontal cortex (mOFC), which secretes dopamine, a chemical in the brain that makes receiving a reward pleasurable. The mOFC is where the value of immediate gratification versus delayed gratification is calculated, and future rewards are imagined.\n\nEven though Jon was only 10 years old, he was able to make the decision to wait with confidence he could succeed in the challenge. He turned down drinks at friends\u2019 houses and sat through birthday parties and the recent holiday season without a sip of anything but water or unflavored milk to keep him hydrated.\n\nJon's parents gave him a rightfully earned giant ceremonial check for $500. He said he wasn't sure what he would do with the money. \u201cI might have just one pop, but I\u2019m not going to overdo it,\u201d Jon said, adding that soda is \u201cOK for a splurge now and then.\u201d\n\nSoda should remain a splurge. Sugar-sweetened beverages are the largest source of added sugars in American children and adolescent diets, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Childhood obesity has more than tripled in the last 30 years. Maybe more parents should start writing up yearlong sugar contracts.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "soda, pop, challenge, success, sixth, grader, gets, 500, after, quitting, soda, year", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A yearlong soda purge earned one 11-year-old boy a big check for $500.", "title": "11-Year-Old Who Quit Sugary Drinks For A Year Earns $500", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/soda-pop-challenge-success-sixth-grader-gets-500-after-quitting-soda-year-316210", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/04/soda-purge-contract.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A yearlong soda purge earned one 11-year-old boy a big check for $500.", "title": "11-Year-Old Who Quit Sugary Drinks For A Year Earns $500", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/soda-pop-challenge-success-sixth-grader-gets-500-after-quitting-soda-year-316210", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/04/soda-purge-contract.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/04/soda-purge-contract.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-01-04T12:00:06-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-04T12:00:02-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A yearlong soda purge earned one 11-year-old boy a big check for $500."}, "article_summary": "Jon Sarisky succeeds soda pop challenge.\nThe inability to choose the larger delayed gratification reward, such as the $500, is not just a simple matter of poor self-control.\nThe mOFC is where the value of immediate gratification versus delayed gratification is calculated, and future rewards are imagined.\nThe yearlong challenge began as a way to teach the children self-discipline and the value of delayed gratification.\n\u201cWe called it the no-pop challenge,\u201d Jon\u2019s father Jason Sarisky said, according to the Associated Press."}
