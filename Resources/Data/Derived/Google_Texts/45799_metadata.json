How likely are you to believe such claims against Charlie Trump?\u201d the robocall woman asks.\n\n\u201cIf you heard someone say, in an advertisement on radio or TV, that Charlie Trump is a supporter of an extreme Tea Party agenda, who would favor eliminating Social Security, how likely would you be to believe such claims?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome say that if Charlie Trump is elected, he will favor policies backed by big corporations and groups funded by the Koch Brothers.
