The company said it will expand the site to 31 acres and six blocks and add amenities and innovative workspaces to \"retain and attract the finest talent in the world.\"\n\n\"Caterpillar will stay in Peoria,\" Oberhelman reassured the crowd to loud applause.\n\nOberhelman had complained about the state's business climate under Illinois' previous governor, Democrat Pat Quinn, and the company's initial announcement that it was studying options for its headquarters led to concerns it could be considering a move. Company officials have said throughout the process that their intent was to stay put.\n\nTaking his turn at the podium, new Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner called it an \"outstanding day in Illinois and a great day for Peoria,\" and said Caterpillar could have gone anywhere.\n\nAnother major central Illinois employer, agribusiness firm Archer Daniels Midland Co., moved its international headquarters from Decatur to Chicago last year, and some had feared Caterpillar could make a similar departure.\n\nCaterpillar, the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, has about 2,400 employees in its main headquarters building and 800 others spread around Peoria's downtown.", "article_metadata": {"taxo_Sections": "News", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "timeCrawled": "20160526_05:09:37", "categoryName": "CCB - Manufacturing", "title": "Caterpillar staying put in Peoria, expanding headquarters", "taxo_Industries": "Manufacturing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150220/NEWS05/150229992/AR/0/AR-150229992.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "summary": "CEO Doug Oberhelman told a crowd of about 200 people today that after two years of study, the company will modernize its riverfront complex to include a three-tower building.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "CEO Doug Oberhelman told a crowd of about 200 people today that after two years of study, the company will modernize its riverfront complex to include a three-tower building.", "title": "Caterpillar staying put in Peoria\u2014and expanding HQ there", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150220/news05/150229992/caterpillar-staying-put-in-peoria-and-expanding-hq-there", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150220/NEWS05/150229992/AR/0/AR-150229992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "published_at": "2015-2-20", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//news05/150229992", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Caterpillar Inc.", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150220/NEWS05/150229992/AR/0/AR-150229992.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Caterpillar staying put in Peoria, expanding headquarters"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc373\"", "article_summary": "(AP) \u2014 Caterpillar Inc. announced Friday that it is keeping its global headquarters in downtown Peoria and expanding its corporate campus in what it called a re-commitment to the central Illinois city.\n\"Caterpillar will stay in Peoria,\" Oberhelman reassured the crowd to loud applause.\nBruce Rauner called it an \"outstanding day in Illinois and a great day for Peoria,\" and said Caterpillar could have gone anywhere.\nCaterpillar, the world's leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, has about 2,400 employees in its main headquarters building and 800 others spread around Peoria's downtown.\nAnother major central Illinois employer, agribusiness firm Archer Daniels Midland Co., moved its international headquarters from Decatur to Chicago last year, and some had feared Caterpillar could make a similar departure."}
