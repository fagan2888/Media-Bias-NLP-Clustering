More than half of those people signed up in the first three weeks of December.\n\nBut the process has been shrouded in confusion since the botched rollout of the website HealthCare.gov as officials have repeatedly changed rules and shifted deadlines to deal with the ensuing chaos.\n\nThe website, which was nearly disabled by glitches when it first launched in October, now works, Obama administration officials say, but there are still scattered troubles.\n\nEven people who make the deadline might end up without insurance come New Year\u2019s Day because of problems with incomplete enrollment files sent electronically by the federal government to insurance companies.\n\nAmid the confusion, federal officials have been calling and emailing insurance shoppers to emphasize they aren\u2019t considered enrolled until they\u2019ve paid their first month\u2019s premium for the plan.\n\nNew York\u2019s own health insurance exchange \u2014 run independently of the federal government\u2019s, as are 13 other state exchanges \u2014 has been one of the bright spots in the problem-plagued rollout, but even the New York site suffered outages Friday due to high demand.\n\nA Democratic senator warned Sunday the health care law could have a \u201cmeltdown\u201d and make it hard for his party to keep control of the Senate if problems aren\u2019t fixed.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s so much more expensive than what we anticipated, and if the coverage is not as good as what we had, you\u2019ve got a complete meltdown at that time,\u201d Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt needs to turn around,\u201d he said of the health care law. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that I think we will lose (the Senate). It\u2019s going to be extremely challenging.\u201d\n\nWith News Wire Services\n\nedurkin@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "ERIN DURKIN", "twitter": {"description": "Monday is the last day to sign up for federal health exchange insurance if people want their coverage to start in January.", "title": "Obamacare comes Monday for Jan. 1 coverage", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obamacare-enlistees-race-meet-monday-deadline-article-1.1555664", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1554713.1387824821!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obamacare21n-2-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "Barack Obama, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "parsely-author": "Erin Durkin", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "Barack Obama, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "nydn_tags": "obamacare", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obamacare-enlistees-race-meet-monday-deadline-article-1.1555664", "parsely-title": "Obamacare comes Monday for Jan. 1 coverage", "sailthru.date": "2013-12-22T12:53:17-0500", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare comes Monday for Jan. 1 coverage", "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-12-22T17:53:17", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1554713.1387824821!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obamacare21n-2-web.jpg", "description": "Monday is the last day to sign up for federal health exchange insurance if people want their coverage to start in January.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Monday is the last day to sign up for federal health exchange insurance if people want their coverage to start in January.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Politics", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Monday is the last day to sign up for federal health exchange insurance if people want their coverage to start in January.", "title": "Obamacare comes Monday for Jan. 1 coverage", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/obamacare-enlistees-race-meet-monday-deadline-article-1.1555664", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1554713.1387824821!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obamacare21n-2-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "obamacare", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1554713.1387824821!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obamacare21n-2-web.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "ERIN DURKIN", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc912\"", "article_summary": "Monday is the deadline to sign up for health insurance plans under Obamacare if buyers want their insurance to kick in at the beginning of the new year.\nAmid the confusion, federal officials have been calling and emailing insurance shoppers to emphasize they aren\u2019t considered enrolled until they\u2019ve paid their first month\u2019s premium for the plan.\nThe deadline has already been extended for a week \u2014 but with some problems persisting at a federal website that handles the health insurance exchanges, it\u2019s unclear if everyone who wants to buy a plan to start Jan. 1 will be able to.\nMore than 1 million people have signed up for insurance through federal and state exchanges, President Obama said Friday \u2014 a number that could continue to surge as people scramble to meet the deadline.\nMore than half of those people signed up in the first three weeks of December."}
