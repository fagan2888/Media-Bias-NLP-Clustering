They said to believe that Daniel Holtzclaw is innocent is to believe that the victims plotted to ruin him, and the physical evidence just happens to match. The State said Daniel Holtzclaw used his badge to victimize the accusers. Holtzclaw's defense team began presenting closing arguments during the afternoon portion of the trial. Holtzclaw's attorney Scott Adams thanked the jurors for their service during the length of the trial. Adams said this is a trial everyone involved will remember for the rest of their lives. He took the jury back to the date of June 18, 2014, the day sex crimes detectives came down to Springlake division to interview Holtzclaw. He said Holtzclaw was told by the captain that detectives were there to ask about one of his stops. Adams said Holtzclaw acknowledged making it. Adams said even though the alleged victim from that traffic stop told family about that incident and went to the Springlake division, no one ever called 911. He asked if anyone in their right mind would leave a loved one who claimed to have been sexually assaulted, and that the victim's boyfriend did. Adams says his day to day actions as an officer were made to look sinister. #DanielHoltzclaw @NEWS9 \u2014 Adrianna Iwasinski (@AIwasinski) December 7, 2015 Adams called into questions some of that victim's testimony, claiming there were no fingerprints/DNA found on Holtzclaw's squad car to match her story. He claims Oklahoma City detectives did a retroactive investigation on Holtzclaw, not proactive. Adams claims detectives created a profile of black women with prior drug and criminal offenses before they had even identified other accusers.
