Even so, this moment stood out as a new low for women, particularly millennial women. At a rally for Hillary Clinton in Manchester, New Hampshire, Madeleine Albright scolded young women for betraying their elders. \u201cWe can tell our story of how we climbed the ladder, and a lot of you younger women think it\u2019s done,\u201d she said, referring to the fight for women\u2019s equality. \u201cIt\u2019s not done. There\u2019s a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help each other!\u201d Clinton, standing next to her, doubled over in what looked like genuine, if shocked, laughter before recovering, taking a long drink of water and slowly shaking her head.The night before Albright\u2019s comment, the inimitable Gloria Steinem appeared on \u201cReal Time With Bill Maher,\u201d and gave her own assessment of millennial women. Maher asked the legendary feminist why young women don\u2019t support Clinton in greater numbers. \u201cWomen radicalize as they get older,\u201d Steinem said, as \u201cthey lose power.\u201d She went on, \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Where are the boys? The boys are with Bernie.\u2019\u201d The studio audience, which had been cheering and clapping to this point, was silent. Maher nearly choked. \u201cOh. Now if I said that, \u2018They\u2019re for Bernie because that\u2019s where the boys are,\u2019 you\u2019d swat me.\u201d\n\nI wish he was right, but I don\u2019t believe that she would. As a Ph.D. candidate who studies the recent history of rights, and as a millennial woman in the midst of my own late-20s feminist awakening, I was unsettled by how glibly Steinem and Albright dismissed the possibility that young women who support Sanders could have any legitimate political reasons for doing so. Their comments reveal a failure to see that, for many millennial women\u2014from poor single mothers to degree-holders saddled with student loan debt\u2014economic issues may loom larger in their minds and lives than more traditional \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d issues. At the UN\u2019s Fourth World Conference on Women, in 1995, Clinton gave a speech famously titled \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights\u201d; it is just as true that economic issues are women\u2019s issues.\n\nHistory is catching up with Steinem and Albright\u2019s generation of feminists. The feminist movement has, since its inception, willfully elided issues of race and class in its zeal to advance a clear-cut feminist agenda. In the late 1960s, radical feminists defined themselves against what they saw as the anti-feminism of the left, consciously privileging gender over other issues in a response to a leftist preoccupation with class and race.\n\nThey may have gotten away with this into the 1990s, when wages were increasing and the argument could be made that propping up women as such was good for all women, regardless of racial or economic difference. But since then we have seen the erosion of social protections, welfare in particular, the very programs the last President Clinton helped to erode. The financial crash of 2008 was a defining moment of many millennials\u2019 lives, women and men alike, arriving just as they were entering college or the professional world and profoundly redrawing the map of their future. In failing to understand why young women would support Sanders for economic reasons rather than Clinton for gendered ones, Steinem and Albright reveal that they missed the part of recent history where capitalism failed people, young people and women in particular, whose Great Recession reality hardly matches their parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 upwardly mobile hopes. And they seem to have missed the part of their own history, where the system they fought so hard to allow women to participate in\u2013the same system that Clinton, with her financial ties to Wall Street, and Albright, former board member on the New York Stock Exchange, do participate in\u2013not only failed to deliver liberation and equality, but actually blew up in their faces.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many young women support Bernie for economic reasons rather than Hillary for gendered ones.
