State Attorney General Jim Hood (D), the only Democrat elected statewide in Mississippi, has a strong base of support in both parties. \u201cHis numbers are phenomenal,\u201d says one longtime observer of Magnolia State politics. Nevertheless, Mike Hurst, a former Assistant District Attorney in the criminal division for Mississippi\u2019s Southern District, filed against Hood. Hurst may also benefit from having worked on the staff of former US Rep. Chip Pickering (R). Hurst, who has prosecuted several high profile corruption cases, will criticize Hood for waging an insufficient fight against corruption in the state. \u201cIt has the potential to be a pretty good race,\u201d says a knowledgeable Jackson insider, who notes the overall weakness of the Democratic slate is likely to work against Hood.\n\nIn the contest for governor, which by all rights should get top billing, incumbent Phil Bryant (R) looks like a shoo-in. He had $2.4 million in his war chest at the end of 2014. Bryant has a weak primary opponent in political unknown Mitch Young, who has no visibility or built-in base. Three Democrats are running. Vicki Slater, 60, a Madison attorney and former president of Mississippi Association for Justice, a trial lawyers\u2019 group, is favored over Dr. Valerie Short, an Air Force veteran, and retired firefighter Robert Gray. Slater will focus on the need for more funding for education and the failure of the state to expand its Medicaid coverage under Obamacare.\n\nThe race for lieutenant governor could also generate some heat, with former Republican state senator Tim Johnson who recently became a Democrat perhaps getting some national Democratic money to fuel his campaign against incumbent Tate Reeves (R). But Johnson, who has a hobby as an Elvis impersonator, is not a powerful political force in his own right. In the Democratic Primary, Johnson is favored over Jelanie Barr, an actor and losing candidate for mayor of Greenwood in 2013. In the Republican Primary, Reeves is opposed by Alisha Nelson McElhenney, a school teacher and Tea Party supporter, but McElhenney is not likely to raise much money.\n\nRepublican incumbents are favored in the other down-ballot races, although Madison Mayor Mary Hawkins Butler (R) should give state Auditor Stacey Pickering (R) a serious primary challenge. In the General Election, Joce Pritchett, the Democratic nominee, is a civil engineer and businesswoman, as well as a plaintiff in a federal lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage; her position on the issue is not a popular cause in Mississippi.\n\nDemocrats failed to file for two offices, Treasurer and Insurance Commissioner.\n\nOf interest: Two prominent Tea Party lawmakers, state Sens. Chris McDaniel and Michael Watson, failed to run for statewide office and instead filed for reelection. Thus, any momentum the GOP\u2019s hard-right may have gained in last year\u2019s US Senate election will, for the time being, dissipate. McDaniel, who lost a close 2014 race against US Sen. Thad Cochran (R), has hinted that he may run for federal office again, where his issues have more salience. One possibility: McDaniel might challenge US Rep. Steven Palazzo (R) in the Republican Primary next year in the 4th District (Gulfport, etc.).\n\nThe primaries for both parties will be held on August 4, with runoffs on August 25 for contests in which no candidate receives a majority. The General Election is on November 3.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3e4e\"", "article_summary": "In the Democratic Primary, Johnson is favored over Jelanie Barr, an actor and losing candidate for mayor of Greenwood in 2013.\nOne possibility: McDaniel might challenge US Rep.
