But the Rockies\u2019 right fielder woke up Saturday morning feeling fine, and feeling confident that the knee will not be a major problem this season.\n\n\u201cI was just feeling a little bit of fatigue in my knee,\u201d CarGo said. \u201cI talked to Doogie (trainer Keith Dugger) and he said it\u2019s normal. Some days I\u2019m going to feel like that. But it\u2019s nothing serious and I feel really good today.\u201d\n\nGonzalez, who had surgery to repair the patella tendon in his left knee on Aug. 19 and played in just 70 games last season, aggravated the knee after a catch-and-throw off a Will Middlebrooks fly ball in the bottom of the third inning Friday night against the Padres. CarGo finished the inning before being removed from the game.\n\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\n\n\u201cIt scared me at the moment, because the first thing that comes to your mind is, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 \u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cNow, I woke up today stronger and I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d\n\nManager Walt Weiss was not overly concerned Friday night, but he was still glad to hear that Gonzalez checked out OK.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good news,\u201d Weiss said Saturday morning. \u201cI said last night that he has had a good spring physically \u2014 both he and Tulo (Troy Tulowitzki). We are going to take every measure to keep it that way.\u201d\n\nWeiss said it will be his job to pick and choose when he will play the Rockies\u2019 two stars during the regular season, \u201cto make sure we don\u2019t overload those two guys.\u201d\n\nGonzalez said if he wants to thrive on the field, he will have to monitor his knee and make sure he\u2019s in prime shape for the rest of his career.\n\n\u201cDoogie was telling me that I will to have stay on top of my workouts with my legs and stuff,\u201d CarGo said. \u201cSometimes they are going to feel fatigue. They say it\u2019s like having Tommy John (surgery) in your knees. You have to do the things right to keep your body feeling good.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Gonzalez has kept himself fit by incorporating a rigorous stretching routine and adhering to a streak diet. He no longer eats beef, sweets or Cheetos (his favorite junk food), and he weighs 210 pound \u2014 down from the 235 he carried last season.\n\nDe La Rosa update. Lefty starter Jorge De La Rosa, who was originally scheduled to start the Rockies\u2019 home-opener against the Cubs on April 10, is progressing slowly as he returns from a strained left groin.\n\nHe played long toss on Friday and hopes to throw a bullpen session next week. De La Rosa said he\u2019ll begin building up arm strength as soon as his groin is pain free.\n\nHe figures he needs to pitch in two or three games before he could be ready to rejoin the Rockies. He could pitch in games in extended spring and possibly make a rehab start for Triple-A Albuquerque or another minor-league team.\n\n\u201cI really frustrated, but all I can do is stay calm and deal with it,\u201d he said.\n\nRoster moves. The Rockies made several moves Saturday. They optioned infielder Cristhian Adames, right-handed reliever Jairo Diaz and outfielder/first baseman Kyle Parker to Triple-A. They reassigned lefty reliever Kenny Roberts and catchers Dustin Garneau and Ryan Casteel to the minor-league camp.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Carlos Gonzalez\u2019s knee checks out OK; De La Rosa progressing slowly", "title": "Carlos Gonzalez\u2019s knee checks out OK; De La Rosa progressing slowly", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/28/carlos-gonzalezs-knee-checks-out-ok-de-la-rosa-progressing-slowly/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150308__BN20150309_Z00_BNSP09BBNROCKIESp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150308__BN20150309_Z00_BNSP09BBNROCKIESp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-28T12:33:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T15:21:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff9c\"", "article_summary": "De La Rosa said he\u2019ll begin building up arm strength as soon as his groin is pain free.\nDe La Rosa update.\nSCOTTDALE, Ariz. \u2014 Carlos Gonzalez admitted he was scared for a moment Friday night when he felt pain surge in his surgically repaired left knee.\nLefty starter Jorge De La Rosa, who was originally scheduled to start the Rockies\u2019 home-opener against the Cubs on April 10, is progressing slowly as he returns from a strained left groin.\nBut the Rockies\u2019 right fielder woke up Saturday morning feeling fine, and feeling confident that the knee will not be a major problem this season."}
