This was no mere summer skirmish. If anything, the rebellion is gaining strength.\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\nIt is dawning on the party grandees that their most recent predictions of Trump\u2019s demise, like earlier ones, were wrong. He lost some ground after a lackluster performance in the second debate, to be sure. But he still has a healthy lead, with his slide halted or even reversed, and continues to enjoy\u2014astonishingly\u2014more than double the support of any Republican candidate who has held elective office.\n\nMore incredible is that in second and third place are retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and businesswoman Carly Fiorina, both of whom share Trump\u2019s distinction of never having been elected even dogcatcher. According to the Real Clear Politics average of polls, Trump is at 23 percent, Carson at 17 percent and Fiorina at 10 percent. That adds up to fully half of GOP voters defiantly thumbing their noses at all the senators, governors and former-somebodies who are languishing down there in single-digit limbo. Jeb Bush, for all his money and pedigree, is at 8 percent.\n\nImagine what assumptions the political cognoscenti would be making if it were Bush, not Trump, who had maintained such an impressive lead since July, both nationally and in the early primary states. The smart money\u2014which seems pretty dumb this year\u2014would surely anoint him the odds-on favorite to win the nomination. Yet it is taken as an article of faith by Republican wise men and women that Trump will surely lose. Somehow.\n\nHe might, of course. Running for president is hard, and Trump has already made some rookie mistakes. But after getting where he is on bluster, charisma and personal energy, he is now putting together an organization capable of performing the nuts and bolts work of a viable campaign. He even shows new self-awareness, acknowledging to interviewers that the last debate may not have been his best performance.\n\nAnd there is a reason for Trump\u2019s success that goes beyond his skill at burnishing his personal brand: He is saying what much of the GOP base wants to hear.\n\nThe party establishment has only itself to blame. From the moment President Obama took office, Republicans in Congress have been selling the base a bill of goods. They demonized Obamacare and cynically swore to repeal it, knowing they could not. They balked at sensible immigration reform, deciding instead to do nothing. They engaged in Pyrrhic brinkmanship over the budget and the debt ceiling, fully aware that in the end they would have to back down.\n\nPromising to do the impossible was an effective short-term strategy for raising money and winning midterm elections. But if you keep firing up your supporters and letting them down, they become disillusioned. They begin to think the problem might not be Obama and the Democrats. It might be you.\n\nThat same dynamic is happening in the House, where Boehner\u2019s decision to walk away has emboldened, not chastened, the ultraconservative revolutionaries in the GOP ranks. Look at the way they chased out hapless Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who on Thursday abandoned his bid to succeed Boehner because of opposition from the radical Freedom Caucus.\n\nIf he chooses, Boehner can use his remaining weeks in office to keep his party from further injuring itself by shutting down the government or playing chicken with the debt ceiling. But it will only be a matter of time before the next speaker has to quell some far-right tantrum.\n\nIn the Democratic Party, the conflict is ideological\u2014left vs. center-left. In the GOP, the struggle looks existential.\n\nPut another way, it\u2019s not hard to imagine a party in which there\u2019s room for both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and you can easily imagine one supporting the other as standard-bearer. But a tent that can hold, say, both Trump\u2019s view on undocumented immigrants\u2014hunt them down and kick them out\u2014and Bush\u2019s support for compassionate reform? That\u2019s not a political party, it\u2019s a food fight.\n\nThe Republican establishment may ultimately find some way to drag one of its presidential candidates through the primaries. But chaos, Trump has shown, is the GOP\u2019s new normal.\n\nEugene Robinson\u2019s email address is eugenerobinson@washpost.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ben carson, bernie sanders, candidates, carly fiorina, congress, democrats, donald trump, eugene robinson, gop, hillary clinton, jeb bush, john boehner, kevin mccarthy, obama, obamacare, republicans", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "At this point, I worry we\u2019re going to start finding members of the Republican establishment curled up in their beds, eyes clenched shut and ears covered with trembling hands, moaning \u201cmake it stop, make it stop, make it stop.\u201d\n - 2015/10/09", "title": "Chaos Is the GOP\u2019s New Normal: Eugene Robinson", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/chaos_is_the_gops_new_normal_20151009", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/reportuploads/gop_cracked_wall_shutterstock_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At this point, I worry we\u2019re going to start finding members of the Republican establishment curled up in their beds, eyes clenched shut and ears covered with trembling hands, moaning \u201cmake it stop, make it stop, make it stop.\u201d", "title": "Chaos Is the GOP\u2019s New Normal | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/chaos_is_the_gops_new_normal_20151009/", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/reportuploads/gop_cracked_wall_shutterstock_360.jpg", "height": 254}, "creator": "@truthdig", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, Chaos Is the GOP\u2019s New Normal, ben carson, bernie sanders, candidates, carly fiorina, congress, democrats, donald trump, eugene robinson, gop, hillary clinton, jeb bush, john boehner, kevin mccarthy, obama, obamacare, republicans", "article": {"tag": "ben carson, bernie sanders, candidates, carly fiorina, congress, democrats, donald trump, eugene robinson, gop, hillary clinton, jeb bush, john boehner, kevin mccarthy, obama, obamacare, republicans", "published_time": "2015-10-09T10:00:19-08:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T10:01:20-08:00"}, "description": "At this point, I worry we\u2019re going to start finding members of the Republican establishment curled up in their beds, eyes clenched shut and ears covered with trembling hands, moaning \u201cmake it stop, make it stop, make it stop.\u201d\n - 2015/10/09"}, "article_summary": "The Republican establishment may ultimately find some way to drag one of its presidential candidates through the primaries.\nBut chaos, Trump has shown, is the GOP\u2019s new normal.\nThe party establishment has only itself to blame.\nYet it is taken as an article of faith by Republican wise men and women that Trump will surely lose.\nAdvertisement Square, Site wideIt is dawning on the party grandees that their most recent predictions of Trump\u2019s demise, like earlier ones, were wrong."}
