They failed to get in last season, but a 20-10 victory Sunday, combined with San Diego\u2019s 19-7 loss at Kansas City, did the trick.\n\nThe Ravens (10-6, the same record they had in their Super Bowl season), earned a wild card and will be seeded sixth in the AFC.\n\n\u201cAnything can happen when you get into the playoffs,\u201d Flacco said. \u201cI won\u2019t be surprised if in three weeks from now we\u2019re still sitting here playing.\u201d\n\nDefending Super Bowl champion Seattle earned the top seed in the NFC by beating St. Louis 20-6. The Seahawks, winners of the NFC West, were 7-1 at home at the intimidating CenturyLink Field, and have a bye next week.\n\nGreen Bay won the NFC North by handling Detroit 30-20 and got the No. 2 seed in the conference and a bye. Both the Packers and Seahawks finished 12-4, with the tiebreaker Seattle\u2019s opening victory against Green Bay.\n\nDetroit (11-5) will play at NFC East champ Dallas (12-4) in the wild-card round.\n\nCarolina (7-8-1) became the second division champion with a losing record in NFL history. Its 34-3 rout at Atlanta earned the NFC South title.\n\nThe Panthers will host injury-ravaged Arizona (11-5), which fell to San Francisco 20-17 but got the other NFC wild card.\n\nAFC East champion New England (12-4) owns home-field advantage in the conference and will be off next weekend. Denver (12-4), the West winner, also will have a bye after defeating Oakland, 47-14.\n\nThe AFC North champion will be determined in the Sunday night game, with Cincinnati (10-4-1) at Pittsburgh (10-5). The loser gets a wild-card berth and plays at South champion Indianapolis (11-5).
