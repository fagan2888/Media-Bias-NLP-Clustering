Barack Obama is trying to change America,\u201d Rubio told a crowd in a packed town hall forum at McKelvie Intermediate School.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRubio\u2019s strong third-place finish in last week\u2019s Iowa caucuses has made him a top target of his Republican rivals fighting to survive the New Hampshire primary. With businessman Donald Trump continuing to dominate polls, and Senator Ted Cruz winning Iowa, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John Kasich of Ohio are grappling with Rubio for a foothold in a crowded GOP race.\n\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff John Kasich told a crowd of more than 400, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re all here\u201d at Concord High School Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s just little old me.\u201d\n\nWhen Christie attacked him during the debate for hiding behind talking points, Rubio repeated himself again nearly verbatim. By Sunday morning, hecklers from a Democratic super PAC were dressed in makeshift robot costumes outside Rubio\u2019s Londonderry town hall meeting, and some New Hampshire residents were raising concerns about Rubio\u2019s viability as a nominee.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s exposing a weakness in Rubio,\u201d Bedford Republican Nancy Brodeur said of Christie\u2019s attacks during the debate. \u201cI worry about Rubio. I think he could potentially be a Republican Obama, a senator with not a lot of experience.\u201d\n\nBut some \u2014 including Brodeur\u2019s husband, who was leaning toward Rubio before Saturday night\u2019s performance \u2014 came away from his Sunday town hall reassured.\n\n\u201cI think he took a bruising,\u201d Norm Brodeur said. \u201cI was here today because of that. I wanted to see how he reacted.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo days before New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary, the Republican candidates were pointed in their criticism of their rivals.\n\n\u201cDid Marco do well last night?\u201d Trump asked a crowd packed into a gymnasium on the campus of Plymouth State University.\n\nThe crowd responded with a resounding: \u201cNoooooo!\u201d\n\nTrump also went after Bush several times in his hour-long speech, at one point mocking him for using his 90-year-old mother to drive up support. Former first lady Barbara Bush walked in the snow to campaign for her son, Jeb Bush, last week. That was the same day Trump did not return to New Hampshire because of the winter weather.\n\n\u201cPoor, poor, poor Jeb Bush who brings out his mother because he needed help,\u201d Trump said. \u201c \u2018Mommy, please come \u2014 walk in the snow, Mom.\u2019 I like his mother, though. You gotta do it on your own, OK? You gotta do it on your own.\u201d\n\nWith many people still choosing between candidates in the crowded field, the campaigns\u2019 New Hampshire events were flooded with curious voters Sunday.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re all here,\u201d Kasich told a crowd of more than 400 who packed inside Concord High School on Sunday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s just little old me, folks.\u201d\n\nKasich touted his performance as a job creator in Ohio and before that, as the congressman who balanced the federal budget.\n\n\u201cIf you have common sense regulation and you manage the budget, you will have a robust economy with job growth,\u201d Kasich said.\n\nJeffrey Phillips, 53, an independent voter from Concord, called Kasich \u201cthe most moderate and sensible,\u201d and said he showed during Saturday night\u2019s debate that \u201che could do the job\u201d as president, Phillips said.\n\n\u201cI think he could maybe pull off second place,\u201d he said of Kasich\u2019s chances in New Hampshire. \u201cI think there are a lot of people who are undecided and worried about Trump.\u201d\n\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff Ted Cruz touched on repealing Obamacare, abolishing the IRS, increasing border security, and preserving states\u2019 rights.\n\nIn Peterborough, meanwhile, Cruz touched on many of his central themes \u2014 repealing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing the IRS, increasing border security, and preserving states\u2019 rights \u2014 while taking frequent swipes at Democrats.\n\nCruz also referenced Saturday\u2019s debate, in which Rubio, Bush, and Christie said they would support opening Selective Service registration to women. Cruz called that \u201cimmoral\u201d and a nod to political correctness.\n\n\u201cPolitical correctness is dangerous, and the idea that we would draft our daughters to forcibly bring them into the military and put them in close combat, I think is wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nRubio, whose strong speaking skills helped vault him to prominence in his party, needed to recover ground after stumbling in Saturday\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s dispel once and for all this notion that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Rubio said during the debate at Saint Anselm College. \u201cHe knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nMoments later, when he repeated the line almost verbatim, Christie pounced: \u201cThere it is! The memorized 25-second speech! There it is, everybody!\u201d\n\nRubio attracted overflow crowds to events that his campaign said had already been moved to larger venues.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t figure out how to make pancakes for 800 people,\u201d Rubio told the jam-packed crowd in the Londonderry High School cafeteria. At each town hall meeting, he gave similar speeches, took several questions from the crowd, then stayed for pictures and autographs with individual voters, some of whom were giddy to see him.\n\nRather than retreating from his script, Rubio doubled down on it. In Londonderry, he argued that President Obama\u2019s actions are not an accident resulting from his inexperience but intentional efforts to move the country in a different direction against its will.\n\n\u201cEverything that makes us special is in trouble,\u201d Rubio said.\n\n\u201cThis is a concerted, deliberate organized effort to change America,\u201d said Rubio, who added that voters are \u201cgoing to have to explain to our children why we got to grow up in the greatest country in the world and they did not.\u201d\n\nKathy Elkherj of Manchester said she was upset with Christie over his attacks and that she hoped Rubio\u2019s supporters would not be deterred by the debate.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t change my mind,\u201d she said.\n\nBut it had concerned her husband.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t too happy last night,\u201d Nick Elkherj acknowledged. \u201cI wish he was prepared.\u201d\n\nBut he came away from Rubio\u2019s event in Bedford sold, wearing a Rubio hat and toting campaign paraphernalia.\n\n\u201cI was almost there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I really wanted to hear him firsthand.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.2330672486", "eomportal-id": 486340, "description": "Facing criticism for clinging to his talking points during the final GOP debate before Tuesday\u2019s primary, Senator Marco Rubio refused to toss his script Sunday before hundreds of voters at New Hampshire town hall meetings.", "eomportal-instanceid": 16, "og": {"city": "Bedford", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "Facing criticism for clinging to his talking points during the final GOP debate before Tuesday\u2019s primary, Senator Marco Rubio refused to toss his script Sunday before hundreds of voters at New Hampshire town hall meetings.", "title": "After debate flop, Rubio seeks recovery on the campaign trail - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/02/07/after-debate-flop-rubio-seeks-recovery-campaign-trail/c3bZwBYXA3FxUcvVpIMy6K/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2016/02/07/BostonGlobe.com/Metro/Images/08newhampshire03.jpg", "longitude": "-71.51320079999999", "state": "NH", "latitude": "42.9463291", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "nhprimary,candidates,2016,Marco Rubio, Marco Rubio, Barack  Obama, Donald J  Trump, Jeb  Bush, Barbara  Bush,Republican Party", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 10:51:45 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "nhprimary,candidates,2016,Marco Rubio, Marco Rubio, Barack  Obama, Donald J  Trump, Jeb  Bush, Barbara  Bush,Republican Party, Democratic Party, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "21a56492-cdf6-11e5-ab2f-05d3299dcce1"}, "article_summary": "Cruz also referenced Saturday\u2019s debate, in which Rubio, Bush, and Christie said they would support opening Selective Service registration to women.\nBarack Obama is trying to change America,\u201d Rubio told a crowd in a packed town hall forum at McKelvie Intermediate School.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s exposing a weakness in Rubio,\u201d Bedford Republican Nancy Brodeur said of Christie\u2019s attacks during the debate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just little old me.\u201dWhen Christie attacked him during the debate for hiding behind talking points, Rubio repeated himself again nearly verbatim.\n\u201cI wish he was prepared.\u201dBut he came away from Rubio\u2019s event in Bedford sold, wearing a Rubio hat and toting campaign paraphernalia."}
