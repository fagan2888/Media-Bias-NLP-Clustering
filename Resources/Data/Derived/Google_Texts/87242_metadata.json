It\u2019s intimidating to a lot of people,\u201d said Jean Brownhill Lauer, founder of New York-based Sweeten.\n\nAfter a user posts the project through the app, Sweeten finds experts for projects that can range from simple bathrooms to housing developments.\n\n\u201cThere are just so many options when it comes to contractors. You might get recommendations from friends, other people in your building, or search online,\" Lauer said. \"But it\u2019s challenging to understand which ones are better suited to your projects.\u201d\n\nThe company monitors the projects and contractors and gets feedback from the home owners to ensure quality. Sweeten is available in New York City and is expanding throughout the United States.\n\nRelated: 10 Over-the-top Home Luxuries for the Super Rich\n\nAnother app, LikeThat D\u00e9cor, takes the guess work out of finding the right type of furniture and decorations. Users point their smartphones at a piece of furniture, or a particular pattern they like, to find complementary items that might match in the home.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re searching for a piece of furniture like a sofa, you\u2019ll usually start by taking a look at what\u2019s available in the market. Maybe you\u2019ll go to different stores to see what\u2019s new and trendy, or try out a site like Pinterest,\u201d said Adi Pinhas, founder of the California-based company Superfish, which created the app.\n\n\u201cBut at the moment when you\u2019re trying to find something similar, or trying to source where to buy an item you saw ... it gets challenging,\u201d he added.\n\nThe free app for iPhone, iPad and the web, which is available in the United States, uses image recognition technology to search millions of products from more than 4,000 stores, including Zara Home, Gilt and Ikea. It also provides a link for users to purchase the items.\n\nRelated: Why First-Time Homebuyers Should Get Their Checkbooks Ready\n\nHome decoration app Houzz, free on iOS, Android and the web, lets people search for design ideas using search terms to describe the item and see how people have styled similar pieces. More than 2,000,000 design photos are available within the app.\n\nHouzz also connects users to a community of local designers, architects and contractors, who are reviewed on the platform.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Home owners and renters looking to redesign or renovate can turn to new apps to help simplify the process and get the job done sooner and more efficiently.", "title": "3 Apps That Make Your Home Remodeling Easier", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/23/3-Apps-Make-Your-Home-Remodeling-Easier", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10112011_first_time_homeowners_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/23/3-Apps-Make-Your-Home-Remodeling-Easier", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10112011_first_time_homeowners_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Home owners and renters looking to redesign or renovate can turn to new apps to help simplify the process and get the job done sooner and more efficiently.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee9a\"", "article_summary": "A free web app called Sweeten links homeowners to contractors, interior designers and architects to help create their dream house or apartment.\nRelated: A Rosy Outlook for Home RemodelingAs home spending ramps up, apps aim to ease some of the pain and expense.\nLast year Americans spent approximately $130 billion on home remodeling projects, the highest amount since 2007, according the U.S. Census Bureau.\nAfter a user posts the project through the app, Sweeten finds experts for projects that can range from simple bathrooms to housing developments.\nHome owners and renters looking to redesign or renovate can turn to new apps to help simplify the process and get the job done sooner and more efficiently."}
