They\u2019re going to retire,\u201d said Dr. Richard Ridge, CEO of NJSA. \u201cWe\u2019re on the precipice of unprecedented change.\u201d\n\nRidge indicated the vacancies will pile up over the next eight years. The weak economy has played a strong role in the situation recently, as more workers are willing to take on extra hours and help fill the gaps. However, that is having a negative effect on the many recent graduates who are struggling to find work.\n\nWith millions of people entering the realm of Medicare nationwide, meanwhile, and an even greater number of people signing up for health care through the Affordable Care Act, the demand for nurses is even greater.\n\nAccording to Ridge, an increasing number of people are interested in pursuing a career in nursing, which would help alleviate the problem, but there is a \u201cbottleneck\u201d because of a lack of faculty.\n\n\u201cThere are some schools \u2013 many schools \u2013 that have a hard time filling their slots, recruiting students, because they don\u2019t have enough faculty,\u201d Ridge said.\n\nRidge noted the salary discrepancy is a major factor. Nurses know they can earn much more in the field, compared to teaching.\n\nOn the bright side, the state has made strides toward increasing the number of baccalaureate-prepared nurses. Meanwhile, a bill in Trenton would eliminate the requirement that advanced practice nurses be involved in a joint protocol with a physician.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2014/05/108878783.jpg", "sailthru.author": "dinoflammia", "description": "An aging population, along with an older field of nurses, have paved the way for what could be the most severe nursing shortage in New Jersey history.", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey 101.5", "description": "An aging population, along with an older field of nurses, have paved the way for what could be the most severe nursing shortage in New Jersey history.", "title": "NJ Nursing Shortage Looms [AUDIO]", "url": "http://nj1015.com/nj-nursing-shortage-looms-audio/", "image": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2014/05/108878783.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nj1015", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-05-19 05:10:23", "sailthru.title": "NJ Nursing Shortage Looms [AUDIO]", "fb": {"admins": 100002025987268, "app_id": 309166499099898}, "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-wkxw, tsmmarket-trenton, tsmtype-local, newsletter, nurses, nursing-shortage, new-jersey-news, anycategorynews", "sailthru.description": "An aging population, along with an older field of nurses, have paved the way for what could be the most severe nursing shortage in New Jersey history.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2014/05/108878783.jpg", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1821\"", "article_summary": "Christopher Furlong, Getty ImagesCiting data gathered from the state, the New Jersey State Nurses Association concluded that 37 percent of Garden State nurses are between the ages of 57 and 65.\nAudio clip: Adobe Flash Player (version 9 or above) is required to play this audio clip.\nAn aging population, along with an older field of nurses, have paved the way for what could be the most severe nursing shortagein New Jersey history.\nOn the bright side, the state has made strides toward increasing the number of baccalaureate-prepared nurses.\nAccording to Ridge, an increasing number of people are interested in pursuing a career in nursing, which would help alleviate the problem, but there is a \u201cbottleneck\u201d because of a lack of faculty."}
