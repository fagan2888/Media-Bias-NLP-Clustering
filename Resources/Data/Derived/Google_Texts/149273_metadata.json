But since I\u2019d rather deal with a few uncomfortable moments now than burn forever in the fires of hell, I\u2019ve stubbornly clung to clarity and honesty over doublespeak and lies.\n\nConsidering the never ending, illogical barrage of bologna spewing forth from the mouths of liberal leaders (at all levels), it gives me pause to wonder how they can dream up and profess the same lines simultaneously. Whether they\u2019re all hardwired together and directly linked to a mainframe or just synchronized by daily marching orders, they\u2019re ability to obfuscate the truth by reinventing language is absolutely stunning.\n\nNow I accept that sometimes a \u2018little white lie\u2019 is preferable to blatant honesty in order to protect someone\u2019s feelings. I mean most people are uncomfortable saying, \u201cWow, you look like . . .,\u201d or \u201cDang, you\u2019ve really put on weight.\u201d\n\nBut what\u2019s bringing this country down isn\u2019t some little white lie scenario. No, it\u2019s the nosedive our elected and unelected leaders have taken into the black abyss of abject dishonesty. And instead of fighting that dark corruption, our population is hurling itself off the edge of the cliff, plummeting towards the end of a nation.\n\nLike the kingdom in \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Clothes,\u201d we have become a society of sheep, willingly accepting whatever is handed out, refusing to read, inquire, or demand a return to integrity.\n\nOur English language is tough and complex, but not so tough as to continuously need reengineering by liberal bureaucrats. True, it\u2019s happened slowly over time, but the sad result is that our spoken language has become a ludicrous sham of false terms and misnomers all because of imaginary fears and fabricated persecution complexities.\n\nThese sometimes subtle changes didn\u2019t happen by accident, leaving any intelligent person to ponder \u2013 why?\n\nOne possibility is that liberals simply don\u2019t have a solid command of the English vocabulary (or maybe they just skipped a few all important classes at their ivy league school). But since I don\u2019t believe liberals are inherently stupid, I have to look for an alternate possibility; that they are little more than prostitutes, selling themselves to the highest bidder \u2013 all for Marxist cause.\n\nAnd while they scratch and claw their ways to the top of their private dung heaps, they are bulldozing our beloved country into the quagmire. I mean really folks, when the President of the United States doesn\u2019t understand what the definition of \u201cIs,\u201d is (Clinton) or \u201cTerrorism,\u201d (Obama) then the American people are in serious trouble.\n\nWhether it was Clinton who started us down this deceptive path, or the 1970\u2019s union boss who suddenly decided the janitor\u2019s position had been elevated to \u201cIndustrial Engineer,\u201d doesn\u2019t matter. What does matter is that it\u2019s time to put the skids on the ever increasing, ridiculous \u2018thought police\u2019 because these confusing shifts are actually enslaving the minds of the American people.\n\nHere are a few of my favorite examples of language in the absurd.\n\nAffordable Care Act \u2013 translated: An illegally produced law that allowed a tyrannical government to seize control of vast amounts of tax dollars, divert them into an endless system of bureaucratic agencies whose singular purpose was/is to destroy the best medical care system in the world.\n\nCarbon Exchange \u2013 translated: An opportunity for Obama and other tyrants to make billions in the biggest scam of the century \u2013 by forcing logical people to ignore the obvious fact that all plants and animals (even the liberal sloths who thought up this scheme) need carbon dioxide to function and live. Maybe they all missed the Krebs Cycle discussion in high school.\n\nCinco de Mayo \u2013 translated: An annual Mexican holiday celebrated on May 5th marking the victory of Mexican troops over French forces in Pueblo, Mexico in 1862. According to many American school administrators, now more important than any/all American patriotism, as marked by their absolute intolerance toward the displaying of U.S. patriotic symbols on that day.\n\nEthnic American \u2013 translated: An American who choses to define him/herself by foreign heritage or skin color, instead of being satisfied with simply being an \u2018American.\u2019 My grandparents were Irish and English and I would no more refer to myself as an Irish American than a Martian American, because I\u2019m quite content to simply be an \u2018American.\u2019\n\nWhen an ethnicity purposefully differentiates itself from the rest of the body of a country, it cannot cause anything but division. Truthfully, I don\u2019t think of Obama as being African American, I think of him as being morally corrupt, all physical attributes aside. Until we get down the road away from these divisive exclusions, our country will continue to be angrily torn apart by allegiances to ethnic backgrounds rather than being united by our Constitution and flag.\n\nGender Reassignment \u2013 translated: A confused and/or dysfunctional individual who undergoes surgery which disfigures their body and changes their sex.\n\nGreen Energy \u2013 translated: An excuse by liberals to dump billions into boondoggle schemes (Solyndra) and factories that will never generate enough power to run a toothbrush, let alone power a vehicle or light a city. Also an excuse to shut the water off to farmers and ranchers in the San Joaquin valley, forestall the Keystone Pipeline, and destroy the coal industry, to name a few.\n\nHomeless Person \u2013 translated: Vagrants or bums. While there are those who are unable to care for themselves, mentally and/or physically, the vast majority do not fit into this category. Today most street bums simply refuse to get off their duffs and get a job, go to school, learn a trade, or contribute to society in a meaningful way.\n\nMarriage Equality \u2013 translated: An insane decision imposed by a few loons in black robes that the definition of marriage is no longer limited to the sacred union of one man and one woman, but now encompasses everything (just wait for it) from polygamy to marrying your daughter and/or the neighbor\u2019s pet.\n\nPro-Choice \u2013 translated: Murder. Plainly, it\u2019s the right to murder a vulnerable human being who happens to be inconvenient to another person, place, or time.\n\nRe-education Training Classes \u2013 translated: Government mandated brainwashing programs designed to force individuals and businesses to service same-sex couples, with the ultimate goal of stripping Christians of their faith.\n\nReligious Tolerance \u2013 translated: All religions are acceptable, except for Christianity and Judaism because Islam doesn\u2019t appreciate either of those. Oh yes, and while we\u2019re at it, Buddhism and Hinduism probably need to go away, too, as they are religions of peace.\n\nUndocumented Immigrant \u2013 translated: An illegal criminal who broke into our home and is stealing our stuff. This term is about as accurate as classifying a \u2018Shoplifter\u2019 as a \u2018Nonpaying customer.\u2019\n\nWar on Women \u2013 translated: A fabricated, non-issue debate spurred by liberal females to convince women that they are nothing more than the sum of their reproductive parts.\n\nWetlands \u2013 translated: Swamp. This is a typical example of redefinition because no one cares about saving a dirty waterhole full of bugs, mosquitos and gators. But by calling it something special, the government invites itself into our checkbooks and backyards.\n\nWorkplace Violence \u2013 translated: A crazed Islamic terrorist who opens fire on innocent civilians and/or military personnel (Ft. Hood) while crying \u2018Allahu Akbar\u2019 and denouncing the U.S. government.\n\nHonestly, the list is ridiculously long and I could go on for hours, but you get the drift. We have allowed this to happen and it\u2019s time to call a halt. It will take some courage, but we must get back to integrity and honesty. Maybe what this country desperately needs is one little kid who just happens to notice that our self-appointed king with his pen and his phone is really naked after all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Personally, Ive never been one to mince words, which has occasionally gotten me into a bit of boiling water.
