We are one big family,\u201d said APIDC Chair and co-founder Patricia Kinaga.\n\nNoting that the event happens every three to five years throughout California, Kinaga said, \u201cI think these conferences are so well-attended, because there is such a need. We do this to help educate the mainstream service organizations, who do not know how to reach a lot of Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. It\u2019s a special opportunity for them to find out how to better access mainstream services.\u201d\n\nEnlightening workshops included mental health disparities, autism, occupational therapy, health care and the Affordable Care Act, civil rights in employment and transportation, technology access, financial issues, special education, and outreach to the community.\n\n\u201cWe provide people with a safe space to come and share their stories, and meet others who are going through the same thing,\u201d said Peter Wong, APIDC Research Director. \u201cAsian Americans are always the last to sort of catch up. Now we are being included, asking more questions, learning about access to services and rights, to improve our quality of life.\u201d\n\nAsian Americans with disabilities have gotten the lowest in funding for employment, according to APIDC research. They are also the most underemployed demographic than any other group in the US.\n\nThe two-day event also happened to fall on the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which has changed the lives of so many people by giving them better mobility access and resources.\n\n\u201cThe 25th anniversary [of the ADA] created an opportunity for it to be a momentous conference. It was an opportunity for us to look back at progress in the last 25 years,\u201d Kinaga noted. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a reminder how many issues are still needed to be addressed, as they relate to APIs with disabilities. We have a long ways to go, because of cultural barriers.\u201d\n\nAPIDC\u2019s first conference took place in 2001, and was the first convening of physical/mental health service providers, elected officials, organizations, educators, families, and consumers in the disabled community.\n\n\u201cWe looked around and realized the great need,\u201d said Kinaga. \u201cwe started doing original research, looked at data, looked at the needs of our community We realized we needed to train the next generation of young adults with disabilities, so that they can become community leaders. We needed to network more, through social meet-ups. We generated fundraisers, came up with an action plan, and all the while the APIDC conferences continued to grow.\u201d\n\nConsumers, families, agencies, and advocates gathered together in the Pasadena Westin ballroom that weekend, with more than 30 exhibitors showcasing their useful services to participants.\n\nConference co-chairs and APIDC board members Johnna Cho and June Kuehn introduced special guests at the conference, including activists, community groups and elected officials.\n\nPasadena Vice Mayor and City Councilmember Gene Masuda welcomed the crowd on March 18. \u201cThe goal is to improve the quality of life of all persons with disabilities, focus on strength, celebrating successes, and being open to opportunities. Learn as much as you can here, so that you can become an advocate. I am confident that you will gain new knowledge and feel empowered with this experience.\u201d\n\nThe conference kicked off with a ceremonial tea, featuring the Vice Mayor and Miss Wheelchair CA Foundation owner Jennifer Kumiyama, who was crowned in 2010.\n\n\u201cThis conference and organization [are] very important,\u201d Kumiyama, who was born with arthrogryposis, shared. \u201cAs an API myself, I grew up in a culture where, if you\u2019re different, with any sort of disability, you\u2019re kind of put in the background. People don\u2019t realize that you\u2019re there. And I think that we as a community as a whole are as strong as our weakest link.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you take advantage of what the APIDC offers, you\u2019re on the right path to becoming a proactive advocate for people with disabilities,\u201d she added.\n\nAs a non-profit, APIDC continues to promote the rights and accessibilities of the disabled community, connecting them to accessible opportunities, and debunking cultural stigmas. It also develops youth leaders through their Youth Leadership Institute, a yearly program aimed to identify and train young people to become leading advocates for AAPIs with disabilities.\n\nLeft and right at the conference were stories of people who overcame their struggles, by not letting it define them.\n\n\u201cAs people with disabilities, we used to be invisible\u2026but today, we have gained confidence, and work to change the environment so that we could participate,\u201d shared Lillibeth Navarro, Executive Director of Communities Actively Living Independent & Free, and a speaker at the conference. \u201cI learned more about the disability rights movement. It\u2019s not just an American thing; it affects us Filipinos too.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing that binds us all together is the common struggle. It\u2019s our shared story, across all generations. Our Lolas and Lolos, those with disabilities. We all have close cultural ties; we bring to the table our families and friends, and our people are very persevering.\u201d\n\nNavarro\u2019s work as an advocate for the disabled community includes increasing Supplemental Security Income (SSI) for people who need extra financial help.\n\nBrian Thomas McGrath, a student at Pasadena City College, sustained brain and spinal cord injuries in a serious motorcycle accident.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always liked working won my feet; always been a kinesthetic learner. When I started taking welding classes, I was still shaking and stuttering,\u201d he shared.\n\nThomas left the hospital in three months to return to school, where he initially faced huge challenges in his speech and memory.\n\n\u201cStudying the bookwork and practicing welding [in college] has been a continuation of my physical and occupational therapy. It\u2019s so much fun \u2014 I get paid to melt metal, make loud noises, and I teach others now. It sparked a light in me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some days that it feels like this will never end\u2026you\u2019ve got to push through those dark days,\u201d Thomas continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to stay dark forever. Don\u2019t give up hope.\u201d\n\nMs. Wheelchair California 2014 Theresa de Vera proudly wears her title with a shiny crown pin, while continuing to serve her community on the Los Angeles City Commission on Disability. An advocate, de Vera has pushed for reform in special education, transportation and mobility infrastructure, and supported the installation of access stands at LAX to make it easier for drivers to know when and where to pick up riders.\n\n\u201cEmbrace yourself for who you are and what you offer to the world,\u201d de Vera shared, flashing her Miss Wheelchair pin. \u201cI want to teach my future children that they can live as normal of a life in the chair, as they can without.\u201d (Allyson Escobar / AJPress)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "News", "description": "PASADENA, Calif. \u2014 Asians and Pacific Islanders with Disabilities of California (APIDC), a non-profit volunteer-run organization that assists with bridging the services and cultural barriers faced by the Asian and Pacific Islander community, hosted", "title": "APIDC hosts statewide conference on Americans with Disabilities Act | News", "url": "http://asianjournal.com/news/apidc-hosts-statewide-conference-on-americans-with-disabilities-act/", "image": "http://asianjournal.com/news/files/2016/03/Statewide-Disabilities-Conference-BoardVolunteeers-300x225.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 255788754543881}, "generator": "WordPress 3.5.1", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3997\"", "article_summary": "Conference co-chairs and APIDC board members Johnna Cho and June Kuehn introduced special guests at the conference, including activists, community groups and elected officials.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s also a reminder how many issues are still needed to be addressed, as they relate to APIs with disabilities.\nNow we are being included, asking more questions, learning about access to services and rights, to improve our quality of life.\u201dAsian Americans with disabilities have gotten the lowest in funding for employment, according to APIDC research.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for everyone who shares the same vision of improving services, and striving for creating an environment for people with disabilities.\nLeft and right at the conference were stories of people who overcame their struggles, by not letting it define them."}
