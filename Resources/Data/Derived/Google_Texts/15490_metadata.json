Brad Nettles/Staff\n\nWhen Alfred Pinckney strolls the ancient graveyard at St. Philip\u2019s Church, as he likes to do, he steps over earthen paths traveled by his ancestors who have worshipped here since the 1760s.\n\nAnglican timeline in South Carolina 1680-81: Ten years after the new colony of Charles Towne was settled, the first St. Philip\u2019s Church built at corner of Meeting and Broad streets, the site of St. Michael\u2019s Church today. 1706: An act by the Colonial Commons House of Assembly formed seven area parishes, including St. Philip\u2019s to serve the peninsula, St. Andrew\u2019s to serve the Ashley River and Christ Church to serve southeast of the Wando River. 1751: An act divided the city of Charles Towne into two Anglican parishes with Broad Street as the divider. 1761: First worship held at new St. Michael\u2019s Episcopal on \u201cFour Corners of Law,\u201d representing ecclesiastical authority. 1785: Protestant Episcopal Church in the State of South Carolina was created. 1786: Diocese adopted first constitution. Signatories were: St. Philip\u2019s, St. Michael\u2019s, Old St. Andrew\u2019s, St. Helena\u2019s, Trinity Edisto Island, St. John\u2019s and Prince George parishes. 1789: Diocese joined six other state associations to become founding members of The Episcopal Church, the national church body. 1795: South Carolina diocese elected first bishop. 1841: Diocese added clause to its constitution saying it \u201caccedes to, recognizes and adopts the general Constitution and Canons of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, and acknowledges their authority accordingly.\u201d 1861: Diocese withdrew from The Episcopal Church and joined The Protestant Episcopal Church in The Confederate States of America. 1866: At the Civil War\u2019s end, diocese rejoined The Episcopal Church. 1922: Diocese of Upper South Carolina formed, dividing the state roughly in half. 2010: After years of theological discord with The Episcopal Church, diocese voted to remove the so-called \u201caccession clause\u201d added in 1841. 2012: Bishop Mark Lawrence and two-thirds of parishes disaffiliated from The Episcopal Church. Two months later, diocese and parishes filed lawsuit against national church and local parishes that remained with it. 2014: Three-week trial held in St. George. 2015: Circuit Judge Diane Goodstein rules in favor of Diocese of South Carolina and parishes that had withdrawn from Episcopal Church. Appeals to come.\n\nBeneath the church\u2019s towering spire and a cluster of massive live oaks, elegant grave markers bear their names. Pinckney clutches to his chest memories of their lives and deaths contained in a family history book.\n\n\u201cAll these gravestones, they have a story,\u201d he says, gesturing to an expanse along Church Street where at least 20 of his family members are buried alongside names like John C. Calhoun. The name of another Alfred Pinckney, one of several namesakes, is engraved into a marble dedication near the sanctuary, a forever thanks to young Confederate soldiers from St. Philip\u2019s who died in the War Between the States.\n\nPinckney\u2019s grandchildren mark the sixth generation in his family to worship here. But he wonders for how long, given two-thirds of the Diocese of South Carolina\u2019s parishes, including this one, left the national Episcopal Church in 2012.\n\nToday, they are embroiled in a lawsuit over more than $500 million in church properties, including some of the areas oldest Colonial congregations: St. Philip\u2019s Church, St. Michael\u2019s Church, Old St. Andrew\u2019s Parish and Christ Church, all signatories of the diocese\u2019s founding constitution in 1786.\n\nA circuit judge decided on Feb. 3 in favor of parishes that left, but now the case moves on toward an appeal.\n\nAs it winds through the courts, its files swelling with thousands of documents and arguments, on the sidelines sit families from both sides of the theological divide whose histories are steeped in these Colonial churches. From the pews now at stake, their ancestors have worshipped, baptized children, buried loved ones and prayed to survive the city\u2019s wars, plagues and storms for centuries.\n\nThe idea of fighting over the church properties confounds many because their value is too enormous. At 75, a past St. Philip\u2019s senior warden and diocesan trustee, Pinckney wonders what will happen as the case moves forward.\n\n\u201cThese churches are so intertwined with families,\u201d Pinckney says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad situation.\u201d\n\nThe throngs of camera-wielding tourists passing any of those churches today might not realize that all four grew up scrappy little houses of worship besieged by fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, wars, you name it only to rank among the most cherished Colonial congregations today.\n\nSt. Philip\u2019s Church\n\nIn a Holy City so full of churches, its skyline pierced by steeples, St. Philip\u2019s was the first Anglican church established south of Virginia.\n\nIn the early 1680s, its small wooden building was the first church built in Colonial Charles Towne. Back then, it didn\u2019t sit on the picturesque spot on Church Street it calls home today. Instead, it was built at Broad and Meeting streets, at the so-called Four Corners of Law where St. Michael\u2019s is located.\n\nAfter the church was severely damaged by a hurricane in 1710, construction of its new building began a few blocks away on Church Street (only to be interrupted by another hurricane).\n\nOriginally built for Church of England families, several Colonial governors and Episcopal bishops have since been buried in its graveyard, not to mention John C. Calhoun, vice president of the U.S., and author Dubose Heyward.\n\nThe first services in its new building were held on Easter 1723 only to be followed by fires, hurricanes, smallpox, yellow fever, slave uprisings, attacks by Native Americans and threats of war from the Spanish, according to a church history.\n\nIts steeple became a handy target for Union soldiers shelling the city. One shell exploded in the churchyard during a Sunday service.\n\nThen the second St. Philip\u2019s building burned down in 1835 only to be rebuilt.\n\nAnd almost a century later, Bishop William Alexander Guerry was murdered in his office by a priest, who then took his own life.\n\nBut as time passed, as the city prospered after the Great Depression, so did St. Philip\u2019s. Today, it ranks among Charleston\u2019s most iconic houses of worship.\n\nSt. Michael\u2019s Church\n\nAs St. Philip\u2019s grew too large, the General Assembly of the Province authorized a second church be built.\n\nConstruction stretched over 10 years, from 1751 to 1761, once the damaged wooden remnants of the old St. Philip\u2019s were torn down.\n\nThe new cornerstone was laid in 1752, and nine years later St. Michael\u2019s held its first services. Except for adding a sacristy in 1883, the building has changed little over the years, according to a church history.\n\nIts steeple, soaring 186 feet high, housed what today is the oldest tower clock in North America with bells imported from England in 1764.\n\nFor 250 years, from Charleston\u2019s poorest days to its wartime sagas to these prosperous tourist-laden years, those bells have announced the city\u2019s routine life events, not to mention hurricanes, earthquakes, fires and two war-time bombardments.\n\nToday, St. Michael\u2019s also remains among the Holy City\u2019s most iconic structures.\n\nOld St. Andrew\u2019s Parish\n\nAlso one of the Colony\u2019s original 10 parishes, what\u2019s commonly known today as Old St. Andrew\u2019s Parish was born in 1706 to serve planters and their slaves west of the Ashley River.\n\nAfter a rocky start with its first two rectors \u2014 one died, the other was chased out \u2014 the parish grew into one of the wealthiest, fueled by rice, indigo and slave labor. By 1720, planters in the area owned more land and slaves than any other in South Carolina.\n\nIn time, the Colonists grew divided. Two-thirds of Anglican clergy sided with those wanting freedom from the king. So when the Revolutionary War erupted, the British didn\u2019t much like the Anglicans\u2019 houses of worship, and the war left St. Andrew\u2019s in near ruin.\n\n\u201cThe ravages of war have left St. Andrew\u2019s a desolation,\u201d reported John Grimke Drayton, the parish\u2019s longest-serving rector, according to a church history titled \u201cAgainst All Odds,\u201d written by Paul Porwoll.\n\nReconstruction forces set up camp at the church, and worship was no more. Its doors and windows were left open, its pews vacant, its future bleak.\n\nIn 1891, Drayton died. Old St. Andrew\u2019s nearly died, too. For 57 years, the church sat dormant.\n\nThen, a small band of faithful saved it, reopening on Easter 1948.\n\nMost recently, it underwent a restoration in 2004 and 2005, and is the suburban worship hub that locals know today.\n\nChrist Church\n\nAnother suburban church, Christ Church, was born in 1706 when the Church of England was the Colony\u2019s official church.\n\nBack then, the parish was described simply as \u201cSouth-east of the Wandoe river,\u201d according to a history written by a late parishioner, Anne King Gregorie. She descended from one of its key families, the Porchers.\n\nMost of its first vestry probably were \u201chardy adventurers who had crossed the ocean to make new homes in America,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBack then, Mount Pleasant wasn\u2019t so pleasant. The residents labored in a mostly agricultural area of slave-owning plantations.\n\nIn 1725, the church building burned accidentally. So the church rebuilt.\n\nThen in 1781, British troops occupied the new space. They burned down the church and the vestry house.\n\nThe church was destroyed, many of its faithful dead, and the area was left impoverished. The blackened ruins remained on the roadside, \u201creminding all who passed of the hatefulness of war,\u201d Gregorie wrote.\n\nThe church and vestry house eventually were rebuilt.\n\nBut then came the Civil War when a company of Union Cavalry used the church as a stable. They burned the windows, doors, pews and pulpit in campfires. Once again, the shell of the walls was all that remained.\n\nYet again, Christ Church rose and rebuilt.\n\nMount Pleasant also began to look more like Mount Pleasant. And Christ Church took its place among the area\u2019s most historic hubs of worship.\n\nReach Jennifer Hawes at 937-5563, follow her on Twitter at @JenBerryHawes.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Local families worshiped at parishes for centuries, long before Episcopal split, Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nFaith & Values, \r\nFaith & Values, Episcopal Church,Episcopal Church in South Carolina,Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina,Episcopal lawsuit,history,St. Michael's Church,St. Philip\u2019s Church", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "When Alfred Pinckney strolls the ancient graveyard at St. Philip\u2019s Church, as he likes to do, he steps over earthen paths traveled by his ancestors who have worshipped here since the 1760s.", "title": "Local families worshiped at parishes for centuries, long before Episcopal split", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150214/150219656/local-families-worshiped-at-parishes-for-centuries-long-before-episcopal-split", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150214/PC1204/150219656/AR/0/AR-150219656.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150214/PC1204/150219656/AR/0/AR-150219656.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When Alfred Pinckney strolls the ancient graveyard at St. Philip\u2019s Church, as he likes to do, he steps over earthen paths traveled by his ancestors who have worshipped here since the 1760s.", "title": "Local families worshiped at parishes for centuries, long before Episcopal split", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150214/PC1204/150219656/AR/0/AR-150219656.jpg?201502142059", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150219656}}, "keywords": "Local families worshiped at parishes for centuries, long before Episcopal split , Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nFaith & Values, \r\nFaith & Values, Episcopal Church,Episcopal Church in South Carolina,Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina,Episcopal lawsuit,history,St. Michael's Church,St. Philip\u2019s Church", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-14T18:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-02-14T20:59:00Z", "author": "Jennifer Berry Hawes"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "When Alfred Pinckney strolls the ancient graveyard at St. Philip\u2019s Church, as he likes to do, he steps over earthen paths traveled by his ancestors who have worshipped here since the 1760s."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a9c\"", "article_summary": "Signatories were: St. Philip\u2019s, St. Michael\u2019s, Old St. Andrew\u2019s, St. Helena\u2019s, Trinity Edisto Island, St. John\u2019s and Prince George parishes.\n2010: After years of theological discord with The Episcopal Church, diocese voted to remove the so-called \u201caccession clause\u201d added in 1841.\n1761: First worship held at new St. Michael\u2019s Episcopal on \u201cFour Corners of Law,\u201d representing ecclesiastical authority.\n1789: Diocese joined six other state associations to become founding members of The Episcopal Church, the national church body.\nMembers of St. Philip\u2019s Church head to Sunday School after the early service recently."}
