He noted that The New Republic has \"always tried to be a part of the conversation about policy,\u201d dating back its Progressive Era roots and early support for issues like the minimum wage.\n\nCohn said he and the two other primary writers for the vertical, Danny Vinik and Rebecca Leber, will offer reasoned arguments around issues like health care, the economy and climate change in the new section, which will be called Q.E.D. It will be found at NewRepublic.com, and Cohn and Co. also plan to produce a daily email newsletter.\n\nCohn\u2019s Thursday post on Obamacare rate shock suggests what readers might expect from Q.E.D. While the media debate often resides in the extremes -- success or failure -- Cohn argued that \u201cthe truth is somewhere in between and the real argument, among those who follow the law closely, is whether the good stuff outweighs the bad stuff or vice versa.\u201d Cohn walked readers through the issue with several charts based on a just-released survey.\n\nQ.E.D. takes its name from an abbreviation for a Latin phrase that means \u201cwhich was to be demonstrated\u201d and is found at the end of mathematical proofs. Similar to proofs, Cohn said policy writers should show readers how they arrived at a given conclusion.\n\nA 17-year veteran of The New Republic, Cohn has built a strong reputation in Washington for deep coverage of budgetary and social welfare issues. In 2007, he wrote a book on health care policy, Sick, and in recent years he has written extensively on the Affordable Care Act. (He's been largely supportive.) While politically liberal, Cohn opts on television and Twitter toward civil, wonky debates over partisan food fights.\n\nCohn remarked on how much the policy news cycle has changed since his early days at the magazine. He recalled writing in the late 1990s on HMO regulation and having a week to meet a print deadline. Now, he said, readers \"expect you to know what you\u2019re talking about\" in three hours.\n\nCompetition in the wonk world has only gotten hotter in recent months.\n\nIn January, Cohn wrote that \u201cpolicy journalism is having its moment\u201d after Ezra Klein, the founder of the Washington Post\u2019s Wonkblog, left the publication to co-found Vox.com, a site focused more on explaining the news than breaking it. Nate Silver also launched his data-driven FiveThirtyEight site in March, and The New York Times responded to his departure with The Upshot a month later.\n\nWhile Q.E.D. fits into journalism's \"wonk bubble,\" it's a small-scale operation when compared to high-profile launches like Vox and FiveThirtyEight, each of which boasts dozens of staffers.\n\nNoah Chestnut, The New Republic\u2019s director of labs, told The Huffington Post that Q.E.D. will add new features in the coming weeks to enhance the conversation between the writers, readers and other policy experts. Q.E.D., he said, will grow organically and innovate quickly based on reader engagement.\n\nCohn wouldn\u2019t speculate as to how many posts can be expected daily. But given that Cohn used to publish one or two detailed posts a day on The Treatment, his old health care policy blog, it\u2019s unlikely Q.E.D. writers will be churning out posts simply to generate content. Indeed, Cohn acknowledged that he\u2019s \u201ca big believer in quality over volume.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEW YORK --  The New Republic will launch a domestic policy and politics vertical on Monday...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-06-23 20:00:49 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "NEW YORK --  The New Republic will launch a domestic policy and politics vertical on Monday...", "title": "The New Republic Expands Policy Coverage Online With Q.E.D.", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/22/new-republic-qed-policy_n_5519042.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1869194/images/o-NEW-REPUBLIC-QED-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NEW YORK --  The New Republic will launch a domestic policy and politics vertical on Monday...", "creator": "mlcalderone", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1869194/images/o-NEW-REPUBLIC-QED-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "The New Republic Expands Policy Coverage Online With Q.E.D.", "site": "@HuffPostMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-22 20:00:49 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5519042", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "the backstory,jonathan cohn new republic,tnr,new republic policy,qed,The New Republic,jonathan cohn tnr,jon cohn,new republic section,new republic q.e.d.,new republic qed,q.e.d.,jonathan cohn,new republic", "article": {"section": "Media", "tag": "the backstory,jonathan cohn new republic,tnr,new republic policy,qed,The New Republic,jonathan cohn tnr,jon cohn,new republic section,new republic q.e.d.,new republic qed,q.e.d.,jonathan cohn,new republic", "published_time": "2014-06-22 20:00:49 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-06-23 07:59:02 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "In 2007, he wrote a book on health care policy, Sick, and in recent years he has written extensively on the Affordable Care Act.\nA 17-year veteran of The New Republic, Cohn has built a strong reputation in Washington for deep coverage of budgetary and social welfare issues.\nwill add new features in the coming weeks to enhance the conversation between the writers, readers and other policy experts.\nSimilar to proofs, Cohn said policy writers should show readers how they arrived at a given conclusion.\nBut given that Cohn used to publish one or two detailed posts a day on The Treatment, his old health care policy blog, it\u2019s unlikely Q.E.D."}
