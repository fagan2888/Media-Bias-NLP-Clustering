These reserves could reach 776 billion cubic meters.\n\nOn Friday, the National Office of hydrocarbons and mining (ONHYM) confirmed that encouraging gas indications were found in Sidi Mokhtar (Essaouira province) as part of an oil test drill carried out by the Longreach Oil & Gas Ltd company.\n\n\u201cThese indications are encouraging signs to continue the zone\u2019s exploration through 3D seismic acquisition and the drilling of other wells,\u201d ONHYM added.\n\nDuring the opening session of the Morocco Oil and Gas summit, which took place in Marrakech on May 7-8, the head of the ONHYM, Amina Benkhadra, was optimistic about the prospects of oil and gas in Morocco.\n\nIn spite of the optimism expressed both by Moroccan officials and the chairman of Longreach Oil & Gas, Moroccans are skeptical regarding the possibility that their country sits on a consequential reserve of oil and gas. In the past, there have been instances when overoptimistic statements were made about the discovery of oil and gas in Morocco only for the Moroccan people to learn later that the statements were based on inaccurate data.\n\nFor example, Moroccans still remember the case of Talsint, in eastern Morocco, when in August 2000 the Moroccan government announced the discovery of oil in the Talsint region. Just a few weeks later, the government reversed its assessment and said that such an announcement was inaccurate.\n\nNevertheless, as previously reported by MWN, Morocco is still believed to have the world\u2019s sixth largest reserves of oil shale in the world.\n\nEdited by Elisabeth Myers\n\n\u00a9 Morocco World News.
