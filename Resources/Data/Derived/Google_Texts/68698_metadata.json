No, it isn\u2019t the election \u2014 it\u2019s the next open enrollment period in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe first enrollment period reduced the number of uninsured in Philadelphia by 27-percent. Advocates want the number to shrink even more in the second go-round, so outreach workers like Neil Rickett are starting now, even going door-to-door to find the uninsured.\n\n\u201cI work with Enroll America. We do education and outreach for the affordable care act,\u201d he tells a neighbor on the Kensington street that he targeted for a recent canvas. \u201cGot a few minutes, I could talk to you about health insurance?\u201d\n\nRickett has been getting a warm reception. Even those who already have insurance often have questions or ask for information to pass on to friends.\n\nIf he finds someone who isn\u2019t insured but may be eligible for subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care Act, he takes their contact information for follow-up.\n\n\u201cOur research shows that people are 25-percent are more likely to enroll if you make at least three contacts with them,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen we get to the open enrollment period in November, we\u2019ll have a targeted list of people that have already stated interest in getting enrolled and we\u2019ll be able to get them to enrollment events in their neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also looking for people who may be eligible for coverage right now, due to a life event such as marriage, divorce, unemployment or the birth of a child.\n\nAlexandra was in the category. A month away from her 26th birthday, she was about to lose coverage through her parents\u2019 policy. Rickett took her information and offered Enroll America\u2019s help in shopping the marketplace.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just looking to make sure everybody get\u2019s covered,\u201d Rickett told her.\n\nRickett concedes that knocking on doors is a labor intensive way to reach the uninsured. He still thinks it\u2019s worth it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really high-intensity type of canvas,\u201d he says. \u201cWe may not reach as many people as we want to but we find that we have a really high success rate with the people we do get in touch with.\u201d\n\nRickett says he\u2019ll keep at it till the next enrollment period ends next February.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The next open enrollment period in the Affordable Care Act is not until November, but campaigning is already underway.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/07/28/advocates-go-door-to-door-for-affordable-care-act/", "image": {"width": 985, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/neil-rickett.jpg?w=985", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/neil-rickett.jpg?w=985", "height": 739}, "type": "article", "description": "The next open enrollment period in the Affordable Care Act is not until November, but campaigning is already underway.", "title": "Advocates Go Door-To-Door For Affordable Care Act"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/neil-rickett.jpg?w=985", "title": "Advocates Go Door-To-Door For Affordable Care Act", "site": "CBSphilly", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The next open enrollment period in the Affordable Care Act is not until November, but campaigning is already underway."}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "keywords": "affordable care act, enroll america, kyw newsradio, neil rickett, pat loeb, philadelphia community, heard on, local, news, philadelphia, watch + listen", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, enroll america, kyw newsradio, neil rickett, pat loeb, philadelphia"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7c6\"", "article_summary": "No, it isn\u2019t the election \u2014 it\u2019s the next open enrollment period in the Affordable Care Act.\nWe do education and outreach for the affordable care act,\u201d he tells a neighbor on the Kensington street that he targeted for a recent canvas.\nIf he finds someone who isn\u2019t insured but may be eligible for subsidized coverage through the Affordable Care Act, he takes their contact information for follow-up.\nThe first enrollment period reduced the number of uninsured in Philadelphia by 27-percent.\nAdvocates want the number to shrink even more in the second go-round, so outreach workers like Neil Rickett are starting now, even going door-to-door to find the uninsured."}
