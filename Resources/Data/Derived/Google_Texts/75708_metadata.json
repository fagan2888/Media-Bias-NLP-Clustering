She says a recent problem with Covered California is making it difficult for her clients when it comes to their medical care. \u201cI just got off the phone call with one of my girls and she said, \u2018Hey they won\u2019t see me at the doctor anymore,\u2019\u201d she said. \u2026Whitlow says it\u2019s happened to a number of her clients in the past few months. \u201cWhat then we find is these girls decide not to go to a doctor,\u201d she said. \u201cSo now we have them not going to prenatal care.\u201d\n\nBut that is not the only technical problem associated with the Golden State\u2019s Obamacare exchange. Federal investigators found significant cybersecurity weaknesses in the health insurance websites of California and two other state exchanges that could enable hackers to get their hands on the personal information about hundreds of thousands of people.\n\n\u2026[A] spokesman for the state\u2019s exchange, Roy Kennedy, would not say how Covered California was addressing the problems, citing security concerns. He pointed instead to a letter sent in October to members of Congress. Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee said there have been no successful breaches of website security. However, he said personal information may have been exposed in a few instances because of human error or other mistakes. \u2026Since the GAO audit, Lee\u2019s letter said, Covered California conducts more frequent scans to identify threats, and any critical findings will be immediately fixed.\n\nBut beyond the computer issues, there is even more trouble ahead. California\u2019s insurance exchange is threatening to cut hospitals from its networks for poor performance or high costs.\n\n\u2026The California Hospital Association said the exchange is moving too fast and acting too much like a regulator. \u201cThe devil is in the details, and the rapidity of this concerns us,\u201d said Dr. David Perrott, chief medical officer at the state hospital trade group. \u201cWe understand value-based purchasing is here in some form and we do not oppose that. But Covered California is charging ahead with this assessment and trying to figure out the answers when it hasn\u2019t been worked out.\u201d California physicians warn that the exchange\u2019s proposal could further reduce networks that already are too thin for patients.\n\nAll of these issues were predicted by Tea Party groups during our 2009 protests attempting to stop passage of Obamacare.\n\nNow, the Obamacare chickens are beginning to come home to roost\u2026and they they just laid a big egg on Covered California.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Covered California Facing Huge Computer Glitches: Obamacare chickens are now coming home to roost", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion", "description": "Obamacare chickens are now coming home to roost", "title": "Covered California Facing Huge Computer Glitches", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/LI-18-Covered-California-e1461368586908.png", "updated_time": "2016-04-23T14:28:09+00:00", "url": "http://legalinsurrection.com/2016/04/covered-california-facing-huge-computer-glitches/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2016-04-23T14:30:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T14:28:09+00:00"}, "keywords": "obamacare", "google-site-verification": "f_SDILa9XMa3xcLX9n6eq0yDinw8hWKIjXr-0IOcgIE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee said there have been no successful breaches of website security.\n\u2026Since the GAO audit, Lee\u2019s letter said, Covered California conducts more frequent scans to identify threats, and any critical findings will be immediately fixed.\nNow, the Obamacare chickens are beginning to come home to roost\u2026and they they just laid a big egg on Covered California.\nShe says a recent problem with Covered California is making it difficult for her clients when it comes to their medical care.\n\u2026[A] spokesman for the state\u2019s exchange, Roy Kennedy, would not say how Covered California was addressing the problems, citing security concerns."}
