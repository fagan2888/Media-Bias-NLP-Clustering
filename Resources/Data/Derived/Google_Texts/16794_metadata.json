Asa Hutchinson took his pitch for continuing Medicaid expansion in Arkansas directly to the public Tuesday by holding a town hall meeting on the topic.\n\nSpeaking in the auditorium of Central Baptist College in Conway, Hutchinson said he did not support the federal Affordable Care Act and was not involved in creating the program known as the private option, Arkansas\u2019 alternative to the expansion of Medicaid rolls that was envisioned in the law.\n\n\u201cI inherited it,\u201d Hutchinson said of the program that uses federal Medicaid money to subsidize private health insurance for Arkansans earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nThe governor said ending Medicaid expansion at this point would create \u201cturmoil\u201d in the health care marketplace, leave \u201ca huge hole\u201d in the state budget and create a fairness issue because federal subsidies for health insurance would remain available to people earning 100 percent of the federal poverty level but would cease to be available to people earning below that level.\n\nHutchinson outlined his plan to replace the private option with a similar program that would be called Arkansas Works. The plan, which he will ask legislators to approve next month, would add features including:\n\n\u2014Mandatory referral to work or work training for unemployed, able-bodied recipients.\n\n\u2014Premiums of $19 per month and 2 percent co-pays for recipients earning more than 100 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\n\u2014A requirement that recipients enroll in employer-based insurance, where available, with premium assistance provided.\n\n\u2014Coverage that would be effective upon enrollment instead of being retroactive for the 90 days preceding enrollment, as it is now.\n\n\u2014An option for the state to end the program with 30 days\u2019 notice.\n\n\u201cUltimately, if you\u2019re able-bodied and you\u2019re able to work, you ought to be working, and if you\u2019re not working, you ought to be in job training, and if you\u2019re unemployed, you ought to be helping somewhere,\u201d he said.\n\nAn audience member asked if Arkansas would be able to get federal waivers to allow all of the changes Hutchinson is seeking. Hutchinson said he was confident it would and said the only thing he is seeking that no other state has done is the mandatory referral to work or work training.\n\nHutchinson said he would like to propose a work requirement for recipients, but that would not be allowed because it is not consistent with the philosophy of President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nAsked if Arkansas can afford the program, Hutchinson said a consultant has advised that the program will save the state money over the next five years.\n\nThe Stephen Group has estimated that the program will save the state $757 million between 2017 and 2021.\n\nBy 2021 the state will be paying 10 percent of the cost of the program, which now is fully funded by the federal government. Hutchinson said he believes the state can find enough savings in Medicaid to cover that cost.\n\nSome audience members asked about the governor\u2019s plan to let private companies manage parts of the Medicaid program for high-cost populations. Hutchinson said managed-care companies can save health-care costs by, among other things, giving patients incentives to make better use of services.\n\nHutchinson and state Surgeon General Greg Bledsoe also said any managed care plan would begin with a patients\u2019 bill of rights and a providers\u2019 bill of rights.\n\nAudience members had differing perspectives on the issue of work-training referrals. One person asked how the state would ensure that people follow through with work training.\n\nState Department of Workforce Services Director Daryl Bassett said every person to receive such a referral would have a caseworker who would track the person through the system.\n\nAnother audience member said many recipients may not have cars and may not be able to get to the training, especially if they live in a town with no bus system.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting up all kinds of roadblocks for them to continue to get health care because we think they\u2019re lazy. They\u2019re not,\u201d she said.\n\nHutchinson is expected to call a special session on Medicaid expansion starting April 6.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CONWAY \u2014 Gov.
