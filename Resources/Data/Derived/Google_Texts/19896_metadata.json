If someone contracts Ebola, he or she becomes contagious and can spread the disease to others. This is what causes an Ebola outbreak.\n\nWhat Are the Symptoms?\n\nEbola seems to be pretty similar to the flu at the start. This afflicted have a sudden high fever, muscle pain, and sore throats. However, an outbreak of Ebola causes those who have been infected to have bloody diarrhea, start vomiting, get red eyes and bleed from the nose or gums.\n\nAn Ebola outbreak is particularly scary because there is no cure and there is no vaccine.\n\nCan It Spread to the United States or Other Civilized Countries?\n\nLike we mentioned above, the answer is yes, but this don\u2019t mean that you should live in fear of contracting the disease. The first transmission of Ebola to the United States happened when research monkeys that were infected with Ebola were imported to the country.\n\nSix years ago, two tourists traveling in Uganda were infected with Marburg hemorrhagic fever \u2014 a disease very much like Ebola. Upon returning to their home countries, proper precautions were taken to limit the possibility of an outbreak. One tourist died, while the other survived.\n\nWhen Will It End?\n\nCertainly health officials in Guinea and other locations will be on high alert now that it is known that there is an Ebola outbreak that is threatening people\u2019s health. According to the World Health Organization, the outbreak period would be considered to be over in about 42 days.\n\nGiven that this newest Ebola outbreak has just hit, it is hard to say how soon this one will be over.\n\nImage via UN.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Ebola Outbreak that has left at least 59 people dead in Guinea has people in the United States and other countries questioning if it can happen to them.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The Ebola Outbreak that has left at least 59 people dead in Guinea has people in the United States and other countries questioning if it can happen to them.", "title": "Ebola Outbreak: Could It Happen in the United States?
