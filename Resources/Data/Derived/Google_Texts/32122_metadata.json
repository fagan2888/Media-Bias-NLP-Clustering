The Medical Society of South Carolina, which is made up of Roper physicians, has contributed $250,000.\n\nPart of the plan is get Roper medical professionals to meet regularly with an expert \u201cidea extractor\u201d to discuss and identify needs they glean from working with patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to give doctors the tools to transform themselves from users of new technology to creators of it,\u201d said Dr. Jacobo Mintzer, director of the biotech institute.\n\nThe proposals might range from the \u201ctrivial to the sublime,\u201d he said. Some suggestions have included minor changes in clinical procedures and new ways of keeping track of operating room instruments.\n\nAt the same time, the center is hiring a technology transfer expert to evaluate more ambitious ideas or promising research that could be turned into viable businesses, and then work to raise money to cover prototypes and other start-up expenses.\n\nProposals are being solicited both inside and outside Roper.\n\n\u201cWe are very open. We are an equal-opportunity idea receiver,\u201d Mintzer said.\n\n2 goals\n\nRoper established the biotech research institute in March 2013 in a fifth-floor wing of its Calhoun Street hospital. Its purpose was twofold.\n\nThe first objective was to incorporate more clinical research into everyday care, usually in the form of a government-approved experimental drug, Mintzer said. Today, researchers are at work on studies from six specialties, including primary care, oncology and dermatology.\n\n\u201cThe goal would be that every patient across the system who has a disease that is not completely treatable ... would, if they so desire, be able to receive cutting-edge treatment,\u201d he said.\n\nThe innovation part of the equation came next.\n\n\u201cWe had to create a structure that includes clinical research operations, marketing, regulatory, contracts, finance and accounting,\u201d Mintzer said. \u201cNow, when we had this structure together we looked at the other commitment that we had. That ... was to bring new technology to South Carolina.\u201d\n\nThe state hasn\u2019t exactly been a slouch in this area, he noted. The Boeing 787 operation in North Charleston and the BMW plant in Greer are prime examples from the manufacturing field.\n\n\u201cHowever, it has been less energetic in doing it in the \u2018bio\u2019 part of biotechnology,\u201d Mintzer added.\n\nAs the energetic Argentina native sees it, a big hospital system is an ideal place to nurture that industry from the ground up.\n\n\u201cMost of the innovation comes through small biotech companies. And most of the ideas come from clinicians who are seeing everyday patients,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rub is many doctors lack the time or the expertise to turn their million-dollar ideas into businesses.\n\n\u201cThere is a big gap to be filled,\u201d said Mintzer, who stressed the Roper initiative won\u2019t duplicate other local biotech booster efforts. \u201cIt requires capital and the know-how to use this capital to develop the product to the point that it can be acquired by a larger company or be commercialized by itself.\u201d\n\n1st investment\n\nNeuroquest is a case in point. Created inside the Weizmann Institute of Science, the small Israeli company\u2019s chief scientist, Dr. Michal Schwartz, has developed a marker that, in theory, can identify brain lesions associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease 10 to 15 years before the onset of any symptoms. It could lead to more effective treatments or even a cure.\n\nThe problem is \u201cthe technology has been stuck\u201d within the lab at Weizmann for the same reasons so many other promising ideas never make it to market, said Mintzer, himself an expert in Alzheimer\u2019s and a former Medical University of South Carolina phyisician.\n\n\u201cSo we did the due diligence, and we thought the technology has a future,\u201d he said.\n\nRoper and other backers, including The InterTech Group of North Charleston and the S.C. Research Authority, invested about $1 million in Neuroquest after a state trade mission to Israel in late 2012. The early tests from a medical outsourcing firm in Australia are encouraging, Mintzer said. By some estimates, Neuroquest is now valued at as much as $8 million, from virtually nothing three years ago.\n\n\u201cNow, after the completion of all preliminary studies, we\u2019re at the stage where we\u2019re about to establish the U.S. headquarters for the company here, start a large North American study with participation of major universities and complete a second round of investment,\u201d Mintzer said.\n\nThe hope is that the business will mature to the point that it will need more workers and more space, perhaps the SCRA Innovation Center on upper Meeting Street or at the emerging Horizon project near MUSC.\n\nAs for Mintzer and his staff, the task at hand is to uncover more opportunities like Neuroquest. He vowed that at least two more companies will be \u201cup and running\u201d and incubating along with Neuroquest on the fifth floor at Roper Hospital by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cThis is real,\u201d he said.\n\nContact John McDermott at 937-5572", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Roper biotech program bares its \u2018innovation arm\u2019 in Charleston, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Biotechnology Research Institute ,Dr. Jacobo Mintzer,Innovators,Neuroquest,Roper Hospital", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Thinking up new ways to improve medical care, even incrementally, is hard enough.", "title": "Roper biotech program bares its \u2018innovation arm\u2019 in Charleston", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150308/150309557/roper-biotech-program-bares-its-x2018-innovation-arm-x2019-in-charleston", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150308/PC05/150309557/AR/0/AR-150309557.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150308/PC05/150309557/AR/0/AR-150309557.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thinking up new ways to improve medical care, even incrementally, is hard enough.", "title": "Roper biotech program bares its \u2018innovation arm\u2019 in Charleston", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150308/PC05/150309557/AR/0/AR-150309557.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150309557}}, "keywords": "Roper biotech program bares its \u2018innovation arm\u2019 in Charleston , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Biotechnology Research Institute ,Dr. Jacobo Mintzer,Innovators,Neuroquest,Roper Hospital", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-08T07:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-03-06T11:43:00Z"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Thinking up new ways to improve medical care, even incrementally, is hard enough."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb07\"", "article_summary": "Part of the plan is get Roper medical professionals to meet regularly with an expert \u201cidea extractor\u201d to discuss and identify needs they glean from working with patients.\n\u201cWe had to create a structure that includes clinical research operations, marketing, regulatory, contracts, finance and accounting,\u201d Mintzer said.\nThe first objective was to incorporate more clinical research into everyday care, usually in the form of a government-approved experimental drug, Mintzer said.\n\u201cThere is a big gap to be filled,\u201d said Mintzer, who stressed the Roper initiative won\u2019t duplicate other local biotech booster efforts.\nHe vowed that at least two more companies will be \u201cup and running\u201d and incubating along with Neuroquest on the fifth floor at Roper Hospital by the end of the year."}
