The agency called it a proactive move.\n\n\u201cThis may be just the beginning,\u201d said Dr. Larry Dial, head of internal medicine at Marshall University, Monday on MetroNews \u201cTalkline\u201d.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act and the decision by Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin to take the Medicaid option doctors are treating more Medicaid patients, Dial said.\n\n\u201cWhat it\u2019s done is placed us in a position where we are much more at risk for these type of actions. So if our volume has went up and subsequently they are going to start to delay payments, I think it\u2019s going to impact the bottom line,\u201d Dial said.\n\nMarshall University\u2019s clinics have seen a 30 percent increase in Medicaid patients in the last two years.\n\nThe DHHR maintains the cash flow problem is in no way connected to the expansion. The state will begin allocating approximately $15 million to the expansion next fiscal year, DHHR Deputy Secretary Jeremiah Samples told MetroNews last week.\n\nWest Virginia Medical Association past-president Dr. Hoyt Burdick said on \u201cTalkline\u201d Monday some doctors may decide to stop treating Medicaid patients.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk. If the practice business model is failing tough decisions have to sometimes be made,\u201d Burdick said. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we as physicians want to do but that\u2019s the reality, the economic reality.\u201d\n\nBoth Burdick and Dial support a $1.00 increase in the state cigarette tax. It would provide much needed revenue but also reduce health care costs, Burdick said.\n\n\u201cFor every dollar spent on purchasing tobacco there\u2019s $8 in health care costs,\u201d Burdick said.\n\nThe Medicaid payments were made on time for April. Burdick said the payments are usually a little slower in the summer months.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicaid expansion, state budget problems not a good combination.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Medicaid expansion, state budget problems not a good combination.", "title": "More doctors may decide to stop treating Medicaid patients", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2016/05/02/more-doctors-may-decide-to-stop-treating-medicaid-patients/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Doctor-Generic.jpg", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Doctor-Generic.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@WVMetroNews"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-02T16:34:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-02T16:34:31+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Earl Ray Tomblin to take the Medicaid option doctors are treating more Medicaid patients, Dial said.\nWest Virginia Medical Association past-president Dr. Hoyt Burdick said on \u201cTalkline\u201d Monday some doctors may decide to stop treating Medicaid patients.\nMarshall University\u2019s clinics have seen a 30 percent increase in Medicaid patients in the last two years.\nThe Medicaid payments were made on time for April.\n\u201cThis may be just the beginning,\u201d said Dr. Larry Dial, head of internal medicine at Marshall University, Monday on MetroNews \u201cTalkline\u201d."}
