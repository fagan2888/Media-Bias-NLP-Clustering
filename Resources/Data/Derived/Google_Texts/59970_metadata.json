Kennedy might not be a sure vote for marriage equality after all.\n\nOne source of the fretting was this comment by the perennial swing justice: \"This definition [of marriage] has been with us for millennia, and it's very difficult for the court to say, oh, well, we know better.\"\n\nLater, however, Kennedy -- the author of three major gay rights decisions -- cheered same-sex marriage supporters when he returned to a favorite theme: the idea that laws shouldn\u2019t offend the dignity of gays and lesbians.\n\nIn a colloquy with the lawyer representing the state of Michigan, Kennedy said that the \u201cwhole purpose\u201d of marriage was that it \u201cbestows dignity\u201d on a couple and that same-sex couples want \u201cthe same ennoblement.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the argument, commentators pondered whether Kennedy was still a safe vote for striking down bans on same-sex marriage. Some would say that such speculation is out of line. As a former editor used to warn me when I was covering the court: \"Be careful. They might have been just playing devil's advocate.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court began hearing arguments on whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional right, with decisions expected in June.\n\nSometimes justices do ask questions unsympathetic to the side they eventually decide to support or role-play to demonstrate their open-mindedness. But just as often justices think aloud -- Justice Stephen Breyer is famous for telling lawyers what troubles him -- and offer what experienced reporters see as a reasonably reliable guides to how they will vote.\n\nThe question for the reporter becomes: Should I pretend that I have no inkling of how the case is likely to come out? Or do I owe it to the reader to report (if I believe it) that a justice leans a certain way or that the court is \u201csharply divided.\u201d\n\nSometimes justices do ask questions unsympathetic to the side they eventually decide to support or role-play to demonstrate their open-mindedness.\n\nI favor the latter approach, even if it creates a risk that a justice or the entire court will upset expectations. Sometimes, however, a reporter\u2019s best judgment is that particular justice is genuinely conflicted or at least hasn\u2019t shown his or her hand clearly enough to justify a prediction.\n\nThat was my takeaway from today\u2019s arguments, and I\u2019m not alone. My colleague David Savage, who covers the court, reported that Kennedy \u201cdid not tip his hand.\u201d But sometimes justices do. Think of Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s infamous \u201cbroccoli\u201d comment during arguments about the Affordable Care Act. Or Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.\u2019s comments today analogizing same-sex marriage to a m\u00e9nage a quatre.\n\nOn those occasions, reporters shouldn\u2019t be shy about telling their readers which way the judicial winds are blowing.\n\nFollow Michael McGough on Twitter @MichaelMcGough3", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Was Justice Kennedy playing 'devil's advocate' on gay marriage?", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "During this morning\u2019s Supreme Court \u00a0 arguments on same-sex marriage, my Twitter feed reflected anxiety that Justice Anthony M.
