ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThroughout the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games, Guggenheim fellowship-winning poet Kwame Dawes will be writing verses that capture the spirit of the day\u2019s action.\n\nIn this installment the poet offers a meditation on cold-weather sports, and thoughts on Lolo Jones, the telegenic but controversial Summer Olympian who changed gears to land a place on the Winter Olympic team.\n\nCONFESSIONS FROM THE EQUATOR\n\nI have to tell you,\n\nme, I love my sports:\n\nthe race the dance\n\nthe feats of power\n\nwinners losers almost made it\n\nbut when I look\n\nat skiers, skaters, sledders,\n\nboarders, curlers,\n\nall I think is cold.\n\nLOLO, QUEEN OF THE PRAIRIES\n\nExotic is what white folks call\n\nthe mixed up look by many other names.\n\nExotic is the wild side of take-home-to-mum\n\nbut not so wild to make folks wonder,\n\n\u2018cause the thing they call beauty\n\nis all over her face, plus great\n\nskin tone most un-Victorian\u2014\n\nno bloodless porcelain glow. No alabaster\n\npure, Rushdie\u2019s dirt in the mix,\n\nthe Native near enough the surface\n\nto imagine some mountain snow spirit.\n\nAnd no one cares to scratch\n\nthe surface to the Iowa parcel\n\npassed around from do-gooder to\n\ndo-gooder to rescue this elegant piece\n\nof driftwood\u2014nothing exotic there,\n\nnothing so cute in the con for a father\n\nand the hustle for a life. Lolo, Lolo\n\nall motion and power, floating\n\nover hurdles, then stripping for the mags.\n\nLolo, Lolo, in your thermal neon\n\njumpsuit, sprinting on ice, before\n\nthe hop and duck, and then speed\n\nspeed, speed, speed. Pretty is pretty,\n\nwin or lose, and the camera wants to love\n\nher tear-upped or hyped, and that\n\nis the game, it\u2019s always been the game,\n\nfor exotic skins against cold white ice.\n\nFeel the smile creep over your face,\n\nevery champion must have a story,\n\nevery loser must have an epic lurking,\n\nand then the race is worth the time\n\nfor we who stare at the spectacle,\n\nsuckers for a story.
