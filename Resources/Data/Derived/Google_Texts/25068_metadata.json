Thomas Marino (R-PA), pictured in 2011, has introduced a bill that would change some subtle wording of the Clean Air Act, while simplifying the law's code.\n\nThe Clean Power Plan, published in the Federal Register on Friday, is already the subject of a legal challenge by 24 states. But on Tuesday, legislators on the House Judiciary Committee will mark up a bill that could take a more roundabout way of subverting the EPA rule.\n\nH.R 2834, sponsored by Rep. Tom Marino (R-PA), is a relatively straight-forward, if somewhat odd, bill. It takes the Clean Air Act \u2014 a comprehensive environmental protection law that the EPA says is responsible for reducing pollution from six common pollutants by nearly 70 percent since 1970 \u2014 and reorganizes it into its own part of the U.S. code. The intent, lawmakers say, is to make it easier for researchers to find the relevant parts of the Clean Air Act.\n\nBut the EPA, in a letter from its general counsel in July, says the codification will confuse existing case law.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that if H.R. 2834 were enacted, it would further complicate the already complex task of interpreting the Clean Air Act in regulatory proceedings and court cases,\u201d wrote Avi Garbow.\n\nAs an example, Garbow noted that the codification picks one version of one section of the Clean Air Act \u2014 111(d) \u2014 that would invalidate the Clean Power Plan, over another version that authorizes it.\n\nOne of the major legal arguments against the Clean Power Plan, which seeks to reduce carbon emissions from the electricity sector under the Clean Air Act, rests on a clerical error. There are actually two different versions of Section 111(d) \u2014 one enacted by the House and one by the Senate. The House version, which is the one in the Marino bill, says that the EPA can\u2019t regulate additional pollutants from power plants, because it already regulates mercury from power plants in Section 112.\n\nSupporters of the Clean Power Plan have argued that the House version is clearly a mistake, since regulating mercury pollution and carbon emissions represent hugely different hazards. Opponents of the plan, though, are expected to argue that the House version makes the Clean Power Plan unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cBy selectively using one text and not including other language that had been enacted by Congress and signed into law by the President, the restated provision, if it were law, would exacerbate the confusion,\u201d Garbow wrote.\n\nFor his part, Marino has not made any secret of opposing the Clean Power Plan. The representative has a Stop the EPA\u2019s So-Called \u201cClean Power Plan\u201dpetition on his website.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Affordable Care Act\u2019 has never been affordable, and there\u2019s nothing clean about the EPA\u2019s \u2018Clean Power Plan.\u2019 This is simply a No Power Plan,\u201d he is quoted as saying.\n\nMarino\u2019s office did not respond to ThinkProgress\u2019s inquiry on Monday.\n\n\u201cIt might be well-intentioned, but with the example of the Clean Power Plan, it\u2019s clear that there could be some potential real-world impacts,\u201d Greg Dotson, vice president for Energy Policy at Center for American Progress, told ThinkProgress.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The Clean Power Plan's fate rests on the interpretation of a few words.
