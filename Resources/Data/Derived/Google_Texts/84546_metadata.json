Many of the details [in rules about benefits] just say you have to have a lawful presence, not that you don\u2019t have to be a qualified alien.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress never intended for illegal immigrants to get public benefits,\u201d Dane said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "article_metadata": {"classification": "LANGUAGES/English", "dcterms.modified": "2014-11-25 16:57:15 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/politics/0/0/Health%20Care%20Push.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Undocumented immigrants qualify for some federal benefits under Obama\\u0027s executive order\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/11/25/undocumented-immigrants-could-get-variety-federal-benefits-under-obama/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/politics/0/0/Health%20Care%20Push.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"47b862007f8e9410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-25T21:57:15Z\",\"tags\":[\"LANGUAGES/English\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "keywords": "United States,executive order,pay taxes,health insurance,Barack Obama,Affordable Care Act,Immigration Reform,immigration enforcement,Social Security,U S", "description": "Con respecto a los veh\u00edculos el\u00e9ctricos asequibles que te puedan hoy llevar m\u00e1s lejos con una carga, existen ahora mismo dos jugadores muy importantes en la contienda: Tesla y General Motors.
