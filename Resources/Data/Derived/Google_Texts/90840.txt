A House Republican lawmaker was introducing a measure Tuesday to ban the use of taxpayers’ dollars to renovate the White House bowling alley.

Rep. Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania, a former federal prosecutor, said he objects to the Obama administration’s reported plans to rebuild the two-lane bowling alley in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building adjacent to the West Wing.

“Smart budgeting means making choices and setting priorities,” Mr. Meehan said in a statement. “With our nation $17 trillion in debt, upgrading the president’s private bowling alley shouldn’t be a priority.”

He added, “That anyone at the White House thought it would be a good use of taxpayer funds is disrespectful to all of the hardworking taxpayers that are struggling to make ends meet in a tough economy. Taxpayers expect — and deserve — better.”

The General Services Administration last week posted a notice online soliciting for contractors’ bids to renovate the bowling lanes, saying the facility is damaged and outdated.
