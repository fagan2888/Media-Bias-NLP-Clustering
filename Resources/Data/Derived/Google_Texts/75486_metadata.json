It\u2019s too gridlocked, or something. As George Will said in his acceptance speech upon receiving the George Washington Award from Americans For Prosperity Foundation in 2010, \u201cgridlock isn\u2019t an American problem; gridlock is an American achievement.\u201d At the liberal conference Netroots Nation earlier this month, a panel comprised of Congressman Alan Lowenthal (D- CA), Mark Takano (D-CA), and Dan Kildee (D-MI) all said it made up the ingredients for a \u201ccrazy Congress.\u201d\n\nThe panel, moderated by Huffington Post politics reporter Sabrina Siddiqui, is described as such:\n\nFrom endless Obamacare repeal votes to the IRS \u201cscandal\u201d to the disgusting politicization of Benghazi, the 113th Congress has been a sight to behold. Hear from two progressive Members of Congress serving their first term on how they persevered to move the ball forward on progressive issues despite a conservative majority bent on picking useless political fights. Come to this panel for an inside look at how progressives are fighting the good fight in this House of Representatives\u2014and what it will take to break through and win on important issues.\n\nSiddiqui described the IRS fiasco as a \u201cso-called scandal\u201d in her opening remarks \u2013 and went on the list the various issues Congress faced, or is still debating, while House Republicans try to get to the bottom of what happened at the IRS when Lois Lerner was running the division overseeing tax-exempt nonprofits; issues like the Violence Against Women Act, Hurricane Sandy relief, sequestration, immigration reform, and Syria to name a few.\n\nShe then posed a question to Rep. Kildee and the rest of the congressmen about what they\u2019ve learned since being elected to Congress.\n\nHe said it was much more partisan than he had imagined, but said he was able to work on what he planned on working on \u2013 to a certain degree \u2013 in urban policy. Yet, as being the minority party in the House of Representatives, Congressman Kildee said he frustrated that his side is \u201cplaying more defense than offense.\u201d\n\nCongressman Takano said that he doesn\u2019t get easily frustrated, which he attributes to his teaching career before entering public life; he taught high school for twenty-four years, so you know that tests your patience. The response drew some laughter from the audience.\n\n\u201cI try to keep my expectation in line,\u201d he said. But Rep. Takano knew what he was getting into when he assumed his congressional office on January 3, 2013, where the lame duck Congress was still trying to hash out something for Sandy victims. Rep. Takano said House Republicans would eventually do the right thing, but had to be shamed into it by the Senate.\n\nAlthough, he noted that the high point of the alleged dysfunction was the government shutdown. But Democrats in the House and Senate, along with President Obama held the line and the Republicans finally backed off their demands over Obamacare.\n\nRep. Takano said the tone changed after the shutdown with his Republican colleagues. They reauthorized the Workforce Investment Act, which he said would\u2019ve been impossible in prior to the shutdown. So, standing firm against Republican hostage tactics, as he described them, was essential.\n\nRep. Lowenthal agreed with the premise that House Democrats play a lot of defense on the Hill, but said it\u2019s important to be in that position on some. The congressman is on the Committee on Natural Resources, which he describes as highly partisan, where discussions about drilling on federal lands are common. \u201cSomebody has to stand up and talk about the debate about some of the impact of climate change. And that\u2019s what we do as progressives,\u201d he said. It\u2019s all about framing the debate.\n\nHe mentioned that one of the good things about the dysfunction in Congress is that it\u2019s allowed Democrats to come together and create a political apparatus they can use when they retake the House. Rep. Lowenthal prides himself in being a member of the Progressive Caucus, where fellow Democrats support each other and lay out their policy objectives.\n\nLowenthal then railed against House Republicans, labeling them as arrogant and unwilling to heed to the will of the American public. \u201cRemember history is on our side; the people are on our side; it\u2019s only because of a crazy gerrymandering and the things that have happened in this county that we\u2019re not in control of the Congress. America is not represented by the people who it really wishes to represent,\u201d he said. So, that sentiment has also brought House Democrats, or at least the progressive ones, together.\n\nRep. Kildee also detailed how House Republicans are abusing the rules in way that\u2019s unprecedented. Specifically, the number of closed rules on legislation that Kildee says silences the minority.\n\nGranted, this is about House, but is he aware that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid nuked the Senate filibuster rules on most presidential nominees and appointments?\n\nThe panel moved on to discuss immigration reform and the border crisis. Rep. Takano noted that these immigrant children are turning themselves in to immigration authorities, so it\u2019s not about needing for more border guards.\n\nThese fleeing awful conditions \u2013gang violence being one of them \u2013 and that they should be able to make their case in front of a judge; hearings that are already law under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.\n\nRep. Lowenthal described this as a test for America, saying the law is clear that these children have rights and deserve their day in court. He also said the largest Cambodian and Vietnamese populations in the United States live within his district, where he remembers Americans welcoming Cambodians fleeing Pol Pot. After Saigon fell in 1975, we welcomed those Vietnamese refugees.\n\nThe problem with that analogy is that Mexico and Central America aren\u2019t being ravaged by civil wars or experiencing mass slaughter at the hands of genocidal dictators. They\u2019re also not fleeing political persecution.\n\nHouse Democrats are waiting in the tall grass for Republicans to implode. As expected, they\u2019re unhappy being in the minority, but see they\u2019ve gridlock as a way to build a political infrastructure for when they\u2019re in the majority.\n\nOf course, they railed against gerrymandering; Takano wants districts to be redrawn based on independent commissions like in California. Oh, and they\u2019re the party of the middle class.\n\nOne last note on gerrymandering, the 2011 redistricting gave the GOP no advantage whatsoever (via Washington Post):\n\n2012 compared to the 2010 Districts What if we \u201cre-run\u201d the 2012 House election, but using the old districts? We have done that simulation, using the 2008 presidential vote in both the old and new districts to capture how the redistricting might have moved partisans around. If we assume that nothing else affects House election outcomes but the partisanship of the districts\u2014in other words, if we allow redistricting to have its maximum possible effect\u2014we find that the 2011 redistricting cost Democrats 7 seats in 2012. This is not nothing, but it\u2019s far less than what the Democrats needed to take back the House and about half what Wang estimated. \u2026 2012 compared to history Perhaps the pre-2011 maps are not the right standard. In fact, there is evidence they were already biased toward Republicans. The question is whether that advantage is a product of redistricting. In turns out when we go back further in time across multiple redistricting cycles, House elections have tended to favor Republicans for at least a couple decades. Once we put 2012 in this historical context, it does not stand out as a \u201cgreat gerrymander\u201d at all. \u2026 Conclusion We\u2019ve written cautionary notes about redistricting several times in the past months. Simply raising the possibility that redistricting isn\u2019t always as powerful or pernicious as its critics suggest sometimes leads people to conclude that we are \u201cgerrymandering deniers\u201d who think redistricting has no partisan consequences whatsoever. That is not the case. The analysis above does not confirm the worst fears about the \u201cgreat gerrymander\u201d of 2012. But given the challenge of answering \u201ccompared to what?\u201d, we would not argue that the 2011 redistricting gave the GOP no advantage whatsoever. Political science research on redistricting has confirmed that control of the line-drawing process does yield some benefits. The challenge is in estimating what those benefits are. We have tried to show that the answer is far more complicated, and that the magnitude of the redistricting effect is probably smaller than many have assumed.\n\nAnd, then there\u2019s this bit from Philip Bump, also of the Washington Post:", "article_metadata": {"description": "And Republicans are the only ones who gerrymander districts -- said by no one..05/25/2016 12:10:53PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "And Republicans are the only ones who gerrymander districts -- said by no one.", "title": "- At Netroots, House Democrats Slam Gerrymandering, Say Gridlock Unites Them", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/07/29/at-netroots-house-democrats-slam-gerrymandering-say-gridlock-unites-them-n1871750", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/43/ee12c050-bf4a-4ec8-9209-a994984f42d4.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "And Republicans are the only ones who gerrymander districts -- said by no one.", "title": "- At Netroots, House Democrats Slam Gerrymandering, Say Gridlock Unites Them", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/07/29/at-netroots-house-democrats-slam-gerrymandering-say-gridlock-unites-them-n1871750", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/43/ee12c050-bf4a-4ec8-9209-a994984f42d4.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "At Netroots, House Democrats Slam Gerrymandering, Say Gridlock Unites Them, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddfd4\"", "article_summary": "Rep.
