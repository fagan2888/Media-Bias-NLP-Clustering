Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer has changed his views on the sustainability of Donald Trump's candidacy — though he still opposes it.On Monday's edition of Fox News Channel's "Special Report," Krauthammer said he once believed that Trump had to present plans to voters, but he now thinks the billionaire businessman can make it through the end of the calendar year without doing so."At some point you have to say exactly what you're going to do with health care other than I'll abolish Obamacare and then I'll produce … a terrific substitute. That's a plan of sorts," Krauthammer conceded."Perhaps on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, I would have a plan for something," he added. "We surround them and then go in and take ISIS' oil. That's another plan. I think it needs to be fleshed out a little bit."Trump's commanding lead in the polls is proof enough of his viability, Krauthammer said, but added later on "The O'Reilly Factor" that things may change as candidates drop out and Trump faces a smaller field of more serious candidates."I haven't changed my views of his candidacy, but I surely have on his durability," Krauthammer said.
