On one side, most of those who claimed that the Obamacare individual health insurance mandate is constitutional believe that Congress has virtually unlimited authority to regulate anything that might affect the economy, and that the courts should defer to the legislature on federalism issues whenever possible. The opposing view holds that Congress\u2019s powers are limited to those enumerated the Constitution, and that courts should not hesitate to enforce those limits. The Court\u2019s divided ruling gave something to both sides. The issues raised by the decision remain relevant as the debate over Obamacare and the limits of federal power continues.\n\nThe Individual Mandate and the Limits of Federal Power\n\nThe ACA individual health insurance mandate requires nearly all Americans to purchase government-approved health insurance by 2014 or pay a fine. The federal government advanced three arguments claiming that this is constitutional, asserting that Congress was authorized to enact it by the Commerce Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause, and the Tax Clause. As became increasing clear over the course of two years of litigation, the common weakness of these arguments is that they tended to break down meaningful constraints on federal power. That is the reason why the Supreme Court ultimately rejected the first two, and partially accepted the third.\n\nThe Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate \u201cCommerce \u2026 among the several states.\u201d Since the 1940s, the Supreme Court has expanded it broadly to cover virtually any \u201ceconomic activity.\u201d Failure to purchase health insurance, however, is not economic activity. If Congress could impose mandates simply because failure to take an action has an effect on the economy, there would be no limit to its authority. Failure to purchase broccoli affects the market for food. Failure to wake up early may affect an individual\u2019s productivity. As Chief Justice John Roberts put it in his decisive swing vote opinion, if Congress can \u201cregulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing,\u201d it would have the power to impose mandates \u201cwhenever enough [people] are not doing something the Government would have them do.\u201d But if the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to enact any law that affects the economy, the Constitution\u2019s elaborate listing of other congressional powers would become completely superfluous. For example, Congress would not need a separate power to coin money or declare war, since both of these measure obviously affect the economy.\n\nThe same problem bedeviled the government\u2019s argument that the mandate is authorized by the Necessary and Proper Clause, which gives Congress the power to \u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution\u201d other federal powers. The Supreme Court has defined the term \u201cnecessary\u201d very broadly. But even a \u201cnecessary\u201d law may be unconstitutional if it is not also \u201cproper.\u201d A majority of justices ruled that the mandate was not \u201cproper\u201d because the logic of the government\u2019s argument would have given Congress virtually unlimited power to impose any mandates that might affect the economy, thereby gutting limits on federal power. As James Madison explained in 1791, \u201c[w]hatever meaning this clause may have, none can be admitted that would give an unlimited discretion to Congress.\u201d\n\nHaving accepted nearly all of the case against the mandate, the chief justice joined the Court\u2019s four liberal justices in reinterpreting it as a tax, authorized by the Constitution\u2019s Tax Clause. He reasoned that the mandate is a tax because it imposes only a monetary penalty on those who fail to comply, the penalty is not so high as to be coercive, it does not apply to the very poor, and the fine is collected by the IRS. But the text of the statute refers to the fine as a \u201cpenalty,\u201d not a tax. And the Supreme Court has repeatedly distinguished between taxes and penalties, defining the latter as \u201can exaction imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act\u201d or omission; this description fit the individual mandate very well. Unfortunately, Roberts\u2019 opinion gives Congress broad power to use \u201ctaxes\u201d to force Americans to purchase virtually any product, whether it be health insurance or broccoli. But his reasoning also imposes important constraints on the degree of coercion it can use. Congress must limit mandates in inactivity to monetary penalties that are not coercive, and it cannot make it a crime to disobey.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ilya Somin", "description": "The administration's view of unlimited federal power is constitutionally dubious and practically dangerous.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Last year\u2019s Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act was part of an ongoing struggle over constitutional federalism.
