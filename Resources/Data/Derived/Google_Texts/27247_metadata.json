Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., chairwoman of the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, said Tuesday in a prepared statement.\n\nBlackburn said California-based StemExpress; the University of New Mexico; and Southwestern Women\u2019s Options in Albuquerque, N.M., had not cooperated with the panel\u2019s requests.\n\nAll three were subpoenaed to appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee to produce specific materials, she said:\n\nWhile it was our hope that these organizations would voluntarily work with us in this effort, some have refused to cooperate by withholding information that is critical to providing us with answers to questions the American people are asking. Consequently, if forced to do so, we will issue subpoenas to any organization that refuses to fully cooperate with our investigation.\n\nThe three organizations subpoenaed were the only ones that did not comply with requests out of more than 30 groups asked to produce documents, The Hill reported.\n\nThe pro-life Center for Medical Progress has released a series of hidden-camera videos that put the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, in the spotlight for its practices and procedures.\n\nThe videos spurred three House committees\u2014Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, and Oversight and Government Reform\u2014to begin looking into Planned Parenthood, which receives hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars.\n\nIn October, the Energy and Commerce Committee created Blackburn\u2019s Infant Lives panel to investigate practices and policies regarding the purchase of aborted body parts and fetal tissue, its cost, and how these parts are obtained.\n\n\u201cThis is about getting answers to questions about how we treat and protect life in this country,\u201d Blackburn, the no. 2 Republican on Energy and Commerce, said in October:\n\nThis is a discussion that this country must have; we cannot shy away from what is an unsettling topic. The allegations raised in these disturbing and abhorrent videos have led us to ask: What have we come to in this country? This select panel will allow us to have this conversation and help us get the facts about how infant lives are being treated.\n\nThe ranking member on the panel, Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., said the subpoenas are \u201cunjustifiable and abusive\u201d and \u201care a new low in the Republicans\u2019 attack on women\u2019s health care.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chair\u2019s actions are dangerous, particularly given the uptick in violence since release of the false and inflammatory videos against Planned Parenthood last July,\u201d Schakowsky said Tuesday in a formal statement.\n\nStemExpress, a biomedical tissue procurement company that supplies human specimens for biomedical research, cut ties with Planned Parenthood after the undercover videos prompted congressional inquires.\n\nStemExpress released this statement in response to the Blackburn panel\u2019s subpoena:\n\nStemExpress has turned over to the Select Investigative Panel numerous materials as well as materials produced previously for the House Committee on Government Reform, Senate Judiciary Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee for each of their own separate investigations.Throughout this process, StemExpress has continued to protect its clients\u2019 confidentiality, and to abide by its legal obligations. The Select Investigative Panel now seeks confidential client information and the identity of individual scientists and researchers through the issuance of a subpoena.\n\nThe subpoena for the University of New Mexico, in part, requests documents that show entities or persons from which it the school purchased or received aborted body parts or fetal tissue, as well as entities or persons receiving the parts or tissue from the university.\n\nThe subpoena also requests the identity of university-affiliated physicians who participated in abortions, prenatal care, or postnatal care of infants who survived an abortion procedure while at Southwestern Women\u2019s Options, an abortion clinic in Albuquerque, N.M., as well as persons at the university who received fetal tissue from Southwestern Women\u2019s Options.\n\nSimilarly, the subpoena for Southwestern Women\u2019s Options requests, in part, documents to show personnel affiliated with the University of New Mexico.\n\nThis report has been expanded to include more details on the subpoenas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "StemExpress, the University of New Mexico, and Southwestern Women\u2019s Options have been subpoenaed to appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "StemExpress, the University of New Mexico, and Southwestern Women\u2019s Options have been subpoenaed to appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.", "title": "Panel Issues 3 Subpoenas in Probe of Planned Parenthood", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160217_InvestigativePanel_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-18T10:11:07+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Q21Ueq"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "StemExpress, the University of New Mexico, and Southwestern Women\u2019s Options have been subpoenaed to appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committee.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160217_InvestigativePanel_Jessen.jpg"}, "title": "Panel Issues 3 Subpoenas in Probe of Planned Parenthood", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2016-02-17T17:49:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-18T10:11:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Select Panel on Infant Lives, Marsha Blackburn, abortion, StemExpress, House, Planned Parenthood, University of New Mexico, Southwestern Women\u2019s Options, fetal tissue, investigation"}, "article_summary": "This select panel will allow us to have this conversation and help us get the facts about how infant lives are being treated.\nThe Select Investigative Panel now seeks confidential client information and the identity of individual scientists and researchers through the issuance of a subpoena.\nStemExpress, a biomedical tissue procurement company that supplies human specimens for biomedical research, cut ties with Planned Parenthood after the undercover videos prompted congressional inquires.\nThe videos spurred three House committees\u2014Energy and Commerce, Judiciary, and Oversight and Government Reform\u2014to begin looking into Planned Parenthood, which receives hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars.\nConsequently, if forced to do so, we will issue subpoenas to any organization that refuses to fully cooperate with our investigation."}
