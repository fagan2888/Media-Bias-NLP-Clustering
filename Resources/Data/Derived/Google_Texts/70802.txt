At the same time Trump was declaring the need for more people to be armed, Obama was holding a town hall conversation on guns with CNN moderator Anderson Cooper.

The conversation followed Obama's announcement on Tuesday of executive actions intended to curb gun violence.

At his rally Thursday night, Trump went through a list of terrorist events, including the recent terorrist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif., and in Paris, and said that if only more "good guys" were armed "it would be a whole different story."

"Now, you know what a gun-free zone is to a sicko? That's bait," Trump said.

"A gun-free zone. ... That ends immediately. We're going back to sanity in this country."
