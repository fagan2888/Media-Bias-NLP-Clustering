The administration petitioned the justices to step in only 10 days after a federal appeals court ruled against President Obama\u2019s program. Unless the Supreme Court agrees to consider the issue and overrules the lower court, Obama has little chance of implementing the program before he leaves office in January 2017. The case raises major issues involving the separation of powers and federalism, and it has been one of the major flash points of disagreement between the Democrats and Republicans running for president.\n\nIf the Court takes it, that means we might get a decision in the spring of 2016 \u2014 thrusting the fate of millions of immigrant families right into the center of the presidential election. \u2014 gs\n\n* A lot of conservatives have cited the news of UnitedHealth Group\u2019s hundreds of millions in losses as the latest sign that Obamacare is collapsing. As usual, leave it to Jonathan Cohn and Jeffrey Young to explain the real deal here, with nuance and balance, and no sugar-coating, either. \u2013gs\n\n* Yesterday we noted that a majority of Republicans think the unemployment rate is higher today than it was when Barack Obama took office. Steve Benen has the chart of the day, showing how unemployment has actually gone over those nearly seven years, and considers the broader effects of this reality gap:\n\nThis is by no means limited to unemployment. President Obama increased border security, and Republicans are absolutely certain that he\u2019s done the opposite. The deficit has dropped by $1 trillion in the Obama era, and Republicans just know in their gut that the deficit has ballooned. The Affordable Care Act has lowered the uninsured rate to unprecedented depths, but Republicans are confident that \u201cObamacare\u201d hasn\u2019t improved the uninsured rate at all. The United States\u2019 international reputation has improved dramatically since the end of the Bush/Cheney era, though Republicans believe it\u2019s deteriorated.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new phenomenon, but it may be more comprehensive now than it has been before.\n\n* Elizabeth Bruenig looks at how we took in tens of thousands of Bosnian refugees in the 1990s to see what lessons might be gleaned for the question of Syrian refugees.\n\n* Ryan Cooper has a bracing summary of the larger context within which the battle over Syrian refugees is unfolding:\n\nSince the attacks in Paris, America has broken into a frenzy of Islamophobic political hysteria. The leading Republican presidential candidate has proposed a raft of literally Nazi-esque policies, and tiptoed up to even more. Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill ordering a \u201cpause\u201d in the admittance of new refugees. \u2026.a couple days ago an Ethiopian Christian taxi driver was assaulted when a drunk passenger mistook him for a Muslim. A presentation of plans to build a mosque near Fredricksburg, Virginia, was shut down when two men wouldn\u2019t stop shouting things like \u201cI\u2019ll do everything in my power to make sure that does not happen\u2026every Muslim is a terrorist.\u201d Fully 27 percent of Republicans think closing down all mosques would be a good idea (and a further 35 percent are unsure). Trump\u2019s security goons have now blacklisted at least two journalists.\n\nOn the other hand, we\u2019re not talking so much about Christian bakers anymore.\n\n* America-hater Ted Cruz comes out against registering all Muslims in America into some kind of database of potential subversives.\n\n* NBC\u2019s First Read Crew recaps some of the ugly rhetoric coming from the GOP right now, and ask the right question: Who in the party is going to stand up against it?\n\n* Noah Rothman calls out Marco Rubio for not standing up to Trump over his vow to close down mosques, one of the few conservative writers we\u2019ve seen doing so today.\n\n* Heather Digby Parton takes stock of the dangerous consequences that could result from the xenophobia currently spreading through our politics.\n\n* Francis Wilkinson asks and answers a good question: If the Tea Party is fading, why is Donald Trump continuing to do so well?\n\n* Bethany Albertson and Shana Gadarian explain how politics changes when you introduce a healthy dose of anxiety about terrorism.\n\n* At The Week, I marveled at how quickly and easily Republicans rampaged to the right on refugees.\n\n* And via Taegan Goddard, here\u2019s the quote of the day, from Rep. Steve King:\n\n\u201cI grew up with Fun with Dick and Jane. Wonderful. But you know, while I was going on, [Barack Obama] was going to a school in Indonesia, so his idea of America is entirely different than the idea that most Americans have of what we ought to be like, and he\u2019s filling our country up with people that will continue to attack us.\u201d\n\nYes, that Obama has done so much to divide Americans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "title": "Happy Hour Roundup", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/20/happy-hour-roundup-738/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/plum-line/Images/GOP_2016_Trump-0e8ae-021.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/11/20/happy-hour-roundup-738/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "plum line", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "plum line"}, "article_summary": "Unless the Supreme Court agrees to consider the issue and overrules the lower court, Obama has little chance of implementing the program before he leaves office in January 2017.\n\u2013gs* Yesterday we noted that a majority of Republicans think the unemployment rate is higher today than it was when Barack Obama took office.\n* NBC\u2019s First Read Crew recaps some of the ugly rhetoric coming from the GOP right now, and ask the right question: Who in the party is going to stand up against it?\n* At The Week, I marveled at how quickly and easily Republicans rampaged to the right on refugees.\nIf the Court takes it, that means we might get a decision in the spring of 2016 \u2014 thrusting the fate of millions of immigrant families right into the center of the presidential election."}
