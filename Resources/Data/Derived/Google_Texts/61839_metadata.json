Reuters\n\nA new study demonstrates that baby brains light up just like adult brains when exposed to pain. The world\u2019s first study to use advanced MRI technology to examine infant pain even goes so far as to suggest that infants may be more sensitive to pain than adults. For most people, this comes as no surprise. However, until 1987, doctors proceeded under strangely different assumptions.\n\n\u201cIt used to be thought that babies just don\u2019t feel pain,\u201d Dr. Rebeccah Slater of Oxford University's Department of Pediatrics and lead author stated in a video (see below). Slater further explained how a ground-breaking study in 1987 changed this scientific opinion.\n\nUntil the late 1980s, it was common practice for babies to be given neuromuscular blocks but no pain relief medication during surgery. The 1987 experiment followed two groups of babies undergoing surgery; one group of babies was given muscle relaxants, while the other group was given pain relief. After the surgery, the group of babies given medication for pain had much better outcome measures.\n\n\u201cThis really changed clinical practice,\u201d commented Slater, who explained how thereafter it was not considered acceptable to deny pain relief to babies. Today, a child in neonatal intensive care receives, on average, \u201c10 painful procedures a day,\u201d Slater said. \u201cGiven that their hospital stay is 50 days or more, this is a huge burden in early life.\u201d Clearly, then, pain relief drugs \u2014 even if they may be somewhat problematic in their own right \u2014 must make a substantial difference in a struggling newborn's life.\n\nInside the Brain\n\nFor the current study, Slater and her colleagues applied a pain stimulus, in this case a pinprick, to a group of 10 adults as well as a group of 10 infants. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the researchers recorded changes in activity levels occurring in the brains of both groups of participants.\n\n\u201cfMRI has been used to understand pain in many, many different studies, but it\u2019s never been used in babies,\u201d Slater noted. While undergoing this experiment, the adults verbally reported the intensity of their pain. For the non-verbal infants, the researchers simply observed reflex leg withdrawal.\n\nThe brain scans showed 18 of 20 pain regions active for adults were similarly active for the babies. The scans also revealed the babies\u2019 brains responded to a weak pin prick as adults did to pinprick four times as strong. For the researchers, these findings suggest that not only do babies experience pain much like adults, they also have a lower threshold of pain \u2014 substantially lower.\n\n\u201cAlthough we cannot necessarily infer an infant's subjective experience based on a given pattern of brain activity, these results make certain conclusions more likely,\u201d wrote the authors at the conclusion of the paper, adding this study supports the likelihood \u201cthat the infant experience is similar to that described by adults.\u201d\n\nSource: Goksan S, Hartley C, Emery F, et al. fMRI reveals neural activity overlap between adult and infant pain. eLife. 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "infants, neonatal, babies, pain", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The world's first MRI study of babies demonstrates that infant brains light up just like adult brains when exposed to pain.", "title": "New Study Uses An MRI To Verify Babies' Pain [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-scans-show-babies-feel-pain-adults-world-first-proves-what-every-mother-knows-330092", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/21/baby-pain.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The world's first MRI study of babies demonstrates that infant brains light up just like adult brains when exposed to pain.", "title": "New Study Uses An MRI To Verify Babies' Pain [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-scans-show-babies-feel-pain-adults-world-first-proves-what-every-mother-knows-330092", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/21/baby-pain.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/21/baby-pain.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-04-21T10:35:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-21T10:35:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The world's first MRI study of babies demonstrates that infant brains light up just like adult brains when exposed to pain."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd460\"", "article_summary": "The 1987 experiment followed two groups of babies undergoing surgery; one group of babies was given muscle relaxants, while the other group was given pain relief.\nThe world's first MRI study of babies demonstrates that infant brains light up just like adult brains when exposed to pain.\nThe scans also revealed the babies\u2019 brains responded to a weak pin prick as adults did to pinprick four times as strong.\n\u201cfMRI has been used to understand pain in many, many different studies, but it\u2019s never been used in babies,\u201d Slater noted.\nThe brain scans showed 18 of 20 pain regions active for adults were similarly active for the babies."}
