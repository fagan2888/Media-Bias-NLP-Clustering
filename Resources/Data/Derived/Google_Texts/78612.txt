Remembering Pearl Harbor

Those who were there will never forget. But the voices of those who faced the devastating Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, are rapidly being silenced by Father Time, as a USA Today story so poignantly captures.

The long-planned attack, which began at 7:48 on a lazy Sunday morning, sunk four battleships, killed 2,402 Americans and launched the U.S. into World War II.

One of those battleships was the USS Arizona, which still rests where it was sunk, partly visible from the memorial structure that spans – but does not touch – the mid-portion of the sunken ship. It’s the final resting place for many of the 1,177 crewmen who died, including more than 25 who survived the attack and chose to be interred with their shipmates when they later passed away.

The memorial is a humbling place to visit. I had the opportunity back in 2005 while on a Pacific trip for Gannett’s Navy Times, my previous newspaper.

You get there via ferry, and are almost immediately standing right over the sunken hull – some of it barely visible under the surface, in a ghostly sort of way, and parts of it in plain view.

A shrine at the far end of the memorial contains a marble wall listing the names of all who died during the attack.

At times, one can see their “black tears,” as the specks of oil still leaking from the massive ship 72 years later are called.

The epic scope of World War II is impossible to grasp for those of us who were not alive or of age during the war. So think about this: In one attack, on one morning 72 years ago today, more U.S. service members died than have died during 12 years of war in Afghanistan.

We honor the service of all. And we hope the world never again sees a world war.
