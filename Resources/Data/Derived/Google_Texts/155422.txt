Two drug suspects allegedly pulled a hotel fire alarm to avoid arrest.

Springs police say the suspects hoped the tactic would distract the officers who had cornered them at the MCM Hotel Elegante Saturday morning.

But it instead proved to be their undoing when the male suspect couldn't withstand the water pouring into their room.

According to police, officers went to the North Academy hotel around 7:30 a.m. after receiving information that a man and woman wanted on drug charges were staying there. The suspects barricaded themselves in their room and refused to come out.

Sometime before 10, a fire alarm went off. Firefighters responded to the scene and found no signs of fire--but a lot of water. The fire alarm triggered the sprinkler system, flooding several rooms including the suspects'. The hotel was evacuated and the electric system turned off so police wouldn't risk electrocution wading in relatively deep water.

Police say the male suspect, identified as 24-year-old Michael Muehbauer, eventually came out of his room complaining of hypothermia. He was taken into custody; officers then went into the room and arrested the female suspect, identified as 26-year-old Alexis Celona.

A German shepherd was found in the room and taken by police.

Police say the sprinklers went off in the suspects' room, causing the most damage in there. There was reportedly so much water, a toilet had to be removed from the room to allow the water to drain out. Between that room and adjacent hotel rooms that also flooded, the suspects allegedly caused at least $100,000 in damage.

In addition to the existing drug warrants, the suspects now face charges of tampering with fire suppression devices and endangering nearby hotel guests.
