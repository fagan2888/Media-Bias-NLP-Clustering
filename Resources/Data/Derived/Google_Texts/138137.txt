The vote is on to determine which turkey, Honest or Abe, will get a presidential pardon this Thanksgiving.

The two lucky birds are going head-to-head, or wattle-to-wattle, to become the official National Thanksgiving Turkey and win a pardon from President Obama on Wednesday.

The White House opened up online voting Tuesday to pick the fortunate gobbler. For the first time, voters can cast their ballot in a Twitter poll.

Not much differentiates the pair of 4-month-old male turkeys. Both Honest and Abe — who were named by California schoolchildren — prefer country music, according to a White House fact sheet. Their “strut style” does differ: Honest prefers “Skoots in Boots” while Abe is more of a “Macho Man” kind of bird.

No matter what happens with voting, Honest and Abe can both count their lucky feathers, as both of them will retire to a Virginia farm following the White House festivities.
