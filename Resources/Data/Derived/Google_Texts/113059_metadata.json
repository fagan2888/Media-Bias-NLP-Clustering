But together with a prior decision reining in the law's Medicaid expansion, the decision in the case brought by arts-and-crafts chain Hobby Lobby and other businesses marked a blow for the law and a reminder for critics of its reach. (Hobby Lobby provides coverage for 16 of 20 forms of contraception, but objected to those it claims can work after conception.)\n\nJoe Antos, of the American Enterprise Institute, said it \"touches on issues related to what is the power of the president versus the power of the Congress to decide how we run our lives.\"\n\nKellyanne Conway, who polls on issues affecting women, noted the health care law has struggled to win public approval.\n\n\"The majority of the Americans in everyone's polling rejects the Affordable Care Act as way too intrusive and invasive and also way too expensive for them,\" she said.\n\nSeveral polls have uncovered deep skepticism about the law. A Fox News poll from late June found a 56 percent majority disapprove of President Obama's handling of health care while only 41 percent approve.\n\nA poll from early June found 55 percent wish the law had never passed, compared with 38 who said the opposite.\n\nIn the same poll, 44-29 percent said the country will be worse off under the law, while 24 percent say it'll make no difference.\n\nThe court case once again raises the issue ahead of looming midterm elections. Democrats are using the ruling to highlight the impact on women, and defend the law's intent of providing contraceptive coverage to female employees.\n\nBut Republicans are likely to highlight the rebuke to the law itself.\n\n\"The election isn't for another few months,\" Antos said, \"and I think there will be other issues that will come up that will remind people that this is not the law that they would have hoped for.\"\n\nRoy added that \"this whole case was really about showing that ObamaCare's ability to regulate every aspect of the way the private sector and private economy works was not appropriate.\"\n\nIn mid-week, a poll by Bankrate.com found 68 percent of Americans say ObamaCare will play a role in deciding how they vote this fall. Thirty-two percent said they're more likely to vote Republican, while 26 percent said they're more likely to vote Democrat.\n\nAnd 52 percent, according to the poll, would like to see the new Congress make changes in the law, while only 12 percent of Americans want to keep it exactly as it is.\n\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
