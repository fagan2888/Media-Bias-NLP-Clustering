Maddow used the story as a jumping off point to examine the new burst of ads aimed at bolstering Republicans in the 2014 midterms, many of which are being funded by David and Charles Koch.\n\n\u201cMost people competing in normal American political terms have to wait until they\u2019re within a few weeks or months of their election before they start buying tens of millions of dollars of TV time to try to influence that election,\u201d Maddow said. But, \u201cif you are the Koch brothers, say, well then time is money and you\u2019ve got all the money.\u201d\n\nMaddow played one \u201ctough\u201d and \u201criveting\u201d ad paid for by Americans for Prosperity, which in turn is backed by the Koch brothers, that tells the story of an leukemia patient whose health insurance policy was canceled due to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOf course, as we reported earlier today, that ad was awarded three Pinocchios by Washignton Post fact checker Glenn Kessler when he discovered that the woman\u2019s new plan actually saved her $1,200/year and allowed her to keep her doctor.\n\nMaddow commended Senator Mark Begich (D-AK) for standing up to the Kochs with his own ad countering their false claims, but worried that Democrats would never be able to keep up with their spending level through November.\n\n\u201cCan they do this everywhere?\u201d she asked. \u201cBecause the Kochs are playing everywhere. That\u2019s the game now. That is 2014.\u201d\n\nWatch video below, via MSNBC:\n\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rachel Maddow ended her MSNBC show Tuesday night by reporting the news that Republican David Jolly had defeated Democrat Alex Sink in a special congressional", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-11-at-7.22.41-PM.png", "title": "Maddow Challenges Dems to Counter Koch Brothers\u2019 \u2018False\u2019 Obamacare Ads"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rachel Maddow ended her MSNBC show Tuesday night by reporting the news that Republican David Jolly had defeated Democrat Alex Sink in a special congressional election in Florida.
