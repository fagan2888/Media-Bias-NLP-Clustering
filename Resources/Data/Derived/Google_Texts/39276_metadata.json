The commander-in-chief recently said that our battle against the terror cell was accelerating and that we have made important strides against them. For example, in December, Obama admitted more progress needed to be made, but quickly pointed out that U.S. airstrikes resulted in the terror group losing 40 percent of territory it had claimed in Iraq. In the same speech, he told ISIL leaders that they \u201ccannot hide\u201d and the military was coming for them next, suggesting some kind of end was in sight.\n\nAt a ministerial meeting in Stuttgart, Germany on Wednesday, Carter took a much different tone.\n\n\"While we have gathered momentum since our ministerial in Brussels, this fight is far from over,\" Carter said.\n\nCarter\u2019s warning is perhaps most aptly noted by the death of Charles Keating IV, the 31-year-old Navy SEAL who this week became the third U.S. serviceman to die fighting ISIS.\n\n\u201cWe are putting people at risk every day,\u201d Carter said, before addressing the White House\u2019s recent announcement to send 250 more troops to Syria. While those troops will primarily be advising local forces on the ground, the defense secretary noted some combat cannot be avoided.\n\nWill the president be as candid as Carter in his next foreign policy address?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is the president shielding the truth about the fight against terror?.05/27/2016 6:02:14AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Is the president shielding the truth about the fight against terror?", "title": "Carter Disagrees With Obama's Assessment, Says ISIS Fight 'Far From Over'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/05/04/carter-isis-fight-far-from-over-n2157971", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/124/b9ba6387-21d7-46c1-97f9-901a1c87174e.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Is the president shielding the truth about the fight against terror?", "title": "Carter Disagrees With Obama's Assessment, Says ISIS Fight 'Far From Over'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/05/04/carter-isis-fight-far-from-over-n2157971", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/124/b9ba6387-21d7-46c1-97f9-901a1c87174e.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Carter Disagrees With Obama's Assessment, Says ISIS Fight 'Far From Over', Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Defense Secretary Ashton Carter apparently does not share President Obama\u2019s promising assessment of the fight against ISIS.\nWhile those troops will primarily be advising local forces on the ground, the defense secretary noted some combat cannot be avoided.\n\"While we have gathered momentum since our ministerial in Brussels, this fight is far from over,\" Carter said.\nWill the president be as candid as Carter in his next foreign policy address?\n\u201cWe are putting people at risk every day,\u201d Carter said, before addressing the White House\u2019s recent announcement to send 250 more troops to Syria."}
