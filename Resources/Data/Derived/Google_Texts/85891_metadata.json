Magazine photos are hyper-sexualized, and many models or celebrities often go completely nude from the waist up, with only pasties or emojis covering their nipples.\n\nThat\u2019s perhaps why Pink Ink Fund founder Amy Black, who runs an Instagram showcasing post-mastectomy tattoos, was shocked to find her Instagram suspended one day. According to Instagram\u2019s email to her, her content could not be reactivated because it contained \u201csexually suggestive\u201d content.\n\nThe Instagram page is indeed full of breasts \u2014 but none of them are sexually suggestive. In fact, they are uplifting and bring hope to thousands of women suffering from breast cancer. Many of the women featured on the Instagram show beautiful tattoos covering their mastectomies, and others don shirts that proclaim \u201cArt Heals.\u201d Click on \"View Slideshow\" to see the images.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "instagram, pink ink fund, mastectomy, mastectomy tattoos", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Women were enraged after Instagram deactivated a post-mastectomy tattoo account, stating it was too \u201csexually suggestive.\u201d", "title": "Post-Mastectomy Tattoo Account Reactivated After Instagram Shut It Down", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pink-ink-fund-post-mastectomy-tattoo-account-reactivated-after-instagram-shut-it-down-362350", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/19/ins5.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Women were enraged after Instagram deactivated a post-mastectomy tattoo account, stating it was too \u201csexually suggestive.\u201d", "title": "Post-Mastectomy Tattoo Account Reactivated After Instagram Shut It Down", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pink-ink-fund-post-mastectomy-tattoo-account-reactivated-after-instagram-shut-it-down-362350", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/19/ins5.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/19/ins5.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-11-19T19:04:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-20T10:58:39-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Women were enraged after Instagram deactivated a post-mastectomy tattoo account, stating it was too \u201csexually suggestive.\u201d"}, "article_summary": "According to Instagram\u2019s email to her, her content could not be reactivated because it contained \u201csexually suggestive\u201d content.\nThat\u2019s perhaps why Pink Ink Fund founder Amy Black, who runs an Instagram showcasing post-mastectomy tattoos, was shocked to find her Instagram suspended one day.\nThe Instagram page is indeed full of breasts \u2014 but none of them are sexually suggestive.\nMany of the women featured on the Instagram show beautiful tattoos covering their mastectomies, and others don shirts that proclaim \u201cArt Heals.\u201d Click on \"View Slideshow\" to see the images.\nIn fact, they are uplifting and bring hope to thousands of women suffering from breast cancer."}
