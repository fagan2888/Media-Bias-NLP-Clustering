His appearance in Fayetteville marked the closest a presidential contender has traveled to Robeson County this election cycle.\n\n\u201cThere are things he\u2019s saying he\u2019s going to take care of that no other politician will even touch on,\u201d said William Lowe, a Trump supporter who drove from Lumberton to attend the rally. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a force to be reckoned with. That this guy can fill up an arena says a lot about him.\u201d\n\nFans cheered as Trump rattled off the 14 out of 20 state primaries he\u2019s won since February. He played up his ties to North Carolina, where voters will hit the polls next week.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of people who work for me in North Carolina,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m probably the only presidential candidate that\u2019s ever came here who can say they employ a lot of people in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nTrump received 53 percent of the vote in a straw poll conducted Tuesday at the Robeson County GOP Convention. Ted Cruz, who was stumping in Concord that day, garnered 38 percent of the vote; Mark Rubio received 7 percent.\n\n\u201cFor the older guys and ladies of the party, the decorum and etiquette of Trump doesn\u2019t suit them,\u201d said Bo Biggs, a Republican and longtime observer of Robeson County politics. \u201cBut I think that the higher goal of defeating the Democratic nominee is going to bring everybody together. As we narrow the field, we\u2019re all going to come together.\u201d\n\nIn response to criticisms surrounding his boorish persona, Trump told the crowd that he \u201ccan be the most presidential person you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a professional politician,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m running against people who have run for office their whole life. \u201c\n\nThat\u2019s part of the candidate\u2019s appeal, according to Biggs.\n\n\u201cTrump has obviously tapped into frustrations,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has a huge draw of people who are very upset with what\u2019s going on in Washington.\u201d\n\nBrenda Pope, president of the Robeson County Republican Women organization, says she can\u2019t remember a time when a GOP front-runner has caused as much division within the party.\n\n\u201cHe has really awakened the sleeping portion of the Robeson Republican party,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve never seen before and hopefully it\u2019s going to turn out good.\u201d\n\nTrump hit familiar beats during the rally, vowing once again to \u201cget rid of Obamacare and Common Core.\u201d He also promised to \u201ctake care of veterans\u201d and to outfit troops with \u201cthe equipment that they need.\u201d\n\nAfter voicing his support of the Second Amendment, Trump argued that the recent massacre in Paris \u201cwould have played out differently with the bullets flying in the other direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cParis has some of the toughest gun laws in the world, folks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a mental health problem [in America] and we have to solve the mental health problem, but we need to protect the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe candidate walked on stage shortly after 7 p.m. as the Alan Parsons Project\u2019s \u201cEye in the Sky\u201d blared from the coliseum\u2019s PA. He spent the better part of an hour dismissing protesters, many of whom voiced their support of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, and admonishing the news media.\n\nHe occasionally managed to hit both targets at once.\n\n\u201cTomorrow you\u2019ll read in the paper: \u2018Trump has protests,\u2019\u201d he said as a protester was being ejected from the coliseum.\n\nMultiple videos circulating on social media show a 78-year-old Trump supporter sucker-punching a young protestor. A female protester said in a Facebook post that several male supporters bombarded her with violent and sexually explicit insults.\n\n\u201cIt was incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cThe hate and straight-up racism that filled that coliseum makes me want to cry.\u201d\n\nLowe says the protests did little to change his position on the real estate mogul.\n\n\u201cWhat I saw going on was a bunch of people wanting their 15 minutes of fame,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear them say anything other than \u2018look at me; put me on TV.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump closed the rally with a promise to \u201cbring jobs back to North Carolina.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be a brilliant country, not a smart country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep winning; you\u2019re going to love North Carolina and you\u2019re going to love your president.\u201d\n\nDemocratic candidate Hillary Clinton is set to visit a Durham high school today. Sanders announced plans this morning to hold a rally in Raleigh on Friday.\n\nStaff writer Jaymie Baxley can be reached at 910-416-5771 or by email at [email protected]\n\nPhoto by Jaymie Baxley | The Robesonian | Donald Trump played up his ties to North Carolina during a rally in Fayetteville on Wednesday.
