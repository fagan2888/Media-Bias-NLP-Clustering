Since the Ebola outbreak spread to Liberia and quite naturally entered the rubber farm itself, approximately 71 Firestone Liberia employees, family members, retirees, and people living in the surrounding communities have contracted the deadly virus. Of these, Firestone's Ebola Treatment Unit has helped 17 people survive and has become, in the process, a model medical center in the eyes of health officials worldwide.\n\nIn a country where cases of Ebola are doubling every three weeks, how exactly has Firestone Liberia withstood the viral storm? Oddly enough, it began with the most ordinary reaction to the news of a first case of Ebola in March: the executive team Googled the word ebola, according to The Wall Street Journal. Like most of us, Ed Garcia, president of Firestone Natural Rubber Company LLC, and his team knew little about the virus when the outbreak began.\n\nLearning more about the threat they faced, Garcia and his team quickly sketched an action plan to protect their employees. They erected two make-shift Ebola isolation clinics, built with shipping containers and plastic wrap. After learning more by way of Professor Internet, they distributed to the company hospital's staff the plantation\u2019s stock of hazmat suits, normally reserved for chemical spills. And, as the need arose, they trained medical staff how to handle patients and instructed janitors in the proper method of burying the corpses. As Garcia, who is responsible for running the plantation, explained to the WSJ, \u201cIt was like flying an airplane and reading the manual at the same time.\u201d\n\nA Company Town in Liberia\n\nThe population of Firestone Liberia\u2019s \u201ccompany town\u201d \u2014 known as Harbel and named after founder Harvey Samuel Firestone and his wife, Idabelle \u2014 totaled nearly 25,500 people at last count. This rarity in tropical Africa boasts one hydroelectric power plant, a botanical research division, and a radio service, all operated by Firestone. The company also maintains roads, water towers, housing, schools, telephone lines, and a hospital. Certainly, then, Firestone Liberia has had more to work with than most of Liberia when combatting this illness. However, its success goes far beyond an easy start.\n\nIn addition to creating a makeshift Ebola Treatment Unit, Firestone Liberia\u2019s emergency response has included active investigations, contact tracing, and intervention measures. The company has conducted a mass education program, which involved teachers from the company\u2019s schools going door-to-door to explain the disease not only to its employees but also to at least 72,000 additional people residing within the general community and surrounding areas. Among the company\u2019s most innovative decisions was its use of in-house radio station to broadcast interviews with survivors as a way to directly educate those ignorant or even doubtful of the disease's existence. According to the WSJ, Levi Zeopueger recently entertained his listeners with the details of his illness: \u201cI was unable to lift a plastic bottle of water, can you imagine?\u201d\n\nToday, Firestone Liberia is working to extend its effective methods in curbing the spread of disease throughout the country by collaborating with the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization. Even more, the company is generously donating funds to others who war against the disease. In September, Bridgestone Corporation, Firestone\u2019s parent, divided $1 million among Samaritan\u2019s Purse and UNICEF.\n\nSome subtly downplay Firestone's success where government's have failed by citing the company's great financial power and practiced organizational abilities. However, others see more human qualities in play. Clearly, the tremendous will and social concern demonstrated by the corporation's many employees have made all the difference in preventing the spread of disease.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "firestone liberia, bridgestone group, ebola", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Firestone's Ebola Treatment Unit has helped 17 people survive and has become, in the process, a model medical center in the eyes of health officials worldwide.", "title": "How Firestone Is Saving Its Employees From Ebola In Liberia", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/firestone-keeping-ebola-away-employees-liberia-through-low-tech-intervention-program-306878", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/rtr6r9z.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Firestone's Ebola Treatment Unit has helped 17 people survive and has become, in the process, a model medical center in the eyes of health officials worldwide.", "title": "How Firestone Is Saving Its Employees From Ebola In Liberia", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/firestone-keeping-ebola-away-employees-liberia-through-low-tech-intervention-program-306878", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/rtr6r9z.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/13/rtr6r9z.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-13T13:10:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-13T13:10:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Firestone's Ebola Treatment Unit has helped 17 people survive and has become, in the process, a model medical center in the eyes of health officials worldwide."}, "article_summary": "Certainly, then, Firestone Liberia has had more to work with than most of Liberia when combatting this illness.\nIn a country where cases of Ebola are doubling every three weeks, how exactly has Firestone Liberia withstood the viral storm?\nSince the Ebola outbreak spread to Liberia and quite naturally entered the rubber farm itself, approximately 71 Firestone Liberia employees, family members, retirees, and people living in the surrounding communities have contracted the deadly virus.\nLike most of us, Ed Garcia, president of Firestone Natural Rubber Company LLC, and his team knew little about the virus when the outbreak began.\nIn addition to creating a makeshift Ebola Treatment Unit, Firestone Liberia\u2019s emergency response has included active investigations, contact tracing, and intervention measures."}
