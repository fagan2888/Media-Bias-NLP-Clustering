The House is considering a stopgap funding bill that would fund the government through Dec. 11 and it is expected to include funds to authorize President Obama’s plan to train moderate Syrian rebels in an effort to combat the terrorist group ISIS.

On Tuesday, House leaders said they would need Democrats to vote for the measure in order for it to pass.

Cornyn said he would support the measure if it reaches the Senate later this week, although he has questions about the strategy Obama laid out last week.

“I do have questions about how the different rebel groups will be vetted,” Cornyn said. “That said, I will support the authority and the money to equip the troops.”

Cornyn said he would prefer Obama asked for congressional authority to use military force in Iraq and Syria but since Obama has said he won’t do that, he’d support the plan the president presented.

Obama said he doesn't need Congress to authorize military force because he wouldn't be putting U.S. troops on the ground. Obama is instead using airstrikes to stop ISIS from gaining more control in the region.
