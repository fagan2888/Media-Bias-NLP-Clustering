A study out Wednesday finds that this year's most popular health law plans are raising premiums an average of 15 percent in 2016. You'll have to switch if you don't want to pay more.

Allen plans to provide an analysis of the options to the Legislature during the February session.\n\nOregon insurers face an additional fee proposed by the federal government for allowing the state to use HealthCare.gov for Obamacare enrollments.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has proposed a 3 percent of premium fee beginning in 2017. This would be in addition to the 2.9 percent fee the state already charges insurers to cover Marketplace expenses, Allen said. Currently, there's no fee for using HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe proposed fee would amount to $13 million, DCBS spokesman Jake Sunderland said.\n\nIt's possible the request for proposals could unearth a more affordable option, he said.\n\nsyoo@StatesmanJournal.com, (503) 399-6673 or follow at Twitter.com/syoo.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://stjr.nl/1Rm0Zag", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Department of Consumer and Business Services, which oversees the Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace, is seeking proposals for technology solutions that could run the small business and individual marketplace", "og": {"site_name": "Statesman Journal", "description": "The Department of Consumer and Business Services, which oversees the Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace, is seeking proposals for technology solutions that could run the small business and individual marketplace", "title": "Oregon exploring setting up own exchange, again", "url": "http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/health/2016/01/13/oregon-exploring-setting-up-own-exchange-again/78745416/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/statesmanjournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Department of Consumer and Business Services, which oversees the Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace, is seeking proposals for technology solutions that could run the small business and individual marketplace", "title": "Oregon exploring setting up own exchange, again", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/949b96cb4493612fa2240b490183fc8ec66e165d/c=86-0-427-341&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/16/Salem/Salem/635859050874300670-Health-Overhaul-Premi-Haut.jpg", "creator": "@salem_statesman", "site": "@salem_statesman", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=815599744", "fb": {"app_id": 138699832852944}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/saerom.yoo"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) (Photo: AP)The state of Oregon may be getting back in the health insurance game.\nThe Department of Consumer and Business Services, which oversees the Oregon Health Insurance Marketplace, is seeking proposals for technology solutions that could run the small business and individual marketplaces.\nOregon insurers face an additional fee proposed by the federal government for allowing the state to use HealthCare.gov for Obamacare enrollments.\nThis means Oregon could again set up its own exchange platform, a strategy the state deviated from after Cover Oregon's failure to launch.\nThe proposed fee would amount to $13 million, DCBS spokesman Jake Sunderland said."}
