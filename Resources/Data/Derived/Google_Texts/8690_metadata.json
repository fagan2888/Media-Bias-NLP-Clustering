(Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\n4589209\n\nThe Council of the District of Columbia voted Tuesday to extend the contract to build the city\u2019s Obamacare exchange website to a company that is being sued for allegedly discriminating against American workers.\n\nIn 2013, the district awarded a $51 million contract to the India-based company Infosys Public Services Inc. to implement the city\u2019s health benefit exchange marketplace. The website is intended to allow D.C. residents to shop between competing insurance plans, though it hasn\u2019t yet launched.\n\nA lawsuit filed in 2014 by four former Infosys IT workers claims that the company intentionally discriminated against Americans in hiring and promotions, in favor of \u201cSouth Asian individuals.\u201d\n\nThe complaint alleges that around 2011, Infosys began a deliberate effort to purge non-South Asian employees in its United States offices and \u201cengaged in a systematic pattern and practice of discriminating against non-South Asian employees and in many instances replacing them with South Asian employees.\n\nSome members of the council, though, were unaware of the lawsuit facing Infosys when they voted to extend the company\u2019s contract.\n\nCouncilman David Grosso, who voted present because he is opposed to the council\u2019s role in approving contracts, said he didn\u2019t have time to look at it.\n\n\u201cMr. Chairman, given the fact that this is a $51 million contract and I haven\u2019t had time to really invest in studying it, I\u2019d like to be recorded as voting present,\u201d he told Council Chairman Phil Mendelson. He then reiterated the amount of the contract. \u201cFifty one million dollars.\u201d\n\nTiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for Councilwoman Yvette Alexander, who introduced the legislation, said she hadn\u2019t heard anything about the lawsuit, but people in her office would look into it.\n\n\u201cI know that hasn\u2019t come across our office,\u201d she said.\n\nLayla Bolten, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, claims Infosys interviewed her in its Washington, D.C. office to be a \u201cTest Lead Analyst,\u201d but instead hired her as a \u201cTest Analyst,\u201d which has considerably less responsibility and pay.\n\nBolten claims she was passed over for multiple promotions because she was not Indian, and she was routinely harassed because she did not speak Hindi.\n\nJust three of the 100 employees working on D.C.\u2019s healthcare exchange website were American, according to the complaint. Demographic data Infosys reported to the federal government showed that of Infosys\u2019s 59 offices in the United States, 21 have 100 percent Asian employees. At 53 of the 59 offices, at least 94.5 percent of employees are Asian.\n\nAnother of the plaintiffs in the case, Kelly Parker, alleges that in 2012 she was contracted by Infosys to provide IT services to Harley Davidson. In 2013, Parker claims the company decided not to hire her permanently and terminated her contract in favor of an Indian worker who \u201cParker herself had trained and moved to Tomahawk to replace her.\u201d (Related: Disney Forces Tech Workers To Train Their Foreign Replacements)\n\nIn May, Infosys moved to have the discrimination lawsuit dismissed, and while a federal judge dismissed some of the plaintiff\u2019s claims, she ultimately ruled that the central claim of the case could proceed.\n\nFollow Josh on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
