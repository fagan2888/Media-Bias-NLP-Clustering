Well, okay. How hard can that be? We take the \u2018Hour of Code\u2019 challenge to find out.\n\nIt only takes one hour.\n\nThat\u2019s the premise of \u201cHour of Code,\u201d a weeklong campaign launched this week with the goal of getting kids across the country to try their hands at computer coding.\n\nIt\u2019s a push that has been embraced by President Barack Obama. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates have offered their advice. And companies including Apple and Microsoft are opening their doors to get more of us average joes dabbling in the language of the web.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s born a computer scientist,\u201d President Obama says in one online video released with the campaign. \u201cBut with a little hard work \u2014 and some math and science \u2014 just about anyone can become one.\u201d\n\nBut coding, a difficult process which involves learning a new language\u2014one built for computers\u2014ain\u2019t easy. Can one hour of code really start someone who\u2019s never written a line of HTML down the path towards creating the next Facebook?\n\nTo find out, we asked staffers at The Daily Beast who would like to volunteer and take the challenge. We were searching for someone who hasn\u2019t tried to code before; someone who wasn\u2019t a native of the tech scene, and who didn\u2019t have a tech startup brewing on the side.\n\nWe found our volunteer in the very brave Jane Frye.\n\nWhat follows is a diary of her hour of coding\u2014and insight into whether this nationwide push might pay off for America\u2019s ever-expanding technology industry in its hunt for more coders in talent pool. - Brian Ries\n\nMy Hour of Code\n\nI\u2019m nervous yet excited.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m taking a University of Phoenix class and Mark Zuckerberg is the Prof. I mean hey \u2013 if someone like Zuckerberg can code, so can I right? Right?! Suddenly the conspiracy theorist inside me has a thought: could this be a trick to get me to sign up for Obamacare, and boost enrollment numbers?! More importantly: Is signing up for Obamacare as tough as learning to code?\n\nBut I digress.\n\nCoding is just like the game Angry Birds, the online tool\u2019s introduction says.\n\nWell that seems easy enough. But the simple puzzles we start off with have me skeptical.\n\nCoworkers walk by and accuse me of playing games on the job. No, I swear, it\u2019s all in the name of investigative journalism!\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

So far, so good.\n\nBut the exercises are getting tougher and my brain is starting to break a sweat. I make it through unscathed but get cocky in the next round and have to repeat a few of the puzzles to get them right.\n\nPhase IV brings on the addition of \u2018if/then\u2019 statements. My guard goes up. I smell math coming on. But on my screen Bill Gates sits cross-legged in a burnt orange Land\u2019s End half-zip and assures me I will do alright. Here\u2019s an if-then statement for you, Mr. Gates: If you studied words in college like I did, then you are probably bad at math. But I\u2019m in it for the long haul and want to see this thing to the end so no turning back. I think. As I listen to Gates go on to explain all the conveniences coding has to offer it makes me realize I should have used this coding business back in math class to do my homework FOR me.\n\nOk. Video party\u2019s over and I bravely begin my foray into the next round of challenges. The ante has been upped and now things are getting kind of fun. I\u2019m doing pretty well and start to envision a life in Silicon Valley as a Master Coder. Man, I\u2019ll miss New York pizza. At this point I have to admit the tutorial does quite a fantastic job of breaking everything down into layman\u2019s terms, and well, easy games, which I can\u2019t complain about.\n\nI\u2019ve now completed the final stage with flying colors (although, somehow I don\u2019t think my friend Zuckerberg Angry-Birded his way to the creation of Facebook so I know I have a lot left to learn). I take a breather, grab some water and eagerly anticipate the final video segment congratulating me on my hard work and offering me a lucrative position at a small start-up on the west coast. But a glitch has the video stuck in permaload mode and my patience is running thin after that strenuous hour of \u201cmath\u201d. Could this be the final exam? Am I supposed to code my way through the final video to get it to play? Have the critics been too hard on healthcare.gov if even these guys can\u2019t get it right??\n\nI have no choice but to return to my journalism roots and dig up the video on YouTube instead. Clearly a master coder I am not just yet. But I\u2019m off to a good start and looking forward to Angry-Birding my way through the next 19 courses offered. If not only Zuckerberg but I, too, can do it so can you.\n\nTrust me.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Technology", "publicationDate": 201312121520, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/tech-and-health", "description": "President Obama wants you to learn to code.
