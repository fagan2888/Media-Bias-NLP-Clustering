Asian stocks retreated, with U.S. stock futures also down somewhat.\n\nNetflix, Alphabet, Microsoft Earnings\n\nTop-name techs Netflix (NFLX) and Google owner Alphabet report quarterly results.\n\nThe video streaming leader is projected to see earnings drop 73% to 3 cents a share amid rising costs for its global rollout when it issues its report after the close on Monday.

Netflix expects subscriber additions to hit 6.1 million, up from 4.9 million last year.\n\nNetflix was able to retake the critical 200-day line on Tuesday, gaining 7.4% for the week. Shares are trading 16% below its December high and a cup-base buy point of 133.37.\n\nAlphabet reports after the close on Thursday. Earnings are expected to climb 23% to $7.96 a share as revenue increases 18% to $20.34 billion.

Oil prices, energy-related stocks and financial markets generally had rallied significantly from January\u2019s longtime lows for crude, in large part on output freeze hopes. However, Kuwaiti oil production has plunged due to a strike, providing some near-term support oil prices.\n\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration will release weekly U.S. crude stockpile and production numbers Wednesday. The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, will give inventory estimates late Tuesday. Baker Hughes (BHI) will release the weekly U.S. rig count on Friday.\n\nYahoo Bids Are Due Day Before Q1 Report\n\nFirst-round bids for flailing Web portal Yahoo (YHOO) are reportedly due Monday.

Analysts expect Sands to report a 6% drop in Q1 EPS to 62 cents. Revenue is seen shrinking 4.3% to $2.88 billion.\n\nLas Vegas continues to grow at a slow, steady pace and analysts point to signs that Macau, the globe\u2019s No. 1 gambling destination, may be near the end of a nearly two-year recession.\n\nEarlier this month, rival Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pre-announced Q1 combined Macau-Las Vegas casinos revenue of $987 million-$1.007 billion. The midpoint missed Wall Street\u2019s $998.22 million target. Wynn blamed Macau.\n\nBroadcasters\u2019 Show\n\nThe National Association of Broadcasters holds its show in Las Vegas from Saturday to Thursday.

Revenue is expected to reach $43.96 billion. UnitedHealth has reported slight upside surprises for the last two quarters.\n\nSpokesman Tyler Mason confirms that it is pulling out of exchange markets in Georgia and Arkansas in 2017, adding that ObamaCare accounts for \u201cless than 1%\u201d of UnitedHealth\u2019s business. Late Friday, Michigan regulators said UnitedHealth would exit that state as well.\n\nAirlines Profits Ready For Liftoff\n\nDelta\u2019s stock surged on Thursday after the carrier reported Q1 results and forecast $3 billion in 2016 fuel savings, benefiting from low oil prices that could lift many airlines to record profits this year. However, questions loom over whether the good times for the bottom line might be fleeting.\n\nWall Street will likely be on the lookout for such signals from the slew of airlines reporting results. United Airlines (UAL) reports quarterly results on Wednesday, while Southwest (LUV), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and Hawaiian Holdings (HA) report on Thursday. American Airlines (AAL) reports on Friday.\n\nIs Housing Building Momentum?\n\nA stack of economic data and earnings reports will show whether housing activity is picking up steam.
