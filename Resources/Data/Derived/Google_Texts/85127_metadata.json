That's the question I ask in my latest Time column. A snippet:\n\nIn The Myth of the Robber Barons, historian Burton W. Folsom made a distinction between market entrepreneurs, who got rich by providing goods and services to people at cheaply and efficiently, and political entrepreneurs, who maintained and grew their market share by lobbying for regulations and special privileges that gave them an edge. Folsom underscored that it\u2019s common for market entrepreneurs to become political entrepreneurs (think Thomas Edison, who used all sorts of political connections to kneecap market rivals). Uber\u2019s latest strategy may make sense from a business point of view\u2014Plouffe even calls it \u201cUber-mentum\u201d\u2014but if you believe in free markets, it\u2019s just as dispiriting as most of the other things that have ginned up anti-Uber fervor. And to the extent that new regulations make it that much harder for the next great disruptive business to come along, it\u2019s worse still.\n\nRead the whole thing here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "It was a great run, really.
