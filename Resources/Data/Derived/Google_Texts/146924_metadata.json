Neurosurgeon and CNN\u2019s Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta was reporting live from the scene as he performed life-saving surgery on an 8-year-old girl who had barely survived a house's collapse. But as he discovered months later, he had never operated on her at all. Instead, he cut into the skull of another girl.\n\n\u201cI hate mistakes. I really hate them,\u201d Gupta told The Daily Beast. \u201cI take this very seriously. We\u2019re going to learn from it. I\u2019m going to continue to dissect it. I\u2019ve thought about nothing else, frankly, since they first flagged this for me on Tuesday, and I\u2019m going through everything\u2026 If there\u2019s a lesson to be learned, I\u2019ll certainly share that.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s team arrived in Nepal\u2019s capital, Kathmandu, two days after the initial earthquake, and Gupta was sent into the heart of an overwhelmed Bir Hospital. When he arrived, doctors presented him two CAT scans: one of a 14-year-old Sandhya Chalise and another of an 8-year-old Salina Dahal. Both patients had epidural hematomas on the right side of their brains, however, one was in a more dire state than the other.\n\nThe hospital was in desperate need of staff physicians and Gupta said once the hospital recognized him from television they asked if he could assist in a craniotomy. As a neurosurgeon, 45-year-old Gupta was familiar with the procedure, and he proceeded to remove part of the girl\u2019s bone from the skull wielding a drill and string saw.\n\n\u201cWhen I went into the operating room, the surgeons came and grabbed me, they said they were not going to start the case until I was in the operating room \u2014 the patient was already draped,\u201d Gupta recalled. \u201cSo when you walk into a situation like that, the best way I can describe it is all you really see is the top of the head.\u201d\n\nWithout questioning the identity of the head, Gupta cut into the bone to remove a blood clot, which relieved swelling in the brain caused by blunt trauma. The entire procedure was reported on CNN, with a surgical scrub-clad Gupta declaring to his audience that the surgery was a success. Without the emergency surgery, Gupta said, she would\u2019ve had permanent brain damage or died.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t Salina he had operated on \u2014 instead it was Sandhya. When the story first broke on CNN\u2019s program \"New Day\" on Wednesday morning, co-host Chris Cuomo interviewed Gupta on the medical mix up.\n\n\u201cWhat has been flagged for us now, Chris, is in fact that the patient that I operated on may not have been this 8-year-old girl, but rather a 14-year-old girl in that same hospital during that immediate aftermath of the earthquake,\u201d Gupta said in the segment.\n\nIn the aftermath of the announcement, Gupta has agreed to interview after interview with news outlets. Whether it is to set the record straight or because he feels that as a hybrid doctor-journalist he owes it to his career, he has been publicly retracing his steps as more details unfold. Salina did eventually get the care she needed that day, but unfortunately, it was as the price of both erroneous reporting and medical malpractice.\n\n\u201cA good surgeon knows the identity of the patient he\u2019s operating on,\u201d said Ganesh Bahadur Gurung, the vice chancellor Nepal\u2019s National Academy of Medical Science, which runs Bir Hospital. \u201c[Gupta] is not a surgeon, he is a butcher.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nepal, earthquake, and, medical, mix, cnns, sanjay, gupta, reveals, he, performed, brain, surgery", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Sanjay Gupta incorrectly identified the patient he was performing brain surgery on.", "title": "CNN's Sanjay Gupta Admits He Operated On The Wrong Nepal Earthquake Victim", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nepal-earthquake-and-medical-mix-cnns-sanjay-gupta-reveals-he-performed-brain-surgery-342616", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/12/sanjay-gupta-nepal-surgery.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sanjay Gupta incorrectly identified the patient he was performing brain surgery on.", "title": "CNN's Sanjay Gupta Admits He Operated On The Wrong Nepal Earthquake Victim", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nepal-earthquake-and-medical-mix-cnns-sanjay-gupta-reveals-he-performed-brain-surgery-342616", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/12/sanjay-gupta-nepal-surgery.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/12/sanjay-gupta-nepal-surgery.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-12T12:26:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-12T12:26:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Sanjay Gupta incorrectly identified the patient he was performing brain surgery on."}, "article_summary": "Without the emergency surgery, Gupta said, she would\u2019ve had permanent brain damage or died.\nNeurosurgeon and CNN\u2019s Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta was reporting live from the scene as he performed life-saving surgery on an 8-year-old girl who had barely survived a house's collapse.\nWhen the story first broke on CNN\u2019s program \"New Day\" on Wednesday morning, co-host Chris Cuomo interviewed Gupta on the medical mix up.\nThe entire procedure was reported on CNN, with a surgical scrub-clad Gupta declaring to his audience that the surgery was a success.\nChaos ensued after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake hit Nepal on April 25, ultimately claiming more than 7,500 people\u2019s lives."}
