He embraces the poor, the disfigured, the outcast.\n\nThese attributes pose a sharp contrast, we are informed, to his mean-spirited, judgmental and arrogant predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, who was known for his fancy vestments and aloof, academic attitude.\n\nIf Francis has the common touch, the story goes, Benedict was firmly out of touch, perched on an ivory tower far inside the Vatican.\n\nTo many Catholics this media-driven contrast between the two Popes is laughable.\n\nBenedict may have been unpopular with the world and many of its opinion-makers, but those who loved him as the Holy Father, who listened to what he said and read what he wrote, knew a far different man than is cruelly caricatured in the media.\n\nWe welcomed Benedict's theology and liturgical vision; and the hallmark of his papacy was a deep humility rooted in prayer. He was ever the gentleman. Even his criticisms of trends in modern society that run contrary to the church\u2019s teachings on life, marriage and the family were delivered in courteous language.\n\nAnd when Benedict did say something likely to be deemed offensive, he was often extremely careful about the way in which he said it.\n\nIn fact, he was much more careful not to offend than his successor on the throne of St. Peter.\n\nEach Pope has his own teaching style, and it is obvious that with Francis, adherence to protocol and upholding custom is not his way. His strength is communicating parts of the Catholic faith in a simple, direct and visible way.\n\nBut bluntness is a double-edged sword, and some of his speeches and sermons have offended some of the papacy's biggest supporters. This, of course, counters the image of Francis as the \u201cgentle, pastoral shepherd.\u201d In sifting through media reports, I was shocked by how often the Pope criticized Christians and by the severity of his insults.\n\nI felt inspired by conversations with members of the clergy to compile a compendium of papal invective, calling it, tongue firmly in cheek, \u201cThe Pope Francis Little Book of Insults.\u201d\n\nIt is not a real book, of course. (This should have been obvious by the fact that I offered a 20% discount to anyone who directed one of the Pope\u2019s insults at a bookstore cashier.) Rather, it's an online litany of the surprising and sometimes slashing one-liners in Francis' verbal arsenal.\n\nIndeed, here's some of the names the Pope has actually called people: \"pickled pepper-faced Christians,\" \"closed, sad, trapped Christians,\" \"defeated Christians,\" \u201cliquid Christians,\u201d \"creed-reciting, parrot Christians,\" and, finally, those \"watered-down faith, weak-hoped Christians.\"\n\nCatholics who focus on church traditions are \"museum mummies,\" the Pope says. Nuns who fail to inspire faith in the church are \"old maids,\" and the Vatican hierarchy has at times been \"the leprosy of the papacy,\" in Francis' words.\n\nIndeed, men of the cloth face the brunt of Francis' fulminations. He has called some of them \u201cvain\u201d butterflies, \u201csmarmy\u201d idolators and \u201cpriest-tycoons.\u201d He\u2019s described some seminarians as potential \u201clittle monsters.\u201d\n\nThe Pope didn't say these things just to insult people, of course. Rather, he was often making a larger point about the kind of church he wants to lead: open, merciful and unafraid.\n\nMORE ON CNN: Pope Francis: No more business as usual\n\nBut at the same time, some Catholics have felt alienated by Francis\u2019s criticisms, as if they are under attack. In blasting the status quo, it can sometimes seem as if the Pope is slighting the most faithful members of the church.\n\nTo be honest, reaction to my satirical \u201cPope Francis Little Book of Insults\u201d has varied.\n\nSome readers are so amused that they want to see the book really published so they can buy a copy. Others are outraged that I could dream up something so \u201cdisloyal\u201d to the Pope. (I am hopeful that our Holy Father has a healthy sense of humor.)\n\nI am also hopeful that, over time, Catholics will become accustomed to this pontiff\u2019s style of teaching, even if it contradicts the shallow media image of \u201cFrancis the Friendly Pope,\u201d as one well-known website calls him.\n\nSpeaking of media, Pope Francis hasn\u2019t left journalists out of the fun. In a recent address, he called them \u201cfomenters of coprophagia!\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what it means, look it up. But whatever you do, don\u2019t complain and be like \u201cMr. and Mrs. Whiner.\u201d\n\nAfter all, as Pope Francis says, nobody likes a \u201csourpuss.\u201d\n\nLaurence England lives in Brighton, England, and writes the blog That The Bones You Have Crushed May Thrill.
