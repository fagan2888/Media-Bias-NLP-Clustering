An off-duty Delanco police officer who shot a man suspected of breaking into his vehicle will not face criminal charges.

Burlington County prosecutors said Wednesday a grand jury determined that Officer Basil Warren acted lawfully in the September 2014 incident and declined to indict him.

Meanwhile, a separate grand jury indicted the man who was shot, 27-year-old Tysean Fitzpatrick, of Willingboro, on one count of third-degree attempted theft.

The incident unfolded after Warren arrived at his Edgewater Park home about 3 a.m., having just completed his shift and still dressed in his police uniform.

He briefly went inside the home, leaving the Chevrolet Avalanche - the officer's personal vehicle - running.

That's when Fitzpatrick allegedly got inside the vehicle and began to back it out of the driveway, according to prosecutors.

Officials said Warren shouted for the vehicle driver to stop, but Fitzpatrick continued onto the street, prosecutors said.

Warren fired his police-issued gun five times when the vehicle lurched toward him, striking Fitzpatrick, who survived, officials said.

The prosecutor's office said grand jurors voted not to indict the officer in late July and returned the indictment against Fitzpatrick on Oct. 1 but did not announce either grand jury's decision until Wednesday.
