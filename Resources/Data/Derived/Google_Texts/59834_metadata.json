Gallup, for instance, finds Congress with an approval rating of just 9 percent. And worse, at 14 percent and falling, its yearly approval rating is on track to be the lowest ever. For comparison\u2019s sake, this makes Congress less popular than traffic jams, cockroaches, head lice, root canals, and colonoscopies.\n\nPresident Obama is still more popular than all of those, but he\u2019s not doing well. According to the latest Quinnipiac survey, his approval has dropped to its lowest point ever\u2014just 39 percent of voters approve, compared to 59 percent who disapprove. And for the first time, a majority of voters\u201452 percent\u2014disagree that Obama is \u201chonest and trustworthy,\u201d a huge blow to his personal brand. On individual issues, his ratings are poor to mediocre, with fewer than 40 percent approval for his handling of foreign policy, immigration, the federal budget, health care, and the economy.\n\nWith all of this said, we should be careful not to over-interpret these numbers. It\u2019s not clear that his approval is suffering because of his misleading rhetoric on the Affordable Care Act or the problems with Healthcare.gov. Yes, pundits have already pointed to more \u201ccredibility\u201d or \u201ccompetence\u201d as things that could improve Obama\u2019s standing. But we should remember that the economy explains the large majority of the variance in political trust and approval. To wit, here\u2019s a chart from political scientist John Sides that illustrates the relationship:\n\nJohn Sides, The Monkey Cage\n\nIn the last two months, the economy has seen a steep decline in consumer confidence and a slight uptick in unemployment. Wages haven\u2019t budged, benefits have been slashed, and too many people are stuck in depressed communities with little in the way of growth or opportunity. For the millions of Americans who face profound economic insecurity, there\u2019s no reason to approve of anyone in Washington, and so they don\u2019t.\n\nNone of this is to say it doesn't matter that Obama misled the public or bungled the rollout of the federal exchanges, but that those things are subordinate to economic growth when it comes to presidential approval. If joblessness were low and the economy was booming, Obama would have strong support from the public, even with his mistakes (see: Clinton, Bill). Simply put, the only path to lasting popularity for the White House (and Congress, for that matter) is robust economic growth. But, given the demand shortfall, that requires billions of dollars in sustained investment from the federal government, which just isn\u2019t possible with a Republican majority in the House of Representatives.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201311131520, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "Forget more \"credibility\" or \"competence.\" The only thing that can save Barack Obama's approval ratings is a stronger economy, and right now, that's far off.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "You Can Blame the Economy for President Obama's Unpopularity", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"You Can Blame the Economy for President Obama\\\\u0027s Unpopularity\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/13/you-can-blame-the-economy-for-president-obama-s-unpopularity.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/13/you-can-blame-the-economy-for-president-obama-s-unpopularity/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46145209.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/13/you-can-blame-the-economy-for-president-obama-s-unpopularity\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-13T15:20:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "tags": "u_s_politics0", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-13T15:20:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/13/you-can-blame-the-economy-for-president-obama-s-unpopularity", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Forget more \"credibility\" or \"competence.\" The only thing that can save Barack Obama's approval ratings is a stronger economy, and right now, that's far off.", "title": "You Can Blame the Economy for President Obama's Unpopularity", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/13/you-can-blame-the-economy-for-president-obama-s-unpopularity.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/11/13/you-can-blame-the-economy-for-president-obama-s-unpopularity/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1384356292611.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3e6\"", "article_summary": "The only thing that can save Barack Obama's approval ratings is a stronger economy, and right now, that's far off.\nSimply put, the only path to lasting popularity for the White House (and Congress, for that matter) is robust economic growth.\nBut we should remember that the economy explains the large majority of the variance in political trust and approval.\nIf joblessness were low and the economy was booming, Obama would have strong support from the public, even with his mistakes (see: Clinton, Bill).\nYes, pundits have already pointed to more \u201ccredibility\u201d or \u201ccompetence\u201d as things that could improve Obama\u2019s standing."}
