Hill+Knowlton Strategies has added RC Hammond, a top aide to former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich to its Washington office.

Since 2012, Hammond was running his own PA, crisis and media relations consulting outfit.

Hammond was press secretary for Newt 2012 bid for the Republican presidential nomination.

Earlier, he was with the former Georgia Congressman's American Solutions for Winning the Future 527 organization.

That group is remembered for its "Drill Here. Drill Now" 2008 initiative for offshore energy development and the "No More Obamacare" effort launched in January 2011.

ASWF folded in March 2011 upon Gingrich's decision to establish an exploratory committee to run for president.

Prior to Gingrich, Hammond worked for ex-Oregon Senator Gordon Smith and West Virginia Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito, who was elected Senator of the Mountain State on Tuesday.
