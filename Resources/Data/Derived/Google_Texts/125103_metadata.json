While there have always been a few greedy doctors, businessmen-wealth-seekers \u2014 not doctors \u2014 now dominate the medical-industrial complex. They include for-profit insurance, medical device and pharmaceutical companies as well as for-profit and nonprofit corporate providers of health care services, such as the three large hospital systems in Maine.\n\nPartly because of the Affordable Care Act, they also include a rapidly growing army of lawyers, consultants and policy wonks who are creating lucrative businesses helping hapless \u201cconsumers\u201d \u2014 formerly \u201cpatients\u201d \u2014 \u201cnavigate\u201d their way through the grotesquely byzantine maze our health care system has become.\n\nThis shift in emphasis from patient care to money profoundly has affected the practice of medicine and resulted in the clash of cultures within health care. As increasing numbers of \u201cproviders\u201d \u2014 formerly \u201cdoctors\u201d \u2014 become employees of large health care corporations \u2014 formerly community hospitals \u2014 we have come under increasing pressure to diagnose profitable diseases and order profitable tests and procedures without enough regard to the benefits or harm accruing to patients. Hospital \u201cCEOs\u201d \u2014 formerly \u201cadministrators\u201d \u2014 trained in the ethics and practices of business rather than health care are incentivized to configure their \u201cproduct lines\u201d \u2014 formerly \u201cservices\u201d \u2014 to produce the largest \u201cprofits\u201d \u2014 formerly \u201cmargins.\u201d\n\nThose of us in the health care \u201cbusiness\u201d \u2014 formerly \u201cprofession\u201d \u2014 have been slow to react to this hijacking of our health care calling. Patients, despite sensing something is deeply wrong, feel helpless to push back. That now seems to be changing.\n\nFor the past three years The Lown Institute, founded by Dr. Bernard Lown, renowned cardiologist and advocate for universal health care, has held conferences designed to point out the growing problem of overtreatment in medicine. Recently they also have turned their attention to the equally disturbing problem of impaired access to health care and undertreatment. They now advocate for RightCare \u2014 not too much treatment and not too little.\n\nArguably some of the most important effects of Obamacare have been the destabilization of our deeply dysfunctional health care system and an order-of-magnitude increase in the amount of attention given to its dysfunction by the media and the public. Elisabeth Rosenthal\u2019s excellent New York Times series \u201cPay Till It Hurts\u201d and Steven Brill\u2019s Time magazine cover story and book titled \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bitter Pill\u201d are two of the most recent examples. These two factors have created an opportunity for real structural and cultural change.\n\nThere are many advocacy groups \u2014 Physicians for a National Health Program, HealthCare-NOW, Maine AllCare \u2014 trying to highlight these issues and to propose ways to turn this runaway train around.\n\nWhile they are necessary, attempts at education and persuasion are not sufficient. Unlike past human rights movements, such as women\u2019s suffrage and marriage equality, the fight for the right to health care for all Americans will require redirecting huge sums of money away from deeply entrenched, profit-oriented private corporations to not-for-profit programs that directly promote the public\u2019s health and wellbeing.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine estimates that the convoluted American health care system wastes $750 billion per year in inefficiency and fraud, unnecessary administrative complexity and medical services, unjustifiably high prices and missed prevention opportunities. That waste creates a lot of jobs but does not pay for one Band-Aid or aspirin.\n\nI attended the latest Lown conference, held last week in San Diego, to talk about the \u201cHeal-In\u201d held at Boston City Hospital in 1967 as an example of direct action taken by doctors, nurses and other healers to achieve a political goal without compromising patient care. The capstone of the conference was to announce the expansion of Lown\u2019s mission, previously focused on education and discussion, to include creation of a national grassroots movement that will include direct action. Their first foray will be called RightCare Action week and is scheduled for the fall. Stay tuned.\n\nChanging our health care system is as much about persuasion through power as it is about the power of persuasion. We as patients have power through the ballot box, and we as health care workers have power through our key roles in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of health care to return and redirect its mission toward healing and away from its increasingly singular obsession with profitability.\n\nAll we have to do is summon the will and the courage to exercise that power.\n\nPhysician Philip Caper of Brooklin is a founding board member of Maine AllCare, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group committed to making health care in Maine universal, accessible and affordable for all.
