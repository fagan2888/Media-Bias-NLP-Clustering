Again\n\n\"It is important to point out that the Vatican is not broke ... the Holy See is paying its way, while possessing substantial assets and investments,\" Pell said, according to an advance text made available on Thursday.\n\nPell did not suggest any wrongdoing but said Vatican departments had long had \"an almost free hand\" with their finances and followed \"long-established patterns\" in managing their affairs.\n\n\"Very few were tempted to tell the outside world what was happening, except when they needed extra help,\" he said, singling out the once-powerful Secretariat of State as one department that had especially jealously guarded its independence. \"It was impossible for anyone to know accurately what was going on overall,\" said Pell, head of the new Secretariat for the Economy that is independent of the now downgraded Secretariat of State.\n\nAustralian Outsider\n\nPell is an outsider from the English-speaking world transferred by Pope Francis from Sydney to Rome to oversee the Vatican's often muddled finances after decades of control by Italians.\n\nRelated: Pope Francis Slams Capitalism and Growing Inequality\n\nPell's office sent a letter to all Vatican departments last month about changes in economic ethics and accountability.\n\nAs of Jan. 1, each department will have to enact \"sound and efficient financial management policies\" and prepare financial information and reports that meet international accounting standards.\n\nEach department's financial statements will be reviewed by a major international auditing firm, the letter said.\n\nSince the pope's election in March, 2013, the Vatican has enacted major reforms to adhere to international financial standards and prevent money laundering. It has closed many suspicious accounts at its scandal-rocked bank.\n\nIn his article, Pell said the reforms were \"well under way and already past the point where the Vatican could return to the 'bad old days'.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Vatican's", "title": "Miracle Money?
