Officials in Iowa have now found a second occurrence of avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, at an egg laying installation in Osceola County on Monday, according the the U.S. Department of Agriculture. All 5.3 million hens at the facility will be euthanized to prevent further spreading to the disease.

Last week, bird flu was found in a group of 27,000 turkeys in Buena Vista County, which were also euthanized. Officials stated an entire flock of birds can be wiped out in just two days from the disease.

Scientists stated they believe the deadly virus is being distributed via migratory birds in the Mississippi flyway. The first strain found was in this pattern.

The industry has ramped up its biosecurity since the breakouts. Officials were worried last week that the bird flu virus would infiltrate Iowa’s commercial egg laying industry. Therefore, facilities around the area have been quarantined to prevent further damage. The lethal virus has also been found in many other states across the country.
