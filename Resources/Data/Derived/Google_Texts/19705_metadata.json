Jim Butler, an Oakwood Republican, drafted House Bill 157 in an ambitious attempt to reform Medicaid and rein in health-care expenses across the board.\n\n\u201cWe have consistently poured money into an ever-expanding medical-industrial complex with a woeful return on taxpayer investment,\u201d Butler wrote in a Dayton Daily News op-ed, noting state spending on Medicaid is expected to grow to $7.4 billion in 2017 from $4.7 billion in 2011.\n\nMany Republicans in the Ohio House seem to agree. State Rep. Terry Johnson, a physician from McDermott, is a primary sponsor of HB 157, and the bill has 22 cosponsors.\n\nHB 157 cosponsors include Rep. John Becker, Rep. Tom Brinkman, Rep. Ron Hood, Rep. Nino Vitale and Rep. Paul Zeltwanger, the only five House Republicans to vote against a 2016-17 budget funding Republican Gov. John Kasich\u2019s Obamacare Medicaid expansion.\n\nButler\u2019s plan would not roll back the Obamacare expansion, but it aims to increase transparency and competition in the health-care industry with a focus on Medicaid.\n\nMedicaid Health Savings Accounts and health-care price transparency, two major components of HB 157, were incorporated into the budget the House approved last week. The Ohio Senate is working on its own version of the budget.\n\nTo give Medicaid recipients more ownership of their health decisions, Butler\u2019s proposal would divert Medicaid funding into personal Health Savings Accounts and require yearly premiums of $99 for adults, $49 for children and $149 for smokers.\n\nProposed transparency measures would require hospitals to give patients cost estimates before providing non-emergency care, allow providers to advertise prices and require insurers to disclose out-of-pocket costs for the top 20 percent of covered services.\n\nButler based the Health Savings Account idea on Indiana\u2019s original Healthy Indiana Plan, which was watered down this year as part of Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s Obamacare Medicaid expansion.\n\nIn an email to Ohio Watchdog, Butler said there are \u201clarge differences\u201d between his Healthy Ohio Plan and Pence\u2019s revised program, commonly referred to as HIP 2.0.\n\n\u201cOne example is that in HIP 2.0, premiums are only required for access to optional services like dental and prescriptions. In HIP 1.0 and HOP, premiums are required for all coverage,\u201d Butler said.\n\nWhatever happens with HB 157, Butler\u2019s top priority \u201cis to make sure the Senate agrees to HOP and transparency staying in the budget.\u201d\n\nIf enacted as introduced, HB 157 could save $10 billion per year in Medicaid expenses and private health-care spending, Butler explained in a video published on YouTube last week.\n\nTo reduce defensive medicine \u2014 needless tests, prescriptions and procedures from doctors afraid of being sued \u2014 HB 157 would create a state medical injury compensation system and end lawsuits against care providers.\n\nButler asserts data from the medical injury compensation system would help hold providers accountable. His bill includes incentives to foster competition among hospitals, independent providers and Medicaid managed care companies, as well.\n\n\u201cI am cautiously optimistic that the House will approve most or all of the major components of HB157,\u201d Butler told Ohio Watchdog.\n\nMany of Butler\u2019s proposals could take effect with support from Kasich and the Ohio Senate, but the HOP program would require U.S. Department of Health and Human Services approval.\n\nHHS and other Medicaid reform opponents have considerable leverage because Kasich expanded Medicaid under Obamacare while accusing critics of wanting to leave the poor \u201cout in the street.\u201d\n\nTo help Ohio\u2019s most needy and address this political reality, Medicaid cost savings from HB 157 \u201cwould be used to provide additional and augmented coverage for populations that need it,\u201d Butler said.\n\nIf Butler\u2019s plan is implemented and proves effective, HB 157 could give lawmakers a way out of an Obamacare expansion, which has cost $3 billion in new federal spending in just 15 months.\n\nConsideration of any HB 157 proposals not included in the state budget will take a backseat to budget negotiations between the House, Senate and Kasich. A new budget must be signed by the governor before July 1.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With Medicaid spending skyrocketing due to Ohio's Obamacare expansion, state lawmakers have introduced a bill meant to curb health care costs.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "With Medicaid spending skyrocketing due to Ohio's Obamacare expansion, state lawmakers have introduced a bill meant to curb health care costs.", "title": "Ohio House bill could save billions in medical costs each year - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/04/jim-butler-ohio-house.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-01T08:31:02+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/215048/ohio-medical-reform/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "With Medicaid spending skyrocketing due to Ohio's Obamacare expansion, state lawmakers have introduced a bill meant to curb health care costs.", "title": "Ohio House bill could save billions in medical costs each year - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/04/jim-butler-ohio-house.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "published_time": "2015-05-01T04:00:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-01T08:31:02+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "Jim Butler, Ohio House, Medicaid reform, Ohio Medicaid, Medicaid expansion, John Kasich, Obamacare, Healthy Ohio Plan, HSA"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9147\"", "article_summary": "State Rep.
