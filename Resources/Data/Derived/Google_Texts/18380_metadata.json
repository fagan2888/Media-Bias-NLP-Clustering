Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner have routinely been portrayed in news reports as \u201cmoderates\u201d and \u201ccentrists.\u201d But after two years in the Senate, Tim Kaine has a perfect zero on the conservative scale. Mark Warner has a lifetime score of 10.33 percent conservative, but his last two annual scores have been a 4 and an 8. They could be mistaken for Barbara Mikulski.\n\nFar-left is middle of the road on the media spectrum. The Washington Post has been especially guilty of suggesting over the years that Kaine was as pious as conservative stalwart Ken Cuccinelli, a man they place on the \u201cfar right.\u201d In 2012, the Post profile of his GOP opponent George Allen suggested he was seen as a \u201ccolossally insenstive brute,\u201d but this is how the Post began a Kaine profile:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual, on an election-year Sunday, to find a white candidate in a black church. But Tim Kaine, swaying this month to the gospel groove at St. Elizabeth Catholic Church in a poor Richmond neighborhood, wasn\u2019t on the campaign trail. He was taking a break from it at his home parish.\u201d\n\nTim Kaine has a perfect 100 score from the NARAL folks, and and perfect 100 with the gay-left Human Rights Campaign. But to the Post, he\u2019s practically the Pope\u2019s right hand, swaying in the pews at Mass. A few weeks ago, Kaineand Warner signed a letter to the HHS Secretary (with other liberals like Barbara Boxer) complaining about insurers failing to provide proper payment for contraceptives through Obamacare.\n\nThe Post did this in 2005, too, when Kaine first ran for Governor: \u201cKaine, the Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia, said that teaching at a fledgling Jesuit school in El Progreso [Honduras] gave his life direction, inspiring him to public service and rekindling his devotion to Catholicism.\u201d\n\nWhen the Post touts your deep Catholic roots as positive, it probably means you\u2019re a liberal opposed to Catholic orthodoxy.\n\nMark Warner also scores 100 on the libertine-left scale at NARAL and HRC. When Warner first announced a campaign for the Senate in 2007, Anita Kumar of the Washington Post pitted him against former Republican Gov. Jim Gilmore this way: \u201cDo they prefer a social conservative who cut taxes but left a deficit, or a centrist businessman who balanced the budget but raised taxes?\u201d He was \u201cpro-business,\u201d not liberal.\n\nIn another story, Post reporters wrote \u201cWarner, 52, a self-described moderate Democrat, will make his announcement in an e-mail to supporters Thursday.\u201d\n\nSo if he described himself so falsely, why didn't the Post expose him? Because the Post subscribes to the falsehood.\n\nWhen he was endorsed by former Sen. John Warner (allegedly a Republican) in 2014, the Associated Press said \u201che praised his successor, also a centrist, for seeking bipartisan solutions.\u201d That\u2019s what the Post said in an editorial endorsing Mark Warner last year: he had \u201ca nearly obsessive search for creative solutions and real flexibility in long negotiating sessions.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s submerging the campaign news entirely: Warner\u2019s incredibly close race against Ed Gillespie race never drew an A-1 story in the Post during the last three months of the 2014 campaign, except for a dismissive story on how Gillespie was just building name ID for the next race.\n\nVoters could complain about \u201ctruth in advertising,\u201d because that\u2019s what the press coverage of Kaine and Warner has been \u2013 badly disguised positive commercials about their habitual moderation, pretending to be objective news coverage.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "The latest scorecard from the American Conservative Union is out, and the voters of Virginia might want to file a complaint about truth in advertising with the press corps.
