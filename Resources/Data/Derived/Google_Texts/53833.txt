The Urban League of Greater Chattanooga, along with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), City of Chattanooga and SunTrust Foundation, will offer free tax preparation services through its Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Program to qualified taxpayers. The VITA kickoff event will be held on Friday, January 29 at 11:30 a. m. at the Highland Center (formerly 21st Century Academy) 104 North Tuxedo Circle, Chattanooga, TN 37411.

Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) will begin preparing your federal and state income tax returns this week at several locations throughout Chattanooga and Cleveland. Val Palmer, VITA Area Coordinator, said that the sites are up and ready and will give taxpayers the same service including e-file, which paid preparers offer without the charge. Volunteers have been training since October and have been certified by the IRS. Palmer said that many of the volunteers have been serving the community for years, “We get many repeat customers who really appreciate the friendly service the volunteers provide”. The program serves individuals and households whose income is less than $54,000. Last year, VITA volunteers prepared more than 5,000 returns for local citizens.

Taxpayers need to bring their tax documents, W2s, 1099s’, Social Security Cards for all children, photo identification, Affordable Care Act (ACA) Statements: 1095-A, and home mortgage statements.
