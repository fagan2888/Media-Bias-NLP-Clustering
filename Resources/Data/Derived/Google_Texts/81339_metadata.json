AIPAC divisions increasing\n\nFor American Jews, soul-searching about both Israel and AIPAC are as dependable as a trip to the movies on Christmas.\n\nThat\u2019s become more pronounced as President Barack Obama pushes forward on both an Israeli-Palestinian peace process framework and negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. But now there\u2019s an active effort among more liberal groups to show that the changing politics in the American Jewish community mean that AIPAC\u2019s positions represent fewer and fewer people, and should be getting less and less attention.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThough American Jews strongly supported Obama in both the 2008 and 2012 elections, he\u2019s never fully settled anxieties about not being a close or devoted enough friend of the Jewish State, and he\u2019s rarely seen eye-to-eye with the political group that\u2019s long been the strongest, loudest voice on these issues.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP eyes AIPAC summit for Iran push)\n\nObama, notably, won\u2019t be addressing the AIPAC annual conference that starts Sunday and runs through the beginning of the week. Neither will Vice President Joe Biden. The administration is sending Secretary of State John Kerry instead \u2014 the point man on both these issues. ( )\n\n\u201cThis is a time where there are lot of things converging, and there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, there are a lot of questions,\u201d said Rep. Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), the ranking member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, who\u2019ll be attending the AIPAC conference for his 27th straight year and remains a strong supporter. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of angst in the American Jewish community, because these are very important issues and the administration\u2019s right in the thick of it with them.\u201d\n\nAmong groups that support the administration\u2019s approaches, the hope is to smash the narrative that by talking about an Israeli-Palestinian compromise and negotiating with Iran, Obama\u2019s working against Israel\u2019s interests. Petitions are circulating. Town halls are being held. More campaign donations are being promised and made to those who support the president. And a coalition of liberal groups has formed that\u2019s been in regular touch with the White House to keep them aware of the support.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Poll: Obama not respected abroad)\n\nThe clearest place that\u2019s begun to manifest itself is the split between AIPAC and J Street, the left-wing alternative founded six years ago. Though they\u2019ve always disagreed ideologically, recent moves in Congress have put them in direct opposition for the first time.\n\nAll of this is happening with a clearly shifting backdrop, including the just 17 percent of American Jews who said in a Pew poll last October that they believe expanded West Bank settlements help Israel\u2019s security, and a letter released Thursday by a group of 82 mostly Jewish donors urging Congress again not to pass new sanctions against Iran.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is that the direction the president and the secretary are pursuing is eminently pro-Israel and this is what friendship for Israel really looks like,\u201d said J Street president and founder Jeremy Ben-Ami. \u201cTo promote the end of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict secures Israel\u2019s future and to achieve the goal of preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon\u2014these are the acts of a friend, this is what pro-Israel should be defined to be.\u201d\n\nAn AIPAC spokesman did not return requests for comment about the group\u2019s standing, or its relationship to J Street.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Liberal groups are making an effort to show AIPAC is not the only American voice on Israel.", "title": "AIPAC divisions increasing", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/aipac-divisions-more-pronounced-than-ever-104126.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/news/110522_obama_aipac_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,Jews,Israel,AIPAC", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Liberal groups are making an effort to show AIPAC is not the only American voice on Israel.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb07c\"", "article_summary": "AIPAC divisions increasingFor American Jews, soul-searching about both Israel and AIPAC are as dependable as a trip to the movies on Christmas.\nNotably, President Obama will not be speaking at AIPAC this year.\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP eyes AIPAC summit for Iran push)Obama, notably, won\u2019t be addressing the AIPAC annual conference that starts Sunday and runs through the beginning of the week.\nThat\u2019s become more pronounced as President Barack Obama pushes forward on both an Israeli-Palestinian peace process framework and negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is that the direction the president and the secretary are pursuing is eminently pro-Israel and this is what friendship for Israel really looks like,\u201d said J Street president and founder Jeremy Ben-Ami."}
