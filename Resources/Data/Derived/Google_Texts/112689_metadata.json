It was supposed to be the start time of LaShonda Holloway\u2019s press conference, but she was late.\n\nJust a couple hundred feet away, Holloway\u2019s opponent, Representative Corrine Brown, spoke at a press conference of her own, so Holloway waited for reporters.\n\nWhen she finally took the stage, she said she\u2019s not focused on her opponent.\n\n\u201cI am actually running for the people,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m not happy with many of the laws and amendments that the members of congress have voted against. From the bank bailouts to the constant attempts to overthrow the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nHolloway said she wants to address government deficiencies, including problems with the Veterans Administration, but is scant on the details.\n\n\u201cI expect to improve veteran services, yes,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cOverall.\u201d\n\nThough she\u2019s never run for political office, her resume shows a fellowship in a Congressional office and a stint in the D.C. mayor\u2019s office in 2007.\n\nShe\u2019s also the founder of a Jacksonville nonprofit called All About HealthCARE Advocates, but the organization\u2019s website expired 12 days ago.\n\nBrown doesn\u2019t seem ruffled by her new challenger.\n\n\u201cSomeone mentioned it,\u201d Browm said. \u201cWell, well good. Fine. This is America.\u201d\n\nHolloway said she\u2019ll make her run for Congress official by filing paperwork this week.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Political newcomer LaShonda \u201cL-J\u201d Holloway is vying to represent Florida\u2019s 5th Congressional district.
