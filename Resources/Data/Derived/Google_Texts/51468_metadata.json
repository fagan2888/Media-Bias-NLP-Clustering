Believe it or not, 59 percent of those in the Northeast said they liked it. That wasn\u2019t as high an approval as those in the South or West expressed, but it beat out respondents in the Midwest.\n\nWhen it came to breaking down the four seasons, summer ranked high among all Americans, with 25 percent saying that they eagerly look forward to the warm weather. Fall, however, is the nation\u2019s number-one season, with 29 percent ranking it tops. You may not be surprised to learn that winter is only preferred by seven percent of us.\n\nLiving here, you know that in terms of friendliness, crime, clean air and water, recreation and everyday beauty, few parts of the world can beat out our mountains and the rural areas of the Mid-Hudson Valley. If your home isn\u2019t already in a gorgeous spot, chances are you can drive to one in a few minutes.\n\nBut this is Earth, not Heaven. There\u2019s got to be some negative. And we all know what it is: Winters are way too long. Unless you\u2019re one of that small minority who say that they prefer winter (and thanks to Obamacare, there\u2019s therapy for such hallucinations), you know that a couple of months of snow would be lovely and fun. However, we find our gardens bare and trees leafless and birds gone and birdsong vanished and smells absent and skin covered from November through March: five months \u2013 a long time. Down in Virginia, March is a spring month. Cherry blossoms grace the DC Mall the first week of that month. But here, it\u2019s just more winter: five months.\n\nIf you hate winter, you want to know, psychologically, when it\u2019s half over and the nadir has been reached. Surprisingly, this is hard to pin down.\n\nWe start off a bit screwy, because the very darkest day (December 21) is already behind us during winter\u2019s first full day (the 22nd). Thus, brightness grows during the entire season. The date when the low-sun period has reached its halfway mark? That\u2019s December 21. So now, in late January, the sun is already much higher up at noon, much stronger and out nearly an hour longer than it did the week before Christmas. Using darkness as a metric, we\u2019re now way past winter\u2019s midpoint.\n\nHow about temperature? Well, the statistically coldest week of the season is between January 17 and the 25th. So that\u2019s now behind us, too. Statistically, we\u2019ll now be warmer than the season that has elapsed so far.\n\nCalendarwise? Winter\u2019s midpoint was celebrated throughout Europe \u2013 which loved winter as much as we do \u2013 as Candlemas, on February 2. That holiday, with marmots thrown in as part of an obscure German tradition, became our Groundhog Day. That\u2019s this week: the calendar midpoint of winter. However, because of the slow precessional cycle, winter\u2019s actual calendar midpoint is now two days later, on February 4.\n\nWhat about snowfall? Well, March delivers more precip than any other winter month. But sometimes March has it come down as mostly rain. Also, this year we had that odd deep snowstorm around Thanksgiving. Put it all together and \u2013 this year, at least \u2013 we\u2019re probably about midpoint when it comes to snow, although, as we all know, anything can happen.\n\nTo wrap it up: Yes, we\u2019re at the midpoint, except when it comes to solar intensity, where we are now firmly on the bright side of the graph.\n\nAfter nightfall, remember that Venus has returned very low in the sunset direction each evening in fading twilight. And brilliant Jupiter is back, too. Look for it on Tuesday, February 3, starting around 8:30 p.m., next to the Full Moon.\n\nWant to know more?
