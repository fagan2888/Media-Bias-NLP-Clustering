For soldiers in battle and moms with scraped-up little ones, and really just about anyone who needs instant wound treatment, being able to stop bleeding quickly can be the difference between minor injury and major trauma. VetiGel may be tomorrow\u2019s answer.\n\nBrooklyn-based biotechnology company Suneris has designed a polymer gel that can be injected at wound sites for immediate clotting. Within 15 seconds of application, VetiGel begins matching the composition of the surrounding tissues, reducing blood flow and sealing up injury. CEO and Co-Founder Joe Landolina says he and his team designed VetiGel to be ubiquitous one day.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to get this in every ambulance, in every soldier\u2019s belt, and in every mom\u2019s purse,\u201d Landolina told Bloomberg News. \u201cAnd to be in every mom\u2019s purse means having a product that is easy enough to be used by just about everybody.\u201d\n\nRight now, however, tests on VetiGel have yet to involve human subjects. Their sights are first set on veterinarian clinics, where they can see how animal wounds seal up before ironing out any wrinkles as they approach human tissue. If all goes to plan, Suneris hopes to get FDA approval for the futuristic bandage and bring it to market.\n\nAll this is years away, of course. But that doesn\u2019t erase Landolina\u2019s visions of grandeur. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely hoping this changes the way the world looks at wound care, not only stopping bleeds but being able to treat burns,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could even apply this technology to the regeneration of organs one day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "vetigel, stops, bleeding, seconds, polymer, could, be, band, aid, future", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Within 15 seconds, all bleeding stops.
