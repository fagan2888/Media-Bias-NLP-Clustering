Delmont, SD

As the tornado roared toward Main Street Delmont, it hit several farms in its path, killing livestock and crumpling grain bins.

"I would say we're in shock, you know? Everything we've worked for for the last 42 years, it's pretty much gone," farm owner Lila Fechner said.

In addition to a machine shed, grain bins, and field equipment, Lila and Michael Fechner lost their home.

For the Fechners, it all started with a warning from their son-in-law to "look out the south window, and get in the basement," Fechner said.

Together with a neighbor, they took shelter in a corner of the basement.

"I said, 'We gotta hang on to each other,' so we covered up. Prayed, of course, that it wouldn't hit," Fechner said.

When it did, it slid the house from above their heads, exposing the basement to the open sky.

"There was a rush - I say - there was was more noise, really, when it was on its way than when it actually happened," Fechner said.

Even in the wake of such shocking destruction, family and friends were quick to respond.

"Words can't express what it means. I've heard from people I haven't heard from in years, since this happened," Fechner said.

Fechner's more concerned about people in town.

"We're in our sixties, but there's people in their eighties in town that have lost their homes, and I can't imagine, you know, what they're gonna do," Fechner said.

As for her belongings?

"We'll check that out later. You can replace things but not people," Fechner said.
