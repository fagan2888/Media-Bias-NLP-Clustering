Anyone who\u2019s been in a Christian subculture could pick them up instantly. I am not sure the reporter was attuned to this at all, unfortunately, and Hughes wasn't really big on the God talk but he kept dropping hint after hing. It's obvious this man is one mixed-up guy, albeit quite entertaining.\n\nAnyway, this piece has more ghosts (places where the reporter should have picked up on the spiritual element) than a Hogwarts Halloween party. Here\u2019s how it started:\n\nFrom head to toe, the Eagles of Death Metal lead singer is like a neon sign advertising the trappings of American rock. Tight jeans. Bright tattoos. Bold views. Wild hair. Several stints in drug rehab. And above all: sexually charged lyrics.\n\nOn Nov. 13, Hughes was belting those sexually suggestive lyrics on stage when three members of the Islamic State forced their way into the Bataclan concert hall in Paris. Hughes managed to escape but scores of his fans did not. Strapped with suicide vests and armed with Kalashnikovs, the gunmen slaughtered 89 people at the Bataclan. Across the city, coordinated attacks claimed 41 more lives.\n\nIn a statement, the Islamic State tried to paint the concert hall as a hedonistic pleasure palace \u201cwhere hundreds of pagans gathered for a concert of prostitution and vice.\u201d\n\nBut if the Islamic State tried to blame Hughes, his band and his fans for the supposed sins of rock-and-roll, then the attackers forgot about the genre\u2019s other side: its saving grace.\n\nThe story soon launches into a description of the man who escaped death that night:\n\nIn many ways, Hughes is a fitting figurehead for American rock. Just last month, Grantland called him \u201crock\u2019s last wild man.\u201d In an interview laced with references to sex, drugs, religious devotion and Donald Trump, Hughes likened himself to rock-and-roll greats like Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis and Prince.\n\n\u201cReligious devotion?\u201d More information, please. Plus, the song this band was singing as the ISIS began firing away was \"Kiss the Devil.\" Where does the Satanism in the lyrics fit in with Hughes' \"devotion?\"\n\nThe reporter could have unpacked all that later on, but didn\u2019t. The story launches into Hughes\u2019 bio, with him saying:\n\n\u201cI was going through a really ugly divorce,\u201d Hughes said in an interview earlier this year. \u201cI went through a very typical, clich\u00e9d \u2018I served you my whole life, and this is what I get\u2019 anger.\u201d\n\nNow, who do you think is the \u201cyou\u201d Hughes is referring to? Is that \"you,\" or \"You\"? Doesn't this bring to mind Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cGotta Serve Somebody?\" The story then describes Hughes\u2019 raunchy lifestyle:\n\nBut Hughes also seems to capture, for better or worse, much more of the contradictory American condition. He is highly religious and politically conservative. He loves Donald Trump, believes President Obama was not born in America and considers George W. Bush his hero because \u201ca dude who does blow and likes ZZ Top is my kind of motherf--,\u201d he told Hyden.\n\nYet, he is also hypersexual -- \u201cI\u2019m a horny dude, man\u201d -- and unabashed about his continued drug use: \u201cThe only place you\u2019re going to find the type of speed I like to do is at a gay bar at six in the morning.\u201d\n\nHughes is an ordained minister who preaches fevered sermons online but has also posed for naked photo shoots with his ex-porn star girlfriend. He describes himself as devout, but goes by the nickname \u201cThe Devil.\u201d\n\nAn ordained minister? Fill in the blanks, dude.\n\nA quick Google search turns up this Facebook post by the Universal Life Church world headquarters about their ordination of Hughes on Dec. 6, 2012. Hughes, they say, is \u201ca very intense and very devout Christian.\u201d What denomination was he before getting ordained AND, if he's so unhappy with God, what's he doing becoming a pastor?\n\nSo at this point, one wonders: Is Hughes still bitter toward God? Or is he grateful that his life and the lives of his band were saved on that awful evening when so many people died because they came to listen to them? Does Hughes feel at all bad about being a magnet for crazies, in this case an ISIS cell?\n\nLooking more closely at this piece, we see the quotes are taken from other interviews. So it\u2019s possible the reporter had no access to the rock star.\n\nBut the writer does seem a bit clueless as to the spiritual aspects of Hughes\u2019 escape from death. Near the end, the article refers to rock music\u2019s \u201csaving grace\u201d being the people at the concert who refused to leave their friends or who blocked their friends from being hit by bullets. Was the real origin of grace the music or Hughes? Should the term have been applied to something else, not the least of which the fact that Hughes escaped?\n\nHere\u2019s hoping this reporter gets a one-on-one with Hughes where he can buttonhole the musician on whether serving God still has benefits or not.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I\u2019m not really a heavy metal fan but when I saw this piece posted in the \r\nWashington Post about the band that was playing during the terror attacks \r\nat the Bataclan concert hall in Paris, I had to take a second look.\r\n\r\nI was swimming through this longish piece when I began noticing all sorts \r\nof hints about faith being dropped by Jesse Hughes, the lead singer of \r\nEagles of Death Metal.
