The Arizona House passed a bill that would have the state ignore any Obama executive order.

“Oh, just secede already, Arizona legislature,” Arizona Republic columnist Laurie Roberts wrote in her Wednesday column about HB2368, a bill that would prohibit the state from enforcing or cooperating with Obama’s executive orders unless they were affirmed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress.

“Our leaders are marching ever closer to declaring our independence from the United States of America,” Roberts noted. “Or at least, from its government.”

“The bill, sponsored by none other than Rep. Bob Thorpe, R-Flagstaff, is one of a series of kooky measures aimed at declaring our independence from federal gun laws, from the Affordable Care Act, from the Environmental Protection Agency, from the Department of Justice, from Barack Obama and from just about anything else associated with the state’s most detested f-word… Federal, that is.”
