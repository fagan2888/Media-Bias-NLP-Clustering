(WOOD) \u2014 A longer wait didn\u2019t stop the chants of support for Donald Trump in Cadillac Friday.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate showed up for the rally at Wexford Civic Center about an hour later than scheduled.\n\nOrganizers told 24 Hour News 8 around 3,000 to 5,000 people packed the venue for the rally.

So we\u2019re going to straighten that out. Three months ago, they were saying you can\u2019t build a wall, now they\u2019re saying you can,\u201d Trump said.\n\nCheers erupted from the crowd when Trump said he would eliminate Common Core and replace the Affordable Care Act. He also said he is bringing \u201cmillions\u201d of people to the Republican Party single-handedly, but also took a jab at Senator Marco Rubio.\n\n\u201cSo many changes are gonna be made. We\u2019re gonna be like the smart country, not the stupid country. People are joining the Republican Party because of me, because they want common sense. They\u2019re not coming in for little Marco [Senator Marco Rubio], that I can tell you,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong those escorted out was a protester who screamed \u201cNo Trump in USA, no Trump, no KKK.\u201d\n\nTrump said he thought the protester should have been arrested.\n\n\u201cGet that guy out of here! I would arrest him for a filthy, dirty mouth,\u201d yelled Trump.\n\nTrump started his day of stumping in Warren, where a crowd packed MCC Sports & Expo Center to see him speak.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nPinterest\n\nMore\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr\n\n\n\nReddit\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Republican, Cadillac, GOP", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wood", "og": {"site_name": "WOODTV.com", "description": "A longer wait didn\u2019t stop the chants of support for Donald Trump in Cadillac Friday.", "title": "Trump in Cadillac: Voters \u2018want common sense\u2019", "url": "http://woodtv.com/2016/03/04/donald-trump-to-hold-rally-in-cadillac-friday/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/donald-trump-cadillac-030416.jpg", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A longer wait didn\u2019t stop the chants of support for Donald Trump in Cadillac Friday.", "title": "Trump in Cadillac: Voters \u2018want common sense\u2019", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwood.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/donald-trump-cadillac-030416.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@woodtv", "site": "WOODTV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, Republican, Cadillac, presidential candidate, GOP", "msapplication-tooltip": "Grand Rapids, MI news, weather, sports and traffic", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488527284", "fb": {"pages": 20114386235}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://woodtv.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/28c7d45e6d62506344f0aad2af937984?s=16", "application-name": "WOODTV.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/woodtv", "published_time": "2016-03-04T13:44:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-04T23:27:36+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "nqHTbbkW32A8Ssjvec6oDik57M8cANvAMyR0LzfR1to", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is holding a rally in Cadillac on Friday."}, "article_summary": "They\u2019re not coming in for little Marco [Senator Marco Rubio], that I can tell you,\u201d he said.\nCADILLAC, Mich.
