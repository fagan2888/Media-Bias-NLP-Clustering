Now, a new pricing concept in the wireless marketplace, known as \u201czero-rating,\u201d promises to relieve consumers of the fear that streaming one too many videos will trigger extra charges.\n\nBut instead of receiving plaudits, zero-rating has come under attack by many in Washington as a violation of the network-neutrality rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) last year. The controversy underscores the danger that the FCC\u2019s rules\u2014which are now under review in federal court\u2014poses for consumers and the growth of the Internet.\n\nThe latest dispute involves T-Mobile, the no. 3 wireless carrier in the U.S. Since 2014, T-Mobile has offered a \u201cMusic Freedom\u201d program under which consumers can stream content from music sites such as Pandora and Spotify without it counting against their limit.\n\n>>> Read More: Binge of Regulation: Wireless Pricing and the FCC\n\nLast November, the firm launched a similar program for video, which they call \u201cBinge On.\u201d The plan allows subscribers to access video content from sites such as ESPN, Hulu, and Netflix without it counting against their caps. There are no fees to pay, and all video providers are able to join. To do so, however, they need to conform to certain technical standards, limiting the bandwidth used by the video. Essentially, this means limiting the video to standard quality rather than high definition.\n\nThe idea of zero-rating is not unique to T-Mobile. Wireless market leaders Verizon and AT&T are launching zero-rating plans of their own under which content providers can also exempt data from counting against a subscriber\u2019s data cap, albeit for a fee. Also known as \u201csponsored data,\u201d the plans would work much like an 800 phone number, with charges paid by a business rather than the customer.\n\nThe plans have pro-regulation zealots up in arms. It\u2019s discriminatory, they say, and violates the FCC\u2019s brand new \u201cneutrality\u201d regime. Allowing a network operator to charge different prices to consumers based on the kind of data and provider of data, they say, gives that network operator too much power. This, in turn, could make it difficult for upstart providers to get a foothold in the market.\n\nThis reasoning is flawed. If anything, zero-rating is likely to increase competition and innovation, not constrain it. Under the Binge On program, any provider can participate, with no fee required. But even fee-based \u201csponsored data\u201d plans such as AT&T\u2019s raise no special concerns. A small content provider is no more disadvantaged by paying a fee to add zero-rating service than by having to pay for an 800 number, advertising, rent, or any other expense. In fact, by having the ability to reduce potential costs of using their content, zero-rating would be an important tool for newcomers in the marketplace.\n\nPlans such as Binge On could help supercharge competition among wireless networks as well. T-Mobile is now a distant third in the wireless marketplace, with 15 percent of subscribers, far behind leaders AT&T and Verizon. It needs to offer a better mousetrap to consumers, and Binge On is one big part of its plan to do that. Efforts to block such innovative approaches that expand the network will hobble competition and consumer choice, not increase it.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how the battle over zero-rating plans will turn out. The FCC deliberately punted on the issue when it wrote its neutrality rules last year, leaving its position rather muddy. While the chairman, Tom Wheeler, has praised Binge On as \u201cpro-consumer,\u201d the commission is still looking into the matter. An outright rejection of such zero-rating plans would be bad news for wireless consumers.\n\nEqually disturbing is the subjective, extemporaneous nature of the FCC\u2019s decision-making process, forcing firms to go to the FCC for permission before adopting any new practice. In a dynamic marketplace, outside-the-box innovation should be the rule, not the exception. The question is whether the FCC can pass judgment on each such innovation without stifling dynamism.
