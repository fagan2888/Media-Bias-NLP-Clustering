DIANA DEGETTE, D, Colo.: Between 2003 and 2014, GM learned hundreds of reports of ignition switch problems through customer complaints, warranty claims, lawsuits, press coverage, field reports, and even more internal investigations.\n\nREP. FRED UPTON, R, Mich.: With all that information available, why did it take so long to issue the recall?\n\nGWEN IFILL: Senior lawmakers from both parties made clear they want answers, at issue why GM took so long, years, to fix vehicles with faulty ignition switches. They\u2019re now linked to air bag failures and at least 13 deaths.\n\nGM\u2019s CEO, Mary Barra, has been on the job just since January.\n\nMARY BARRA, CEO, General Motors: Sitting here today, I cannot tell you why it took so long for a safety defect to be announced for this program, but I can tell you we will find out. As soon as I learned about the problem, we acted without hesitation. We told the world we had a problem that needed to be fixed. We did so because, whatever mistakes were made in the past, we will not shirk from our responsibilities now or in the future.\n\nGWEN IFILL: GM company documents indicate the automaker knew of the problem as far back as 2001, in Chevrolet Cobalts, Saturn Ions and other models.\n\nRecalls finally began in February, and the total number of affected vehicles has now reached 2.6 million. Even more recalls are under way for other defects.\n\nBut, Barra acknowledged, the action they\u2019re taking now may be far too late for some.\n\nMARY BARRA: Today\u2019s GM will do the right thing. That begins with my sincere apologies to everyone who has been affected by this recall, especially the families and friends who lost their lives or were injured. I am deeply sorry.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Barra vowed that an internal investigation will find the facts, but committee members pressed for details.\n\nREP. DIANA DEGETTE: As far back as 2004, GM conducted problem resolution tracking system inquiry after it learned of an incident where the key moved out of run condition; is that correct?\n\nMARY BARRA: Yes.\n\nREP. DIANA DEGETTE: Thank you.\n\nNow after the PRTS inquiry, one engineer advised against further action because there was \u2014 quote \u2014 \u201cno acceptable business case to provide a resolution,\u201d at the PRTS was closed. Is that correct?\n\nMARY BARRA: If that is true, that is a very disturbing fact.\n\nREP. DIANA DEGETTE: Yes, it is.\n\nMARY BARRA: That is not the way we make decisions.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Congresswoman Diana DeGette said GM\u2019s own documents showed a defective spring in the ignition assemblies would have cost 57 cents to replace.\n\nThe committee also called David Friedman, acting head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency first heard complaints about the GM vehicles in 2005.\n\nDAVID FRIEDMAN, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: Some of that information did raise concerns about air bag non-deployments. So, in 2007, we convened an expert panel to review the data. Our consumer complaint data on injury crashes with air bag non-deployments showed neither the Cobalt nor the Ion stood out when compared to other vehicles.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Friedman pointed the finger at GM, saying it withheld significant details for years. But his testimony drew fire.\n\nREP. TIM MURPHY, R, Penn.: What specifically did NHTSA ask GM? And, for example \u2014 and this is very important \u2014 did NHTSA raise the question with GM, tell us the reasons why an air bag would not deploy in one of your cars? Did you ask GM that question?\n\nDAVID FRIEDMAN: I don\u2019t have a record of that. I know our team did bring up concerns over this case to General Motors in a meeting, but I don\u2019t have records of assessing that specific question.\n\nGWEN IFILL: The questions and answers played out before family members of the 13 victims who earlier in the day appeared on the Capitol steps to demand.\n\nKen Rimer and his wife, Jayne, lost their daughter Natasha in a 2005 Chevy Cobalt accident.\n\nKEN RIMER, Victim\u2019s Father: The accident report shows that speed wasn\u2019t a factor, weather wasn\u2019t a factor, nor road conditions or traffic. The ignition system was found in the accessory position by accident investigators. None of this ever had to happen. It could have been easily addressed and corrected.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Laura Christian\u2019s 16-year-old daughter, Amber Marie Rose, also died in a 2005 crash.\n\nLAURA CHRISTIAN, Victim\u2019s Mother: Our daughters, sons, sisters, brothers, mothers, fathers, wives, and husbands are gone because they were a cost of doing business GM-style. Corporate executives made a decision that fighting the problem was cheaper and easier than fixing the problem.\n\nGWEN IFILL: GM\u2019s Barra met with the families yesterday, and after the hearing, she promised again the automaker will meet its obligations.\n\nMARY BARRA: We are definitely moving to a culture that is focused on the consumer, that is focused on the customer, is focused on high quality and safety. And that\u2019s my direction, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing today.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Barra didn\u2019t say when GM\u2019s internal probe will conclude. The Justice Department has launched its own investigation.\n\nBoth Mary Barra and David Friedman will testify before a Senate committee tomorrow.\n\nFor more on what came out of today\u2019s hearing, we turn again to David Shepardson, who covers the automotive industry for The Detroit News, and Joan Claybrook, the president emeritus of Public Citizen, who\u2019s been working with some of the victims\u2019 families. She\u2019s also a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nDavid Shepardson, we heard Mary Barra say not once, but several times today, that today\u2019s GM wouldn\u2019t do \u2014 would do the right thing. What did yesterday\u2019s GM do? What was the culture she was talking about which led to this?\n\nDAVID SHEPARDSON, The Detroit News: Well, she found herself in the position of basically disavowing and rejecting many of the decisions that GM made, you know, around 2005.\n\nShe was presented with e-mails that showed the company had opted not to improve the ignition switches, in one case saying that the amount the company would save in warranty costs, only about 10 to 15 cents per switch, wasn\u2019t as much as the 90 cents per switch it would have cost to make the change.\n\nShe said the new GM doesn\u2019t put a cost on safety, whatever it takes, they\u2019re going to fix cars. But, you know, in the face of these documents, she had really little choice but to say, this is not acceptable today.\n\nGWEN IFILL: And she said repeatedly that she couldn\u2019t answer the question because it\u2019s still under investigation, right?\n\nDAVID SHEPARDSON: And that only went so far with the committee, and the Senate tomorrow is going to push her, too.\n\nAnd part of that is a fair answer that they \u2014 there are a lot of questions they don\u2019t know. I mean, GM has amassed about six million pages of records in this investigation. But a part of it is still getting to the bottom of, how far up the chain did these decisions get made? Was this a low-level decision by engineers to not fix this, you know, for what was a very small amount of money, or did it go much higher than that?\n\nGWEN IFILL: Explain one key thing which came up today, which is this potential cover-up, at least that\u2019s the words some of the members of Congress used, of a safety problem that was found in 2006?\n\nDAVID SHEPARDSON: Well, in 2006, the switches that have been recalled or linked to the 13 deaths, the switch was changed to a much-improved switch, but the company didn\u2019t change the part, in fact, showed in the committee the record from the engineer that signed off on it.\n\nThey didn\u2019t change the part number. That\u2019s very unusual, because you would want to change the part, be able to track how the new switch is performing vs. the old switch. And it wasn\u2019t actually until last year that an outside engineer figured out this problem, because they couldn\u2019t understand why some vehicles were showing much higher failure rates than others.\n\nAnd that is a central question here. Why didn\u2019t GM change the part number? Why didn\u2019t they inform NHTSA, and was this something that they were eager to hide by not making a change in the part number?\n\nGWEN IFILL: Joan Claybrook, as a former head of NHTSA and watching these hearings today, speaking on behalf of the families, the victims\u2019 families, were you satisfied with the answers you heard?\n\nJOAN CLAYBROOK, Former President, Public Citizen: No. I think that Mary Barra should have been more prepared to give particular answers.\n\nGeneral Motors has submitted 200,000 pages of documents to the committees in Congress. And they have also submitted a timeline, several different versions, I think three or four of them, to the Department of Transportation.\n\nSo she should have been better prepared, in my view, to give answers. I think that she wants to reserve her options for how she frames this when she gets the whole investigation finished inside General Motors.\n\nGWEN IFILL: GM announced today that they have retained Ken Feinberg, the noted compensation specialist, to speak about how to compensate certain victims of this, pre-bankruptcy, pre-2009.\n\nSo is that what you think? Is that how an internal investigation should look, looking in terms of compensation?\n\nJOAN CLAYBROOK: Well, that\u2019s not the internal investigation I was referring to. I\u2019m referring to the hiring of Jenner & Block, an outside law firm, to do an unvarnished evaluation, as Mary Barra said, of what happened and why it happened and who was involved.\n\nI think it\u2019s a very positive move to hear that they have hired Ken Feinberg, because consumer groups asked Mary Barra in a letter to set aside a $1 billion fund to compensate those people who were injured or killed in crashes that occurred before July 2009, which is the date of the bailout.\n\nAnd what happened in the bailout \u2014 it was quite unusual, in my view \u2014 is that they said that any crash that occurred before the bailout is the responsibility of the old General Motors, which has no money, and, therefore, people are not going to get any money, any compensation for their injuries.\n\nGWEN IFILL: So there\u2019s a liability shield pre-2009 for the company?\n\nJOAN CLAYBROOK: That\u2019s right. There\u2019s a liability shield. That\u2019s right.\n\nAnd so the fact that she\u2019s now talking about having Ken Feinberg look at this and see if there\u2019s a way to compensate these individuals, I think that that\u2019s a very positive move, and I hope that \u2014 that that occurs.\n\nGWEN IFILL: David Shepardson, I want to ask you about the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as well, their role. They were also testifying today. They were also pressed on these questions.\n\nDid members, did lawmakers seem to believe that they were any way culpable on these?\n\nDAVID SHEPARDSON: They\u2019re really bearing down on a decision that NHTSA made in 2007.\n\nOne of their senior investigators said there were reports of four fatal crashes in these now recalled Cobalts, and asked his superiors to form \u2014 to open a formal investigation. The government didn\u2019t do that. And, unfortunately, in terms of timing, one of these special crash reports came out early the next year which showed that, in fact, the non-deployment of the air bag was tied to the fact the key had slipped out of position, but by the time they got that report, the government had already decided not to open that investigation.\n\nNow, the government says the data wasn\u2019t there and really tried to point the finger back at GM, saying, if they\u2019d had more information, like the part change number, like the fact that, in 2002, the initial part, the switch never met GM\u2019s own specifications, and they told their supplier go ahead and build it anyway, if \u2014 so they argue, the government, that if GM had provided more information, they could have made a different decision. They\u2019re not admitting any wrongdoing at this point.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Joan Claybrook, should the governor \u2014 government have had more responsibility for this?\n\nJOAN CLAYBROOK: Absolutely.\n\nI think that General Motors bears the basic responsibility, because it built and designed and sold and evaluated and had a lot of information about this error in the ignition switch. But the government keeps saying they didn\u2019t have enough data, which is really terrifically outrageous.\n\nThe fact is, it\u2019s a design defect. This problem is a design defect. And if you have a design defect, it affects every part that was made. And they knew that there were crashes that were caused by this, that there were injuries that resulted in death. It didn\u2019t matter how many consumer complaints they had. It didn\u2019t matter how many warranty claims they had.\n\nThey didn\u2019t need any more data. And when I was in charge of this agency in the \u201970s, we looked at things to see whether or not there was a design defect. And if there was, and if it could cause harm, and if the problem arose, that was absolutely, per se, a design \u2014 a safety defect.\n\nAnd so they\u2019re treating this whole thing as though they have to gather tons and tons of paper in order to make a decision, and I think that that\u2019s completely wrong, and it\u2019s a real failure at the agency. And I hope that they will revise this. And there\u2019s a lot of work going on now to try and persuade them to look at this in a different way.\n\nGWEN IFILL: All right.\n\nFor the record, we did invite representatives from GM to appear tonight, and they declined.\n\nJoan Claybrook, president emeritus of Public Citizen, and David Shepardson of The Detroit News, thank you both.\n\nDAVID SHEPARDSON: Thanks, Gwen.\n\nJOAN CLAYBROOK: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Capitol Hill, GM CEO Mary Barra acknowledged the company's recalls came too late for some and vowed to get to the bottom of the cause.", "pubdate": 20140401, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "On Capitol Hill, GM CEO Mary Barra acknowledged the company's recalls came too late for some and vowed to get to the bottom of the cause.", "title": "GM CEO offers apology but no explanation yet for recall lag", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/481873259.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/gm-ceo-offers-apology-no-explanation-yet-recall-lag/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "On Capitol Hill, GM CEO Mary Barra acknowledged the company's recalls came too late for some and vowed to get to the bottom of the cause.", "title": "GM CEO offers apology but no explanation yet for recall lag", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/481873259.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Transportation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "auto industry, cars, congress, General Motors, government regulation, mary barra, Transportation"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0fe4\"", "article_summary": "GWEN IFILL: Barra vowed that an internal investigation will find the facts, but committee members pressed for details.\nGWEN IFILL: Barra didn\u2019t say when GM\u2019s internal probe will conclude.\nGWEN IFILL: GM announced today that they have retained Ken Feinberg, the noted compensation specialist, to speak about how to compensate certain victims of this, pre-bankruptcy, pre-2009.\nGWEN IFILL: GM company documents indicate the automaker knew of the problem as far back as 2001, in Chevrolet Cobalts, Saturn Ions and other models.\nWhy didn\u2019t GM change the part number?"}
