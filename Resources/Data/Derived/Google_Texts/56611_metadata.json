As a named member of the task force, AARP Hawaii will help evaluate how to implement provisions of the CARE Act as well as the community resources needed for family caregivers to safely care for their loved ones at home. In early 2015, the task force will make a recommendation to best support the 270,000 family caregivers in Hawaii.\n\nAloha! After a busy few weeks of travel to fight for family caregivers \u2013 and enjoying some warm Hawaii sunshine in between meetings \u2013 I\u2019m back in chilly D.C. with news to report. First, I had the pleasure of spending time with AARP Hawaii as it works to pass the Caregiver Advise, Record, Enable (CARE) Act and support the 247,000 family caregivers in Hawaii \u2013 as well as the seniors these caregivers help to live independently, at home.\n\nThroughout the week, we were warmly welcomed in meetings with Gov. Neil Abercrombie, Attorney General David Louie, Department of Public Health Director Linda Rosen, House Speaker Joseph Souki and the House Health Committee to discuss the crucial need for the CARE Act.\n\nSen. Suzanne Chun Oakland \u2013 an early legislative champion for the CARE Act \u2013 also joined us for a live tele-town hall meeting to hear directly from our members about their caregiving experiences and learn how the CARE Act will help. More than 3,500 AARP members participated, and a strong 82 percent majority agreed that hospitals should provide clear and detailed instructions to family caregivers before their loved one is discharged, a large component of the CARE Act.\n\nEach year Hawaii\u2019s family caregivers provide 162 million hours of unpaid care for their loved ones, valued at nearly $2 billion. By providing this care, family caregivers serve a critical role in helping to keep their loved ones from being readmitted to the hospital, out of costly institutions, and at home.\n\nThe CARE Act supports these family caregivers when their loved ones go into the hospital and helps them learn the tasks they must perform \u2013 including medication management, wound care and more \u2013 when their loved ones are discharged and return home.\n\nAs introduced, Senate Bill 2264, the Hawaii version of the CARE Act, would:\n\nRecord the name of family caregivers on the medical record of a loved one\n\nInform the family caregiver when their loved one is to be discharged or moved\n\nGive the family caregiver explanation and live instruction of the medical tasks \u2013 such as medication management, injections, wound care and transfers \u2013 that they will perform at home.\n\nStuart Ho, former AARP Hawaii state president and former chair of the Hawaii Long-Term Care Commission, explained:\n\n\u201cWith this bill, Hawaii can take some common-sense steps that would make a world of difference\u201d to family caregivers.\n\nWhile it was a busy week, this hard work has not been without progress for family caregivers. The CARE Act has already passed the Hawaii Senate and just last week, while I was there, cleared the House Health Committee. But we still have much work to do to keep the CARE Act strong and move it through the House Finance Committee, a House-Senate conference committee and then on to final votes. All of this must be wrapped up by May 1, the end of Hawaii\u2019s legislative session.\n\nNext, I\u2019m pleased to report: The CARE Act is earning the support of organizations in states like Hawaii as well as those representing constituencies nationwide. Here\u2019s just a hint at what some leading groups have to say:\n\nThe American Geriatrics Society: \u201cThe American Geriatrics Society (AGS) commends AARP for its efforts to integrate family caregivers across the continuum of care. The Society recognizes that members of the interdisciplinary care team can better provide person- and family-centered care when family caregivers are identified in medical records, notified of discharges, and provided appropriate training and explanations.\u201d\n\nThe American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network: \u201cThe CARE Act recognizes the important role of caregivers by requiring that hospitals identify and involve patients and their designated caregivers in the discharge planning and after-care preparation process.\u201d\n\nCaregiver Action Network: \u201cFamily caregivers are integral members of the health care team for their loved ones and the CARE Act is exactly the right approach to recognize the vital role that caregivers play.\u201d\n\nCoalition of Geriatric Nursing Organizations: \u201d Implementing the CARE Act in each state will provide a system for enhancing caregiver support.\u201d\n\nFamily Caregiver Alliance: \u201cPassage of the CARE Act will ultimately improve care for the patient through better involvement and training of family or informal caregivers.\u201d\n\nNational Alliance for Caregiving: \u201cAs a formal member of the care team, family caregivers can better assist medical professionals in providing high quality, patient-centered care.\u201d\n\nReACT (Respect a Caregiver\u2019s Time): \u201cReACT (Respect a Caregiver\u2019s Time) commends AARP for its efforts to formally integrate family caregivers into the continuum of care.\u201d\n\nMore to come on why these organizations are supporting our efforts to help family caregivers in my next blog.\n\nTo stay up to date or get involved with our caregiving advocacy in the states, sign up for the AARP Advocates e-newsletter or visit your state Web page.
