Allan Ajifo, CC BY 2.0.\n\nOur brain is an amazing tool, wired to help us decipher the world around us in such a way that promotes our safety, while also enabling higher learning. When we encounter a scene, we have the ability to take the stimuli we\u2019re surrounded by, and categorize them in a way that helps us better understand where we are and what\u2019s happening. In more primitive times, this categorization helped us to distinguish danger before it was too late. Psychologists used to believe this categorization process worked by prioritizing certain stimuli over others, but now, researchers are finding this process may be far simpler. It turns out that when we categorize a scene, our brains initially group stimuli based on the easiest way to distinguish them.\n\nLooking at a scene, there are many things we can take away from it; is it a natural landscape, a manmade one, a forest or a beach, a face or not a face? Previous research has found that when we look at our surroundings, certain levels of categorization happen sooner than others, leading many researchers to believe that the brain establishes priorities. \u201cThe superordinate advantage,\u201d suggests that our brains will establish the global characteristics of a scene before its details. For example, we are more likely to decipher whether we\u2019re indoors or outdoors first, before acknowledging details, like whether it\u2019s a kitchen or bedroom.\n\nBut Thomas Serre, assistant professor of cognitive, linguistic, and psychological sciences at Brown University feels we are overcomplicating the matter of categorization. \u201cWhatever is happening in the visual system might not be as sophisticated as we thought,\u201d he said in a recent press release.\n\nTo prove that \u201cthe superordinate advantage\u201d is not always the natural way of categorizing a scene, Serre, along with co-authors Imri Sofer and S\u00e9bastien Crouzet, set up a prediction that we first categorize a scene based on \u201cdiscriminability,\u201d a measurement that describes how easy it is to distinguish between stimuli in a scene. For instance, when looking at a scene, do you first notice that you are outside or that you are in a desert?\n\nIn order to measure discriminability within their study, the researchers created a computational model, or algorithm, which they trained by exposing it to a large variety of natural scenes. Once the algorithm had been trained in these scenes, it was then taught categorization tasks. For this given experiment, the algorithm calculated how close each given scene was to a boundary, or a 50/50 shot of being one thing or the other, in this case either man-made or natural. The greater the distance from the boundary (how easily it could be deciphered as man-made or natural), the higher the discriminability score.\n\nThe researchers then brought in a small group of participants to test their new algorithm. This part of their research consisted of two experiments. In the first, eight people were exposed to hundreds of trials in which they looked at different scenes and were told to make the distinction between man-made or natural by pressing a button. Ultimately, they found that the higher the discriminability score, the quicker and more accurately participants were able to categorize the scene.\n\nFor the second experiment, the researchers asked: When taking discriminability into account, will the superordinate advantage theory still hold up? To test this, the researchers brought in 24 new participants, and exposed them to images that had to be grouped through a superordinate categorization (man-made vs. natural) or a basic categorization (desert vs. beach). Half of the participants were then given images with greater discriminability for superordinate categorizations, while the other was presented with easier-to-decipher, basic characterizations.\n\nResearchers guessed that if the superordinate advantage was truly how our brains operated, participants would be able to decipher superordinate characteristics quicker than basic ones. However, they observed that when basic categorizations were easier, participants were able to make these distinctions faster and more accurately. Therefore, they concluded that the \u201cbasic advantage,\u201d or the ability to decipher the most obvious distinctions, was how our brains processed a scene.\n\nHowever, they said this doesn\u2019t mean the superordinate advantage doesn\u2019t play a part in the brain\u2019s categorization methods; if superordinate categorization is easier, then we will distinguish it first. \u201cThe mere fact that it is possible to reverse [the superordinate advantage], shows that it is not a sequential type of process,\u201d Serre said, adding that it\u2019s possible there still exists a hierarchy of priorities, which further research will uncover.\n\nSource: Serre T, Sofer I, Crouzet S.
