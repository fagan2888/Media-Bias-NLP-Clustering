This year\u2019s effort to restore the program was one of the most contentious fights of the legislative session.\n\nRepublican leadership in both chambers opposed the measure. They said the Affordable Care Act was supposed to cover these families and rejected backers\u2019 argument that the federal government is paying for the entire cost, noting the large federal deficit.\n\n\u201cWe will see the negative consequences happen, because we cannot live our lives on borrowed dollars, we will have to face that sooner or later,\u201d said Sen. Sylvia Allen, R-Snowflake, on the Senate floor.\n\nLeadership in both chambers attempted to block the legislation, but bipartisan support overcame several roadblocks and the bill passed the 16-12 in the Senate before heading to the governor\u2019s desk where Gov. Doug Ducey signed it hours later.\n\nOne of the major proponents of the legislation, Rep. Regina Cobb, R-Kingman, said the measure would never have passed without bipartisan support. For her, it was an issue that crossed partisan lines.\n\n\u201cNo matter how you look at the problem, this kind of fills the gap until we can do insurance reform,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a victory for a lot of people that really saw the need to put their political views aside.\u201d\n\nSen. Bob Worsley, R-Mesa, was one of five Senate Republicans who backed the measure. He said it was important to make sure that children can get medical care.\n\n\u201cThese are children who need health care, who are in the most needy situation,\u201d Worsley said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "arizona_news", "og": {"url": "http://www.trivalleycentral.com/casa_grande_dispatch/arizona_news/children-s-insurance-to-start-in-sept/article_72de014c-1f7d-11e6-905f-1be78567e5aa.html", "site_name": "trivalleycentral.com", "type": "article", "description": "PHOENIX \u2014 Low-income Arizona families in need of affordable health insurance for their children can begin receiving coverage in September under a new plan offering relief for the working poor.", "title": "Children\u2019s insurance to start in Sept."}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "<266179467961>", "app_id": 266179467961}, "keywords": "arizona_news", "google-site-verification": "pnob7A_ZlKDY1isdeDLyU6W1kqaqdp1JUZJ3eDCa61w", "description": "PHOENIX \u2014 Low-income Arizona families in need of affordable health insurance for their children can begin receiving coverage in September under a new plan offering relief for the working poor."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThese are children who need health care, who are in the most needy situation,\u201d Worsley said.\nPHOENIX \u2014 Low-income Arizona families in need of affordable health insurance for their children can begin receiving coverage in September under a new plan offering relief for the working poor.\nThe program known as Kids\u00adCare will fold into the state\u2019s existing Medicaid program, said Monica Coury, assistant director for the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System.\n\u201cNo matter how you look at the problem, this kind of fills the gap until we can do insurance reform,\u201d she said.\nState health officials estimate as many as 30,000 children will enroll in the first year as Arizona joins the rest of the country in the state\u2019s version of the federal Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program \u2014 at no cost to the state at least through 2017."}
