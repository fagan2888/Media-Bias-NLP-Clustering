1. For purposes of threat assessment, the definition of a threat should be broad and inclusive so that potential sources of violence are not overlooked. As a result, there may be investigation of possible threats that do not turn out to be genuine or serious threats.

2. Threats are communications of intent to harm someone. Threats can be communicated directly to the intended target or indirectly to third parties. Threats also may be expressed in private statements, such as journal entries or written plans, which have no third party audience.

3. Threats can be explicit (“I am going to kill him”) or veiled (“Wait and see what happens, now”).

4. Threats can be expressed through any media (e.g., cell phones, radio, Internet).

5. Threats can express through drawings or other visual representations.

6. Threats can be expressed behaviorally, such as through gestures.

7. Possession of a weapon, concealed or unconcealed, can indicate a threat and merits investigation.

8. In some cases, threat assessments may be indicated when no explicit threat has been communicated, but is strongly suspected, for example, when someone has been highly angry and verbally abusive in a manner that suggests violent intentions.

9. Threats must be identified and reported in order to be investigated. Therefore, organizations should train their staff to identify and report threats. When in doubt, possible threats should be reported so that they can be investigated. There should be clearly established and publicized means of reporting persons who have made threats or engaged in threatening behavior. Multiple reporting methods are desirable.
