Even those who say climate change is a hoax. Even those of you who use four letter words.\u201d\n\nA long time champion of renewable energy, and star of films such as the \u201cTerminator\u201d and \u201cKindergarten Cop,\u201d Schwarzenegger couched his arguments on the health detriments of pollution created from burning fossil fuels.\n\n\u201c(Do) you believe it is acceptable that 7 million people die every year from pollution,\u201d he asked his followers, referring to a WHO study from September finding that pollution killed millions of people in 2012. That number eclipses murders and suicides, combined, Schwarzenegger wrote.\n\nHe added:\u201cEvery day, 19,000 people die from pollution from fossil fuels. Do you accept those deaths? Do you accept that children all over the world have to grow up breathing with inhalers?\u201d\n\nSchwarzenegger ended his post with a question, asking his anti-renewable energy Facebook followers to consider shutting themselves in a room with a gasoline-fueled car, engine running at full-blast. \u201cThere are two doors. Behind Door Number One is a completely sealed room, with a regular, gasoline-fueled car. Behind Door Number Two is an identical, completely sealed room, with an electric car. Both engines are running full blast,\u201d the Terminator star wrote.\n\nRead the whole post here\n\nFollow Chris on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nClick here for reuse options!
