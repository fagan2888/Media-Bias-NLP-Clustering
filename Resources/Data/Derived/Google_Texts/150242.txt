In 2013, Fox News worked to stoke outrage over the supposed decline of traditional American values, identifying the purported "wussification" of America in everything from the "disturbing trend" of yoga in schools to the availability of human resources in the workplace. Here is Media Matters' top ten countdown of Fox News' 'wussification' fears:

10. Yoga For Children

On January 3, Fox & Friends asked whether young children participating in yoga is leading to the "wussification of America."Guest Larry Winget called yoga a "disturbing trend" and complained that yoga wasn't competitive enough and, doesn't teach people how to be "tough." Winget admitted that yoga has positive properties only because he didn't "want all those yoga Nazis coming after [him] on this thing." [Fox News, Fox & Friends, 1/3/2013]

9.Fines For Poor Sportsmanship

On September 25, Fox reported that youth football coaches in one town may face up to $200 in fines for allowing their teams to run up the score against an opponent. Such "mercy rule" regulations are recognized by many youth league sports, but Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade wondered if this represented "wussification" or "good sportsmanship."

8. A Police Officer Who Was Suspended For Cursing

On the December 6 edition of The Kelly File, host Megyn Kelly reported that a police officer was suspended for cursing at a school bus full of children, while the children who were misbehaving faced no consequences. Fox contributor Arthur Aidala said this is the "wussification of America, literally," attributing the children's apparent lack of respect to insufficient fear that their "father is going to give [them] a whack in the mouth."

7. Paid Internships

On the May 18 edition of Fox & Friends Saturday, co-host Clayton Morris hosted author Ron Perlin to discuss internships and the "culture of unpaid work."

4. Helmets For Youth Soccer League

On the October 10 edition of Fox & Friends, co-host Brian Kilmeade reported that one town was campaigning for youth soccer leagues to require helmets.

3. Human Resources

On September 9, Fox & Friends hosts asked regular guest Larry Winget to weigh in on people who talk themselves into being "victims" and offer advice on how to take personal responsibility. Co-host Brian Kilmeade cited as an example those who "complain to [their] boss or run to human resources" when someone "is being mean to you." Winget criticized America from being a "huge nation of weenies," and in response to a question about the recent problems with extreme cyber-bullying, Winget advised parents:"you've got to teach your kid not to be a victim."
