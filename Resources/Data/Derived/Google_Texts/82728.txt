Videos of an incident outside of the In-N-Out Burger on Broadway Boulevard on Saturday, Feb. 27 are causing a stir on social media.

The videos show a group of individuals being confronted by officers with the Tucson Police Department. One officer tells the group they need to get food or get off the property.

Those who shared the video claimed they were harassed by officers and one man was allegedly thrown to the ground without cause.

We reached out to some of the individuals who posted the videos on social media. They said they were not ready to comment.

Sgt. Kim Bay, spokeswoman for TPD, said officers responded to the restaurant around 11 p.m. Saturday.

She said seven people were arrested for trespassing but was unable to give any more details on what exactly happened.

Bay said more information regarding the incident will be available Monday.

Some of the viewer videos can be seen below. Warning, some of the videos contain explicit language.
