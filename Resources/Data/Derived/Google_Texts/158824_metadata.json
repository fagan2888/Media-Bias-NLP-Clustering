If Ben Carson agrees with him, doubly so. Add Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s endorsement, and you have nothing short of apparent mathematical certainty that the matter at hand, so decisively pronounced upon by this Triumvirate of Republican Dunces, must be other than what they assert. Especially when President Obama, waving a moralizing finger at them, takes a position antithetical to theirs.\n\nYet the above assumption may be \u2014 I stress may be \u2014 incorrect, or at the very least, insufficiently considered in the case I\u2019m about to discuss: that of the United States\u2019 response to the dilemma presented by the influx into the West of hundreds of thousands of mostly Muslim refugees, about half of whom come from, or claim to come from, Syria. After chiding Republicans for not wanting to accept asylum-seeking \u201cwidows\u201d and \u201cthree-year-old orphans,\u201d or worse, preferring \u201conly Christians,\u201d as \u201ccontrary to American values,\u201d Obama announced plans, notwithstanding the ISIS terrorist attacks in Paris on November 13, to accept 10,000 Syrians next year, with deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes affirming that they will be subject to a \u201crobust vetting procedure.\u201d\n\nTen thousand is hardly a drop in the bucket in view of the 4.2 million Syrians dispersed elsewhere, mostly in the Middle East. Yet Cruz has called Obama\u2019s plan \u201cnothing short of lunacy.\u201d Trump has promised, if elected, to send them back, warning that ISIS may have infiltrated militants into their ranks, thereby effectuating \u201cone of the great tactical ploys of all time.\u201d Carson likened such militants to \u201cmad dogs.\u201d Former Gov. Mike Huckabee tossed in his two bits (which happens to just about equate with his poll ratings), and declared that the United States should outright reject any refugees from countries \u201cwhere there is a strong presence of ISIS or Al-Qaeda.\u201d Hillary eventually weighed in, opining that barring the entry of these Syrians would \u201cundermine who we are as Americans.\u201d\n\nIt has long been known that Syria\u2019s killing fields are affording some of the world\u2019s most zealous Islamists \u2014 including those possessing European passports \u2014 with battlefield training they put to use against the \u201cinfidel\u201d populations of their home countries. Sure enough, after the terrorist assaults of November 13 in Paris, it emerged that two of the assailants had registered as Syrian refugees upon arrival in Greece earlier in the year, with others traveling back and forth from Syria, apparently unhindered, thanks to Europe\u2019s poorly policed borders and disorganized intelligence services. Though at least one call has issued from liberal quarters to invite a million Syrian refugees to our shores, a measure of sobriety has begun to tinge the debate, with some leading Democrats, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, expressing reservations.\n\nBut the Syrian refugee crisis should not have been the wildly partisan issue it became. Caution is in order. We need to discuss the matter on its merits, politics aside.\n\nConsider these additional points. Most Syrian refugees are fleeing not ISIS, but bombardment by the Assad regime that ISIS is striving to overthrow. A poll conducted a year ago found that 13 percent of Syrian refugees in the Middle East had a positive or somewhat positive opinion of ISIS. This should not be surprising. A renowned 2013 Pew Research Center survey that canvassed much of the Islamic world disclosed the extremely illiberal views (on apostasy, women\u2019s rights and Sharia, among other things) prevalent across the Middle East in particular; it did not include Syria, of course, but there is no reason to believe that that country would have offered results much different from those of its neighbors.\n\nI mention this latter survey only so we understand the possible conflict between values espoused as a matter of course in Muslim countries \u2014 values that may conflict with the secularism and gender equality that rational folk cherish, for instance. This is no reason not to accept Syrian refugees, however. People can change. But we should not assume that because we show them largesse in accepting them, they will gratefully renounce hardline convictions deriving from their religious faith.\n\nNone of the general data cited above should be interpreted as evidence against the admission of individual Syrian refugees, but it should be taken into account in any discussion of the subject, and would tend to dispose one to the conclusion that, at the very least, fighting-age males should continue to be rejected in favor of women and children. Yet women and even children have been both victims and perpetrators of terrorist violence in Syria and elsewhere. Again, caution has to be the rule.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump, Cruz and Carson -- the Triumvirate of GOP Dunces -- are easy to dismiss.
