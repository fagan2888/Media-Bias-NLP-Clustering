Margo Davidson endorsed one of her two challengers in the Democratic primary.\n\nThe political action arm of Planned Parenthood in Pennsylvania announced Monday that it is supporting Billy Smith to represent the 164th Legislative District. The PAC is backing Smith for his willingness to fight for women\u0092s access to birth control, preventative heath care and reproductive rights.\n\n\u0093Billy is in support of safe, legal abortion, supportive of Planned Parenthood (and) supportive of birth control,\u0094 said Sari Stevens, executive director of the PAC. \u0093That\u0092s who we believe should be representing the 164th.\u0094\n\nSmith, a criminal defense attorney from Lansdowne, is trying to unseat Davidson, a two-term incumbent from Upper Darby. Dafan Zhang, a third-year law student from East Lansdowne, also is on the May 20 Democratic primary ballot. Saud Siddiqui, chief executive officer of the Upper Darby Caring Foundation, is running as a Republican.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u0093My support of women\u0092s health is unequivocal,\u0094 Smith said. \u0093It will remain that way. It\u0092s just as equal to my stance against vouchers. My stance against vouchers is also unequivocal and will remain that way.\u0094\n\nDavidson was endorsed by the Planned Parenthood PAC when she first ran for office in 2010. The PAC did not endorse her when she ran for re-election against Republican Earl Toole in 2012.\n\n\u0093Rep. Davidson\u0092s voting record is a stark contrast to the positions that we believe she held when we endorsed her in 2010,\u0094 Stevens said.\n\nAs part of the endorsement process, Planned Parenthood asks candidates to fill out a questionnaire covering various women\u0092s health issues. Based on Davidson\u0092s 2010 responses, Stevens said the PAC was \u0093surprised\u0094 and \u0093disappointed\u0094 by her voting record.\n\n\u0093We don\u0092t endorse without a questionnaire,\u0094 Stevens said. \u0093The votes that were taken were at odds with what was on the questionnaire.\u0094\n\nDavidson supported a 2011 bill that required abortion clinics to meet the same safety standards as freestanding, ambulatory surgical facilities. Signed into law, Senate Bill 732 caused abortion clinics to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars without actually improving patient safety, Planned Parenthood claimed.\n\nDavidson also voted in support of a 2013 bill that prevented health insurance exchanges offered through the Affordable Care Act from covering most abortions.\n\nAbout three dozen Democrats backed each bill.\n\nDavidson said she voted to make abortion clinics safer because a \u0093loved one\u0094 was among the victims of Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortion doctor serving a life sentence without parole for murdering babies after failed abortions. Two women also died, allegedly from illegal, late-term procedures.\n\n\u0093Women were butchered and killed at Dr. Gosnell\u0092s clinic over decades while nothing was done,\u0094 Davidson said in a statement. \u0093I voted yes on SB 732 to make abortion clinics safer with qualified staff and emergency equipment to save women\u0092s lives and protect their rights to choose. When a woman dies she has no more choices.\u0094\n\nDavidson added that she voted to prevent abortion coverage on ACA health insurance exchanges to uphold a federal law preventing federal money from funding abortions.\n\n\u0093In light of these facts, I am not sure why Planned Parenthood would choose to play politics with my votes and support a man who has literally no idea what it is like to face that choice,\u0094 Davidson said. \u0093Only a woman knows.\u0094\n\nDavidson cited her 2012 re-election by a 2-to-1 voting margin as evidence that she has the support of her constituents.\n\nThe district boundaries since have changed by removing portions of Upper Darby and adding Lansdowne and part of Yeadon.\n\nSmith also has been endorsed by Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams and the Pennsylvania State Educators Association \u0097 another group that backed Davidson in 2010. The PSEA withdrew its support after Davidson voted in favor of a vouchers bill in 2011.\n\nDavidson received the endorsement of the Women\u0092s Democratic Club of Delaware County last weekend. She also has the endorsement of the Delaware County Democratic Party, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 830, U.S. Rep. Robert Brady, D-1, of Philadelphia, and state Sen. Anthony Hardy Williams, D-8, of Philadelphia.\n\nZhang, who did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment, has not announced any endorsements.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "election2014, Elections", "title": "Planned Parenthood PAC backs 164th district hopeful", "og": {"url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20140317/NEWS/140319641", "image": {"width": "426px", "identifier": "http://www.delcotimes.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DC/20140317/NEWS/140319641/AR/0/AR-140319641.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "480px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Planned Parenthood PAC backs 164th district hopeful"}, "twitter": {"domain": "delcotimes.com", "description": "A political action committee that previously backed state Rep.
