Sen. Bernard Sanders said Sunday he is ready to fight for the Democratic presidential nomination all the way to the California primary in June, saying he needs to push front-runner Hillary Clinton on everything from income inequality to climate change to college debt.

“It’s good for democracy, it’s good for the Democratic Party,” the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont told ABC’s “This Week.”

Mr. Sanders trails Mrs. Clinton by hundreds of delegates heading into a series of East Coast primaries on Tuesday.

But he made no apologies for needling Mrs. Clinton on her ties to Wall Street and her failure to push for single-payer health care, even if she has a clearer path to the nomination and a November showdown with GOP candidates who disgust Mr. Sanders.

“We need to continue this debate about what is happening to ordinary people in America,” Mr. Sanders said.

Mr. Sanders hasn’t said whether he would throw his support behind a Clinton nomination, though he did say he would do everything he can to make sure that GOP presidential front-runner DonaldTrump or a “right-wing person” like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz doesn’t win.

For now, he’s still trying to be the one who squares off with the GOP in November.

“We’re going to fight this out until the last vote is cast, that’s what democracy is about,” he told CBS’s “Face the Nation.”
