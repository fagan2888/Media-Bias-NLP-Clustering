Officials in Oregon, Minnesota and Maryland all resigned as troubles mounted.\n\nLee hasn't been immune to criticism. On Thursday, after his bonus was announced at a meeting of the exchange's board, two state lawmakers faulted him for low enrollment among African Americans.\n\nLee defended the exchange's performance and said he would follow up on their concerns.\n\nIn other personnel matters, Covered California announced two new executives. Amy Palmer was hired as director of communications and public relations. She will earn $160,000 a year.\n\nKirk Whelan, a former Kaiser Permanente executive, was named director of individual and small-business sales at a annual salary of $170,000.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obamacare chief in California gets $53,000 bonus", "date": "2014-08-22", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California's health insurance exchange awarded its executive director a one-time bonus of $53,000 after the state enrolled 1.2 million people in Obamacare coverage.", "title": "Obamacare chief in California gets $53,000 bonus", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-california-chief-bonus-20140821-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53f6ee18/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-california-chief-bonus-20140821", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, covered california", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81150302", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, covered california", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "California's health insurance exchange awarded its executive director a one-time bonus of $53,000 after the state enrolled 1.2 million people in Obamacare coverage.
