(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File)\n\nHouse Republicans are considering passing a short-term extension of government funding this week to buy more time for negotiations over a year-end omnibus spending bill as a deal with Democrats proves elusive and a Friday deadline for avoiding a shutdown nears.\n\nGOP leaders are discussing a stop-gap bill that would cover a few days, but some conservatives are pushing for a longer extension that would go into next year as they seek to add policy provisions to the must-pass legislation.\n\nSeveral Republicans said after a weekly party meeting Tuesday that Democrats are trying to use the Friday deadline to pressure GOP lawmakers to back down on their priorities.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re trying to jam us,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a member of the House Appropriations Committee. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to have an omnibus with no riders.\u201d\n\nAmong the GOP riders Democrats oppose are proposals to restrict the ability of Syrian and Iraqi refugees to enter the country, block environmental rules advanced by the Obama administration and rollback financial regulations required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.\n\nWith the deadline for another government shutdown fast approaching, here the eight terms you need to know in order to understand what Congress is debating. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cWe know that we\u2019re going to get it right instead of get it done fast,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said of the negotiations, while adding House GOP leaders will give lawmakers three days to scrutinize any deal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure that members of Congress and therefore the public have the time to read what is agreed to. But we\u2019re not going to let an arbitrary Dec. 11 deadline stop us from getting this right. We\u2019re going to get the best agreement we can possibly get, and those negotiations are ongoing.\u201d\n\nStaff members for Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) were expected to meet Tuesday afternoon on both the tax and spending negotiations.\n\nSome conservatives floated the idea of a six-week extension of current federal spending levels in order to give negotiators more time to work out an agreement, but most Republicans said they would like to see a much shorter extension.\n\n\u201cIt just prolongs the inevitable,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), a leading moderate. \u201cIt just creates another cliff and provides for more drama, dysfunction and budgetary instability.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, White House spokesman Joshua Earnest warned that President Obama would not sign a short-term spending bill to buy more time for negotiations but would consider approving one if it was only needed to provide a few days for final votes to occur.\n\nSenate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.) said he thinks a short-term spending bill of about one to two days could pass the Senate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we want to have any situation here we don\u2019t have everything open and functioning,\u201d Thune said. \u201cI would hope that it wouldn\u2019t be more than a day or two at most.\u201d\n\nHouse Democrats also appeared open to a very short extension.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters that it could be reasonable to allow until Dec. 18 to complete a spending bill.\n\n\u201cLonger than that is a problem,\u201d he said.\n\nMembers said the talks have been further complicated by simultaneous negotiations on a package of tax breaks that has become closely linked with the spending bill.\n\nSome leaders hope that progress on the tax package could ease pressure on the spending negotiations by allowing Republicans to claim victory over a large-scale tax break for businesses and individuals.\n\nLate Monday, House Republicans filed a scaled back bill that would retroactively reauthorize the breaks that expired last year and then extend them for one year going forward.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) told reporters on Tuesday that even though the bill has been filed he expects negotiations will continue on a bigger deal that could make several breaks, including the research and development tax credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit, permanent.\n\n\u201cWe want negotiations to continue,\u201d Brady said.\n\nBrady also said he is considering adding language to the bill that would delay for two years the implementation of two provisions of the Affordable Care Act, a tax on medical device manufacturers and a levy on high value health plans known as the Cadillac Tax.\n\nSeveral negotiators and aides said that prospects for the broader bill were increasingly positive despite frustration from House Democrats.\n\nSome House Democrats, including Hoyer and Pelosi oppose the broader bill over concerns that the tax cuts would forgo an estimated $700 to $800 billion in future tax revenue.\n\nSome also worry that it would make some costly business tax breaks permanent and make it harder to find savings if Congress attempts tax reform in the future.\n\n\u201cWe believe a large bill like that is not justified and in fact could be harmful,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cIt would undermine the ability to do tax reform.\u201d\n\nMike DeBonis contributed to this report", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP leaders are discussing a stop-gap bill that would cover a few days, but some conservatives are pushing for a longer extension that would go into next year.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "GOP leaders are discussing a stop-gap bill that would cover a few days, but some conservatives are pushing for a longer extension that would go into next year.", "title": "Republicans eye short-term spending bill as shutdown deadline approaches", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/12/08/republicans-discuss-short-term-spending-bill-as-shutdown-deadline-approaches/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/05/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Republican_Leadership-0a5be-1649.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kelsey_snell"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Omnibus, shutdown, syria, spending", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Omnibus, shutdown, syria, spending"}, "article_summary": "said he thinks a short-term spending bill of about one to two days could pass the Senate.\ntold reporters that it could be reasonable to allow until Dec. 18 to complete a spending bill.\nSeveral negotiators and aides said that prospects for the broader bill were increasingly positive despite frustration from House Democrats.\nMembers said the talks have been further complicated by simultaneous negotiations on a package of tax breaks that has become closely linked with the spending bill.\nSome also worry that it would make some costly business tax breaks permanent and make it harder to find savings if Congress attempts tax reform in the future."}
