I know so many Muslims that are such fabulous people,\" he said. \"But there is a problem. I mean, there's no question about it. And we can be politically correct, and we can say there is no problem whatsoever. But the fact is there is a problem with some. And it's a very severe problem.\"\n\nTodd also asked Trump if he would support a Muslim for president. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, another leading Republican contender, said on the same program that he \"would not advocate that we put a Muslim in charge of this nation, according to The Associated Press. But Trump seemed unsure.\n\n\"I can say that it's something that at some point could happen. We'll see. It's something that could happen. Would I be comfortable? I don't know if we have to address it right now. But I think it is certainly something that could happen,\" Trump said.\n\nReferencing conspiracy theorists who question Obama's faith, Trump added that \"some people have said it already happened, frankly.\"\n\nHowever, he told Todd that he would take Obama \"at his word\" that he's a Christian.\n\nSeveral years ago, Trump was one of the most prominent people challenging the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate. But since he announced his presidential campaign this year, Trump insists he's \"off that subject.\"\n\n\"I mean, you're bringing it up this morning,\" he said Sunday. \"But I'm into the world of jobs. I'm into the world of military and vets, and, frankly, I discuss Obamacare because [with] Obamacare, you see what's happening with the premiums. They're going through the roof. A lot of problems with Obamacare.\"\n\nWatch his 'Meet the Press' interview below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Colin Campbell", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "\"I just don't want to discuss it.\"", "creator": "BKColin", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-obama-birth-certificate-meet-the-press", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/55febb059dd7cc15008bbb11-506-253/donald-trump-just-had-an-awkward-exchange-about-obamas-birth-certificate.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump just had an awkward exchange about Obama's birth certificate", "site": "bi_politics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Donald Trump, Meet the Press, Chuck Todd, Barack Obama, Conspiracy Theorists, Birthers, Colin Campbell", "description": "\"I just don't want to discuss it.\"", "author": "Colin Campbell", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-20", "sailthru.title": "Donald Trump just had an awkward exchange about Obama's birth certificate", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/55febae09dd7cc25008bba1b-50-50/donald-trump-just-had-an-awkward-exchange-about-obamas-birth-certificate.jpg", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Meet the Press, Chuck Todd, Barack Obama, Conspiracy Theorists, Birthers, Colin Campbell", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/55febae09dd7cc25008bba1b/donald-trump-just-had-an-awkward-exchange-about-obamas-birth-certificate.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-09-20", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/colin-campbell"}, "sailthru.description": "\"I just don't want to discuss it.\"", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "\"I just don't want to discuss it.\"", "title": "Donald Trump just had an awkward exchange about Obama's birth certificate", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-obama-birth-certificate-meet-the-press", "image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/55febb059dd7cc15008bbb11-1190-625/donald-trump-just-had-an-awkward-exchange-about-obamas-birth-certificate.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Donald Trump just had an awkward exchange about Obama's birth certificate", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/55febae09dd7cc25008bba1b/donald-trump-just-had-an-awkward-exchange-about-obamas-birth-certificate.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics"}, "article_summary": "Real-estate tycoon Donald Trump refused to answer multiple questions about President Barack Obama's birth certificate on Sunday.\nReferencing conspiracy theorists who question Obama's faith, Trump added that \"some people have said it already happened, frankly.\"\nBut I think it is certainly something that could happen,\" Trump said.\nSeveral years ago, Trump was one of the most prominent people challenging the authenticity of Obama's birth certificate.\n\"So this man got up, and he felt very strongly \u2014 whoever he was \u2014 he felt very, very strongly and very powerfully about something,\" Trump recalled."}
