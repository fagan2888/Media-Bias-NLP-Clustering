Uh oh!

Canadian senator Ted Cruz is telling reporters that he confronted Obama a couple nights ago, demanding that the president end the shutdown and help everyone “negatively affected by Obamacare.”

Cruz told Politico:

“I opposed the shutdown from Day One. I think it was wrong that President Obama and Harry Reid forced the shutdown. They forced the shutdown because they wouldn’t compromise on Obamacare,”

According to the site Cruz told Obama that any deal to reopen the government must also provide relief for those negatively affected by Obamacare. Cruz did not use the word “defund” to describe his aspirations for changes to the health care law when speaking to reporters, but said he wants “substantial” changes

Cruz adds:

“I’m glad that we are finally having discussions. That is an improvement. There was an awful lot of talk but then, at the end of the day, the president still said he wouldn’t negotiate. We began talking, that was good today. But he continued to maintain that he will not negotiate or compromise on anything. And if that is the position, that’s not going to lead to a resolution.”

Mmm… We wonder what POTUS’ response was.
