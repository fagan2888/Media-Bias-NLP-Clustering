They are currently on a bus tour of the state, urging everyone to sign up -- using real people, like Diana Parret of Fresno to sell it. \"Because it saved a life, it saved mine and I am very thankful.\"Parret told a crowd in Downtown Fresno how being able to get health insurance through covered California saved her.\"I lost my job in December so I had no coverage and I had no job so thank goodness we had this program so I was able to get back to Kaiser,\" said Parret, \"So I look at it as a gift, I got a new lease on life.\"Peter Lee heads Covered California and noted it has dramatically reduced the number of Californians without health insurance. \"California has been successful. I think its really important to note by reducing the rate of the uninsured from 22 to 11 percent is the biggest reduction in the nation.\"But Lee notes 3 million remain without coverage. He says nearly all could get no cost or subsidized insurance if they would sign up. Lee disputes claims Covered California, which is the states version of the Affordable Care Act or Obama Care, is raising health care costs. He also noted that cost increases are at their lowest level in years. He added the message of its benefits are not talked about by its political critics.\"What are people talking about in their churches, what are people talking about in their communities -- what we are hearing there are stories like people from Diana -- her story of having no insurance and then having uterine cancer found and treated right away. Those are the stories that matter.\"Open enrollment for Covered California starts on November 15th and runs through February 15th.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Californian&#39;s  who don&#39;t have health insurance have a new chance to sign up.", "og": {"site_name": "ABC30 Fresno", "description": "Californian's  who don't have health insurance have a new chance to sign up.", "title": "Covered California open enrollment starts soon", "url": "http://abc30.com/391834/", "image": "http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/content/kfsn/images/cms/automation/vod/391415_1280x720.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Californian's  who don't have health insurance have a new chance to sign up.", "title": "Covered California open enrollment starts soon", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/abc30-fresno/id408436001", "iphone": "http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/abc30-fresno/id408436001", "googleplay": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.abclocal.kfsn.news"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "ABC30 Fresno", "iphone": "ABC30 Fresno", "googleplay": "ABC30 Fresno"}, "id": {"ipad": 408436001, "iphone": 408436001, "googleplay": "com.abclocal.kfsn.news"}}, "creator": "@abc30", "site": "@abc30", "image": "http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/content/kfsn/images/cms/automation/vod/391415_1280x720.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=408436001, affiliate-data=ct=kfsn-smart-banner&pt=302756, app-argument=http://abc30.com/health/covered-california-open-enrollment-starts-soon/391834/", "fb": {"app_id": 228176854052685, "pages": 160328526481}, "keywords": "covered california,open enrollment,health insurance,health care,obamacare,affordable care act,covered california,health insurance,obamacare,affordable care act,health care,fresno,united states,california", "msvalidate.01": "59C39F9AA91BE12CB90B7EF18335463D", "google-site-verification": "vi6Z_KgHMFudo6Bxglnd2t2-OcbvfQQuv8ZdtX9ucRU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "covered california,open enrollment,health insurance,health care,obamacare,affordable care act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd080e\"", "article_summary": "\"Open enrollment for Covered California starts on November 15th and runs through February 15th.\nOpen enrollment for the Covered California health plans stars next week.\n\"Parret told a crowd in Downtown Fresno how being able to get health insurance through covered California saved her.\n\"Peter Lee heads Covered California and noted it has dramatically reduced the number of Californians without health insurance.\nLee disputes claims Covered California, which is the states version of the Affordable Care Act or Obama Care, is raising health care costs."}
