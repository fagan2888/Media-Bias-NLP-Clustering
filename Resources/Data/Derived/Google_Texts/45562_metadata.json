It\u2019s a theory about why we\u2019re having such a misguided, unconstructive discussion about several hot-button food-related issues, GMOs first among them.\n\nIt begins with the premise that our food supply has some very big problems. Although any reasonable person acknowledges the things we do well \u2014 our farms are highly productive, our food is extremely safe \u2014 it\u2019s easy, also, to see where we\u2019ve gone wrong. Our agriculture has contributed to water-quality problems and soil erosion, among other issues. And our food supply is hard for us to navigate without getting fat; two-thirds of us are overweight or obese. We eat a lot of processed food and not a lot of produce. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 13 percent of us eat enough fruit, and 9 percent eat enough vegetables.\n\nPretty much everybody I\u2019ve talked with concedes that there are problems. But it\u2019s hard to find a villain. A complex set of interacting players and factors drives these problems, and solutions tend to be commensurately complex. Genetically modified organisms, I think, are often a proxy for the very big, very real problems in our agriculture and food supply. One reason we can\u2019t get past them is that, although GMO advocates point out, early and often, that GMOs aren\u2019t the problem (and I believe they\u2019re right), they seldom go on to say exactly what the problem is (and I believe they\u2019re remiss).\n\nSo I figured I should ask. I went to a whole host of smart, thoughtful people holding varying positions on GMOs and asked one simple question: Leaving aside GMOs for the moment, what\u2019s the problem with our food? How, in other words, should we go about fixing our food system, from the ground up?\n\nHere is a necessarily distilled version of what they told me. Next month, I\u2019ll synthesize their suggestions, along with those of other people I\u2019ve spoken with over the past two years and a few ideas of my own, into a grand plan to fix our food system. I know you\u2019re on the edge of your seat!\n\n\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack: \u201dThere\u2019s an effort on the part of many people to use food policy as a dividing issue. . . . Food should be uniting.\u201d (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nTom Vilsack, U.S. secretary of agriculture\n\nFittingly, he begins by pointing to two programs the Department of Agriculture has already implemented. One gives farmers \u2014 particularly small and medium-size operations \u2014 options other than large-farm style commodity crops. Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food helps them enter markets \u2014 local, regional, organic \u2014 where more of the food dollar goes to the farmer.\n\nThe second, the Regional Conservation Partnership Program, encourages multiple conservation practices on farmland, to mitigate problems with soil condition and water quality.\n\nThe USDA, says Vilsack, doesn\u2019t focus exclusively on farmers. More-healthful school meals are a priority, as is helping families who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program assistance (SNAP, or food stamps) so they can \u201cincorporate healthier choices in tight family budgets with more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and multiple protein sources.\u201d\n\n[Want to get food on the table with little money? Make time to cook.]\n\nWhat frustrates Vilsack is that \u201cthere\u2019s an effort on the part of many people to use food policy as a dividing issue. Red, blue. Organic, conventional. Foodie, traditional. I\u2019m fed up with having divisive conversations.\u201d\n\nThere are some uniting issues, he notes. Conservation is a goal for everyone involved in agriculture, as is adaptation to climate change. We all want to reduce food waste. And no one wants children to go to bed hungry.\n\nVilsack wants to find more common ground: \u201cFood should be uniting.\u201d\n\n\n\nDan Glickman, senior fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center: We have to bring different people from different worlds together. Producers, processors, retailers, consumers: That dialogue has not occurred very much.\u201d (Kate Patterson/For The Washington Post)\n\nDan Glickman, senior fellow, Bipartisan Policy Center\n\nGlickman, who was secretary of agriculture in the Clinton administration, starts by quoting H.L. Mencken\u2019s famous dictum that for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple and wrong. \u201cThere is no silver bullet,\u201d he says. But there is \u201csilver buckshot,\u201d a wide range of initiatives that, together, can help.\n\n[Why everyone who is sure about a food philosophy is wrong]\n\nHe lists a few that could help change consumer habits: \u201cMaintain improvement in school meals. Make sure the Dietary Guidelines are scientifically based and have a health focus. Educate doctors and health-care professionals about prevention techniques, including nutrition.\u201d He also suggests that the insurance industry write policies with incentives for people to take better care of themselves.\n\nOn the production side, he wants to encourage crop diversity. \u201cIt\u2019s a Field of Dreams,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we grow it, they will buy it.\u201d\n\nLike Vilsack, Glickman would like to see more unity. \u201cWe have to bring different people from different worlds together,\u201d he says. \u201cProducers, processors, retailers, consumers: That dialogue has not occurred very much. People have to be talking to each other.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation President Bob Stallman (left, with Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack): \u201cFrom an industry standpoint, we should do what we can to not disincentivize the production of healthier crops.\u201d (American Farm Bureau Federation)\n\nBob Stallman, president, American Farm Bureau Federation\n\n\u201cThe complexity of society\u2019s relationship with food is at the core of the problem,\u201d says Stallman. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a tendency by society to blame. Some look at the food system.\u201d To change consumer behavior, he says, start with education. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame kids in schools aren\u2019t taught basic nutrition.\u201d\n\nStallman says the food system bears some responsibility. \u201cFrom an industry standpoint, we should do what we can to not disincentivize the production of healthier crops.\u201d When I ask whether that means he\u2019d support a crop-neutral system, in which insurance premiums are subsidized to the same extent, no matter the crop, and commodity programs are eliminated, he says that \u201cin theory, I think a crop-neutral risk management support system would be desirable.\u201d\n\n[The crop program that could change everything]\n\nHe also says farmers and ranchers have to be more engaged in the public debate: \u201cWe have to show up and have reasonable conversations in forums that we may not be most comfortable being in.\u201d When people who aren\u2019t involved in food production get together to talk about our food system, \u201cmost farmers and ranchers ask, \u2018Who are these people, and why do I need to be there?\u2019\u201d he says. But it\u2019s important to show up, because \u201cit\u2019s easy to trash someone when you\u2019re not looking them in the eye.\u201d\n\n\n\nRicardo Salvador, food and environment program director for the Union of Concerned Scientists: \u201cThe government supports the businesses that produce the food that make us sick.\u201d (Jeffrey MacMillan)\n\nRicardo Salvador, director, Food & Environment Program, Union of Concerned Scientists\n\nSalvador begins by talking about the sequence of people \u2014 seed developer, farmer, aggregator, manufacturer \u2014 who together produce food. \u201cEveryone in the sequence is doing the best that they can within their niche. The aggregate outcome is that we\u2019re exploiting people and nature, and producing the wrong things.\u201d\n\nTo fix it, \u201cyou don\u2019t modify a system by tweaking a leverage point. You have to change its purpose.\u201d And its purpose, according to Salvador, should be \u201cpublic well-being,\u201d which encompasses both human and environmental health. From there, we have to align incentives with that objective. \u201cRight now, incentives are all about productivity, because at one time that was the limiting factor.\u201d\n\nTo change that, Salvador focuses on the political process, beginning with \u201ca concerted campaign for the next president to see that food should be a high national priority. Every issue that candidates believe they have to address \u2014 climate, drought, immigration \u2014 is related to food.\u201d\n\nThe idea is that \u201cgovernment should invest in supporting the system it recommends that we eat. Instead, the data show the government supports the businesses that produce the food that make us sick. The free market can do whatever it wants, but the government shouldn\u2019t be investing public resources in it.\u201d\n\n\n\nChef-restaurateur and Food Policy Action co-founder Tom Colicchio: \u201cI think people want to eat healthier food, but they can\u2019t afford it.\u201d (Kris Connor/Getty Images for Chef Action Net)\n\nTom Colicchio, chef/owner, Crafted Hospitality; co-founder, Food Policy Action\n\nColicchio starts with crop subsidies. \u201cIf you want to change behavior, there have to be incentives,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are tying subsidies and crop insurance to conservation, but some of the standards need to be stronger.\u201d He suggests, as an example, tying them to the amount of carbon sequestered in soil.\n\nHe\u2019s also focused on helping farmers convert acreage to organic crops. \u201cThere are farmers who want to do it, but the three-year period [required for the transition] may not be a good business decision.\u201d He floats the possibility of an affordable loan program, or \u201ca futures market for organic,\u201d to help with that.\n\nOn the consumer side, Colicchio focuses on affordability. \u201cI think people want to eat healthier food, but they can\u2019t afford it.\u201d To make fruits and vegetables more affordable, Colicchio circles back to crop subsidies, which he\u2019d like to see reflect MyPlate, the USDA nutrition guide that divides the plate into approximately four equal parts: fruits, vegetables, grains and proteins. He also wants to see programs like SNAP and Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) keep their funding.\n\nIn schools, Colicchio would like to see a continued focus on more-healthful school lunches and more nutrition education. \u201cStart at pre-K,\u201d he says, \u201cso kids know what healthy eating is.\u201d\n\n\n\nMichael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest: \u201cGovernment and industry need to mount major, ongoing dietary-change campaigns promoting fruits, veggies \u2014 including beans \u2014 and whole grains.\u201d (Chris Kleponis/Center for Science in the Public Interest)\n\nMichael Jacobson, executive director, Center for Science in the Public Interest\n\nJacobson pinpoints three improvements we should make: Drink fewer sugary drinks, eat less meat, and eat more fruits and vegetables. On the sugar front, he suggests soda taxes and FDA limits on the calorie content of drinks (and a warning notice on drinks that exceed the limits). On produce, he says \u201cgovernment and industry need to mount major, ongoing dietary-change campaigns promoting fruits, veggies \u2014 including beans \u2014 and whole grains.\u201d He also favors giving SNAP recipients discounts on fruits and vegetables, but acknowledges that it\u2019s \u201cunrealistic\u201d politically.\n\n[Eat less meat, a government panel says. Does science agree?]\n\n\u201cA softer, longer approach,\u201d he adds, \u201cis to teach kids how to cook.\u201d\n\n\n\nLaura Batcha, chief executive and executive director of the Organic Trade Association: \u201cCrop diversity, habitat diversity, diversity in seed. Most everyone can agree that diverse systems are more resilient.\u201d (Erika Nizborski/Organic Trade Association)\n\nLaura Batcha, chief executive and executive director, Organic Trade Association\n\nBatcha points to two issues: diversity and choice.\n\n\u201cDiversity is the obvious one,\u201d she says. \u201cCrop diversity, habitat diversity, diversity in seed. Most everyone can agree that diverse systems are more resilient.\u201d\n\nOur food landscape is driven by both markets and public policy, she notes. \u201cWe have to make sure that the government doesn\u2019t have its hands on the scale toward one production system. It has to drive agriculture toward, not away from, diversity.\u201d\n\n[Is organic food better for your health?]\n\nShe acknowledges that this is beginning to happen. \u201cThere have been [government] investments in local and regional food systems. There have been trends to diversify some. We see export support out of USDA slowly start to move away from exclusive support for large commodity exports.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, consumer preferences are also shaping our food supply. Batcha cites the many producers, processors and retailers who are responding to consumer pressure on issues such as cage-free eggs and antibiotic use in livestock. She expects that to continue.\n\nAlthough Batcha represents the organic industry, she\u2019s quick to say that organic is \u201cnot the only thing,\u201d but should be one choice among many.\n\n\n\nMonsanto chief executive Hugh Grant: \u201cThere\u2019s more interest in agriculture than there\u2019s ever been. When you think of the tiny fraction of those involved in growing food, and then the number involved in the debate about food, it\u2019s an order of magnitude bigger.\u201d (Elijah Nouvelage/Reuters)\n\nHugh Grant, chief executive, Monsanto\n\nOne of Grant\u2019s priorities is feeding a growing global population. What are the next 2 billion humans going to eat? \u201cThe U.S. is going to have a big part of feeding them,\u201d he says, and notes the productivity of soybeans, \u201cthe cheapest, purest source of high-volume plant protein.\u201d He acknowledges, though, that Americans don\u2019t consume soy that way. (We feed it to animals and use the oil in food processing.)\n\n[The GMO debate: 5 things to stop arguing]\n\nAbout the question of how to fix our food system here at home, Grant says that \u201cfive years ago, I would have argued that we\u2019re a seed company, what can we do?\u201d But his view has changed, and he sees Monsanto as part of a chain that needs to be interacting. Trace a packaged food back, and it was \u201ca Monsanto seed, grown by a farmer, aggregated by Cargill,\u201d and so on to the grocery shelf.\n\nThe players in that chain \u201cdon\u2019t sit at the same table very often. You have to talk.\u201d What they need to talk about, says Grant, is \u201chow do you grow more, and how do you grow better? We have more, and better has suffered.\u201d\n\n[It\u2019s the chemical Monsanto depends on. How dangerous is it?]\n\nDialogue also has to include people who aren\u2019t in that chain. \u201cThere\u2019s more interest in agriculture than there\u2019s ever been,\u201d Grant says. \u201cWhen you think of the tiny fraction of those involved in growing food, and then the number involved in the debate about food, it\u2019s an order of magnitude bigger.\u201d But there\u2019s a lot of \u201cneedless friction\u201d in that debate. \u201cIt\u2019s conventional versus organic, small versus large, slow versus local. It\u2019s either/or, and the public spectacle of locking horns.\u201d To improve our food supply, \u201cwe\u2019re going to need every element of this.\u201d\n\nGrant is optimistic (\u201cdespite being a Scotsman,\u201d he says). \u201cIf there were total indifference, the chance of engagement would be much less. Collectively, we will figure this out.\u201d\n\nHaspel writes about food and science and farms oysters on Cape Cod. On Twitter: @TamarHaspel.
