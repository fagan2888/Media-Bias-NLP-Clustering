Plans were made to demolish the buildings and upgrade roads, sewers and lighting.\n\nBut those plans perished in the recession and, today, the site still sits stubbornly empty. Now, one city council member says it\u2019s time to abandon the city\u2019s plans to land a big company and to focus on attracting smaller businesses and startups.\n\n\u201cIf the only thing that is acceptable is a home run, you will wait a long time, and we\u2019ve already waited a long time,\u201d Councilman Karl Nurse said. \u201cMaybe after all those years of that not working, we need to take a step back and say what do we need to get that started?\u201d\n\nCity officials say there is still interest in the land and some ongoing discussions with companies. But they admit the city may have to invest in the area\u2019s infrastructure and look to draw a number of small companies.\n\n\u201cWe need to figure out the infrastructure and layout and look at subdividing the property into lot sizes that are attractive to individual job-generating users,\u201d said Dave Goodwin, city director of economic development.\n\nA redevelopment plan for the Dome Industrial Park was hatched in 1999 and initially focused on a 20-acre area on the east side of 22nd Street South. The city received $5 million in federal grants to buy run-down land. The grant, from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, came with strings, requiring that a minimum of at least one job be created for every $35,000 of grant money.\n\nIn 2007, the city sold most of the land to the U.S. Department of Labor for $2.25 million. It built a $40 million, nine-building Jobs Corps complex, creating about 100 jobs. The facility brought job and skills training to one of the city\u2019s poorest areas, but the number of jobs was short of the city\u2019s target, and it did not provide the manufacturing jobs needed for an area where many residents have no higher education.\n\nWith the proceeds from the sale, the city launched a second phase of the Dome plan, targeting the other side of 22nd Street South. To meet the HUD job target, the city would need to attract a company promising to provide at least 170 jobs, Goodwin said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not our target \u2014 170 is low,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to do better than that.\u201d\n\nThe land is in an enterprise zone, is a designated brownfield site and in a community redevelopment area, meaning the city can offer tax credits to companies to move there.\n\nA seafood processing company, a battery manufacturer and a company that manufactures floating concrete docks are among those that considered but passed on the site.\n\n\u201cThey just didn\u2019t pan out,\u201d Goodwin said. He said he could not disclose which company is in talks with the city.\n\nOther parts of the Dome Industrial Park have attracted businesses and jobs.\n\nLantm\u00e4nnen Unibake opened a new 55,000-square-foot facility after the city offered financial incentives. The city joined with Urban Development Solutions, a nonprofit group that opened a branch of Sylvia\u2019s restaurant in the renovated Manhattan Casino on 22nd Street South.\n\nAs part of the Warehouse Arts District, the area\u2019s lower rents have attracted dozens of artists. That includes Mark Aeling, who has worked out of his MGA Sculpture Studio close to the city\u2019s land for nine years. He said other parts of the city still look more attractive to developers and businesses.\n\n\u201cThe economy hasn\u2019t helped, and it\u2019s not a great part of town,\u201d Aeling said.\n\nAnother complication is that the city still has to acquire a couple of parcels before it can offer a contiguous construction site to interested companies. That includes a lone resident whose home is in the middle of the parcel.\n\n\u201cWe can put together a fairly attractive incentive package,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cThe real key to getting revitalization is to assemble the fragmented pieces of property.\u201d\n\ncodonnell@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-7654\n\nTwitter: @codonnellTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 22 Jun 2014 00:01:00 -0400", "Description": "Plans for the Midtown area of St. Petersburg perished in the recession and, today, the site still sits stubbornly empty.
