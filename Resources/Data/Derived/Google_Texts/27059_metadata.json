But it is the best system we\u2019ve got. Similarly, since their invention in the NME in 1952, the UK pop charts have been far from bulletproof. Indeed, the history of the metrics of music consumption would \u2013 and does \u2013 fill books. In the past decade, the UK charts have been rejigged to accommodate downloads and streaming plays, in an attempt to best reflect what music is most popular. Earlier this month, charts just for vinyl were introduced, reflecting the unexpected resurgence of the connoisseur\u2019s format.\n\nMore pop change is afoot. From July, singles and albums will no longer come out on Monday in the UK, but on Friday \u2013 a move that will bring worldwide release dates into harmony. After more than 40 years on Sunday nights, BBC Radio 1\u2019s chart show, to be hosted by Greg James, will move to Friday evening, from 4pm to 6pm. Not only that \u2013 as of 10 May, kids\u2019 TV channel CBBC will play host to The Official Chart Show, a magazine programme studded with videos and gossip, and hosted by Cel Spellman, a successor, of sorts, to the much-missed Top of the Pops.\n\nWith charts as accurate as they have ever been, both the top 40 and what you might call chart-watching as a national pastime are now under scrutiny. The move to CBBC speaks volumes about the need to hook a younger audience into consuming pop in ways an older audience would recognise. (Quite how young that audience might be was slightly misunderstood by NME recently, who weighed in with jokes about Rastamouse, a show on CBeebies, the channel aimed at pre-schoolers.)\n\nThanks to the internet\u2019s endlessly personalisable technologies \u2013 YouTube channels, streaming, you-name-it-on-demand \u2013 pop has been at the forefront of a seismic change in listening. The past couple of years has seen Radio 1 lose millions of listeners as it attempts to retune to a younger audience. Much has been written about this decline in broadcasting, where many once witnessed the same thing at the same time, and the rise of what we do now: stacking up podcasts, Sky+-ing content and streaming the latest obscure remixes on Soundcloud, as and when. \u201cNarrowcasting\u201d describes the endlessly niche way in which we watch and listen. With everyone off doing their own thing \u2013 especially the young \u2013 what is the role of the mainstream charts and, indeed, of mainstream chart shows, in this age of fragmented, bespoke consumption? Our young interviewees, stopped and quizzed in Camden last week \u2013 not a scientific sample but reflecting a range of ages and tastes \u2013 seem to point to the charts\u2019 redundancy, certainly as a tastemaking exercise. But is it telling that more than one commented on the rise of a rock band, Royal Blood, to No 1 as being significant?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Top of the Pops was a national obsession from 1964 until 2006.\n\nIt\u2019s instructive to know that for many years in the US, the charts were confined to the music industry\u2019s trade paper, Billboard: who was at No 9 was of little concern to the general public. In the UK, by contrast, the charts have been a more emotional affair, broadcast to the nation, the rises and falls of your favourite song a matter of intense concern. Bob Stanley, who has written extensively about the charts, reckons this obsession with pop quantification is a curiously British trait, akin to cricket statistics and trainspotting. Perhaps Britons, with their hierarchical society, have had some innate need to know who is top pop dog from week to week. Maybe the system itself appealed, appearing populist and meritocratic at a time \u2013 the 50s, 60s and 70s \u2013 when those old hierarchies were crumbling. Buy enough of your heroes, send them up the charts: your tastes would be validated, and your sense of agency sated.\n\nAnd now? If the charts matter to anyone, it is probably the record companies. Then there are the egos of high-volume artists to consider: the hit parade, after all, parades their hits. You can just picture Ed Sheeran, giddy from his umpteenth No 1, tousling Harry Styles\u2019s hair, promising him a couple of tunes for his putative solo album when One Direction run out of steam. What joy would there be, if there were no No 1 to get to?\n\nAnd chart shows? Getting eyes on screens, or ears to speakers, to consume specific content remains a holy grail for all broadcasters; recapturing the youth audience is a priority for the BBC. Relocating the chart to after school on Friday (and reinforcing it on TV at teatime on Sunday) makes sense. Huge numbers of young people remain pop-obsessed; but, if there is a conclusion to be drawn from our sample and the move to CBBC, perhaps it is that the age of the pop consumer has decreased significantly. Another metric \u2013 the show\u2019s own viewing figures \u2013 will reveal whether our particular national obsession with new entries, steady-at-No-4s, and big climbers can continue in an age where listening is an increasingly fractured pastime.\n\nYoung music fans have their say on the charts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nAntony Ryder, 16\n\nLikes: Nirvana, the Smiths\n\nI discover music through Spotify and YouTube, and there are a few bands in our school that have gigged around London, they know what\u2019s going on. They found out about Drenge and Royal Blood and all these up-and-coming bands. Lots of my friends pass around CDs, or people share their headphones at lunchtime. Things like Spotify are really convenient \u2013 if someone hasn\u2019t heard of a song, you can play it to them straight away, it\u2019s so easy nowadays. I don\u2019t care about the charts \u2013 the music is overplayed on the radio, there\u2019s nothing to it any more. It\u2019s all commercialised. I listen to some playlists, they\u2019re really good for moods \u2013 instead of being the top 20, it\u2019s about what you actually want to listen to.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nAlyssa Crabb, 17\n\nLikes: the Libertines, Fall Out Boy, Panic at the Disco\n\nWe have a record player in the house but it\u2019s downstairs and I wanted my own, so I got one for my birthday. A lot of my friends have them too \u2013 it\u2019s a thing in our generation for people who really like music. Obviously they\u2019re a bit more expensive so it\u2019s more of a commitment. My record player does MP3 so it goes straight to my laptop. Once you have the music that you listen to, those musicians say what bands they like, so you\u2019re always hearing about new stuff. If I wanted something new, then maybe the charts would be a place to go, but I\u2019m in a place where I have too much to listen to anyway.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nMurdo Hepburn, 17\n\nLikes: J Cole, Kendrick Lamar, Kings of Leon, Drake\n\nI wasn\u2019t a huge music fan a year ago but I\u2019ve got majorly into it now \u2013 I had very much a follower phase, but I stopped listening to music because my friends did and found my own groove. I really couldn\u2019t care less about the charts, but back then I definitely did! I\u2019d listen, ask my friends about the songs, and they\u2019d be like, \u201cYeah, that one\u2019s good.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t look anywhere else for new music \u2013 as opposed to now going on Spotify radio for hours on end. I respect all kinds of music but commit to one genre at a time. I\u2019ve started listening to loads of old Drake, which I never used to listen to when it was new. J Cole was the tipping point.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nDylan, 9, and Theo, 7\n\nLike: OneRepublic (Dylan), Iggy Azalea (Theo)\n\nDylan: I like music I can dance to. I like Counting Stars by OneRepublic. I don\u2019t know what the charts are. I am sort of interested in music.\n\nTheo: I like pop music. I like Fancy by Iggy Azalea, one of my friends showed it to me. It\u2019s a good song, it\u2019s really fun. I like the rapping bit best. I like to dance to it. I never see music on the television but sometimes hear it on the radio, whatever is on and most of the songs that are on the radio, I haven\u2019t heard of.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nCsepi Asztalos, 21\n\nLikes: Crystal Fighters, the Kooks\n\nI do listen to the charts! I\u2019ve just been in France for six months and I did listen to the charts as a refresher a bit towards the end. It probably made me feel closer to home, a bit of English music. But when I was away I would Shazam stuff if I heard something good on the radio \u2013 I discovered So Freakin\u2019 Tight by Tough Love. I mostly stream music on YouTube, I don\u2019t really buy it. Then out and about, I listen on Soundcloud, I\u2019ve got a playlist on that. I listened to the charts a bit more when I was a kid, though it never mattered to me where my favourite acts got to. It was just pop music.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nViola Asztalos, 24\n\nLikes: Bonobo, the Walkmen, the Strokes, AlunaGeorge\n\nWe play the radio at work so I listen to the top 40 then, but I\u2019m not that eager to know. I\u2019ve found some artists that I really like and I follow them, rather than what\u2019s top 10. But I loved Top of the Pops when I was a kid, I always wanted my favourites to be No 1 \u2013 when Black Eyed Peas made it with Where Is the Love?, I was loving that. Now I discover things through Spotify on my phone \u2013 I listen to my favourite bands on there, but there\u2019s also the related artists link, and I find new music through there, and friends.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nKit Bienias, 20\n\nLikes: The Wytches, Eagulls, Drenge\n\nI don\u2019t really follow the charts, but when Royal Blood got their album to No 1, that was quite interesting \u2013 it\u2019s been a long time since a rock band have got to No 1. Nowadays it\u2019s usually about all this shit pop music. Recently I\u2019ve got into Spotify, but I buy more vinyls. I\u2019m interested in the new vinyl chart \u2013 we should be all for reintroducing and pushing vinyl. I only started buying records about four, five years ago, but I\u2019m a bit of a collector. I picked up my dad\u2019s records and I use his record player \u2013 he\u2019s got a pretty rubbish modern one but it does the job.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nEmily Warne, 17\n\nLikes: Drenge, Arctic Monkeys, Foals\n\nI don\u2019t really care about the charts, I don\u2019t think there was a time when I ever did. I\u2019ve never been a pop fan. I listen through my headphones on the computer and through my iPod Classic. I buy music from iTunes \u2013 it\u2019s easier to buy it instead of streaming it, and it supports the bands. I don\u2019t think the charts matter \u2013 it\u2019s down to each individual person, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t think the charts affect people\u2019s tastes. Would I be bothered if Foals or Drenge headlined Glastonbury? I suppose it would be good but I\u2019m not that bothered.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nHolly Bootland, 17\n\nLikes: Nirvana, Drenge, Guns N\u2019Roses, Queens of the Stone Age\n\nMy dad used to listen to bands like GNR, so I started listening to them, and now I go on YouTube to find songs. Spotify recommends \u201cartists like this artist\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s how I discovered Drenge. I always buy CDs, I\u2019m addicted! I like to have it in physical form to listen to at home, rather than on my phone. I never pay attention to the albums or singles chart, I\u2019ve never been interested, never been a pop fan. None of my friends do either! When you get to a certain age you realise that kind of music isn\u2019t aimed at you \u2013 it\u2019s for quite young people. One Direction isn\u2019t really for people my age.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nSamir Chadah, 16\n\nLikes: the Cribs, Wolf Alice, Courtney Barnett, Modern Baseball, the Wombats\n\nI don\u2019t usually listen to the charts \u2013 sometimes the bands I like are in there, but I don\u2019t get my music from the charts. The vinyl chart sounds interesting \u2013 the music I like tends to be more on vinyl. There would be a lot less pop stuff on it. I have a Spotify subscription. I get some music on CDs but that\u2019s generally because it comes in a package with a gig ticket. Me and my friends tend to recommend bands to each other. A lot of it is a group thing \u2013 there are some people I know who like the same stuff, who I talk to about music.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nMarco Rodrigiuez, 16\n\nLikes: Royal Blood, Drenge, Red Hot Chili Peppers, AC/DC, James Brown\n\nThe charts don\u2019t make a difference to me \u2013 if it sounds good, that\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in. Though [looks hesitant] I did jump out of my seat when Royal Blood\u2019s album got to Number 1, because maybe now I\u2019ll get the opportunity to hear more bands, and it could mean I have some hope in playing music in the future and make a living out of it. I prefer actually physically having a copy of the music, so a record or a CD is ideal, it\u2019s better to have it in your hand. I listen to music on my phone out and about \u2013 I reckon I have about 1,000 songs on here.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nSolomon Pace, 16\n\nLikes: Royal Blood, Drenge, Led Zeppelin, MF Doom, Dangermouse, Radiohead\n\nI discover some older music through my guitar teacher, but mostly it\u2019s through YouTube. I\u2019ve got into genres, I click through the genre portals on Wikipedia and see what kind of stuff there is in there. Then I go on to YouTube and see what comes up. I don\u2019t really pay attention to the charts \u2013 they don\u2019t really represent what most people like. Well, what I like. I don\u2019t mind when my favourite bands become successful as long as nothing changes \u2013 or it only changes for the good. I sometimes buy music on iTunes\u2026 or I steal it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nJake Fox, 17\n\nLikes: Jacob Isaac, Ella Eyre, Pulp, the Verve, MNEK, Jacob Banks, Raye, Grace Parker\n\nI occasionally listen to the charts when I\u2019m with friends in the car. I am interested, but some music is disappointing at the moment \u2013 a lot of it is highly edited when it could be a lot more raw. Ella Eyre is an incredible artist with an incredible voice. I\u2019d prefer artists like that to go to No 1, though it doesn\u2019t really bother me. I\u2019m quite a casual music fan. But bring back TOTP ! They need to. That was a good way of hearing stuff. I used to watch it with the family.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer\n\nGeorgina Parker, 16\n\nLikes: Drenge, Arctic Monkeys\n\nI don\u2019t really care about the charts. I used to care when I was about 13, a bit younger, but I just don\u2019t like that kind of music any more. Bands I like don\u2019t really get in the charts. I buy music on iTunes because it supports the musicians better. I don\u2019t have Spotify or anything \u2013 it\u2019s expensive, to be honest.\n\nInterviews by Laura Snapes\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "The BBC is about to launch a new chart show, on children\u2019s channel CBBC.
