But currently, CVE programming fails to provide meaningful solutions that would substantively interdict barbaric acts.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA 2014 National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) document titled \u2018Countering Violent Extremism\u201d serves as food for thought. Its expert authors say CVE\u2019s ends are \u201cnot easy to quantify.\u201d This means return-on-investment metrics will be elusive.\n\nThe report authors then offer risk factors to help public service providers identify at-risk youth such as \u201cParent-Child Bonding, Empathic Connection,\u201d \u201cPresence of Emotional or Verbal Conflict in Family\u201d and \u201cParent Involvement in Child\u2019s Education.\u201d As these factors encompass issues with which most American families have struggled at some point, their use in identifying at-risk individuals is nearly non-existent.\n\nOn this subject, McCaul\u2019s proposal assigns the office to the task of \u201cidentifying risk factors that contribute to violent extremism.\u201d But such efforts at classification have already been attempted. In 2008, the UK\u2019s counter-intelligence and security agency, M15, concluded that \u201cit is not possible to draw up a typical profile of the \u2018British terrorist\u2019 as most are \u2018demographically unremarkable.\u2019\"\n\nSimilarly, in its 2010 report titled \u201cPreventing Violent Extremism,\u201d Britain\u2019s House of Commons\u2019 Communities and Local Government Committee said, \u201cRegarding the Government\u2019s analysis of the factors which lead people to become involved in violent extremism, we conclude that there has been a pre-occupation with the theological basis of radicalisation, when the evidence seems to indicate that politics, policy and socio-economics may be more important factors in the process.\u201d\n\nThis pre-occupation with religion raises another problem with expanding the scope of DHS programming. While the security field\u2019s current focus is on Daesh (ISIS), this has not and will not always be the case, and we join other security and civil liberties organizations in our concern that the program\u2019s scope may be expanded at-will in ways not envisioned by its current advocates.\n\nIn February, 2009 the Missouri Information Analysis Center (MIAC), a DHS \u201cfusion center,\u201d issued a report labeling common ideologies or affiliations as warning signs of being a \u201cright-wing extremist\u201d or member of a domestic paramilitary group.\n\nAccording to the MIAC report, any U.S. citizen could potentially be a domestic terrorist if they are in favor of \u201cstrong state rights,\u201d hold \u201canti-abortionist\u201d or \u201canti-Immigration\u201d views, are in strong opposition to \u201cthe collection of federal income taxes\u201d or \u201cthe Federal Reserve Banks,\u201d or support third-party presidential candidates like Ron Paul. The report also noted that \"It is not uncommon for militia members to display Constitutional Party, Campaign for Liberty or Libertarian material\" or the \u201cGadsden Flag.\u201d Setting the enormous costs of monitoring everyone who dislikes paying their taxes or votes for Ron Paul aside, such broad-swath categorizations of what might constitute subversive behavior risk criminalizing anyone who holds views with which the government disagrees, a chilling prospect.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting what has already happened on the ground in those areas in which CVE programming has been proposed; after all, CVE can only work if it is widely accepted as effective by the communities in which it would profess to build ties. Last year, former U.S. Attorney General Holder announced a CVE initiative, designating Los Angeles, Boston, and Minneapolis as pilot cities. While the program was supposed to target all forms of violent extremism, in practice only Muslims were actually examined.\n\nIn all three cities, local Muslim community leaders, who have longstanding records of supporting efforts to make our nation more secure, engaged in the U.S. attorney-led meetings aimed at shaping local CVE frameworks. In time, however, they distanced themselves from the project as they formed a deeper understanding of CVE\u2019s problematic realities.\n\nIn Los Angeles, both the Islamic Shura Council of Southern California, an umbrella organization of mosques and Muslim organizations serving the Muslims of Southern California, and the Muslim Student Association of the West Coast (MSA West) voted to oppose the narrow scope of the federal government's CVE program.\n\nIn Minnesota, nearly 50 Muslim organizations joined together to urge law enforcement to \u201cconsider our grave concerns\u201d and discontinue this stigmatizing, divisive, and ineffective initiative.\n\nA \u201ctop leader of Boston\u2019s Muslim community\u201d opted against the local framework because it targeted only American Muslims and was \u201cfounded on the premise that your faith determines your propensity towards violence.\u201d\n\nGiven that one of the goals of violent extremists is to transform our nation into their vision of an authoritarian state, Americans must be vigilant that the measures we fund to stop them do not ultimately themselves fulfill these aims. CVE, with its call for teachers, guidance counselors, public health workers, and police officers to assess a person\u2019s thoughts, rather than actions, to identify violent extremists, does not represent an effective solution for these very real threats.\n\nSaylor directs the department to monitor and combat Islamophobia at the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the nation\u2019s largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "CVE programming fails to provide meaningful solutions that would substantively interdict barbaric acts.", "description": "CVE programming fails to provide meaningful solutions that would substantively interdict barbaric acts.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "CVE programming fails to provide meaningful solutions that would substantively interdict barbaric acts.", "title": "Is countering violent extremism ready for a $40 million investment?", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/civil-rights/247908-is-countering-violent-extremism-ready-for-a-40-million", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/civil-rights/247908-is-countering-violent-extremism-ready-for-a-40-million", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-15T10:30-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Corey Saylor", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-15T10:30:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/civil-rights/247908-is-countering-violent-extremism-ready-for-a-40-million", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "CVE programming fails to provide meaningful solutions that would substantively interdict barbaric acts.", "card": "summary", "title": "Is countering violent extremism ready for a $40 million investment?"}, "dcterms.title": "Is countering violent extremism ready for a $40 million investment?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e90\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTA 2014 National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) document titled \u2018Countering Violent Extremism\u201d serves as food for thought.\nWhile the program was supposed to target all forms of violent extremism, in practice only Muslims were actually examined.\nHouse Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul\u2019s (R-Texas) proposed new Office for Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) in the Department of Homeland Security would redirect 40 million taxpayer dollars over four years into a dubious expansion of government programming.\nWe all want to prevent violent extremism.\nOn this subject, McCaul\u2019s proposal assigns the office to the task of \u201cidentifying risk factors that contribute to violent extremism.\u201d But such efforts at classification have already been attempted."}
