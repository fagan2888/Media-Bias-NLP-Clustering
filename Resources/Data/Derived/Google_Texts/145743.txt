On Tuesday, Jimmy Fallon pulled out secret weapon and early 2000s teen heartthrob Josh Hartnett to play a rousing game of charades with Charlize Theron and “Tonight Show” announcer Steve Higgins. It started off shaky — Theron seemed both unclear of the rules of the game and how to read — but the competition was stiff, resulting in a tie-breaker round. The highlights include Fallon’s lap dance (all for naught, as you’ll see), and Theron screaming, “Horseee … horrrrrssssse?” before guessing, “Oh! Horsssesss!”
