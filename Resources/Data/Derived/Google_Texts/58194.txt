The Coast Guard rescued a man from a grounded sailboat Friday night near Ocracoke Inlet.

Sector North Carolina was notified around 7:20 p.m. that a 30-foot sailboat was aground and taking on water.

Due to shallow water a lifeboat crew was unable to reach the man.

A helicopter from Air Station Elizabeth City arrived at the scene around 9:00 p.m. and hoisted the man aboard. Red Cross personnel were waiting for him at the Elizabeth City boat ramp. There were no injuries reported.

The sailboat has been removed.
