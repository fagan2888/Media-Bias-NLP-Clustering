One of them is being lectured by people like Frank Bruni at The New York Times about how I am oppressed by my Catholic faith. Funny, I never realized it.\n\nBruni\u2019s article, \u201cCatholicism Undervalues Women,\u201d has many of the \u201cstanding up to the patriarchy\u201d tropes anyone would expect, with some surprises and glaring factual errors along the way. He begins by wryly mentioning Pope Francis\u2019 statement about equal pay for women wherein, Bruni says, the pope \u201cfashioned himself a feminist.\u201d Bruni laughs at this, assuring his enlightened readers that they \u201care not reading The Onion.\u201d He then goes into the expected diatribe about how inconsistent this is with the church that has oppressed women for centuries.\n\nWomen Care about Freedom of Conscience While taking some time to mention the church\u2019s good works and how awesome Pope Francis is for changing the \u201ctone\u201d on marriage, Bruni jumps in with some stuff about reproductive choices.\n\nFor women to get a fair shake in the work force, they need at least some measure of reproductive freedom. But Catholic bishops in the United States lobbied strenuously against the Obamacare requirement that employers such as religiously affiliated schools and hospitals include contraception in workers\u2019 health insurance.\n\nSo what this amounts to\u2014if I understand this correctly\u2014is that the church hurts women by not personally paying for their birth control. To my knowledge, the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops\u2019 lobbying against the Obamacare mandate to require employers to provide abortifacients and other forms of birth control was more about religious freedom and conscience rights than about making absolutely sure no one has birth control.\n\nThe issue here is not why Catholics do not believe in contraception but the mere fact that they do believe it and shouldn\u2019t be coerced by the government to buy yours. In fact, the church\u2019s teaching on contraception has a lot to do with making sure women are treated as equals and not objects. But what do I know? I am just a cog in the machine of my own oppression.\n\nGender Identity Is Not the Same as Equality Then, as expected, we get the old the-Church-is-mean-because-women-can\u2019t-be-priests argument:\n\nMen but not women get to preside at Mass. Men but never women wear the cassock of a cardinal, the vestments of a pope. Male clergy are typically called \u201cfather,\u201d which connotes authority. Women in religious orders are usually called \u201csister,\u201d which doesn\u2019t.\n\nNow at this point I could go deep into Catholic theology and explain just why the Catholic tradition calls only men to enter the priesthood. I could, but I figure it will be lost on the \u201cnot my boss\u2019s business\u201d crowd. But what I can say is that this is a part of an error we see all the time when dealing with gender\u2014mistaking identity for equality.\n\nBeing equal does not mean being the same in every respect possible. Many on the Left\u2014especially second-wave feminists\u2014think that to be equal to men, women basically need to be identical to men. Not only is this untrue, it\u2019s simply impractical. I can\u2019t help but to roll my eyes whenever I hear a report lamenting the lack of woman coal miners or construction workers or the like. What did you expect? Women, always and for the most part, are not physically equipped for such jobs and\u2014if I can say it without getting into a shouting match with feminists\u2014nor do we even want such jobs. Maybe there are a couple of great women coal miners out there, but they are the exception, not the rule.\n\nBeing equal does not mean being the same in every respect possible. Wouldn\u2019t you think that the Left\u2019s champions of diversity would understand that? For example, take what Bruni said in the excerpt above. First, the male equivalents of Catholic nuns (\u201csisters\u201d) are actually \u201cbrothers\u201d\u2014Catholic monks and friars. Nuns typically report to a \u201cmother,\u201d an authoritative title, who is in charge of their community (someone please get this guy a copy of \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d). They are different, but they each have something of equal value to add to the church.\n\nMaking Women Into Men Isn\u2019t Equality The priesthood may only be open to men, but this certainly is not the only role of value within Catholicism. The Catholic church would not run if it weren\u2019t for the mothers, sisters, and teachers who contribute their time and effort in a vast multitude of capacities. And just because these women do not wear vestments or hear confessions in no way means their contributions aren\u2019t just as vital and important. Bruni even mentions the increase in female employment at the Vatican:\n\nAnd the trend line in the Vatican and in Vatican City government is apparently toward a greater number of female employees, though in 2014, according to The Associated Press, they held less than 20 percent of the jobs. That needn\u2019t be the case, even factoring in women\u2019s exclusion from the priesthood.\n\nI guess, like coal miners, true gender equality won\u2019t come until exactly 50 percent of priests are women. The millions of Catholic women teachers, mothers, nurses, or lectors don\u2019t matter\u2014there have to be women priests in order for women to be seen as equal in the church.\n\nHere is the ultimately anti-feminist feminist conundrum we\u2019ve been facing for quite some time. Women\u2019s roles\u2014like mothering among many other things\u2014are seen as inferior. Instead of seeing feminine and masculine roles as equally important to society, we\u2019ve pushed women into men\u2019s roles and called it equality.\n\nBut what kind of message does this send? It says to women, like me, that to obtain equal value we must become something different from what we fundamentally are. In order for me to be successful, I need to shed all my silly, useless feminine qualities and become a man.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 12 May 2015 06:20:33 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Lecturing women about our values and religion disrespects us.
