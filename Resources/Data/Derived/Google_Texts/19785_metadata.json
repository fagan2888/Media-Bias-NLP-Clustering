With three dives left in the finals, English needed to score a 300 or better to meet the state cut.\n\nA season's worth of hard work and tweaking each dive to as close to perfection as possible rested on the final day. She cruised in with a 337.85 to her first state event, but wasn't always sure if she'd really done it.\n\n\"I'm really excited and surprised,\" English said. \"I just had a couple rough dives that I should have scored higher on and so I didn't know if I'd make the cut. (It means) a lot, especially being a junior. I'm really excited.\"\n\nEnglish became the newest Indian to qualify for state, one of 11, and helped her team to a fourth place finish in the conference with 436.5 points.\n\nThe journey to state for English has been so close all year long, but mistakes early in the season kept her just short. That was up until the last two weeks, when her coach, Elyse Jackl, started to see significant improvement.\n\n\"It's awesome, it's amazing. She's been able to make state all season, but we just had off meets and just didn't click,\" Jackl said. \"But it's been clicking the last two weeks, so this was amazing to see it come to result. She didn't hold back and just went for it.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the swimming side of things, Loveland had to make quick adjustments as two key swimmers, Brooke Hansen and Ashlyn Brent, missed the final round due to illness. It left the Indians short for the 200-yard freestyle relay (it was scratched), but LHS coach Krista Jones thought the team responded to their absence.\n\n\"Things come up and you have obstacles, but we just do what we can with who is here and who has fought and trained hard to be here,\" she said. \"You can't think about those swimmers who weren't here and the what ifs because it's not about the what ifs. It's about what we did.\"\n\nThe Indians started strong in the 200 medley relay taking a second-place finish in 1:53.38, while senior Brenda Rhodes took fourth in the 200 free (2:02.11) and junior Kelly Hatanaka third in the 200 individual medley (2:09.06). It was the first of two third-place finishes for Hatanaka along with the 100 breaststroke (1:07.45), the highest individual place of any Indian on the day.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm happy because I'm right around my best times, so it was good,\" she said. \"I liked that I beat my best time from yesterday and I got best times from this meet. I think (conference) helped us prepare for state.\"\n\nRhodes would take another fourth in the 500 freestyle (5:25.97) and Naomi Einhellig finished fourth in the 100-yard butterfly (59.58) and 100 backstroke (1:00.20). Hatanaka, Rhodes and Einhellig also each swam the medley and 400 freestyle relays.\n\nSenior Heidi Waite just missed out on becoming the 12th Indian to qualify for state in the 50 and 100 freestyle. Sophomore Kelsi Modlich knocked off an additional two seconds from her prelim time in the 100 breaststroke, finishing sixth with a 1:10.98.\n\n\"I thought today went really well. I told them all 'today is about racing and scoring points for the team' and obviously we want everyone to get their best times,\" Jones said. \"Every swim made a difference today. We're not biggest team here, but they fought for their places and they fought for that fourth place.\"\n\nCris Tiller can be reached at 669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or on Twitter @cristiller and @RHpreps.\n\nFRONT RANGE LEAGUE\n\nCHAMPIONSHIPS\n\nAt Mountain View Aquatics Center\n\nTeam scores -- Fossil Ridge 924.5; Fairview 609; Monarch 475.5; Loveland 436.5; Mountain Range 412.5; Boulder 340; Legacy 336; Fort Collins 310; Rocky Mountain 269; Poudre 175; Horizon 157; Greeley West 141.\n\n200 medley relay -- 1.
