It\u2019s an impressive feat considering a recent CMS report found 2,610 hospitals owe $428 million in penalties for readmissions from acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, pneumonia and other diseases.\n\n\u201cBy far the most important factor in reducing readmissions is the safety and wellbeing of our patients. This is paramount and why we\u2019ve been on the path to reducing readmissions for more than a decade,\u201d said DHMC chief financial officer Robin Kilfeather-Mackey, who attributes her hospital\u2019s readmission rate to its sustainable health system practices.\n\nTIP: In order to make the value-based model work, hospitals must aspire to provide the highest quality in care.\n\nKilfeather-Mackey said moving away from fee-for-service payment models towards value-based payment models helps the hospital emphasize value of care over volume, which reduces readmissions. \u201cIn fact our payer mix has shifted from 20 percent to 40 percent value-based over the last three years,\u201d Kilfeather-Mackey said. \u201cThis is the third year in a row we\u2019ve had this distinction.\u201d\n\nIn order to make the value-based model work, the executive said hospitals must aspire to provide the highest quality in care.\n\nReducing readmission penalties is key to receiving full federal patient reimbursements under Section 3025 of the Affordable Care Act passed in 2012. Hospitals that risked losing 1 percent of federal payments in 2013 could lose 2 percent in 2014 and 3 percent in 2015 for patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge.\n\nDarlene Saler, administrative director of patient flow at Dartmouth-Hitchcock, said readmission reduction requires focusing on everyone from patients to caregivers. \u201cDoing follow up phone calls at discharge will help, but it needs to be combined with education, support services and provider appointments within seven days of discharge.\u201d\n\nAccording to Saler, DHMC has one of the lowest readmission rates in the country. \u201cWe have a strong care management program that, since 2000, has focused not only on transition care for patients leaving the hospital, but on patients with complex care needs who are followed in our primary care sections and specialty clinics,\u201d she said.\n\nEvery dollar spent on post-discharge care transition yields $1.09 according to a 2012 article, \u201cAn Effectiveness and Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Hospital-Based Transition Program for Elderly Medicare Recipients,\u201d in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. \u201cPost discharge care transition programs have a dual benefit of enhancing elderly adults\u2019 self-management skills and abilities and product cost savings,\u201d it states.\n\nKilfeather-Mackey said hospital financial leaders need to trust their clinical teams and make sure they have the resources they need to succeed. \u201cMake quality and value a priority at the highest level of the organization and maintain a focus on continual improvement,\u201d she said.\n\nSaler said financial leaders should also help clinical staff identify opportunities for improvement that require increased resources. \u201cThey would help us look at the return on investment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/dartmouth-hitchcocks-zero-readmission-strategy-focus-value", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/DHentraceFeature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The CFO of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, says the move towards value-based payment models helps the hospital emphasize value of care over volume, which reduces readmissions.", "title": "Dartmouth-Hitchcock\u2019s zero-readmission strategy: Focus on value"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/DHentraceFeature.gif"}, "description": "The CFO of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, says the move towards value-based payment models helps the hospital emphasize value of care over volume, which reduces readmissions.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Dartmouth-Hitchcock\u2019s zero-readmission strategy: Focus on value"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire is one of only four hospitals in the state to avoid readmission penalties from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
