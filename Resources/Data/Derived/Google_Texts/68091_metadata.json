The president is scheduled to attend a Democratic National Committee fundraiser at the Pacific Palisades home of television producer Chuck Lorre Thursday afternoon, then head across town for another fundraiser at Tyler Perry\u2019s Beverly Hills home.\n\nAccording to Deadline, the president will make a Friday morning pit stop at the Highland Park garage where Maron records his popular podcast before flying to San Francisco in the afternoon for more fundraisers. Maron will conduct a one-hour interview with Obama, the topic of which has not been disclosed.\n\n\u201cOh my god, I hope my bathroom\u2019s clean,\u201d Maron joked about meeting the president. \u201cWe let the neighbors know. My producer has been at the house dealing with secret service. My street is going to be incredibly safe for the next few days.\u201d\n\nMaron\u2019s \u201cWTF\u201d is one of the most popular podcasts on the Internet, having reportedly been downloaded more than 100 million times since its start in 2009.\n\nObama could be using Maron\u2019s podcast to speak about an important issue (Obamatrade?) with a younger demographic, similar to what he did last year when he appeared on \u201cBetween Two Ferns with Zach Galifianakis\u201d on online comedy site Funny or Die.
