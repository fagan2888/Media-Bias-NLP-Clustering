The Emergency Services Dive Team in Pueblo County did some ice rescue training Sunday morning at Lake Isabel.

If you saw these guys, don't worry, there was no emergency.

The sheriff's office is reminding people that as the weather warms, it's not safe to go on the ice.

Check out the slide show above to see some of the dive team's training.
