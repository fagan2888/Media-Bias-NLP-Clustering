Louisiana's shot at having the federal government pick up the full tab beyond 2017 for its expansion of the Medicaid program now rests with Congress.

But Republican animosity toward the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, doesn't bode well for its chances of going anywhere.

Shortly after Gov. John Bel Edwards ordered Medicaid be expanded in Louisiana, President Barack Obama proposed that any state willing to jump on board should enjoy the same benefits as those states that expanded Medicaid in 2014: Three years of the federal government fully covering the program's reimbursement costs for that new group of eligible patients.

But current law states that the 100-percent federal match expires in 2017 regardless of when a state expands the program. Afterward, states will have to pick up 5 percent of the tab, a sum that will jump to 10 percent in 2020.

U.S. Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-New Orleans, introduced Obama's offer as a bill last week that was promptly sent to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Republicans, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Jefferson, have called the proposal dead in the water, given their misgivings about Obamacare and the Medicaid program in general.

Under the terms of Medicaid expansion, families with household incomes up to 138 percent of the national poverty rate could qualify. That's an annual salary of $33,465 for a family of four.
