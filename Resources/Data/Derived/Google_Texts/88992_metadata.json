The euphoric feeling of being face-to-face with a lover, for instance, leaning in as your two lips come together, knees weak and hands shaking, like having your first kiss again, can boost your self-esteem and confidence. Receiving a kiss, be it on the cheek or lips, can actually reap legitimate benefits for your health.\n\n\u201cKissing has a wonderful duality in that is can be both romantic and erotic or familial and friendly,\u201d said Andr\u00e9a Demirjian, The Kissing Expert, and author of Kissing, to Medical Daily in an email. \u201cA kiss on the cheek tells someone they are favored and adored; a kiss on the lips signals a sexy intent; and honestly, once the lips are touched, with all the nerve endings there, signals are immediately fired to the brain to start the 'launch sequence' so to speak.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time to pucker up your lips and start smooching your way to good health. Here are four reasons why:\n\n1. Burn Calories\n\nKissing someone passionately on the lips can actually burn approximately 68 calories per hour. Smooching is not only a great way to show affection but also helps you burn fat. \u201cIf the kissing is vigorous and involves some petting, it could be even closer to 90 calories burned in an hour,\u2019 said Jaiya Kinzbach, a Los Angeles\u2013based sexologist and the author of Red Hot Touch, to Woman\u2019s Day. While kissing may not replace a 45-minute workout, it can help you burn off a handful of chips or crackers with just exchanging saliva for an hour.\n\n2. Reduces Stress\n\nMany of us will experience a feeling of euphoria, or a \u201ckissing high,\u201d when we touch lips with our significant other. This is attributed to the release of the happy, \u201cfeel good\u201d chemicals \u2014 dopamine and serotonin \u2014 said Demirjian, which relaxes us. When people end a relationship, they experience a drop in these chemicals which gives off the feeling our heart is \u201cbroken,\u201d but in actuality, we are going through a chemical withdrawal from the drug. Demirjian believes \u201cwith the right person where things click, kissing can be downright intoxicating and addictive!\u201c\n\n3. Relieves Headaches and Cramps\n\nForget the painkillers, kissing can naturally alleviate headaches and cramps by just dilating our blood vessels. Our brain fires off adrenaline that sends more blood to the \u201cnether regions\u201d for arousal before intercourse, therefore not constricting the blood vessels. Demirjian suggests women not to push their sweetheart away when they are not feeling tip-top. \u201cThey can help you feel infinitely better than over the counter pain relievers, and it\u2019s fun too,\u201d she said.\n\n4. Boosts Immunity\n\nWomen can benefit from just a kiss on the lips. Scientists believe kissing was developed to spread germs which build up immunity to illness. A 2009 study published in the journal Medical Hypotheses found it boosts the immune system of a woman, particular from cytomegalovirus \u2014 a virus, if contracted during pregnancy, which can cause birth defects and blindness to an infant. Kissing is a very natural way to build immunities, as it causes our bodies to produce antibodies. \u201cA kiss a day keeps the doctor away,\u201d Demirjian said.\n\nPucker up, and find that special someone to kiss your way to good health.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kiss me, just a kiss, good health, burn calories, reduce stress, relives headaches and cramps, boosts immunity", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "It\u2019s time to pucker up and kiss someone to reap its juicy benefits \u2014 from burning calories to boosting your immunity.", "title": "Kiss Me, Baby \u2014 4 Reasons To Kiss Your Way To Good Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kiss-me-4-reasons-kiss-your-way-good-health-290972", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/01/man-and-woman-kiss-beach.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s time to pucker up and kiss someone to reap its juicy benefits \u2014 from burning calories to boosting your immunity.", "title": "Kiss Me, Baby \u2014 4 Reasons To Kiss Your Way To Good Health", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/kiss-me-4-reasons-kiss-your-way-good-health-290972", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/01/man-and-woman-kiss-beach.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/01/man-and-woman-kiss-beach.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-02T09:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-02T09:54:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "It\u2019s time to pucker up and kiss someone to reap its juicy benefits \u2014 from burning calories to boosting your immunity."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0dd\"", "article_summary": "Pucker up, and find that special someone to kiss your way to good health.\nReceiving a kiss, be it on the cheek or lips, can actually reap legitimate benefits for your health.\nThis is attributed to the release of the happy, \u201cfeel good\u201d chemicals \u2014 dopamine and serotonin \u2014 said Demirjian, which relaxes us.\nKissing is a very natural way to build immunities, as it causes our bodies to produce antibodies.\n\u201cA kiss a day keeps the doctor away,\u201d Demirjian said."}
