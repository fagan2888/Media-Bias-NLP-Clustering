A Confederate Memorial Service was held in Marion Sunday afternoon.

It took place at the Marion Confederate States Cemetery on confederate drive. Many people came in support of the soldiers who fought so many years ago for what they believed was right. The service included a special guest speaker, singing and a musket salute. The Sons of Confederate Veterans organize this event each year.

"What we're doing is coming out here today to pay homage and respect and to give them all the respect they deserve and that's what we're about," Historian Chief of Sons of Confederate Veterans Chuck Bond says.

The month of April is Confederate Heritage Month with several other memorial ceremonies planned throughout the month.
