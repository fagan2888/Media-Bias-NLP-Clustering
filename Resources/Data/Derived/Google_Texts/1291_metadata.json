I have established relationships with the entities that will ultimately determine how RESTORE and other BP funds are spent, including the Board of County Commissioners, the Escambia County Restore Advisory Committee, and the Restore Act Consultants for Escambia County (Dewberry, Inc.\n\nIssue No. 2. The use of Local Option Sales Tax (LOST) funds. I have held town hall meetings to obtain public input on the future use of LOST funds. I have worked to have the city re-focus its use of LOST funds to address storm water and infrastructure needs and to leverage funds for capital improvement projects with RESTORE funds and other sources of federal and state funding. Advocacy for a community center the north end of the city by leveraging city and county LOST funds.\n\nIssue No. 3. Promotion of Uptown Pensacola located in District 2 as the county\u2019s most important commercial core with thousands of businesses, a major mall, Sacred Heart Health Systems, major hotels, Pensacola State College, Pensacola International Airport an expanding aerospace industry and nice affordable neighborhoods.\n\nWhy voters should elect you on Nov. 4?\n\nAttendance: I have a 100% attendance record of all city council meetings.\n\nResponsiveness to the citizens: I am a champion of the peoples\u2019 right to redress their concerns to the government without intimidation or reprisal. I respond promptly to citizens\u2019 request for assistance on any issue.\n\nKnowledge of city government: I am experienced in the workings of the City Charter, City Ordinances, the city budget process, Florida laws governing municipalities and Community Redevelopment Agencies and issues facing the Community Maritime Park Associates.\n\nRelationships: I have many beneficial relationships with officials and agencies at the county, state and federal levels. Because District 2 in the city is bifurcated with the county cutting a swath through the district, and because we have many major state and county roads in District 2, it is imperative to have a good working relationship with county and state officials to address sidewalk, road resurfacing and drainage projects that impact neighborhoods and our core business community.\n\nWhat is the top challenge facing Northwest Florida? What is your solution to that challenge?\n\nEconomic Development is the top challenge.\n\na. A regional roadmap to address environmental issues, sustainable development, workforce readiness and job creation, improved and creative educational and job training programs, tourism development and transportation infrastructure.\n\nb. Working regionally and collaboratively with the other northwest Florida counties to collectively leverage BP funds with other state and federal funds to address in a systematic manner the issues set forth in a regional roadmap.\n\nSpecifically, what project would you like to see come from RESTORE money from the BP oil spill?\n\nMassive public works project to address storm water and drainage infrastructure needs of the city and county.\n\nDennis Tackett\n\nPensacola City Council, District 2\n\nDescribe the platform/mission statement of your campaign.\n\nOver the last four years, District 2 has not received its fair share of benefits. We\u2019ve complained of being ignored by our Councilperson and we haven\u2019t seen results. I\u2019m ready to work with my colleagues at City Hall to insure District 2 receives the attention it deserves. My goal is to restore civility and productivity to the City Council and to build consensus rather than conflict.\n\nWhat are the top three issues in the community that could be directly impacted by your position?\n\nThe creation of more high paying jobs, better infrastructure and equality of education are key issues I will address for us as a City Councilperson. In order to attract employers and employees for more and higher-wage jobs, we have to have a sound infrastructure. Currently storm water drainage and old gas lines are a major problem. Prospective employers need to be assured their work environments will be safe and can operate without interruption. Also, we need improved education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, allowing us to produce and retain our local talent. All of this requires cooperation and consensus among city officials.\n\nWhy should voters elect you on Nov. 4?\n\nFirst and foremost, I care deeply about every citizen and business of District 2. I have 35 years of strong and successful business experience. As a 24-year family law attorney, church pastor, licensed mediator and father of five, I have vast experience and knowledge of conflict resolution and moving disagreement toward consensus. I\u2019ve served as Neighborhood Association President of two neighborhoods, and I understand that our leaders must work together to deliver results to District 2. My reputation in Pensacola is for honesty, sincerity, humility and very hard work. I\u2019ll meet with constituents regularly, hold business summits, and make certain to follow up with each need. Decisions will always be made after thorough research and listening respectfully to every opinion. I stand for results, not roadblocks. I stand for respectful representation and consensus over conflict. I stand for restored dignity to District 2. My actions speak louder than my words; I have pledged the first year\u2019s salary to the Pensacola Police Department to help improve safety in our community.\n\nWhat is top challenge facing Northwest Florida? What is your solution to that challenge?\n\nWe\u2019ve failed to capitalize on the great assets that we have in District 2 and across Northwest Florida. We have natural resources, amenities abound, and the city is moving in the right direction, but we suffer from a lack of trust between constituents and local government and from conflict among our representatives. Let\u2019s stop the negativity, and focus on improving of quality of life, attracting businesses, ensuring better, equal education and safer, improved neighborhoods. Together, let\u2019s focus on achieving consensus over conflict.\n\nSpecifically, what project would you like to see come from RESTORE money from the BP oil spill?\n\nLet\u2019s spend our RESTORE funds on the things that matter most: restoration of our beaches and ecosystem, storm water infrastructure, and water quality improvement.\n\nBrian Spencer\n\nPensacola City Council, District 6\n\nDescribe the platform/mission statement of your campaign.\n\nMoving Pensacola forward, with vision, with action and with the involvement of the community. My mission is to help Pensacola earn the reputation as a vibrant city with the highest quality of life. Better places make better lives. I am committed to developing strategies that will ensure Pensacola is a magnet for talent. We must capitalize on our many resources and natural beauty. I am committed to making lives better for every resident in every neighborhood, as well as every business owner, employer, and employee in District 6.\n\nWhat are the top three issues in the community that could be directly impacted by your position?\n\nNo. 1: Employment opportunities: Increase by providing adequate workforce training.\n\nNo. 2: Neighborhood safety: Increase lighting and improve sidewalks to promote walkability.\n\nNo. 3: Expand housing opportunities: Create economic incentives to restore abandoned structures, infill vacant properties, and construct high density rental options for various income levels.\n\nWhy should voters elect you on Nov. 4?\n\nPensacola has finally reversed its population decline within the city's boundaries. Pensacola is growing. More people are investing and more businesses are expanding.\n\nI believe this trend will continue through my strong advocacy for a more attractive, well designed, safe, and walkable city. My education in architecture and urban planning, combined with experienced leadership, will continue to contribute to the protection and enhancement of the district's diversity, authentic neighborhoods and cultures, as well as the preservation of historically significant districts. I started my professional business in District 6 more than 25 years ago and sustained it through the most recent economic downturn by making some very difficult but smart decisions. As an elected official, I have drawn upon my business skills and made tough decisions to reform city pensions in order to stop unsustainable debt and liabilities in order to save taxpayers' money.\n\nWhat is the top challenge facing Northwest Florida? What is your solution to that challenge?\n\nThe challenge of workforce development and training must be addressed to ensure our workers of today and tomorrow will have the skills for Pensacola to compete with growing, higher wage paying companies. We cannot focus on a single business sector to build this workforce but must partner with our business leaders and education partners to build the variety of skills that are needed for the locally emerging industries in robotics, aerospace, and Gulf exploration services.\n\nSpecifically, what project would you like to see come from RESTORE money from the BP oil spill?\n\nI would like to see a portion of the RESTORE money address stormwater and flooding issues within District 6. It is appropriate to identify this as an environmental and economic restoration project. There are abundant opportunities to reverse conventional stormwater management practices of the past and implement design and engineering solutions that could make District 6 and Pensacola more flood-proof, sustainable, resilient, and attractive from both urban design and economic perspectives. An example of this strategy is the reduction of impermeable surface areas at roadways and large parking areas. This is accomplished by incorporating permeable, planting areas (bioswales) that utilize existing natural drainage patterns. I have schematically designed a planning and stormwater solution based on this strategy for a 16-block segment of the N. Palafox corridor. I envision this being replicated throughout the city as well as the county.\n\nMark Taylor\n\nPensacola City Council, District 6\n\nDescribe the platform/mission statement of your campaign.\n\nA Strong Voice For YOU and Integrity Over Insider Politics. More at www.VoteMarkTaylor.com and www.LampPost43.com.\n\nWhat are the top three issues in the community that could be directly impacted by your position?\n\na) Public Safety. Our firefighters are only equipped to provide Basic Life Support (BLS). If your loved one needs Advanced Life Support (ALS) they will have to wait for Escambia County EMS. We need to equip our Fire Department with ALS. I will also budget to rebuild damaged Fire station 3, equip police with dependable radios, add police substations where needed, and re-add the third firefighter at the airport.\n\nb) No. 2 is infrastructure. It is time to focus on rebuilding our core infrastructure. Our storm water systems, gas lines, streets, and sidewalks must be a top priority. I will fight to use LOST and RESTORE funds for these projects.\n\nc) Community input and consensus is critical. My opponent has had two large projects that he pushed in the past four years \u2013 demanding the Cobra Helicopter be removed from Veterans Memorial Park in exchange for his support of the Marine Tower/Bell and opening up Government Street to 9th Avenue. Both projects failed because he didn\u2019t build consensus. I will hold bi-weekly community coffees to meet with constituents so that together we can make these important decisions.\n\nWhy should voters elect you on Nov. 4?\n\nMy parents raised me to put God first, others second, and myself last. I have spent my life serving this community and in over 30 countries, in addition to being a small business owner. Locally I have led the efforts to replace 105 free roofs and built over 40 free wheel chair ramps for our areas disabled. At Christmas I help sponsor several hundred children being raised by their grandparents. I will take that same mentality of service and \u201cothers before self\u201d to city council and I will vote for what is best for all of our neighborhoods.\n\nThe city of Pensacola Police & Fire Unions have voted to endorse my candidacy as well as the Pensacola Port Users Association. I hope you will too.\n\nWhat is the top challenge facing Northwest Florida? What is your solution to that challenge?\n\nEconomic diversity is needed to create a strong economy. Military and tourism are great for our community, but we must foster other industries. The Port of Pensacola and VT Aerospace are great examples of businesses that will provide good paying jobs for all our sons and daughters \u2013 both college and trade school educated.\n\nSpecifically, what project would you like to see come from RESTORE money from the BP oil spill?\n\nRESTORE is for economic, environmental, and fish estuary restoration. A project I have been pushing for years that meets all three of those goals is to relocate the railroad track off of our bay and instead connect along the I-10 corridor. The north/south track would still exist from the Port, industrial tenants, and the CSX yard back up to approx Burgess Road to tie into the new track. This would open up 8 miles of waterfront, reduce train noise and pollution, allow us to open up the mouth of Bayou Texar so that it can flush properly, reduce public safety issues at railroad crossings, allow a rail to trails project along the waterfront, and spur on economic opportunity where old tracks once existed.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1wsCCuK", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Five questions with Sherri Myers, Dennis Tackett, Brian Spencer and Mark Taylor.", "og": {"site_name": "Pensacola News Journal", "description": "Five questions with Sherri Myers, Dennis Tackett, Brian Spencer and Mark Taylor.", "title": "5 questions with Pensacola City Council candidates", "url": "http://www.pnj.com/story/news/2014/10/26/questions-pensacola-city-council-candidates/17895369/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/pnj.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Five questions with Sherri Myers, Dennis Tackett, Brian Spencer and Mark Taylor.", "creator": "@", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/pnj.png", "title": "5 questions with Pensacola City Council candidates", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=816200923", "fb": {"app_id": 179056438789435}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "The city of Pensacola Police & Fire Unions have voted to endorse my candidacy as well as the Pensacola Port Users Association.\nAdvocacy for a community center the north end of the city by leveraging city and county LOST funds.\nKnowledge of city government: I am experienced in the workings of the City Charter, City Ordinances, the city budget process, Florida laws governing municipalities and Community Redevelopment Agencies and issues facing the Community Maritime Park Associates.\nMy goal is to restore civility and productivity to the City Council and to build consensus rather than conflict.\nDennis TackettPensacola City Council, District 2Describe the platform/mission statement of your campaign."}
