While this type of conversation may seem commonplace at any college setting, the group is anything but ordinary.\n\nThese particular students have come from countries all over the globe and are meeting to improve their English.\n\nFunded by a state grant, the KPC Learning Center has been offering free English as a Second Language classes for more than 20 years. The classes, held on Wednesdays and Thursdays, range in level and are tailored to fit each student\u2019s needs. Available classes include grammar, conversation, reading and even US citizenship preparation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really student driven, for the most part,\u201d said Diane Taylor, Director of the KPC Learning Center. \u201cWhat students come in here to work on is really varied. It\u2019s not a cookie cutter sort of approach. It\u2019s really as individual as the people themselves.\u201d\n\nWhile classes are held at KPC, people don\u2019t have to be university students to attend. The students represent countries spanning the globe, including Russia, Germany, Cameroon and numerous others.\n\n\u201cThis is for anybody that comes here, whether they are a tourist, an immigrant, or a foreign student that wants to improve their English,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nMoving to a new country is challenging, Taylor said, but with hard work, people can be successful in the United States.\n\n\u201cMany students come from a rewarding background in their home country, and when they come here they start from scratch,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people who have started from scratch go on to do amazing things and really reach their goal.\u201d\n\nTo help students reach their goals, the Learning Center employs some language instructors and it also relies heavily on volunteers. Because the Learning Center doesn\u2019t heavily advertise the ESL classes, Taylor gives the instructors a lot of credit for spreading the word.\n\n\u201cThey are like little ambassadors for the program,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nKathy Christopherson, who has been an ESL instructor at the Learning Center for three years, said teaching and helping the students is a rewarding experience. Aside from lessons, Christopherson helps run events such as potlucks during the holiday seasons, which serve to teach students about American culture.\n\n\u201cWe try to show the students what the celebrations are like in the US, so they become familiar with the (holidays) and they know what\u2019s happening,\u201d Christopherson said.\n\nThe reaction to the ESL classes has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nLena Phillips found the classes immediately after moving to Alaska from Russia. She said that she enjoys the lessons that help her read and understand newspapers, because she finds the stories and the vocabulary interesting.\n\nChristoph Sebastian Barmetler, an exchange student from Germany, attends the English conversation class. He said it gives him a chance to learn about different cultures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to come to the ESL class, because I meet other people who weren\u2019t born and raised here,\u201d Barmetler said. \u201cIt helps me talk to other people. It\u2019s nice to hear about other countries.\u201d\n\nGuangyuan Ding, from China, has been attending classes for several months. Ding said that speaking English used to be intimidating, but the teachers have made her more confident.\n\n\u201c(The teachers) are great. I really love them,\u201d Ding said. \u201cWe are foreigners and they really help us a lot. They encourage us all the time.\u201d\n\nNot only have the classes made students more confident, they have also allowed them to better understand their community.\n\n\u201cWe have more information about the real culture (that we\u2019re living in), which is great,\u201d Ding said.\n\nRecently, KPC was approved to accept international degree seeking students, which, along with the students from ESL classes, will only increase the college\u2019s atmosphere, Taylor said.\n\n\u201c(The foreign students) diversify our community and our campus.\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThey give us the opportunity to have a more global perspective on the world outside of Soldotna.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about ESL classes, call the KPC Learning Center at 262-0327.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: The author\u2019s wife is currently attending the free ESL classes at Kenai Peninsula College.\n\nReach Ian Foley at Ian.foley@peninsulaclarion.com", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Peninsula, Clarion, Kenai, Soldotna, Homer, Kasilof, Nikiski, Sterling, Anchor, Point, Seward, Seldovia, Newspaper, News, Weather, Sports, Obituaries, Real Estate, Jobs, Classifieds, Cars, Homes, Fishing, Outdoors, IAN FOLEY", "og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Clarion", "description": "At a large table in the corner of the Kenai Peninsula College's Learning Center, nearly a dozen people sit and discuss what they did over the Thanksgiving holiday.", "title": "20-year-old KPC program provides free language help to ESL students", "url": "http://peninsulaclarion.com/news/2014-12-13", "image": "http://peninsulaclarion.com/sites/default/files/13967658.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "At a large table in the corner of the Kenai Peninsula College\u2019s Learning Center, nearly a dozen people sit and discuss what they did over the Thanksgiving holiday.
