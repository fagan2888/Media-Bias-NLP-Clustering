Bill Maher schooled Republicans on their foreign policy failures while delivering a lesson on President Obama’s successes.

Video:

Maher did part of the segment in the style of Romper Room’s Do Bee/Don’t Bee:

Romper Room went off in 1994, which is a shame because Misters Do Bee and Don’t Bee would have been perfect to help us illustrate our national Do This, Not That Day.

For example, after an attack on America, Mr. Don’t Bee panics and invades the wrong country. Mr. Do Bee focuses on the real attacker and shoots him in the face.

Mr. Don’t Bee makes up stories about nukes in Iraq that don’t exist.

Mr. Do Bee makes a treaty with Iran, so that they don’t build nukes at all.

Mr. Don’t Bee tortures prisoners.

Mr. Do Bee says that sounds bad.

Mr. Don’t Bee gets his actionable intel from Jesus.

Mr. Do Bee gets his from tapping your phone.

Mr. Do Bee’s best foreign policy move brings our casualty rate down by about sixty-percent.

Mr. Don’t Bee’s best foreign policy move was dodging a shoe.

….

We’ve learned nothing. The Republican campaign trail today is the same empty tough-guy talk from chicken hawks. The same as it was in 2003.
