He then traveled to London, where he participated in a Jacksonville economic development effort tied to the Jacksonville Jaguars\u2019 appearance in the annual NFL game in England. While there, he also appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nSince taking over the top job at Jacksonville-based Florida Blue in 2011, Geraghty has led the company and Florida down a new road as the economics of the Health insurance marketplace change in dramatic and unforeseeable ways. \u201cNobody really knows for sure how these things are going to evolve,\u201d says University of Florida health policy professor Paul Duncan. \u201cThe expectation that there\u2019s a very clear blueprint we\u2019re marching, or lurching, toward is not correct.\u201d\n\nSince Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida started in Florida in 1944, it has enjoyed what Duncan describes as \u201cspectacular\u201d leadership. The company has had only four CEOs in the last three decades and has grown into the market leader. The notfor- profit business, one of Florida\u2019s largest employers with 11,500 workers, holds 29% of the private market, the largest share of any insurer. A staid company in a staid industry, it came to count many of Florida\u2019s larger employers and household names among its group plans, built enviable name recognition and has served as a stalwart community donor. It\u2019s also come under increasing pressure.\n\nThe federal law caps margins for insurers and imposes such new regulatory constraints that some commentators now Speak of insurers functioning essentially as public utilities. The government, employers and patients all want to squeeze margins. As a not-for-profit, Florida Blue aims for only a 2% to 3% margin \u2014 2012\u2019s $159 million in earnings was 2.4% of $6.6 billion in revenue \u2014 but even that is under pressure.\n\nThe act poses a particular threat to insurers\u2019 small group business, which is often insurers\u2019 highest-margin venture. Meanwhile, other lines can be unprofitable altogether. Florida Blue lost $28 million on its Medicare business in 2012. Born and raised in New York, Geraghty grew up in a big Irish-Italian Catholic family where he came to appreciate the value of hearing diverse opinions, which he says he\u2019s sought to encourage in his business career. \u201cThe dinner table was an exchange of ideas, an exchange of philosophies, an exchange of political points of view. Sometimes it was loud. Sometimes it was really engaged,\u201d he says.\n\n1 2 3 4 5 NEXT \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Florida Trend, Florida business, Florida business news, Florida Small Business, Florida economy, Florida government, Florida politics, Florida Trend magazine, Business Florida", "og": {"url": "http://www.floridatrend.com/article/16632/pat-geraghty-florida-blue-ceo", "type": "article", "site_name": "Florida Trend", "description": "Florida Blue CEO Pat Geraghty has staked out a leadership position that is putting his insurance company \u2014 and Florida \u2014 at the forefront of health care trends.", "title": "Pat Geraghty, Florida Blue CEO, is Floridian of the Year"}, "fb": {"admins": "oblivionvortex,100001475033621,665682755,willshortgorham"}, "description": "FloridaTrend.com delivers Florida business news along with reports on Florida politics, Florida public policy and government.
