The motif is relatively new\u2014it was created on October 26, 2013\u2014but the lifetime return is 17 percent.

You can also make money, by earning a $1 royalty payment if another member invests in your creation.\n\nHowever, statistics show that beating the market isn't easy even if you're a professional. According to market research firm HFR, in 2013, the average hedge fund returned 9.13 percent for the year, versus a return of 32.36 percent for the S&P 500, including dividends.\n\nIn the end, if your idea doesn't cut it, you will have no one to blame but yourself.\n\nRead MoreCNBC Disruptor 50: Where tech companies dominate\n\n\n\n\u2014By CNBC's Kristina Yates", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Online broker Motif Investing is trying to disrupt the investing space by letting users build their own theme-based \"mini ETFs.\"", "news_keywords": "etf, investing cnbc disruptor 50, motif investing, stocks", "author": "Kristina Yates", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Online broker Motif Investing is trying to disrupt the investing space by letting users build their own theme-based \"mini ETFs.\"", "title": "Have an investing idea?
