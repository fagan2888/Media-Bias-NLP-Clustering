The administration had hoped to lower that figure to 90 but a third man, a Yemeni prisoner named Mohammad Bwazir, 35, refused to leave for a nation that offered him sanctuary.\n\nRelated: Why President Obama Rejected the Pentagon\u2019s Plan to Close Gitmo\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been in Guant\u00e1namo so long that he was terrified about going to a country other than one where he had family,\u201d Bwazir\u2019s lawyer told the Miami Herald.\n\n\u201cHe just didn\u2019t want to go. He just feels like he\u2019ll be OK if he has a family to support him,\u201d the lawyer added, saying there was no timeline for when Bwazir might depart.\n\nBwazir was one of 17 inmates Defense Secretary Ash Carter cleared for release in December. Of the 91 still at the prison, 34 have been approved for release, 10 are awaiting some form of trial and 47 are indefinite detainees.\n\nThe Pentagon has transferred 16 prisoners from Guantanamo this month as President Obama works to fulfill a campaign promise he made in 2008 to mothball the site. The accelerated pace has angered congressional Republicans, who have inserted language into a variety a laws over the years to try to tie the president\u2019s hands and prevent him from making good on his promise.\n\nRelated: Obama Readies Biggest Reach of Presidential Power Yet\n\nWith less than a year to go, though, Obama is working on a plan close the detention center, potentially through an executive order, and move the remaining prisoners to an existing U.S. military site on American soil, possibly in Kansas, Colorado or South Carolina.\n\nSenate Armed Services chair John McCain (R-AZ) has signaled he might support the administration\u2019s proposal to close the prison but he has to see it first. Obama rejected a Pentagon plan to close the site last year because of its $600 million price tag.\n\nWhen the revamped plan will be presented to Congress is anyone\u2019s guess and has become an almost daily question at White House press briefings.\n\nThe scheme is something \u201cthat the Pentagon's been working on a lot. I know that they've had a lot of conversations with White House officials about the development of that plan,\u201d press secretary Josh Earnest said last week.\n\nRelated: Where Did $800 Million in Afghan Aid Go? The Pentagon Shrugs Its Shoulders\n\n\u201cI would also encourage you to not give in to a sense of mystery about the plan,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI think our strategy that we have been pursuing for quite some time is familiar to those of you who have been watching this issue for years now,\u201d Earnest said before repeating the administration\u2019s well-rehearsed arguments that the prison is costly for taxpayers and a recruiting tool for extremists around the world.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s renewed push to shutter the U.S. detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has hit an unexpected snag: a detainee cleared for release won\u2019t leave.", "title": "Leave Gitmo?
