But Jim Cramer said the same goes for leadership stocks in the market\u2014all it takes is one stock move to trigger buying all over the place. This includes Twitter, which flew higher on Tuesday but failed to bring the market with it.\n\n\"Some leaders have real pin action, and they can give you a spare or a strike far more easily than others,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\nOne of the groups on Cramer's radar that tend to trigger buying is the transports. He always knows that when the trains, planes and trucks are doing well, commerce is doing well. And more commerce means there are more passengers who are spending more money.\n\nUnfortunately, transit stocks have not been doing very well lately, as the price of oil has dampened some of the return.\n\nAnother group is technology stocks, which has been up and down. The good news is that there are some clear leaders within tech. Bad news is that, in Cramer's perspective, these stocks aren't really qualified because they tend to be disruptive and don't have many followers.\n\nFor example, Netflix was on fire on Tuesday because a few analysts had positive commentary on it. Cramer remained unimpressed, though.\n\n\"The issue with Netflix\u2026is that it doesn't inspire any other stocks to rally. Netflix disrupts everyone else,\" Cramer said.\n\nRead MoreCramer: The stocks that could trigger a rally", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "Tweeting big changes?
