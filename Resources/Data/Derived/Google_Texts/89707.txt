BANGOR, Maine — Canines of many breeds strutted their stuff along the waterfront Saturday morning during Bangor Humane Society’s 22nd annual Paws on Parade.

Some, including a Beagle mix named Captain, dressed up for the occasion, with Captain sporting an aviator costume.

Paws on Parade, the society’s largest annual fundraiser, is a celebration of animals to benefit pets awaiting adoption. The theme of this year’s gathering was “Anything is Pawsible,” featuring events and contests for participants, including a shelter dog runway show to introduce the crowd to pets available for adoption.

Pets and their owners walked more than a mile, from the Bangor Waterfront through downtown Bangor and back to the waterfront.

The Bangor Humane Society is a nonprofit that runs entirely on donations from companies and individuals. All money raised stays local to cover operation costs, which include medical care, food and adoption services.

The organization cares for about 4,500 stray and owner-surrendered animals each year.
