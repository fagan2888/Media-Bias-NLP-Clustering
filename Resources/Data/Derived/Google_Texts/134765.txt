(Yahoo News) In a bizarre story emanating out of Jordan, the old adage of truth is stranger than fiction has never been more appropriate.

Originally reported by Gulf News, a 36-year-old Jordanian woman named Hanan Mahmoud Abdul Karim underwent a C-section procedure last month. The baby was delivered, the parents were overjoyed, and it was soon time for everyone to go home.

While this would ordinarily be the end of the story, Karimâ€™s family soon noticed something odd; her stomach was vibrating.
