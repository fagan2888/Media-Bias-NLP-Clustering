Something about Minnesota nice leaching through the cornfields? I don\u2019t know.\n\nKasich got very little air time Wednesday night, unlike the first debate, and so late in the evening, he decided to do the equivalent of grab the microphone and have his say with the American people. And in this dramatic moment he said. . . well, watch and see for yourself. One of the debate\u2019s most unmemorable moments.
