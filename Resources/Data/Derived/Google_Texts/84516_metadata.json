Doctors told his family he wouldn\u2019t survive. He did, but the accident left him paralyzed from the chest down, unable to do what he loved\u2014surf, snowboard or ride dirt bikes.\n\n\u201cAll you are thinking is the worst, worst, worst\u2014everything you can\u2019t do,\u201d said Orefice, who lives in Valencia, Calif. \u201cI wanted to be dead.\u201d\n\nMore than two decades after breaking his back, Orefice, 40, is married, has a 7-year-old son and owns a medical supply business. He also counsels patients newly disabled from spinal cord injuries. \u201cDepression,\u201d he often tells them, \u201cis part of the healing process.\u201d\n\nAs California legislators consider a bill that would allow terminally ill patients to get prescriptions to end their lives, disability rights advocates are speaking up in opposition. They worry that if it becomes law, depression and incorrect prognoses may lead people with serious disabilities to end their lives prematurely.\n\nThe bill poses \u201cconsiderable dangers\u201d to people with new disabilities who may have suicidal thoughts, said Marilyn Golden, senior policy analyst at Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund. \u201cIt would almost be too easy to make an irrevocable choice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could lead to people giving up on treatment and losing good years of their lives.\u201d\n\nGolden added that the many people who initially received terminal diagnoses have \u201clived full lives [for] years or even decades\u201d longer than expected.\n\nDisability rights advocates have fought against bills and referendums in Massachusetts, Colorado, Connecticut and elsewhere that would have allowed doctors to prescribe lethal medication. They have met with legislators, participated in forums, conducted letter-writing campaigns and submitted newspaper opinion pieces.\n\n\u201cWe have had success after success in stopping these bills,\u201d said John Kelly with Not Dead Yet, a grassroots group of advocates opposed to physician-assisted suicide. The coalition was less organized when laws passed in Washington, Oregon and Vermont, Kelly said. Now, he said they are determined to defeat any bill, including the one in California.\n\nAllowing doctors to prescribe such medication would \u201copen the floodgates\u201d to people taking their lives under the mistaken impression that they are imminently dying or because they think they are a burden on their families, he said.\n\nThe proposed California legislation, Senate Bill 128, was prompted by the highly publicized death of Brittany Maynard, a young Bay Area woman with terminal brain cancer who moved to Oregon so she could get a lethal prescription. She took the medication and died in November.\n\nThe End of Life Option Act, introduced by Democratic state Sens. Lois Wolk and Bill Monning, would allow patients to get fatal prescriptions if they are mentally competent and have six months or less to live. Patients would have to make one written and two oral requests 15 days apart.\n\nDisability rights advocates say there aren\u2019t enough safeguards in the bill. In a letter to Wolk late last month, Deborah Doctor, a legislative advocate for Disability Rights California, wrote that disabled people are vulnerable to abuse and could be coerced by family members not acting in the patients\u2019 best interests. Relatives, she said, could put pressure on people to take life-ending medication.\n\n\u201cEveryone is not Brittany Maynard,\u201d Doctor said in an interview, noting that the young woman\u2019s family supported what she wanted. \u201cOur responsibility is to think of people who are the most vulnerable to coercion, abuse and pressure.\u201d\n\nDoctor also worries that in other cases, physicians may simply be wrong about how long someone has to live. Insurance companies also might overrule treatment for people with disabilities because of the cost of care.\n\nSupporters of the bill say it has many protections built in. For example, they say, people wouldn\u2019t qualify based solely on having a disability. The bill also wouldn\u2019t allow medication to be prescribed if the person were suffering from a mental disorder that impaired judgment.\n\nIn addition, physicians would have to attest that the patient\u2019s request didn\u2019t result from undue influence from someone else. And patients would have the final say\u2014they must administer the medications to themselves.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see this law abused, and we certainly don\u2019t want to see it used against people with disabilities who have enough problems with the health care system,\u201d said Toni Broaddus, California campaign director for Compassion & Choices, a nonprofit organization that supports the bill.\n\nIn any event, Broaddus said the vast majority of disabled people wouldn\u2019t meet the criteria for life-ending prescriptions. \u201cMost people with disabilities don\u2019t immediately have terminal illnesses and most disabilities are not terminal,\u201d she said.\n\nPrevious efforts to pass similar bills in California have failed under opposition from doctors, religious groups and disability advocates. But the new bill recently passed in the state Senate, and its chances may be buoyed by Maynard\u2019s case and by the California Medical Association\u2019s historic decision to declare a neutral position.\n\nLaurie Hoirup, 59, strongly opposes the bill based on her own long experience. She has had spinal muscular atrophy since she was a toddler. With a curved spine and rods in her back, she cannot eat, bathe or go to the bathroom on her own. She has trouble breathing.\n\nPhysicians told her family that she wouldn\u2019t live past 10 years old. \u201cAnyone could be given the wrong diagnoses,\u201d she said. \u201cI am certainly the perfect example of that.\u201d\n\nHoirup, who is now a grandmother, spent many years working in government and other positions on behalf of people with disabilities. She said she is particularly concerned about people being coerced into ending their lives so they aren\u2019t a burden on others.\n\nOrefice, who wished for death when he was 19, said he is now glad for what he calls the years of \u201cbonus time.\u201d He still struggles with physical problems, including bladder infections and pressure sores. And three years ago, he had another unrelated health scare\u2014colon cancer. He is now in remission.\n\nBut Orefice said he doesn\u2019t dwell on his disability or think much about death. Instead, he focuses on his family and thinks what he\u2019s been able to accomplish and what he still hopes to. He paddle boards, plays wheelchair hockey and races specially equipped off-road vehicles.\n\n\u201cI have affected more lives than I would have if I was walking,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you are in the trenches, you don\u2019t see that.\u201d\n\nOriginally published by Kaiser Health News", "article_metadata": {"description": "Disability rights advocates worry that depression and incorrect prognoses may lead people with serious disabilities to end their lives prematurely.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Disability rights advocates worry that depression and incorrect prognoses may lead people with serious disabilities to end their lives prematurely.", "title": "Disability Advocates Fight Assisted Suicide Measures", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150705_Wheelchair.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-06T12:12:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NzOeUy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Disability rights advocates worry that depression and incorrect prognoses may lead people with serious disabilities to end their lives prematurely.", "title": "Disability Advocates Fight Assisted Suicide Measures", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150705_Wheelchair.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-07-05T03:01:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T12:12:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "assisted suicide, california, disability rights"}, "article_summary": "Disability rights advocates have fought against bills and referendums in Massachusetts, Colorado, Connecticut and elsewhere that would have allowed doctors to prescribe lethal medication.\nPrevious efforts to pass similar bills in California have failed under opposition from doctors, religious groups and disability advocates.\nDisability rights advocates say there aren\u2019t enough safeguards in the bill.\nThe bill poses \u201cconsiderable dangers\u201d to people with new disabilities who may have suicidal thoughts, said Marilyn Golden, senior policy analyst at Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund.\n\u201cDepression,\u201d he often tells them, \u201cis part of the healing process.\u201dAs California legislators consider a bill that would allow terminally ill patients to get prescriptions to end their lives, disability rights advocates are speaking up in opposition."}
