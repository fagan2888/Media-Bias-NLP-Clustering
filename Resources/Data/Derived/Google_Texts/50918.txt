A group of drag queens in Louisiana has decided to use their cross-dressing talents to help promote Obamacare. Wednesday Night Tea — “a unique, interactive drag queen show held every Wednesday at Central Station in Shreveport, Louisiana” — has partnered up with the non-profit Out2Enroll to help market Obamacare to the LGBT community. Out2Enroll focuses on informing those in the LGBT community about the benefits of Obamacare and on enrolling them in insurance plans and events in cities across the country.

“We immediately began promoting Out2Enroll resources to our in-house fans and our Facebook fans, and we’re including information about the Affordable Care Act and the Out2Enroll campaign in our weekly slideshow,” the Wednesday Night Tea cast and crew wrote. “And, of course, we will continue to use social media and our weekly drag shows to post information about health reform and encourage our fans to check out their options.”

Wishing to help people outside of their local Shreveport, Wednesday Night tea promises to “take our show on the road so we’ll be looking for venues to provide other communities with information concerning the LGBT issues and some GREAT entertainment!”
