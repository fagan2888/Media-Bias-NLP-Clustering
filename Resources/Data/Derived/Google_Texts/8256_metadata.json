Conard smiled and stared intently through his black-rimmed glasses as Jon Stewart, the liberal host of the comedy show, held up his book and described its contents. Conard\u2019s book argued that America\u2019s economy would be stronger if people like Conard were even richer and the country had even higher levels of economic inequality.\n\nStewart was puzzled by Conard\u2019s argument and joked that it didn\u2019t seem right because inequality in the United States was approaching the level in countries with \u201ckidnapping-based economies,\u201d generating laughter in the audience. Then Stewart shifted to an opening that would give Conard a chance to explain himself. \u201cMy question to you about the premise of the book,\u201d Stewart stated, pausing for effect before setting up his punch line, \u201cis huh?\u201d\n\nConard laughed along with the audience, and then launched into his argument that great rewards for the \u201cmost talented\u201d people were the secret to America\u2019s success. Making the rich richer is good for everyone, he claimed, because high levels of inequality provide strong incentives for risk taking and innovation that are essential for economic growth.\n\nThough Conard\u2019s comments were provocative\u2014indeed his book tour generated significant press, including a multipage feature in the New York Times Magazine\u2014he was merely stating the barely hidden premise underlying supply-side economics. Supply-side economics, the misguided theory that has controlled economic policymaking for the past three decades, is built on the idea that inequality is good. Tax cuts for the rich and less regulation of business supposedly provide incentives for the wealthy to invest and work more. Enabling \u201cjob creators\u201d to get richer helps us all, the theory goes.\n\nConard\u2019s former boss at Bain, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican Party nominee for president, ran on a platform of supply-side policies, as have virtually all Republicans since Ronald Reagan was elected president. Even a number of prominent Democrats support supply-side policies and logic. Not only do these wrongheaded ideas about inequality have great political influence, but\u2014until quite recently\u2014they were largely shared by academic economists. For the past several decades, the idea that high levels of inequality were good for the economy dominated economic thought.\n\nFortunately, these flawed ideas are beginning to be challenged. Academics have begun to rethink their views about the decline of the middle class and progressive politicians are finally starting to openly contest the logic underlying supply side after years of failing to do so. It is about time because our economy is suffering deeply from a financial crash caused in large part by high levels of inequality. And though we may not have a kidnapping-based economy, as Stewart joked, the American middle class is so weakened that we are experiencing the kinds of problems that plague less-developed countries, including high levels of societal distrust that make it hard to do business, governmental favors for privileged elites that distort the economy, and fewer opportunities for children of the middle class and the poor to get ahead, wasting vast quantities of human potential.\n\nThe American economy has been thrown off balance because the middle class is so weakened and inequality so high. An economy that works only for the rich simply doesn\u2019t work. To have strong and sustainable growth, the economy needs to work for everyone.\n\nA strong middle class is not merely the result of a strong economy\u2014as was previously thought\u2014but rather a source of America\u2019s economic growth. Rebuilding the middle class would provide the stable base of consumer demand necessary to increase business investment and job creation. It would also enable the country to fully develop the human capital of its people, increase the social trust that makes transactions possible, and balance political power to produce a government that works for the whole country, not just those at the top.\n\nElements of this line of thinking date back to some of history\u2019s most prominent economists\u2014from John Stuart Mill to John Maynard Keynes\u2014but until the Great Recession of 2007\u20132009 snapped the field back to attention, most economists ignored the importance of the middle class. Now, as they revise their models and assumptions that failed to predict the financial crisis, economists are rediscovering classic scholars, opening their eyes to the work of researchers in other fields such as history, political science, and sociology, and developing promising new lines of inquiry to try to understand the role of the middle class.\n\nThe weakening middle class\n\nThe United States was founded as a middle-class country. On the eve of the American Revolution, America\u2019s carpenters, shopkeepers, and farmers enjoyed a higher standard of living than workers in other parts of the world. Further, economic inequality was lower in the United States than any place else. In an era of kings and peasants, America\u2019s middle class stood apart.\n\nAmerica had its share of rich people, and of course it had slavery. But even so, the rich were not that much richer than the middle class. As Peter Lindert, an economic historian at UC Davis, explains: \u201cCompared to any other country from which we have data, America in that era was more equal.\u201d Those who lived during America\u2019s founding sensed that the country\u2019s economic equality was special. Thomas Jefferson noted in a letter that \u201cwe have no paupers. . . . The great mass of our population \u2026 possess property [and] cultivate their own lands\u2026. The wealthy, on the other hand, and those at their ease, know nothing of what the Europeans call luxury.\u201d\n\nThe strength of America\u2019s middle class ebbed and flowed over time, especially as industrialization took hold. But after World War II, America returned to its roots and built a mass middle class that was the envy of the world, with rapidly rising incomes and decreasing inequality. The mid-1940s to the mid-1970s was a period \u201cwithout extremes of wealth or poverty,\u201d as Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman explains. To be clear, America in this era had rich people and poor people, but the bulk of society formed a prosperous middle class that was in relatively close proximity to both the top and the bottom.\n\nYet, over the past three to four decades, middle-class America has come undone. The American middle class was already hurting when the Great Recession struck and is now in deep trouble. While there\u2019s no official definition of the middle class, it\u2019s not hard to see that it is in decline. By most every measure, most Americans are struggling.\n\nFirst, there is the basic level of income earned by the typical American. Median household income\u2014meaning half make more and half make less\u2014was lower in 2013 than it was in 1989. This means that middle-class households now earn less than they did two decades ago. Similarly, incomes for poor and even upper-middle-class households have also stagnated. It is true that over an even longer time period, the middle class have seen some income gains. But these gains have been quite small: over the past four decades, median compensation, including both wages and benefits, has grown at a snail\u2019s pace of just 0.27 percent per year\u2014far slower than the overall economy or output per worker. The miniscule gains that households have made have largely come because women have increasingly entered the workforce\u2014meaning families are working longer hours, as they run faster and faster to stay in place. Indeed, the hourly wage earned by a typical man is less than it was in 1973.\n\nEven these gloomy figures may be too rosy because they show what is happening to the typical household\u2014but the typical worker is getting older, and older workers generally make more than younger workers. Income trends are even worse when workers are compared to those of a similar age from a few decades ago. Median incomes for male workers now in their thirties are about 12 percent lower than the income was for their fathers\u2019 generation at the same age.\n\nWhile incomes have been stagnant for most Americans, the cost of middle-class basics like healthcare and gas have risen much faster than inflation, and some basics like housing and college have risen at double the rate of inflation over the past four decades. It costs a lot more to maintain a middle-class lifestyle, but no matter their efforts most families have not been able to earn much more income. Not surprisingly, debt levels have jumped sharply\u2014the average debt of middle-class families has nearly doubled since 1983.\n\nIn contrast to the middle class and the poor, incomes of the rich, especially the very rich, have grown by astronomical amounts over the past three decades: in 2007, the year the Great Recession started, the top 0.01 percent, the richest one in ten thousand, earned in today\u2019s dollars the equivalent of about $38.8 million, compared to $6.4 million per year in 1979. Because of rapidly rising incomes for the rich and stagnating incomes for everyone else, the economic distance between the rich and the middle class has grown by leaps and bounds. CEO compensation, for example, increased from less than 30 times that of the average worker in 1978 to over 350 times what the average worker made in 2007. Though incomes for the rich fell during the Great Recession more than they did for the middle class, incomes for the rich have come roaring back, while middle-class incomes have not\u2014so much so that income differences are now back to near the prerecession levels.\n\nTo picture how big these differences are, think of a strange building housing the middle class on the bottom floor and the very rich on the top story. In the late 1970s, the CEO\u2019s penthouse would have been on the thirtieth floor, making this apartment building a tall one, but one that would fit in many American cities. In 2007, the penthouse was 351 floors up, meaning the apartment building would need to be more than three times the size of the Empire State Building.\n\nThe rich now make so much more than the middle class because they captured the vast majority of the economy\u2019s gains over recent decades. The share of the nation\u2019s income going to the top 1 percent has approximately doubled over the past three decades, while the share of income going to the middle 60 percent of income earners has fallen precipitously and is now stagnating near the lowest level ever recorded since the government began keeping track of the statistic. These changes in income share are \u201cthe equivalent of shifting $1.1 trillion of annual income to the top 1 percent of families,\u201d according to Princeton economist Alan Krueger. Since the Great Recession ended, over 90 percent of the income gains have gone to the top 1 percent of income earners.\n\nAnd wealth differentials are even bigger than income differences. The bottom 90 percent of Americans have lost wealth over the past two and a half decades and now hold only about one-quarter of the country\u2019s wealth. In contrast, the top 1 percent have seen dramatic gains in wealth and now hold 40 percent of total US wealth. To put the wealth of the very rich in context, the average net worth of the 400 wealthiest Americans is \u201cabout the same as the gross domestic product of Brazil,\u201d according to Forbes Magazine.\n\nFor most Americans, incomes are stagnant, debt levels are high, and they are taking home a smaller share of the pie than they once did and falling further behind the rich. This means, as economists put it, that the opportunities for the poor and middle class are increasingly constrained in comparison to those of the rich.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supply-side economics hollowed out the middle class.
