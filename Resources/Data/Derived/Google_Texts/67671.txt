A janitor at Saint Mary's College has been arrested for allegedly downloading child pornography. He has been suspended from his position with the college pending the outcome of their investigation.

Luis Morales, 60, has been charged with two counts of child exploitation and seven counts of possession of child pornography, according to the St. Joseph County Prosecutor's Office,

A search warrant at Morales' home led to the discovery of several flash drives and SD memory cards with over 100 gigabytes of files, in excess of 100,000 files.

“I’ve been working these crimes for about seven, eight years now and this is one of the largest collections for an offender that I’ve seen,” said investigator Mitch Kaiser.

Officials say Morales admitted he sought out and downloaded all of the child porn discovered during the warrant.

The prosecutor's office says Morales only used the college's wi-fi in order to view and download some of the images. They say no students, faculty or staff at the college appear to be harmed or exploited.

The prosecutor's office says the college was vital to the investigation.

“We certainly had a break on identifying him because of the work that Saint Mary's had done. There was no indication whatsoever that his crime had anything to do with the college except that he used their wi-fi," said Ken Cotter, St Joseph County Prosecutor.

Bond was set at $50,000 corporate surety or $5,000 cash.

The college has suspended Morales without pay and he is not allowed on campus.

The college sent an email out to students, faculty and staff about the arrest:
