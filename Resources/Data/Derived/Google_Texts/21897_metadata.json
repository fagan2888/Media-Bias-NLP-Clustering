Humphrey was drafted out of Tennessee State University into the National Football League by the Atlanta Falcons in 1968 and finished his NFL career with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1981. (Brad Vest/The Commercial Appeal)</p>\n\nBy Geoff Calkins\n\nClaude Humphrey took time to talk to a reporter over lunch at the Piccadilly restaurant in Bartlett the other day. Here\u2019s some more of what he said about his induction into the Pro Football of Fame and other subjects.\n\nQ: What size Hall of Fame jacket?\n\nA: It\u2019s a 58 long. Size 17 ring. They tell me it\u2019s the second-biggest ring size they\u2019ve ever had.\n\nQ: You were raised in Memphis at a time when African-Americans were treated like second-class citizens. As a kid growing up, how aware were you of that?\n\nA: Of course we were very aware that we were treated as second-class citizens. That was just the way it was. There was nothing that we felt we could do to change it, that\u2019s just the way it was.\n\nQ: Who\u2019s the best offensive tackle you ever played against?\n\nA: Everybody in the \u201970s. It\u2019s different now from the way it was then. Back then, everybody put their best blocker on the right side. Now, everybody\u2019s best blocker is on the left side. I lined up in front of the best blocker every Sunday. Ron Yary, Bob Brown, Rayfield Wright, all the Hall of Famers. All those guys in the Hall of Fame, they were right tackles.\n\nQ: They didn\u2019t count sacks when you played. So I guess you didn\u2019t have a sack dance?\n\nA: I played for Norm Van Brocklin. Norm didn\u2019t play that. Norm made me stop talking on the football field. I used to talk a lot coming out of college. Norm told me that I couldn\u2019t talk any more. Just go out there, do your job and come back and sit down. Have no conversation with the guys across the line at all. That was Norm\u2019s approach.\n\nQ: Do you wish you played at a time when sacks were counted as an official stat?\n\nA: I\u2019m going to say this about the stats. They say that Richard Dent holds the sack record for Tennessee State but how do they know that? I was sacking the quarterback left and right but we didn\u2019t call it a sack then. It was just tackling. Richard Dent\u2019s senior year he was coming out and they said he was the sack leader for Tennessee State, but how do they know that? They kept sack records for him but they didn\u2019t for me.\n\nQ: Why did you retire from the Falcons four games into the 1978 season?\n\nA: I can\u2019t tell you what happened.\n\nQ: Something happened?\n\nA: I can\u2019t tell you what happened. I can\u2019t talk about that.\n\nQ: When you were with the Eagles, you lost to the Raiders in Super Bowl 15. Memories of the game?\n\nA: I got called for roughing the passer. That\u2019s one of the things I regret the most about my playing, because I was really not that kind of person. At the moment, I was all ticked off because they were beating us. The official threw the flag at me. I picked it up and threw it back at him. I regret that I did that.\n\nQ: How\u2019s your health?\n\nA: I\u2019m hanging in there pretty good. I had cancer of my kidney, and they removed it. And I have a defibrillator. And I still have wires and steel in my knee. I\u2019ve had blood clots. I\u2019ve had everything that you can have.\n\nQ: How much did you make as a football player?\n\nA: At the very end, I had a nice salary. It wasn\u2019t well into no six figures. I tried to negotiate, and do all the things you do, but back in the day, they wouldn\u2019t have taken all that stuff. They really didn\u2019t care. They said, \u201cYou\u2019re going to come eventually.\u201d The things that young players today use as leverage, that stuff didn\u2019t work in our day. They didn\u2019t care\n\nQ: You excited about the weekend?\n\nA: I\u2019m honored to be in the Hall of Fame. As I said, I nearly passed out when I got the call. But I personally am in the bed by 11 every night and they\u2019re telling me I\u2019m going to have to stay up \u2019til midnight, 1 a.m. They\u2019re breaking my routine.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Sacks, Super Bowl regrets, and a size 17 ring: A Claude Humphrey Q-and-A", "og": {"url": "http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/schools/sacks-super-bowl-regrets-and-a-size-17-ring-a-claude-humphrey-q-and-a-ep-519028623-324362591.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/geoff_sun_0002_7061601_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 426}, "type": "article", "description": "Claude Humphrey, a Memphian, looking forward to Pro Football Hall of Fame induction -- but it means he'll have to stay up late: 'They're breaking my routine.'", "title": "Sacks, Super Bowl regrets, and a size 17 ring: A Claude Humphrey Q-and-A"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/geoff_sun_0002_7061601_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Claude Humphrey, a Memphian, looking forward to Pro Football Hall of Fame induction -- but it means he'll have to stay up late: 'They're breaking my routine.'", "site": "https://twitter.com/memphisnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sacks, Super Bowl regrets, and a size 17 ring: A Claude Humphrey Q-and-A"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ca-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab7b\"", "article_summary": "<p>July 24, 2014 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Memphian Claude Humphrey is being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nNorm didn\u2019t play that.\nHere\u2019s some more of what he said about his induction into the Pro Football of Fame and other subjects.\nQ: What size Hall of Fame jacket?\nQ: When you were with the Eagles, you lost to the Raiders in Super Bowl 15."}
