Pat Roberts is threatening to \u201cshut down the Senate\u201d with a Ted Cruz-style filibuster if President Barack Obama tries to thwart the congressional ban on moving Guantanamo Bay detainees into U.S. prisons.\n\n\u201cI stopped him once from trying to send the Gitmo terrorists to Leavenworth\u201d prison in Kansas, Roberts said during an event in Topeka, according to Roll Call. \u201cI shall do it again, I shall do it again and if he tries it I will shut down the Senate.\u201d\n\nThe White House denied a Wall Street Journal report that it is considering ways to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, which could lead to detainees being transferred into the continental United States.\n\nDespite the denial, Republicans were outraged by what they said is another attempt to sidestep Congress. Roberts, faced with a tough re-election race, said he thinks other Republicans would be with him.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz did it with regards to Obamacare, if necessary I\u2019ll do it for terrorists,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I could do 21 hours \u2014 maybe 22 or 23. But I will have help on this. I can see John McCain there, and I can see Lindsey Graham there, and I can see Kelly Ayotte there, and I can see a whole bunch of other people there.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans also pounced on the report. House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Obama is willing to \u201cunilaterally rewrite the law\u201d because he is \u201cso eager to bring these terrorists\u201d into the country.\n\n\u201cNot only is this scheme dangerous, it is yet another example of what will be this administration\u2019s legacy of lawlessness,\u201d he said.\n\nBoehner also quickly sought to parlay the report into an advantage for Republicans in the Nov. 4 midterm elections, saying that \u201ceach and every Democrat should make their position known\u201d and pledging that the House GOP would oppose any effort to keep detainees housed in Guantanamo Bay out of the United States.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s Friday morning report highlights another area where Obama could turn to executive action after seeing his initiatives thwarted in Congress. Already, the president has signed orders to raise the minimum wage and impose anti-discrimination rules for federal workers and contractors. He has also said he plans to announce an immigration overhaul after the midterm elections.\n\nIn response, House Republicans have sought to sue the president, arguing that he is overstepping his authority.\n\nObama\u2019s options could include vetoing an annual bill setting military policy, which since 2010 has included the ban on transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees into the United States, or he could attach a signing statement saying he considers that restriction an infringement on his executive power, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nHowever, the White House denied the report that similar action is in the works on Guantanamo Bay.\n\nNational Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the White House doesn\u2019t know \u201cwhat new press reports are referring to when they say the administration is \u2018drafting options\u2019 intended to \u2018override a congressional ban.'\u201d\n\n\u201cIt remains true that we continue to object to congressional restrictions, as we\u2019ve said many times,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTo the greatest extent possible and consistent with our national security interests, detainees will be repatriated or resettled, or prosecuted in federal courts or military commission proceedings,\u201d Hayden said.\n\nThere are now 149 detainees housed within the Guantanamo Bay facility. More than half have reportedly been approved for transfer, and some could be shipped to other countries.\n\nThe possibility of transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees into the United States could be a dangerous one for Democrats. A Gallup poll in June found that 66 percent of Americans oppose moving those detainees into U.S. prisons, while just 29 percent support doing so.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Kansas Sen.
