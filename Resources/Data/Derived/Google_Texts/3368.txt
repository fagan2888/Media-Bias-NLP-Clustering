Robert Gates is out with his new book and it’s a doozy.

In “Duty,” due to hit stores Jan. 14, the former Defense secretary says -- among other things -- that when it comes to Afghanistan, Obama “doesn’t believe in his own strategy ... it’s all about getting out.”

Pundits rightly declare it a less than flattering picture of life in the White House. The Washington Post’s Bob Woodward calls the book, “an antagonistic portrait of a sitting President.”

But the Pres isn’t the only target. Gates slaps VP Biden, well, for being Biden.

Gates says Biden "has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and natl. security issue" in past 40 years. http://t.co/5ze9Rg66RI — Charles Hoskinson (@cehoskinson) January 7, 2014

ABC gets out the abacus finding it’s not the first time a phrase like ‘wrong side of foreign policy decisions’ has been used by Republicans to describe the Veep.

The White House backed their man faster than he could say Uncle Joe.

Nicholas Kristof, New York Times columnist, weighs in tweeting a qualified nod to the author’s credibility.

I don't always agree with Bob Gates, but I've great respect for him and he's always worth listening to carefully http://t.co/wVnTQXCohX — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) January 7, 2014

And what about the little guys who got a bum rap from Gates? Al-Monitor’s Laura Rozen leaps to their defense.

Republicans can win it all in 2014?

UVA’s political science professor, Larry Sabato, who is an oft-seen cable face during elections, writes in his new Politico Magazine column that the Grand Old Party could sweep up in 2014.

Sabato: Republicans could really win it all in 2014, if ... http://t.co/YOsrMhY4ZN — Ed Morrissey (@EdMorrissey) January 7, 2014

But, don’t miss the big “if” attached to his prediction: If, among other factors, Republicans don’t mess it up.

Well, that clears that up.

A key vote passed in the Senate, paving the way for unemployment benefits to be restored. “Mom” is the beneficiary in the White House tweets.

Obama on the needs to #RenewUI: “It helps Mom pay the rent while learning new skills to earn that new job.” — The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 7, 2014

The Senate took a vital step to protect American families. The House must allow vote to #renewUI. We must not leave millions #outinthecold. — Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) January 7, 2014

Most Republicans refused to support the extension without corresponding budget cuts. The National Journal’s Ron Fournier just wants everyone to get along.

Good luck with that or any other kind of compromise, tweets reporter Matt Laslo.

And don’t expect him to go there any time soon.

You wanna know what Matt Drudge thinks about ObamaCare? You probably don’t need to read his tweet to guess.

I've opted out of Obamacare for life. Not interested. Pay the tax. Monopoly money anyway... — MATT DRUDGE (@DRUDGE) January 7, 2014

So there.

It wasn’t quite as big as Jay Carney’s new beard, but the numbing temps in D.C. had journos yukking it up on Twitter yesterday morning.
