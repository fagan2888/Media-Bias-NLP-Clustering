Now, a powerful union has launched a brutal ad slamming the mayor over his record.\n\nThe Service International Employees Union (SEIU) debuted its new ad titled \u201cDown Here,\u201d where Rahm\u2019s tenure is characterized as a detriment for the city.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBeginning with a mile-high shot of the Windy City, the narrator says, \u201cFrom up here, Chicago\u2019s never looked better.\u201d The ad, though, goes on to slam Rahm\u2019s failed record.\n\n\u201cBut down here, under Rahm Emmanuel, we\u2019ve seen nearly 10,000 shootings, 50 neighborhood schools shut down, and a mayor who hits working people with higher taxes and fees while giving special tax breaks to his friends at the very top,\u201d the narrator says.\n\nNoting that Rahm is now \u201cfalsely attacking\u201d his opponent, the SEIU ends its ad charging, \u201cBecause Rahm can\u2019t change his record, we need to change mayors.\u201d\n\nMayor Emanuel, a former Obama Chief of Staff, was expected to cruise to re-election last month but was surprised by being unable to reach the 50 percent plus needed to be re-elected outright, even in a five-way election.\n\nSince his failed bid to win re-election outright, several important groups and individuals have come out in support of his more populist opponent, Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia. Garcia\u2019s new supporters includes Operation Push chief Jesse Jackson and a large contingent of the city\u2019s black ministers.\n\nMayor Emanuel has been so desperate to regain his office that he\u2019s turned to the city\u2019s Republicans in the hopes that they might help him over the top in the upcoming runoff election.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has found himself in a political battle with a powerful union launching a brutal ad slamming the mayor's record.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has found himself in a political battle with a powerful union launching a brutal ad slamming the mayor's record.", "title": "Union Slams Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel in New Campaign Ad", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/rahm-emanuel-upset-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/20/union-slams-chicago-mayor-rahm-emanuel-in-campaign-ad/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has found himself in a political battle with a powerful union launching a brutal ad slamming the mayor's record.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/rahm-emanuel-upset-AP.jpg", "title": "Union Slams Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel in New Campaign Ad", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Chicago, Chuy Garcia, Jesse Jackson, Rahm Emanuel, SEIU,Big Government,Rahm Emanuel", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "SEIU", "published_time": "2015-03-20T17:45:44-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The Service International Employees Union (SEIU) debuted its new ad titled \u201cDown Here,\u201d where Rahm\u2019s tenure is characterized as a detriment for the city.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has unexpectedly found himself in the political battle of his life with a whole host of important sectors of the electorate lining up against his re-election.\nNow, a powerful union has launched a brutal ad slamming the mayor over his record.\nMayor Emanuel has been so desperate to regain his office that he\u2019s turned to the city\u2019s Republicans in the hopes that they might help him over the top in the upcoming runoff election.\nSince his failed bid to win re-election outright, several important groups and individuals have come out in support of his more populist opponent, Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia."}
