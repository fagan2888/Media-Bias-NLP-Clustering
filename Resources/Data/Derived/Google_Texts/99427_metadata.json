Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., said during debate on the House floor.\n\nLater Friday, the House passed legislation clarifying the regulations\u2014cosponsored by McMorris Rogers and Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif.\u2014by a vote of 266-144.\n\nNow the action moves to the Senate, where Sens. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Angus King, I-Maine, are sponsoring a companion bill.\n\nThe rules from the Food and Drug Administration\u2014set to go into effect this year\u2014would require restaurants, convenience stores, grocery stores, and other establishments with ready-to-go food to list the caloric intake values of items on their menus.\n\nThe mandate applies to establishments with 20 or more outlets or franchises.\n\nUnder the FDA\u2019s finalized rules, such restaurants or stores must list calorie counts on in-store menu boards and online ordering systems as well as a majority of print advertising such as direct mailers. The regulations also apply to large vending machine operators.\n\nThe legislation from McMorris Rodgers and Sanchez, called the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act, amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to clarify and make the regulations more flexible for eateries that serve items in a variety of combinations, such as deli sandwiches or pizza.\n\nMcMorris Rodgers, the House\u2019s no. 4 Republican as chairwoman of the GOP conference, said the legislation protects small business owners and their employees from frivolous lawsuits and criminal accusations over actions that could be \u201chonest, inadvertent human error\u201d\u2014such as her pickle example.\n\n\u2018Power Grab by the FDA\u2019\n\n\u201cThis legislation is commonsense and provides access to calorie information in a practical, flexible, and simpler manner by clarifying\u2014not significantly altering\u2014complicated regulations,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said in November, before the bill was passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nAt a press conference Feb. 10, the Washington Republican said:\n\nWhen I think of the local salad bar or sandwich options that are available at the deli, I imagine all the possible combinations. You\u2019re thinking about thousands and thousands of different combinations. And here\u2019s the FDA telling these businesses they have to use a one-size-fits-all approach to notify their customers of these nutritional information. It\u2019s another example of a federal agency that is disconnected from its mission.\n\nThe McMorris Rodgers-Sanchez bill (H.R. 2017) clarifies that flyers and coupons are not menus, protects establishments from being punished for inadvertent human error, and places compliance on corporate officials rather than local store managers and workers, an Energy and Commerce Committee spokesman said.\n\n\u201cThe menu labeling regulation is a power grab by the FDA to regulate businesses not covered by the labeling requirements under Obamacare,\u201d Daren Bakst, a research fellow in agricultural policy at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal. Bakst added:\n\nThe statute was supposed to regulate \u2018restaurants or similar retail food establishments.\u2019 Convenience stores and grocery stores are not similar to restaurants. Just because they may sell a prepared food like a hot dog doesn\u2019t make them restaurants by any reasonable stretch of the imagination.\n\nThe Obama administration came out Feb. 10 in opposition to the bill with a statement saying:\n\nTo provide consumers with calorie and other nutrition information about the foods they eat outside of their homes, the Congress in 2010 required that calorie information be listed on menus and menu boards in certain chain restaurants and similar retail food establishments with 20 or more locations, and on certain vending machines. In 2014, after extensive shareholder and public participation, the Food and Drug Administration finalized rules implementing the statutory menu labeling and vending machine labeling requirements.\n\nH.R. 2017 would undercut the objective of providing clear, consistent calorie information to consumers. If enacted, it would reduce consumers\u2019 access to nutrition information and likely create consumer confusion by introducing a great deal of variability into how calories are declared. The legislation also would create unnecessary delays in the implementation of menu labeling.\n\n\u2018Empower Consumers\u2019\n\nRep. Jared Polis, D-Colo., \u201cWhile some say that they don\u2019t like the regulations, the reality is this bill actually delays and waters down the transparency the American people want,\u201d Polis said.\n\n\u201cAs a consumer I like to see the calories at all those [chain restaurant] locations. What this bill would actually do is prevent that from happening.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the bill point to obesity-related health issues.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of this labeling measure in the Affordable Care Act was to empower consumers to make healthier decisions about the food they eat by simply allowing them to know what\u2019s in it\u2014that\u2019s the broad directions set by Congress,\u201d Polis said.\n\n\u201cMaking sure that we have a public health impact, we need a certain level of standardization so consumers can compare nutritional information in restaurants just like they would in packages in stores.\u201d\n\nThe FDA mandate, the details of which took years to hash out, has been delayed in implementation.\n\nThe final menu labeling regulations are 400 pages long and estimated to cost American businesses more than $1 billion and 500,000 hours of paperwork.\n\n\u2018Doesn\u2019t Make Sense\u2019\n\n\u201cLike many other regulations, good intentions don\u2019t always add up to practical policy,\u201d McMorris Rodgers said in November.\n\n\u201cRequiring pizza franchisees to post in their stores every potential topping combination\u2014more than 34 million possible outcomes\u2014when more than 90 percent of their orders take place over the phone or Internet, just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nThe Senate bill, introduced Oct. 29, was referred to the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which has not scheduled a hearing.\n\nChairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said he looks forward to finding a way to pass the bill, Agri-Pulse Communications reported.\n\nThe House bill drew support from the National Association of Convenience Stores, Food Marketing Institute, National Grocers Association, Domino\u2019s Pizza, and more than 200 local grocery, pizza and convenience stores across the country.\n\nUnder federal law, violation of the FDA\u2019s regulations can result in up to a year in prison or as much as $1,000 in fines, or both.\n\n\u201cThe government should not be placing more harmful barriers in the way of hardworking small businesses,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a formal statement following the bill\u2019s passage.\n\n\u201cThis important legislation would roll back the FDA\u2019s burdensome menu labeling rule, giving American restaurants, grocery and convenient stores the flexibility they need to be successful. I commend Cathy [McMorris Rodgers] for her work on this measure.\u201d\n\nIn a video, Domino\u2019s Pizza broke down its many pizza combinations and captured customers\u2019 reaction to in-depth menu boards:\n\nMenu Labeling from Menu Labeling on Vimeo.\n\n\u2018Arrogant Assumption\u2019\n\nAccording to the FDA, posting calories and other nutritional information on menu boards \u201cwill fill a critical information gap and help consumers make informed and healthful dietary choices.\u201d\n\nHeritage\u2019s Bakst looks at it from a different perspective:\n\nThe rule, and menu labeling requirements generally, presumes that the public is ignorant and requires government to step in and mandate nutritional information be provided to them. If the public wants this information, food establishments will provide the information. We already see this.\n\nBakst said the legislation takes a \u201csmall step in the right direction\u201d but called for Obamacare\u2019s menu labeling regulations to be repealed altogether.\n\n\u201cThe FDA appears to be advancing a new public health paradigm that is based on the arrogant assumption that bureaucrats have the ability to accurately influence and even limit what people can eat,\u201d Bakst said. \u201cFood choices should be made freely by each individual based on his or her own preferences, not by bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"It\u2019s another example of a federal agency that is disconnected from its mission,\" Rep.
