It seems like every other day this kind of thing happens: someone says something on Twitter and someone finds a reason to be bothered by it and presto, dialogue is born. So a few days after comedian and political commentator John Fugelsang tweeted a joke about how much Fox News cares for covering Obamacare versus “BridgeGate”, Fox’s James Rosen jabbed back on Twitter by throwing some perspective into the mix.

Last week, when the New Jersey scandal was heating up and more details were leaking out about the lane closures caused by people around Chris Christie, Fugelsang tweeted this out.

It took almost a week, but Rosen finally noticed the tweet yesterday and hit back.

Fugelsang responded by asking for some perspective of his own.
