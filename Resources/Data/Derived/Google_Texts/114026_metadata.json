She used studies and data to back up her claims, according to Breitbart News.\n\nSister Laurel, a Nashville Dominican nun with a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical University in Rome, has often lectured on church doctrine, which teaches that homosexuality is a sin. She normally teaches at Aquinas College, but often guest lectures at high schools across the country.\n\nBreitbart News reported:\n\nIt is reported Sister Laurel also talked about the greater chance at life success that children have who come from households headed by the child\u2019s biological mother and father in a lifelong commitment of marriage.\n\n[* * *]\n\nSister Laurel has reportedly given similar talks a few dozen times all over the country all without incident. It is reported that some of the data she used came from the highly respected Anscombe Bioethics Centre in Great Britain. Most of the nun\u2019s talks are up at her webpage.\n\nAlthough no complaints were raised by other groups, students and parents from the Charlotte-area school were incensed.\n\nNearly 1,000 parents met at the school Wednesday to address complaints. The assembly was closed to the public, but social media posts described it as \u201coften heated, with emotions running high on both sides,\u201d the Charlotte Observer reported.\n\nLaurel\u2019s address also prompted a student petition, which said:\n\n\u201cWe the students of Charlotte Catholic High School would like to issue a formal complaint regarding Sr. Jane Dominic [Laurel]\u2019s speech,\u201d according to an online petition. \u201cWe believe that same sex couples have the ability to raise happy, well-adjusted and successful children \u2026 We believe that homosexual couples are capable of monogamy. As rational people, we know that most homosexual people lead healthy, normal and productive lives like their heterosexual counterparts.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly fans call for her to fire her stylist\n\nThe nun\u2019s remarks shouldn\u2019t have come as a shock, according to Breitbart.\n\n\u201cMuch of what Sister Laurel spoke about comes directly from the Universal Catechism of the Catholic Church and should have been unremarkable given that she was talking at a Catholic high school,\u201d Breitbart reported\n\nStill, the president of college where Laurel teaches apologized for her remarks in an April 4 statement, adding, \u201cSister Jane Dominic has cancelled her speaking engagements and, at her request, is preparing to begin a sabbatical from teaching at Aquinas College.\u201d\n\nThe apology was as much an over-reaction as the anger vented by students and parents.\n\nA Catholic college shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for supporting church doctrine. And if the students and parents don\u2019t like it, they can always join another church.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Political correctness took an ugly turn last week when a Catholic nun was excoriated for lecturing against same-sex unions at a Catholic high school in North Carolina.
