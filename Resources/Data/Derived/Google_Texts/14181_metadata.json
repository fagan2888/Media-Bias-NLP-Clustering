While you as an employer may want to offer a group insurance plan that protects your employees, the reality is that it isn\u2019t always economically feasible to do so.\n\nWhat other options do you have? Premium reimbursement programs that eliminate the cost and hassle associated with insurance fees for employees provide an ideal solution. Even as you save your company money, the last thing you want to do is cut benefits that attract talent to your business. Fortunately, premium reimbursement programs offer a viable solution that works for both employer and employee.\n\nStaggering Health Care Costs Lead to Alternative Solutions\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health care expenditures just in 2013 reached $2.9 trillion dollars, 17.4 percent of the Gross Domestic Product in the country. This includes costs for hospital care, simple physician visits and prescriptions drugs. Americans pay out thousands of dollars each month to stay healthy, and many are opting out of essential health care simply because they can\u2019t afford it.\n\nThis is why a premium reimbursement plan can change the market. The process is simple: your company sets a monthly allowance for each employee, often based on family status or the job criteria of the individual. Your employees then use the marketplace to find the right insurance plan for their needs, choosing their own benefit and coverage levels. After the employees submit their monthly premium receipts, they are reimbursed up to their available health care balance. The money is tax free, putting more money back in the pocket of the employee.\n\nBenefits of Premium Reimbursement Programs\n\nThese programs offer unique benefits to employees, including:\n\nControl over the individual health insurance plan\n\nNo one-size-fits-all, rather the plan is customized to the employee\n\nFlexibility to tweak and change plans to fit the employee\n\nLower individual insurance costs\n\nPremium tax credits available to some individuals\n\nWhile group insurance plans are increasing in cost and bound by restrictions under the Affordable Care Act, premium reimbursement programs offer a viable solution to a frustrating problem.\n\nConclusion\n\nDefined Contribution Health Plans work across all industries to make health insurance simple for employees and employers. If you\u2019re looking for a win-win solution to the ongoing health care dilemma, this practical alternative can help.\n\nWhat questions do you have about premium reimbursement programs?
