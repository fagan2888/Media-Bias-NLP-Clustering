A fascinating analysis this week found that incumbent GOP governors who\u2019ve accepted Medicaid expansion are in far better electoral shape than Republicans who refused to embrace the health care policy.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett (R) has been in the latter category \u2013 the Republican had balked at Medicaid expansion and he\u2019s trailing badly in most polls \u2013 though as Greg Sargent reported yesterday, the governor just announced a big shift.\n\nIn another sign that the politics of Obamacare continue to shift, the Medicaid expansion is now all but certain to come to another big state whose Republican governor had previously resisted it: Pennsylvania. The federal government has approved Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett\u2019s application for the state\u2019s own version of the Medicaid expansion, without a handful of the conditions Corbett had hoped to impose\u2026. Corbett just announced that he will accept the expansion that has been offered, perhaps with some last-minute changes \u2013 expanding coverage and subsidies to as many as half a million people.\n\nAs a substantive matter, this is an important breakthrough. Pennsylvania is the nation\u2019s sixth-largest state by population, and with a stroke of the governor\u2019s pen, nearly 500,000 low-income adults are poised to gain access to medical care. For many, this may ultimately be a life-saving policy.\n\nCorbett\u2019s move also means there are now 27 states (plus the District of Columbia) that have embraced Medicaid expansion, including every state in the Northeast except Maine.\n\nAs for the politics, it\u2019s fascinating to see the degree to which health care politics have been turned on their ear. Here we have a Republican governor, down in the polls, looking to improve his standing with voters. What does he do? Corbett runs towards the Affordable Care Act, not away from it. For all the assumptions about \u201cObamacare\u201d being an electoral albatross, the evidence to the contrary keeps getting in the way.\n\nIndeed, this is arguably part of an important emerging pattern.\n\nIn May, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R), a fierce ACA critic, announced his willingness to work with the Obama administration on Medicaid expansion in his state, becoming the latest GOP governor to stop denying reality and arithmetic. This week, Republicans in Wyoming signaled their intention to do the same thing.\n\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the die-hard red states that refuse to consider the policy dwindles to only a handful.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "What does a GOP governor do when he's down in the polls?
