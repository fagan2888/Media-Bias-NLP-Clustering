But a report posted Tuesday at Carolina Journal Online is simply oozing bummer sauce:\n\nA sizable number of North Carolina residents are learning they are no longer eligible for Obamacare, and some health policy premiums could jump 60 percent within two years, an insurance official says. Rufus Langley, an Apex insurance agent and state leader of the North Carolina Association of Health Underwriters, said Coventry Health Care of the Carolinas CEO Tracy Baker recently told his group that substantially higher consumer costs are anticipated. \u201cHe can see in 2016 this thing shooting up anywhere from 30 to 60 percent in costs\u201d as delayed taxes start to kick in this year and next year, and medical care costs still rising, Langley said Monday at a Raleigh panel discussion. He said many of the small businesses his agency specializes in are giving up group insurance and sending employees to the subsidized exchange because of escalating costs.\n\nHow about those encouraging enrollment figures? That tidbit of good news hasn\u2019t gone stale, has it?\n\nWhile North Carolina has been touted by supporters of the Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is formally known, as one of the nation\u2019s top success stories in recruiting uninsured people to sign up on the HealthCare.gov exchange, Langley sounded a sour note. \u201cTermination letters are going out this month,\u201d he said. \u201cA fair amount [of consumers] didn\u2019t qualify\u201d for coverage, though he had no specific numbers. \u201cThere will be people who are going to be flushed out, and not eligible for subsidies, because they didn\u2019t provide the right information, or they didn\u2019t verify whether or not they were U.S. citizens,\u201d Langley said. Some never paid their premiums, Langley said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to pay to stay.\u201d\n\nI wonder how much \u201cpay to stay\u201d enthusiasm will wane after premiums go up by 30 to 60 percent.\n\nThat was just the bummer sauce on this grim hamburger of woe. Here\u2019s the all-beef patty of dismay:\n\nLangley and Chris Conover, a research scholar at Duke University\u2019s Center for Health Policy & Inequalities Research, said of the 7.3 million people who purchased plans nationally \u2014 a number the federal government recently scaled back from the original estimate of 8 million \u2014 many will end up owing the IRS money at the end of the year. That is because Obamacare requires participants to estimate their annual income at the beginning of the year. Subsidies are awarded based on those numbers. If an Obamacare participant earns more than expected, thus receiving a higher subsidy than allowed, the IRS could seize that overpayment at income tax return time. \u201cI would think it\u2019s probably going to be a minimum of 10 percent\u201d of Obamacare participants who will fall into that situation, Langley said. \u201cI would guess that the number is going to be in the millions,\u201d Conover said. \u201cAt least 1 million will end up having to pay the government back, and that\u2019s going to create a lot of chaos.\u201d\n\nThat does sound like a lot of fun, doesn\u2019t it? You\u2019d think the media would be warning Americans to get ready for their tax bills. Oh, wait, that\u2019s right: midterm elections. What the heck, it\u2019ll keep until December.\n\nSay, remember how ObamaCare critics have always maintained it was a built-to-fail Trojan horse for single-payer socialized medicine?\n\nConover advanced a proposal to replace Obamacare with a market-driven reform. Jonathan Kotch, a research professor at UNC-Chapel Hill\u2019s Gillings School of Global Public Health, spoke as president of Health Care for All of North Carolina, which advocates a government single-payer national health insurance system. \u201cI disagree that single-payer requires that health care delivery remain in private hands,\u201d Kotch said. \u201cSome single-payer systems such as those in socialist countries utilize both public financing and public delivery of care.\u201d His organization models its proposal after the Canadian medical care system in which private providers negotiate reimbursement contracts with the federal government. Keeping delivery private challenges the claim that single-payer is socialized medicine, he said, though doctors and hospitals would be nonprofit providers. \u201cIt is only the power of corporate interests that is preventing us from getting it right\u201d in the United States, Kotch said. \u201cThey\u2019ll do whatever they can to maximize profit.\u201d He opposes individuals or companies profiting from the delivery of health care. While Kotch believes some elements of Obamacare are positive steps, he says it did not go far enough. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is a good example of how political compromise for its own sake can lead to a bad outcome,\u201d Kotch said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act, while expanding access to care, is little more than a life preserver for insurance companies, which, if left to their own devices, probably would have cost themselves out of business.\u201d\n\nYes, because free-market companies allowed to do business without government interference tend to \u201ccost themselves out of business,\u201d and then no other companies ever come along to meet the demands of the marketplace. Capitalism is just everyone charging everybody else ridiculously high prices for everything, until they all go out of business. Why, there would hardly be any companies left at all, without the miraculous leadership of the same all-wise, all-knowing super-government that brought you HealthCare.gov, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and a steadily declining American workforce. We should all be grateful for government\u2019s magical power to conjure free stuff out of thin air, or we\u2019d all go broke paying for things.\n\nThe limits of fair-use oblige me to send you to Carolina Journal to read the rest of that free market vs. single-payer debate, but here\u2019s one more snippet that offers a look at what\u2019s going wrong with the Affordable Care Act at this very moment:\n\nAmong Obamacare\u2019s more objectionable flaws is that its costs reduce wages of low-paid workers in large firms \u201cby at least $1 an hour,\u201d while subsidizing workers who earn the same wage at small firms $9 an hour, he said. Subsidies are not available to employees at large firms. \u201cIn a sensible system, the government shouldn\u2019t be tilting the playing field in either direction,\u201d Conover said. Obamacare increases costs for the millennial generation, people in their 20s, by about 18 percent over their lifetime, Conover said, while using their higher payments to subsidize older people who typically have more income and wealth, and more health care needs. \u201cIt\u2019s a regressive tax.\u201d Obamacare will divert tens of billions of dollars from Medicare \u201cto fund a new entitlement, and that\u2019s going to jeopardize access to care for seniors, and it\u2019s also going to worsen Medicare\u2019s fiscal future,\u201d Conover said. Because low government reimbursement rates have led many doctors to stop accepting Medicaid patients, \u201cthe probability of ending up in the emergency room is higher for Medicaid patients\u201d than uninsured people, he said. Yet Obamacare wants to expand Medicaid by 30 percent. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d Obamacare will cover less than half of the nation\u2019s uninsured while adding $2 trillion to the national debt in its first two decades, and $6.2 trillion over a longer period, Conover said. It will cost 2.5 million jobs, and 10 million workers will be switched from full-time to part-time status, according to projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n\nWho cares what a program costs, as long as some politically-useful number of beneficiaries is pleased with what they receive? So what if compassion turns out to cost billions of dollars more than projected? All that matters are the promises, not the outcome. Only hard-charging capitalists care about what important goods and services cost, because they haven\u2019t accepted the catechism that what is Good must also be Free, no matter how expensive that gets.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Premium hikes, insurance cancellations, invalid enrollments, and overpaid subsidies... and the worst is yet to come.", "title": "Everything wrong with ObamaCare is on display in North Carolina | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/187238639-480x320.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/09/23/everything-wrong-with-obamacare-is-on-display-in-north-carolina/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Premium hikes, insurance cancellations, invalid enrollments, and overpaid subsidies... and the worst is yet to come.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/187238639-480x320.jpg", "creator": "@@Doc_0", "description": "Premium hikes, insurance cancellations, invalid enrollments, and overpaid subsidies... and the worst is yet to come.", "card": "summary", "site": "@humanevents"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0b2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey\u2019ll do whatever they can to maximize profit.\u201d He opposes individuals or companies profiting from the delivery of health care.\nHealthcareNorth Carolina was supposedly one of the big ObamaCare success stories, at least in terms of how many people signed up.\nJonathan Kotch, a research professor at UNC-Chapel Hill\u2019s Gillings School of Global Public Health, spoke as president of Health Care for All of North Carolina, which advocates a government single-payer national health insurance system.\n\u201cI disagree that single-payer requires that health care delivery remain in private hands,\u201d Kotch said.\nSay, remember how ObamaCare critics have always maintained it was a built-to-fail Trojan horse for single-payer socialized medicine?"}
