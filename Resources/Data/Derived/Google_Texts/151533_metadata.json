Or if you\u2019re one of those \u201cupper middle class\u201d types who earn \u201cwell into the six-figure range yet don\u2019t feel rich, either because of their student loan debt or the enormous cost of the amenities they consider nonnegotiable: living in well-above-average school districts for those with children or living in \u2018cool\u2019 neighborhoods for those without.\u201d\n\nWhat side are you on? In a new column at The Daily Beast, I take issue with conservatives (such as Reihan Salam, the executive editor of National Review) and liberals (such as Josh Barro of The New York Times and Monica Potts of the Beast) in vilifying wealthy-but-not-rich people as one of the reasons why America is going down the tubes.\n\n\u201cThe upper-middle-class vote and get on the phone with their Congressperson any time a proposal like Obama\u2019s [529 reform] comes up, ready to kill it before it gets started,\u201d writes Potts. For such reasons, other, much-bigger tax reforms\u2014getting rid of the deductions for mortgage interest and for state and local taxes, for example\u2014can never happen.... Indeed, for Salam at least, the upper middle class wields power so absolute as to be unstoppable. \u201cThe upper middle class controls the media we consume,\u201d he says. \u201cThey run our big bureaucracies, our universities, and our hospitals. Their voices drown out those of other people at almost every turn.\u201d\n\nThe last time somebody associated with National Review saw such a vast, powerful network, it was probably John Derbyshire talking about \"homosexualists\" in the early '00s.\n\nIn my Beast piece, I suggest that trying to guilt or gull the upper middle class into paying higher taxes is unlikely to succeed, especially if your goal is to actually bring government budgets into balance and direct limited resources toward those in true need:\n\nHow to bring spending down to that level is the conversation we need to be having, not one about how to squeeze a few more dollars out of the awful upper middle class with their Whole Foods, their artisanal cheeses, and their fancy cars. The trouble with our welfare state isn\u2019t that the numbers don\u2019t add up. It\u2019s not a math problem. It\u2019s a vision problem: There\u2019s simply no way to be all things to all people.... I may not speak for many other upper-middle-class types, but I\u2019ll tell you what: I\u2019m happy to have the government spend less on me if I know it\u2019s spending less altogether and is directing what money it does spend to people who need it more than I do. But if you\u2019re simply talking about raising taxes in order to maintain the bloated status quo plus a bunch of new programs, count me out. That\u2019s not because I\u2019m selfish. It\u2019s because I\u2019m not stupid.\n\nRead the full article here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "America, we have a new enemy which \u201cthreaten[s] to destroy everything that is best in our country,\" according a range of voices on the right and the", "title": "Upper-Middle-Class Americans Are the New Kulaks", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/02/06/upper-middle-class-americans-are-the-new", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14232322121567.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "America,\nwe have a new enemy which \u201cthreaten[s] to destroy everything that\nis best in our country,\" according a range of voices on the right\nand the left.\n\nYou may be joining me in the reeducation camps if you have\nbothered preparing for your kids\u2019 college via so-called 529 plans,\nwhich allow for tax-exempt gains on higher education savings.
