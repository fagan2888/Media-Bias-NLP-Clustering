Their beef: Granite doctors were sending too many patients to Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital-Milton instead of to Quincy Medical Center, where they work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is an interesting story behind their complaints, but more on that later. For now, focus on the fact that Quincy is controlled by Steward Health Care System, a for-profit medical group that owns 10 Massachusetts hospitals. Some of them appear to be under increasing financial stress.\n\nWhile union organizers protested in Quincy last week, Steward executives rolled out plans to bring two other hospitals it owns \u201ccloser together.\u201d Steward intends to merge Merrimack Valley Hospital in Haverhill and Holy Family Hospital in Methuen onto a single hospital license.\n\nSteward says this will put both hospitals on a \u201cstronger financial footing,\u201d but no one, neither patients nor employees, should notice any difference. Good luck with that.\n\nYou won\u2019t be surprised to learn the company disagrees with me about the financial situation at some of its hospitals.\n\n\u201cOver the last three years, Steward has taken a group of chronically distressed hospitals and put them on a path to financial stability,\u201d says spokeswoman Brooke Thurston. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress and are headed in the right direction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s true at some Steward hospitals, but the limited financial figures made public show facilities headed in several directions.\n\nAmong Steward\u2019s 10 hospitals, five reported operating losses through the first nine months of 2013, the most recent data available. The 10 posted an aggregate operating gain of about $2.9 million.\n\nQuincy Medical Center, by far the worst performer, recorded an operating loss of $14.6 million. Holy Family made $7.5 million but its much smaller merger partner, Merrimack Valley, lost just as much.\n\nSteward likes to point out that the financial performance of its hospitals is skewed by the many millions it spent to upgrade facilities in desperate need of attention.\n\nBut investments don\u2019t distort something called net patient service revenue. That\u2019s a way of counting how much hospitals collect for taking care of patients, and those revenues were down at seven of Steward\u2019s 10 hospitals through Sept. 30.\n\nOverall at Steward, those revenues were off about 3 percent. But at Quincy, they were down nearly 18 percent. Patient revenues fell 14 percent at Merrimack Valley.\n\nDeclining patient revenues are not unique to Steward. Recently, I talked to several hospital executives who call them an industry trend caused by tougher payment rules in the Affordable Care Act, among other things.\n\nBut Steward\u2019s private equity owners spent big money on the idea that more patients would use improved facilities. Build it and they will come. It really doesn\u2019t matter much why patient revenues are getting squeezed.\n\nHospitals make all kinds of deals to secure a steady flow of patients. In Quincy, the protesters complained about Granite Medical but really pointed to a deal struck at a higher level \u2014 between Atrius and Beth Israel Deaconess in Boston. Atrius doctors send patients to Beth Israel in large numbers every year.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing for doctors to refer complex cases to big-city hospitals, but once Beth Israel acquired Milton Hospital, the protesters complain, the same arrangement simply directed care to a different local facility.\n\nEvery hospital needs patients. Some Steward hospitals need more of them.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.3063621799", "eomportal-id": 1895091, "description": "You don\u2019t often see a labor union picketing medical offices, but that\u2019s what happened last week in Quincy.
