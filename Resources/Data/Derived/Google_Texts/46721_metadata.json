The pope with a few words has unsettled so much.\u201d\n\nArchbold said that he\u2019s concerned that the pope's words will be used against anti-abortion activists and opponents of gay marriage in the United States.\n\nBut after thinking and praying about the pope's remarks, Archbold said, he decided that being unsettled may not be \"such a terrible thing.\"\n\n\"I think the pope was reminding us that we're a religion of 'yes.'\"\n\nMORE ON CNN: Pope Francis: Church can't 'interfere' with gays\n\nBefore the release of Thursday\u2019s interview, Bishop Thomas Tobin of Rhode Island said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Francis had not spoken much about abortion. On Friday, Tobin welcomed the pope\u2019s comments, but said it won\u2019t change his focus.\n\n\u201cI have spoken out clearly about the dignity of all human life and the nature of holy matrimony as designed by God and will continue to do so whenever the situation warrants,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cIt is a demand of the Gospel.\u201d\n\nThe bishop also said, however, that he appreciates the new pope\u2019s \u201cbalanced and inclusive\u201d approach.\n\nOther conservative Catholics said the media and liberals had misconstrued the pope\u2019s remarks, made in a 12,000-word interview published Thursday in 16 Jesuit journals around the world.\n\n\u201cThe pope is a reformer, but not a revolutionary,\u201d Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Civil and Religious Rights, told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo.\n\n\u201cThis is the problem with the left,\" Dohonue continued, \"they are trying to take what the pope said and then run with it.\u201d\n\nDonohue, a caustic and sometimes controversial critic of people he perceives as anti-Catholic, said the pope\u2019s remarks won\u2019t silence him.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing the pope said that should give relief to people who say all of a sudden now that conservatives should shut up,\u201d Donahue said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to shut up because we\u2019re in consonant compliance with what the pope said. \u201c\n\nAfter all, conservatives say, it\u2019s not like the pope changed Catholic doctrine in Thursday\u2019s interview.\n\nTo underscore that point, the conservative blog Rorate Caeli posted a lengthy quote from the pope\u2019s meeting with Catholic gynecologists on Friday in which he strongly denounced abortion.\n\n\u201cEach child who is unborn, but is unjustly condemned to be aborted, bears the face of Jesus Christ, bears the face of the Lord,\u201d the pope said, according to Rorate Caeli\u2019s translation. \u201cThey cannot be discarded, as the `culture of waste\u2019 proposes.\u201d\n\nFather John Zuhlsdorf, a conservative Catholic blogger, said the pope urged Catholics to find a \u201cnew balance\u201d between their moral and political missions. He didn\u2019t say they should surrender the culture wars.\n\n\u201cI think that Francis thinks that constant correction and condemnation does more harm than good,\u201d Zuhlsdorf wrote on his blog.\n\n\u201cFrancis said `all the time,\" Zuhlsdorf said.\"He did not say `we should not talk about these things.\u2019\"\n\nMORE ON CNN: The pope said what? Six stunners from Francis\n\nOther conservatives said the pope's remarks are \u201cnothing new.\u201d\n\n\"The pope is not in any way proposing that the church should abandon important moral and social teachings,\u201d said Ashley McGuire of the Catholic Association.\n\n\"Rather, the pope is reaffirming a longstanding teaching that reaches all the way back to the founding of Christianity: love your neighbor.\u201d\n\nAnd while most liberals praised the pope\u2019s bold new vision, some took issue with his remarks about women\u2019s role in the church.\n\n\u201cWe have to work harder to develop a theology of women in the church,\u201d Francis said in Thursday's interview.\n\n\u201cBreaking news, Pope Francis: There is already a profound theology of women,\" said Sister Maureen Fielder, a Catholic nun and longtime advocate of women\u2019s ordination in the Catholic Church.\n\n\u201cThere are libraries of feminist theology just waiting for you, and others, to dive in.\u201d\n\nFielder said she likes the new pope, but she thinks he \u201csorely needs a course in feminist theology.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, however, liberals praised Francis.\n\nUnder previous popes, liberal Catholic nuns, politicians and theologians were castigated by church leaders, said John Gehring, a writer and advocate at the group Faith in Public Life. Now \u201cthe air is starting to clear,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPope Francis is rescuing the Catholic Church from those grim-faced watchdogs of orthodoxy who in windowless rooms reduce Catholicism to a laundry list of nos,\u201d Gehring said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke,\u00a0CNN Belief Blog Co-editor (CNN)\u00a0-- \u201cRain on parched land.\u201d \u201cA bold new course.\u201d \u201cRevolutionary.\u201d That\u2019s how liberal Catholics responded to the stunning\u00a0interview published Thursday in which Pope Francis bluntly said the church shouldn\u2019t be \u201cobse...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Conservatives 'disturbed' by pope's remarks", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/20/conservatives-disturbed-by-popes-new-course/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130920080810-exp-newday-cuomo-donahue-part1-00003308-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke,\u00a0CNN Belief Blog Co-editor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(CNN)\u00a0-- \u201cRain on parched land.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA bold new course.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cRevolutionary.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s how liberal Catholics responded to the stunning\u00a0interview published Thursday in which Pope Francis bluntly said the church shouldn\u2019t be \u201cobse...", "title": "Conservatives 'disturbed' by pope's remarks"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "belief, catholic church, culture wars, faith, gay marriage, pope francis, catholic church, catholicism, pope francis", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/09/20/conservatives-disturbed-by-popes-new-course/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0b6\"", "article_summary": "But after thinking and praying about the pope's remarks, Archbold said, he decided that being unsettled may not be \"such a terrible thing.\"\nOther conservative Catholics said the media and liberals had misconstrued the pope\u2019s remarks, made in a 12,000-word interview published Thursday in 16 Jesuit journals around the world.\n\u201cWe have to work harder to develop a theology of women in the church,\u201d Francis said in Thursday's interview.\nMORE ON CNN: Pope Francis: Church can't 'interfere' with gaysBefore the release of Thursday\u2019s interview, Bishop Thomas Tobin of Rhode Island said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that Francis had not spoken much about abortion.\n\u201cPope Francis is rescuing the Catholic Church from those grim-faced watchdogs of orthodoxy who in windowless rooms reduce Catholicism to a laundry list of nos,\u201d Gehring said."}
