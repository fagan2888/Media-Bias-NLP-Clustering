(Courtesy Akili)\n\n\n\nhttp://www.kqed.org/.stream/anon/radio/science/2015/04/20150406science.mp3\n\nI\u2019m driving through a frozen world, where the roads are paved in ice. As I swerve left to avoid a mini iceberg, a red fish flashes at the top of my screen. I\u2019m supposed to tap all the red fish that pop up, but not the green fish or the blue birds. And I have to do this without crashing the car.\n\n\u201cDoing one thing at a time is easy, but doing them both at the same time is where the magic happens!\u201d says the omnipresent gamemeister\u2013 an unidentifiable animal with an unidentifiable accent wearing a white doctor\u2019s coat.\n\nThe better I do at tagging the red fish and ignoring the green ones, the more excited the doctor on screen gets.\n\n\u201cA-mazing!\u201d he says.\n\nAs I get better at the game, my brain is being trained to ignore distractions and stay focused in real life. Or at least that\u2019s the hypothesis of the neuroscientists who designed the game.\n\nThe brain network that controls multitasking connects with networks that control memory and attention span. So by playing the game, some scientists believe you can improve cognitive skills, and by extension, relieve a range of symptoms associated with attention deficit disorder, and other conditions.\n\n\u201cThere will definitely come a time when games are part of the overall treatment plan,\u201d Willis Gee, Cigna\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through eight or nine completed clinical trials, in all cognitive disorders: ADHD, autism, depression,\u201d says Matt Omernick, the executive creative director at Akili, the start-up in Larkspur that is developing the game.\n\nAs consumers download mobile health games at booming rates, Omernick and his team are taking a very different approach to their Silicon Valley counterparts in bringing their game to market.\n\nWhile most start-ups have opted to market and sell their mobile weight loss games and diabetes trackers directly to consumers, Akili has decided to pursue the long, expensive, risky path of clinical trials through the Food and Drug Administration. If successful, their game would be the first to be approved for medical use by the FDA.\n\n\u201cThe first time those three letters were uttered in a group setting everyone\u2019s like, \u2018Oooh, that\u2019s scary, do we want to do that?\u2019\u201d recalls Omernick.\n\nIf start-ups sidestep the FDA and sell directly to consumers, they can bring a game to market in six months. For Akili, it will take four years to get their game, Project Evo, through the agency.\n\nBut the start-up believes that will pay off. If the FDA gives its stamp of approval, doctors could prescribe the game. And that opens the door for insurance companies to pay for it.\n\n\u201cThere will definitely come a time when games are part of the overall treatment plan,\u201d says Willis Gee, Director of IT Strategy and Innovation at Cigna.\n\nHealth reform and the technology revolution have changed the competitive landscape for health insurance companies. Gee says they have to be more responsive to consumers.\n\n\u201cThey tell us what they want,\u201d he says, \u201cand if we can\u2019t satisfy that, they\u2019ll go somewhere else.\u201d\n\nAnd what consumers want are games.\n\nGee says Cigna believes the explosive popularity in games could be harnessed to educate patients about medical issues and motive them to be more proactive about their health.\n\n\u201cIf you think of an individual\u2019s willingness to play Candy Crush or Angry Birds, they\u2019re willing to do that,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different approach, but it\u2019s one that integrates into the lifestyle of individuals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to look at ourselves and ask, okay are we really going to try to change medicine?\u201d Matt Omernick, Akili\n\nOmernick and his team believe the clinical results of Project Evo could have a profound effect on the health care system. They\u2019re hoping the trials show that the game is so effective at improving attention span and other cognitive skills, that it may reduce, or even replace, the pills that kids need to take for ADHD.\n\n\u201cWe had to look at ourselves and ask, okay are we really going to try to change medicine, yes or no. And the answer was yes,\u201d Omernick says. \u201cAnd so you have to be as serious as you can about FDA approval and regulation across the board.\u201d\n\nPharmaceutical companies are also keeping a close eye on the process. Pfizer is partnering with Akili on one of its clinical trials looking at Alzheimers diagnosis. Though the FDA approval process is grueling by gaming industry standards, it\u2019s a cakewalk compared to the time biotech companies invest in drug development. It takes most drugs ten years to get through the FDA process and could cost half a billion dollars.\n\n\u201cAnd it could fail at the last step,\u201d says Adam Gazzaley, a neuroscientist at the University of California-San Francisco and the creator of the prototype that became Project Evo.\n\nGazzaley says he is cautiously optimistic about how Project Evo will fare in FDA clinical trials. Research on other video games for health has yielded mixed results \u2013 and inspired much internal debate among scientists. Some say the only thing these games make you better at is the game itself.\n\nGazzaley\u2019s research is seen as an exception in scientific communities. He tested his prototype of Project Evo on older adults and found that they showed measurable improvement on standard cognitive tests for working memory and focus \u2013 and the effects lasted six months after they stopped playing the game. That research was published in Nature in 2013.\n\nThe clinical trials that Project Evo has undertaken to support its FDA application will determine if those results can be replicated for different age groups and to treat specific cognitive conditions.\n\nThe trials will also investigate if there are negative side effects of the game. It\u2019s another concern raised by critics, that people sometimes get so hooked on games, they can\u2019t stop playing them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Gazzaley says. \u201cWe built these games to be highly engaging and immersive and some people respond to that type of interactivity with an addictive response.\u201d\n\nGazzaley says the scientists working on Project Evo are looking at ways to manage such negative side effects.\n\n\u201cThe game locks out after a certain period of time. You play it for 20 minutes, and you can\u2019t play it for another 24 hours,\u201d he says.\n\nGazzaley is watching closely to see what happens with the clinical trials for Project Evo. If it is approved by the FDA, he has another four games in development that he hopes will be next.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Neuroscientists hope their video game will be the first approved by the FDA", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Play This Video Game and Call Me in the Morning\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/futureofyou\\/2015\\/04\\/06\\/play-this-video-game-and-call-me-in-the-morning\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-06 06:00:37\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-04-06 09:59:15\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":1254,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"ADHD\",\"FDA\",\"kqedscience\",\"video games\",\"wellness\"],\"categories\":[\"KQED Future Of You\",\"KQED News\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/futureofyou\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/13\\/2015\\/04\\/Health-games_featured.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED Future of You", "description": "Neuroscientists hope their video game will be the first approved by the FDA", "title": "Play This Video Game and Call Me in the Morning", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/futureofyou/2015/04/06/play-this-video-game-and-call-me-in-the-morning/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/futureofyou/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/04/Health-games_1-800x600.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Neuroscientists hope their video game will be the first approved by the FDA", "title": "Play This Video Game and Call Me in the Morning", "image": {"width": 2063, "identifier": "http://ww2.kqed.org/futureofyou/wp-content/uploads/sites/13/2015/04/Health-games_featured.png", "height": 1453}, "site": "@KQED", "widgets": {"link-color": "#000000", "border-color": "#000000"}, "partner": "tfwp", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A girl plays Project: Evo, a video game neuroscientists believe could be used to treat ADHD, autism, and other conditions.\nFor Akili, it will take four years to get their game, Project Evo, through the agency.\nGazzaley is watching closely to see what happens with the clinical trials for Project Evo.\nGazzaley says he is cautiously optimistic about how Project Evo will fare in FDA clinical trials.\nPfizer is partnering with Akili on one of its clinical trials looking at Alzheimers diagnosis."}
