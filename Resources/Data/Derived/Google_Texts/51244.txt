Goodlettsville resident Connie Maynord will represent Sumner County in the Ms. Senior America Pageant on May 16 in Lebanon.

Maynord, a retired school and hospital dietician, has been pursuing her “dream career” for the past 10 years. She is a model and a Screen Actors Guild-eligible actor. Maynord has appeared in More magazine, commercials and various films and TV shows. She also teaches manners and basic modeling classes.

For the talent portion of the pageant, which honors women who have reached the “age of elegance,” Maynord will show off her skills as an actor by telling a dramatic documentary story.

“The Ms. Senior Tennessee America Pageant is very exciting to me,” Maynord said. “When I first decided to be in the pageant, I told my family, ‘I’m as young as I’ll ever be, at my prettiest today, and my healthiest, so I’m going for it.’

Good genes run in her family. Her mother was a high school beauty queen and her aunt modeled with Ford Modeling in Detroit.

She will wear a gown from local designer Johnathan Kayne and fashions by Chico’s in Hendersonville.

“We are very proud and honored to have Mrs. Connie Maynord representing Sumner County in this pageant. She is an active member of Holidayfest of Sumner County, the Newcomers and Community Club of Sumner County and has been a moving force in making sure that films and television opportunities come to Sumner County,” said Anthony Holt, Sumner County executive.

The pageant will begin at 7 p.m. at Cumberland University. Tickets may be purchased at the door and are $15 for adults and $10 for children 12 and under. For those who want to attend but not drive, a bus will be leaving the Sears parking lot in Hendersonville at 6 p.m. for a fee of $10 per rider. You must RSVP by May 11 to levjen@gmail.com.
