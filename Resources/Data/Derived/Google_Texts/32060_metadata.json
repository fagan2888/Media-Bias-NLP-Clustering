They both appreciate the demands the orchestra places on them.\n\nBoaman joined the orchestra because, he said, \"I was looking for a place to play at, other than school, because I wasn't being challenged.\"\n\nThe orchestra members are there because they want to be, not because they need the credit in school, Stark said.\n\n\"Everybody there cares about the music,\" she said.\n\nAlthough just being in the orchestra offers that opportunity, preparing for this weekend's \"Side-by-Side\" concert also allows the students to learn from adult performers who sit next to them during rehearsals and the concert.\n\n\"It's just cool to play next to somebody who's played for 30 years,\" Boaman said. The adults show him different positions to use and how to get a better sound from his cello, he said.\n\n\"They make you feel good about it, even if you're not sounding good,\" he said.\n\nKaLia Bernstein, 14, just started playing the French horn in October; she's played the clarinet for four years.\n\nAs a beginner, she is most appreciative of the chance to learn from experienced players.\n\n\"It's really a cool experience to be working with the adults because they're much better musicians than us,\" KaLia said. \"The adults are always teaching us and giving up little tips.\"\n\nAnother advantage of performing with the adults is the enriching of the orchestra's sound, Hertz said.\n\n\"It makes our music even better, Hertz said. \"It's great for the audience and it's great for the musicians, too.\"\n\nBoaman agreed.\n\n\"I just can't wait to hear ourselves playing (\"Jupiter\") with other players who play it professionally,\" he said.\n\nVictoria Camron can be reached at 303-684-5226 or vcamron@times-call.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/entertainment/ci_24942377/longmont-students-excited-play-holsts-jupiter-symphony", "modificationDate": "2014-01-18T17:08:18-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/0118/20140118__19tcalys1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Victoria A.F.
