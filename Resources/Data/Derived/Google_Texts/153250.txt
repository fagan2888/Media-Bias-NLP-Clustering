A man is in critical condition after being shot several times at a Colorado Springs apartment Saturday morning.

"I was on the phone with my girlfriend when all of a sudden I hear...gunshots go off, about six to eight gunshots," neighbor Nicholas Montoya told 11 News.

"There was a brief pause...then another exchange of gunfire," he added. "About six more."

Police say several people in the area called 911 around 2:40 a.m. reporting gunshots. When officers got to the Greentree Village Apartments on 3562 N. Carefree Circle, they found a badly injured 29-year-old man. He was rushed to the hospital. Police say he's in critical condition, but stable.

Officers say the man was shot following a disturbance in one of the apartments, which carried over outside to the parking lot where the shooting took place. Several people have been detained and interviewed in connection to the shooting, but no arrests have been made.

The investigation is ongoing.
