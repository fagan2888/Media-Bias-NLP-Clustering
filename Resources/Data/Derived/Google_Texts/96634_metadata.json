She\u2019s had a toothache for four months, and the pain medications she takes are eating away stomach lining.\n\nNo matter what the dental horror story \u2014 and there were stories of botched dental work and plenty more of difficulties finding affordable care or dentists willing to accept Medicaid \u2014 people at Peoria\u2019s first Mission of Mercy had nothing but gratitude for the dental volunteers at the massive makeshift free dental clinic that began Friday at the Civic Center. Doors open again at 6 a.m. Saturday.\n\n\u201cIf I had to wait sun up to sun down, I\u2019d do it,\u201d said Gwendolyn Young of Bloomington, who took a day off work.\n\n\u201cThis came right on time,\u201d said Peorian Ken Knight, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran of the Vietnam War and retired construction worker who camped inside the Civic Center overnight to be first in line when doors opened at 6 a.m. He had been nursing toothaches with over-the-counter pain medication for months.\n\nWhether providence or coincidence, a military veteran first in line at a free dental clinic shines a piercing light into the dark holes in the nation\u2019s health care system. The Illinois State Dental Society Foundation began sponsoring the first-come, first-serve clinics in 2010 to highlight the need for affordable, accessible dental care and to influence public policy.\n\nWhile the Veterans\u2019 Administration only provides dental care to veterans with service-related disabilities or those who are homeless, the Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t address adult dental care at all.\n\nThat\u2019s not likely to change soon, said U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin as he greeted volunteers and patients Friday.\n\n\u201cI think we should treat dental care like all other forms of medical care,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cI think we should expand the Affordable Care Act to include it, but it\u2019s going to take some time.\u201d\n\nMany of the dentists volunteering at Mission of Mercy do not accept Medicaid. They say Illinois\u2019 reimbursement rates are too low to break even.\n\nIllinois will reinstitute Medicaid coverage for non-emergency adult dental care Oct. 1 after cutting it in a round of reforms two years ago. But sticky issues, such as reimbursement rates and what procedures will be covered, haven\u2019t been worked out yet, Howell said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mission of Mercy volunteers provided basic extractions, fillings, cleanings and limited root canals for adults and children.\n\nAbout 1,100 people, some from as far away as Iowa, had come through the doors by 1 p.m. Friday, forcing the clinic to stop accepting new patients for the day. Mission of Mercy clinics prepare to treat 1,000 patients a day.\n\nTwo people of about a dozen people who were turned away decided they\u2019d wait at the Civic Center for the second day of treatment.\n\nRoy Allen of Peoria was among those turned away. He decided he\u2019d wait at the Civic Center because otherwise he wouldn\u2019t get there early enough using public transportation.\n\nJoann Kim of Peoria also decided to wait.\n\n\u201cThis a my idea of camping out,\u201d she said. \u201cTo get about $300 worth of free dental care, I can wait 15 hours.\u201d\n\nAllen will be first in line Saturday, Kim will be second. She\u2019s a veteran of the U.S. Women\u2019s Army Corps.\n\nPam Adams can be reached at 686-3245 or padams@pjstar.com.
