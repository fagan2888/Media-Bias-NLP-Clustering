Usually it\u2019s one or the other.\n\nWhen the president is unpopular or when he\u2019s lost control of his agenda or when he just seems inadequate to the demands of the job, the headline \u201cThe Incredible Shrinking Presidency\u201d proliferates like kudzu. When the Republicans lost control of Congress in 2006, The Economist proclaimed \u201cThe Incredible Shrinking Presidency\u201d of George W. Bush on its cover. Barack Obama has been diagnosed with presidential shrinkage many times, including in Politico, the New York Times, and my own National Review.\n\nThe flip side of the shrinking presidency is the imperial presidency, something we\u2019ve been fretting about, by name, since at least Franklin Roosevelt and in principle since the Founding.\n\nPolitically, what is remarkable is that Obama seems to be doing both at the same time. His \u201cYear of Action\u201d \u2014 intended to dispel that lame-duck scent \u2014 is simultaneously Caesar-like and pathetic. (Maybe the presidential seal should depict that dude from the Little Caesars pizza commercials?) Last week, he announced that he would unilaterally raise the minimum wage for federal contractors seeking new work. Only 1 percent of the workforce makes the minimum wage, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and vanishingly few of them work for the federal government. This probably explains why the White House wouldn\u2019t give an actual number when asked how many people his bold action would benefit.\n\nYet, at the Democratic retreat last week, Obama threw cold water on the idea that he could do much more on immigration from the Oval Office, saying there are \u201couter limits to what we can do by executive action.\u201d\n\nSome of his unilateral actions are a bigger deal, of course. The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s decision to treat carbon dioxide as a \u201cpollutant\u201d is an outrageous expansion of executive power. But Obama doesn\u2019t tout that as a bullet point; he let the EPA take the political heat for that decision a while ago. His multiple unilateral revisions to Obamacare run the gamut from desperate tinkering to outright lawlessness. But flop-sweat panic to compensate for executive incompetence and to fend off a rout in the midterms doesn\u2019t exactly project presidential boldness either.\n\nThe \u201cYear of Action\u201d should actually be seen as a replay of President Clinton\u2019s small-ball comeback after the 1994 midterms. Clinton picked micro-initiatives \u2014 school uniforms, the V-chip, etc. \u2014 that poll-tested well but amounted to very little in terms of policy. The clever twist Obama is putting on his micro-agenda is doing it in a way that successfully baits opponents into making the case that he\u2019s more powerful and relevant than he really is.\n\nSubstantively, however, the imperial presidency continues to metastasize. The presidency, the Cato Institute\u2019s Gene Healy has written, \u201ckeeps shrinking, but \u2014 with an executive branch of some 2.1 million civilian employees and counting \u2014 it never gets any smaller.\u201d As a branch of government, it has grown under Republicans and Democrats alike. Some curbs were put on the office under Richard Nixon because of Watergate, and because Democrats don\u2019t like it when Republican presidents behave like Democratic ones.\n\n\u201cThose who tried to warn us back at the beginning of the New Deal of the dangers of one-man rule that lay ahead on the path we were taking toward strong, centralized government may not have been so wrong,\u201d Democratic Senator Alan Cranston of California remarked in 1973 during Watergate.\n\nThat\u2019s a lesson Democrats would do well to ponder, because they are rhetorically giving Obama license to do whatever he likes. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D.,Texas) recently declared that the priority for her and her comrades should be to draft executive orders \u2014 not laws \u2014 for Obama to sign. Representative Xavier Becerra (D., Calif.) suggested on Fox News Sunday that the president could rewrite Obamacare at whim because the Constitution gives him the power to act during a national security threat. And of course, Senator Harry Reid (D., Nev.) blew up the filibuster rules for appointees.\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t be surprised if the next Republican president takes advantage of that license.\n\n\u2014 Jonah Goldberg is the author of The Tyranny of Clich\u00e9s, now on sale in paperback.
