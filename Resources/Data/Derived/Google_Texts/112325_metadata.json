The medical device manufacturer laid off 1,000 employees citing Obamacare\u2019s Medical Device Tax, one of the law\u2019s 20 new or higher taxes. Stryker owes the government upwards of $100 million dollars this year alone and projects that Obamacare will cost them 20 percent of their research and development funds.\n\nBack in November of 2011, the company first announced that it would have to lay off 5% of its 20,000 employees in response to the new 2.3% medical device tax. This isn\u2019t at all surprising. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected that the tax would be passed on to consumers, and what Stryker couldn\u2019t compensate for by raising prices, they made up for in layoffs.\n\nMedical device manufacturers employ 360,000 people nationwide. Like Stryker, these companies will be forced to make tough decisions to stay afloat. One study estimates that up to 10% of the medical device industry workforce\u2014or 47,100 individuals\u2014 could be laid off due to the new tax.\n\nNot only does the medical device tax affect employees of these plants, but patients as well. Rising medical device costs will make necessities like pacemakers less affordable for those who rely on them. A decrease in research investments will prevent expensive medical products from ever becoming affordable, and will cheat patients out of newer, more effective technologies.\n\nStryker exemplifies everything that is wrong with the medical device tax. It kills jobs and stifles innovation at the expense of employees, patients, and taxpayers.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "pocket-site-verification": "e8a03e904ad67c23ec990c1928577c", "og": {"url": "https://www.atr.org/obamacare-forces-layoffs-a7856", "type": "article", "site_name": "Americans for Tax Reforms", "description": "Stryker Corp.", "title": "Obamacare Forces 1,000 Layoffs"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 21200647, "pages": 8127889355}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c70\"", "article_summary": "The medical device manufacturer laid off 1,000 employees citing Obamacare\u2019s Medical Device Tax, one of the law\u2019s 20 new or higher taxes.\nIt kills jobs and stifles innovation at the expense of employees, patients, and taxpayers.\nStryker exemplifies everything that is wrong with the medical device tax.\nNot only does the medical device tax affect employees of these plants, but patients as well.\nRising medical device costs will make necessities like pacemakers less affordable for those who rely on them."}
