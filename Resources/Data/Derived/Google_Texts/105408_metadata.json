Clark, M.D., a resident at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Boston Children's Hospital, contends in the piece.\n\nSome hospitals acknowledge that they treat VIP patients more quickly in the emergency department, Clark writes. But it calls into question what that means for patients who aren't attended to as quickly.\n\nHe also suggests that VIPs may receive worse care because doctors feel pressured to order unnecessary tests or prescribe medicine that probably won't work.\n\nThe bottom line, he says: \"When I allow one of my patients to be labeled 'important,' do I implicitly label the others as less important?\"\n\nSome nurses seem to think so. Author Alexandra Robbins recently detailed complaints by nurses about the five-star treatment their celebrity and VIP patients receive, including larger rooms, big-screen TVs and better food--often on separate floors, FierceHealthcare previously reported. One complained that the sickest patients were often moved farther from the nursing station in favor of less-critical VIP patients.\n\nWhile Clark notes that VIPs receive concierge-level care at many of the nation's top hospitals, the trend toward deluxe amenities isn't limited to the rich and powerful. Some critics question whether high-end hospital accommodations and amenities are adding unneeded costs while focusing more on hospitality than on healthcare in an effort to improve patient satisfaction scores.\n\nTo learn more information:\n\n- here's the opinion piece\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nNurses: Keepers of healthcare's dirty little secrets?\n\nAre high-end, hotel-like amenities a waste of money?\n\nConcentrated concierge practices: Too much of a good thing?\n\nWorkers slam UC medical centers for prioritizing profit\n\nHospitals cater to wealthy patients despite safety net mission", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals that use resources to provide VIP treatment for a select few patients create more harm than good, a doctor argues in an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0for\u00a0The\u00a0New York Times.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals that use resources to provide VIP treatment for a select few patients create more harm than good, a doctor argues in an\u00a0opinion piece\u00a0for\u00a0The\u00a0New York Times.", "title": "Deluxe treatment for the rich and famous hurts patients--and hospitals", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/deluxe-treatment-rich-and-famous-hurts-patients-and-hospitals/2015-10-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,concierge service,deluxe rooms,New York Times,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient satisfaction,Shoa Clark,VIP treatment", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a05\"", "article_summary": "One complained that the sickest patients were often moved farther from the nursing station in favor of less-critical VIP patients.\nSome hospitals acknowledge that they treat VIP patients more quickly in the emergency department, Clark writes.\nWhile Clark notes that VIPs receive concierge-level care at many of the nation's top hospitals, the trend toward deluxe amenities isn't limited to the rich and powerful.\nHospitals that use resources to provide VIP treatment for a select few patients create more harm than good, a doctor argues in an opinion piece for The New York Times.\nAuthor Alexandra Robbins recently detailed complaints by nurses about the five-star treatment their celebrity and VIP patients receive, including larger rooms, big-screen TVs and better food--often on separate floors, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
