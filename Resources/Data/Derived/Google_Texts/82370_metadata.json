It\u2019s well known preventing obesity can ultimately save the healthcare system millions of dollars, but is there any financial payback for insurers? Dr. David Ludwig, director of the new Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Children\u2019s Hospital, Boston, thinks not. He told Kaiser Health News that there\u2019s no real incentive for payers to cover better obesity prevention and treatment because the costs are immediate and the benefits are long-term. According to Ludwig \u201cit doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense for individual plans when families change policies every three to five years.\u201d\n\nEven so, under the Affordable Care Act, insurers are now required to cover screening and counseling for obesity. And many are going above and beyond with both local and national obesity prevention efforts. So what, exactly have the major insurers been doing? Here\u2019s a rundown of just a few of their programs.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield\n\nPediatric Obesity and Diabetes Prevention Kit: an online resource that contains childhood obesity prevention tools to help providers manage pediatric patients during office visits.
