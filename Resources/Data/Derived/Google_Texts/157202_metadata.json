Republicans will lose big at the polls if they fail to act, he warned, the media outlet reported.\n\n\u201c[Obama] predicted the House would pass something this year,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine, who attended this week\u2019s meeting with the president, in The Hill. At the same time, Mr. Kaine said the president admitted the legislative debates would prove fiery.\n\n\u201cHe said we\u2019re then all going to have a challenging conversation,\u201d Mr. Kaine said, in The Hill. \u201cHe said it was more likely than not the House would do something.\u201d\n\nSen. Charles Schumer, who sponsored a bill on immigration that passed the Senate, emerged from the same meeting with a similar assessment.\n\n\u201cI think our Republican colleagues realize that to be blocking immigration reform is not good for them,\u201d Mr. Schumer said, in The Hill.\n\nMeanwhile, moves are afoot on the Republican side to bring forward immigration reform. Mr. Boehner hired the same aide to work as his new immigration policy director who also worked for Sen. John McCain \u2013 who co-sponsored Mr. Schumer\u2019s immigration bill. And Mr. Boehner said he\u2019s readying to release a set of Republican Party immigration reform measures just before Mr. Obama\u2019s State of the Union address on Jan. 28.\n\nIt\u2019s still not clear how the two sides will find consensus on the most controversial aspect of Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration reform \u2013 the legalization of about 11 million illegals. Several Republicans in the House say they won\u2019t vote for amnesty in any form, while Rep. Darrell Issa has suggested a plan to legalize immigrants via visas and worker permits, The Hill reported. Meanwhile, Mr. Boehner has indicated in the past that he\u2019s in favor of a piecemeal approach to immigration reform, rather than the sweeping legislative change proposed by the president and key Democrats. And Mr. Issa has expressed doubts that immigration reform could pass before 2015.\n\nDespite, Mr. Obama is still optimistic for 2014 reform.\n\n\u201cHe feels good. He thinks we\u2019re going to be able to get something on immigration,\u201d said one Democratic senator who met with the president at the White House, The Hill reported. \u201cHe just thinks that Republicans are not going to want to be hanging out on that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Perhaps the president knows something legislative watchers don\u2019t, because Mr. Obama vows \u2013 in sharp contrast to political pundits Capitol Hill insiders \u2013 the House Speaker John Boehner will indeed pass immigration reform before the end of the year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Perhaps the president knows something legislative watchers don\u2019t, because Mr. Obama vows \u2013 in sharp contrast to political pundits Capitol Hill insiders \u2013 the House Speaker John Boehner will indeed pass immigration reform before the end of the year.", "title": "Obama vows that John Boehner will indeed push through immigration reform", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/17/obama-vows-john-boehner-will-indeed-push-through-i/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/16/aptopix-budget-battlejpeg-084f2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/16/aptopix-budget-battlejpeg-084f2.jpg", "description": "Perhaps the president knows something legislative watchers don\u2019t, because Mr. Obama vows \u2013 in sharp contrast to political pundits Capitol Hill insiders \u2013 the House Speaker John Boehner will indeed pas", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama vows that John Boehner will indeed push through immigration refo"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
