The childbirth clinic, which will be moved to another hospital, got hit several times.\n\nSix more people were killed on Sunday, lifting the death toll since the start of the army offensive to 230, medical authorities said.\n\nThe struggle is part of a wider conflict in the North African state where former rebels who helped oust Gaddafi are fighting for power and a share of the country's oil revenues.\n\nLibya is divided between rival tribes and political factions with two governments vying for legitimacy since an armed group from the western city of Misrata seized Tripoli in August, forcing the internationally recognized Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni to move east.\n\nThe situation in Benghazi and other parts of Libya has been fluid with government forces unable to control militias.\n\nForces of former general Khalifa Haftar, which support the army in Benghazi, have planes from Libya's outdated air force though his opponents say he also gets air support from Egypt, which is worried about the spread of militants. Haftar denies this.\n\n(Reporting by Ayman al-Warfalli and Feras Bosalum; Writing by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Eric Walsh)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Libya's army urged residents to evacuate a central district of Benghazi that is home to its seaport, a spokesman said on Sunday, as it prepares a military operation against Islamists in the country's second-largest city.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "title": "Libyan army urges residents of Benghazi port area to evacuate", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, LIBYA, SECURITY", "DCSext.ChannelList": "topNews;newsOne;worldNews;newsMaps;gc05;everything;treasuryMarkets;Continental;forexNewsCopy;Cargill;Shell;Verizon;Amtrak;Amtrak2;Topnews1;yahoo2Dub;yahoo3;echoActivityStream;everythingButHugin;OutloudFeed;libya;CFA;trending-hp;samsung;middle-east;newsproHome;cfaglobal;merrilledge;shipping;dassaultuk;greenpeace;fedex_neg;citgroup;Intel;Fidelity2014;ABG_IN;GCA-NewsPro", "keywords": "US,LIBYA,SECURITY,Crude Oil,Civil Unrest,Oil and Gas (TRBC),Libya,International / National Security,Islam,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Military Conflicts,Insurgencies,Government / Politics,Marine Port Services (TRBC),Wheat,Marine Services (TRBC)", "DCSext.Comments": 1, "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "description": "Libya's army urged residents to evacuate a central district of Benghazi that is home to its seaport, a spokesman said on Sunday, as it prepares a military operation against Islamists in the country's second-largest city.", "WT.cg_n": "World", "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "worldNews", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-02T22:40:27+0000", "sailthru.title": "Libyan army urges residents of Benghazi port area to evacuate", "DCSext.ContentID_worldNews": "USKBN0IM0V720141102", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Libyan+army+urges+residents+of+Benghazi+port+area+to+evacuate", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKBN0IM0V720141102", "WT.cg_s": "World", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "news_keywords": "US;LIBYA;SECURITY;Crude Oil;Civil Unrest;Oil and Gas (TRBC);Libya;International / National Security;Islam;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;Military Conflicts;Insurgencies;Government / Politics;Marine Port Services (TRBC);Wheat;Marine Services (TRBC)", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Editorial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "sailthru.description": "Libya's army urged residents to evacuate a central district of Benghazi that is home to its seaport, a spokesman said on Sunday, as it prepares a military operation against Islamists in the country's second-largest city.", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-worldNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "Libya's army urged residents to evacuate a central district of Benghazi that is home to its seaport, a spokesman said on Sunday, as it prepares a military operation against Islamists in the country's second-largest city.", "title": "Libyan army urges residents of Benghazi port area to evacuate", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-idUSKBN0IM0V720141102", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,LIBYA,SECURITY,Crude Oil,Civil Unrest,Oil and Gas (TRBC),Libya,International / National Security,Islam,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Military Conflicts,Insurgencies,Government / Politics,Marine Port Services (TRBC),Wheat,Marine Services (TRBC)", "published_time": "2014-11-02T22:40:27+0000", "modified_time": "2014-11-02T22:40:27+0000", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Sun Nov 02 22:40:27 UTC 2014", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfdf5\"", "article_summary": "BENGHAZI Libya Libya's army urged residents to evacuate a central district of Benghazi that is home to its seaport, a spokesman said on Sunday, as it prepares a military operation against Islamists in the country's second-largest city.\nHe gave no details but the army had previously said that members of the Ansar al-Sharia militant group had fled there after the army had seized other districts.\nThe situation in Benghazi and other parts of Libya has been fluid with government forces unable to control militias.\nThe district is city's main commercial area and also home to the seaport used for wheat and petrol imports.\n\"The chief of staff asks all residents of the Assabri district to leave by 12:00 noon (on Monday),\" said Ahmed al-Mesmari, spokesman for the chief of staff."}
