It follows Doctor Henry Morgan, New York City’s star medical examiner. But, what no one knows is Henry studies the dead for a reason — he’s immortal. Alongside detective Jo Martinez, Henry’s colorful and long life will be unveiled through their cases.

And “Exposed” comes from Charles Randolph, who wrote film “Love and Other Drugs.” TBD Entertainment’s Peter Traugott and Rachel Kaplan will executive produce the Universal Television project.

“Exposed” is based on a Scandinavian format and follows an investigative journalist who will stop at nothing to uncover the truth including making questionable alliances.

The two drama pickups follow an order of alien drama, “The Visitors,” earlier on Thursday. From “Juno” producer Soo Hugh, Dawn Olmstead‘s production company, Grady Girl, and Steven Spielberg‘s Amblin TV.

The project depicts a race against the clock to defeat an unseen alien enemy out to destroy the world using our most precious resource against us.

These projects will go into contention for a series pickup alongside previously announced pilots: an untitled upstairs/downstairs soap from David O. Russell-Susannah Grant and Mark Gordon drama, “Clementine,” among others.
