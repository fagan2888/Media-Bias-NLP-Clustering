Scott Dibble, DFL- Minneapolis, and Rep. Carly Melin, DFL- Hibbing, announced a bipartisan compromise bill legalizing certain forms of medical marijuana during a press conference at the Capitol in St. Paul on Thursday, May 15, 2014. Katelyn suffers from Batten Disease, a form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) that effects children and can cause seizures. Katelyn's parents Jeremy and Kristy Pauling were also there.

(AP Photo/Tom Olmscheid)\n\nSometimes, the best lobbyists in the world are mom and dad.\n\nMinnesota lawmakers passed many bills over the past three months, from more than $1 billion for public works projects and $550 million in tax cuts to legislation on bullying and boosting the minimum wage.\n\nBut the emotional core of the 2014 session came from a small but determined group of parents who relentlessly pushed for \u2014 and ultimately won \u2014 access to medical marijuana for their children.\n\nThe kids suffer from rare and debilitating seizure disorders that don\u2019t respond to conventional treatments but might be helped by marijuana in a liquid form.\n\nWhen legislation stalled in mid-March, the families marched on the Governor\u2019s Residence and persuaded Gov. Mark Dayton to reopen the issue.\n\nThe families were front-and-center once again, repeatedly testifying at Capitol hearings and telling stories that legislators couldn\u2019t ignore.\n\nThe lobbying worked. In some cases, the stories prompted lawmakers to listen to their own parents.\n\n\u201cThere was a message \u2014 \u2018I would like to talk to you about medical marijuana\u2019 \u2014 and it was from my mother,\u201d said Sen. Charles Wiger, DFL-Maplewood, during a Senate floor debate in early May. \u201cMom said: \u2018Uncle Bill is dying. \u2026 He\u2019s in the most courageous battle of his life now with cancer and endures a great deal of pain.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2026 At the beginning of session, I wasn\u2019t quite sure how I would vote on this. I had concerns registered by law enforcement, treatment professionals,\u201d Wiger said. But he concluded: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, if people are suffering and we have the ability to provide a way to alleviate that pain, let\u2019s hear their concern, let\u2019s hear their prayer.\u201d\n\nThe end result is a bill that Dayton pledged to sign granting access to marijuana for terminally ill patients and those with any of eight serious medical conditions. The state Health Department would select and regulate two manufacturers that could sell marijuana in the form of liquids and pills, but not the plant itself. Patients would not be allowed to smoke marijuana or vaporize plant materials.\n\nWhile the medical marijuana issue pulled at lawmakers\u2019 heartstrings, they also took care of a long list of meat-and-potatoes issues. With rarely seen bipartisan teamwork, they passed a massive public works bonding bill and used part of a budget surplus to cut taxes.\n\nLeaders of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor majorities said they were able to check off almost everything on their to-do list.\n\n\u201cHistory might look at it as the most productive legislative biennium in a generation,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook.\n\nBut Republicans argued DFLers went on an out-of-control tax and spending spree over the past 1 1/2 years.\n\n\u201cThey passed one of the largest tax increases in history (and) the largest spending increase in history,\u201d said House Minority Leader Kurt Daudt, R-Crown. \u201cWe can\u2019t sustain that.\u201d\n\nWhile lawmakers accomplished a lot, here are some things they didn\u2019t do:\n\n\u2014 Although Minnesota is falling behind on maintaining its roads, bridges and a growing demand for mass transit, Dayton and DFL legislators put off possible transportation tax increases until next year.\n\n\u2014 Earlier this year, a federal judge made it clear he wanted lawmakers to fix the state\u2019s sex-offender program, which essentially confines ex-cons for life after they complete their prison sentences. Instead, state policymakers again ducked the issue, opening the door for court intervention.\n\n\u2014 Legislators kept their \u201cget-out-of-jail-free\u201d cards for drunken driving during legislative sessions. Concordia University students launched a campaign to clarify that lawmakers can\u2019t avoid arrest for DWI or other crimes during sessions under a constitutional \u201clegislative immunity\u201d provision intended to protect them from being prevented from voting. But the drive stalled as lawmakers argued their ID cards don\u2019t actually prevent arrests.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the key things lawmakers did do:\n\nMINIMUM WAGE\n\nMinnesota goes from being one of the nation\u2019s lowest minimum-wage states to one of the highest.\n\nIncreases start in August. By 2016, large employers will be paying $9.50 per hour, with an annual inflation adjustment capped at 2.5 percent to start in 2018. The Department of Labor and Industry could suspend the inflation increase in bad economic times.\n\nThe state\u2019s current minimum wage for large employers is $6.15, though in practice, most minimum-wage jobs in Minnesota pay the federal rate of $7.25. The wage hike passed with no Republican votes in either body.\n\nBUILDING PROJECTS\n\nMinnesota will launch the state\u2019s most ambitious effort to finance affordable housing, spark a construction spree on college campuses across the state and finish renovating the aging state Capitol under a $1 billion-plus public works funding package.\n\nLegislators also invested in upgrading state prisons and hospitals, parks and zoos, a massive water project for parched southwestern Minnesota and dozens of civic centers, theaters, museums and similar projects across the state.\n\nSeparately, DFL lawmakers approved a new $90 million office building for senators \u2014 $77 million of it covered by taxpayers \u2014 which Republicans fiercely criticized as lavish. A groundbreaking is scheduled for July if it clears a long-shot lawsuit.\n\nTAX CUTS\n\nLawmakers tapped a $1.2 billion budget surplus in this election year to send $550 million back to taxpayers.\n\nThey cut income taxes by matching some, but not all, state tax credits with the federal tax code, repealed three sales taxes on businesses that they passed last year and voted last week to send property tax refunds to more than a million homeowners, renters and farmers. Refund checks are typically mailed in October.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nAn overhaul to Minnesota\u2019s 37-word bullying-prevention law requires schools to develop bullying-prevention policies, to quickly address instances of bullying and to work with students who are bullied or bully others.\n\nLawmakers focused $54 million of the supplemental budget bill on new education spending, putting $25 per pupil on the general education formula. The budget bill also provided new money for preschool scholarships and funds to guarantee hot lunches for every student who wants one.\n\nLawmakers also budgeted $10 million to help implement the new teacher-evaluation system that is set to begin statewide in the fall.\n\nAn education policy omnibus bill includes broad changes to how students learning English are taught, new ways adults can earn credit toward high school diplomas and alternative methods candidates for teaching licenses can use to demonstrate math and English proficiency.\n\nSPENDING\n\nLegislators used $283 million of the surplus to provide 5 percent rate increases for home and community-based health caregivers for the elderly and disabled, increase K-12 school aid and early-childhood scholarships and expand broadband Internet access across rural Minnesota.\n\nLOTTERY\n\nThe House and Senate approved a bill to squash the state lottery\u2019s step into online sales of scratch-off tickets. Lottery sales at gas pumps and ATMs would be gone, as well. Online sales of lotto-type games such as Powerball still would be allowed.\n\nDayton has not said whether he\u2019ll sign the bill.\n\nA state fiscal analysis estimated ending online lottery sales would cost the state about $3 million in fiscal year 2014-15 and $12 million in fiscal year 2016-17.\n\nWOMEN\u2019S ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT\n\nSigned into law on Mother\u2019s Day, this bill provides more workplace protection and equal pay for women.\n\nIt increases unpaid pregnancy and parenting leave from six to 12 weeks, grants sick leave to care for sick grandchildren and requires more private space to nurse other than bathrooms. Among other provisions, it requires businesses with large state contracts to certify they pay men and women equal salaries for similar jobs, and it bars employers from discriminating against pregnant women and parents with young children at home.\n\nLIQUOR\n\nMinnesota liquor stores will continue to be closed on Sundays, but taprooms can be open.\n\nAdvocates say they were on track to win permission for small breweries to sell growlers \u2014 containers that can be filled with beer, sealed and carried away by the customer \u2014 on Sundays, but that provision was killed after intervention by the Teamsters union.\n\nOther provisions: Hennepin County authorities can OK a 4 a.m. closing time for bars and restaurants on the Monday and Tuesday nights of the 2014 baseball All-Star Game events at Target Field. And the University of Minnesota still will be able to sell beer at TCF Bank Stadium.\n\nGUNS\n\nDomestic abusers subject to a restraining order have to give up firearms, and weapons restrictions tighten for those convicted of domestic assault or stalking.\n\nThe measure passed even though gun-restriction measures have faced an uphill battle in recent years at the Capitol.\n\nAdvocates pitched the measure as offering protection to victims and police officers without infringing on the rights of law-abiding gun owners. It aligns state statute with federal law.\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nMinnesota becomes the first state to enact a \u201ckill switch\u201d law requiring smartphones and tablets sold in the state to have a remote shut-off feature to deter theft. It takes effect in July 2015.\n\nLaw enforcement authorities need a tracking warrant to get electronic device location information. The warrant can be issued only if authorities show there is probable cause to believe the person possessing the device is committing, has committed or is about to commit a crime.\n\nENVIRONMENT/ENERGY\n\nRetail sale of consumer cleaning products containing triclosan is banned, which state officials say appears to be the first ban of its kind in the nation. Individual products already approved by the FDA for consumer use would be exempted. The provisions go into effect Jan. 1, 2017.\n\nTriclosan, an antibacterial chemical found in liquid hand soaps, toothpaste and other products, is an endocrine-disrupting compound thought to contribute to antibiotic resistance, according to the state Pollution Control Agency.\n\nResponding to a severe propane shortage last winter and related price spike, lawmakers approved $20 million in aid to assist propane users and pledged to address some of the systemic issues contributing to the crisis.\n\nThe larger fixes didn\u2019t happen, but consumers get provisions on transparency, equity and nondiscrimination on pricing, budget payment plans and purchase contracts. A study is requested to investigate converting propane gas users to natural gas or other alternative-energy sources.\n\nCRIMINALS\n\nThose exonerated of crimes would qualify for reimbursement for costs associated with their sentence plus $50,000 to $100,000 for each year in prison and $25,000 to $50,000 for each year served on supervised release or as a registered offender.\n\nAmong factors to be considered in calculating monetary damages are lost wages as well as health, educational, housing and transportation expenses. Twenty-nine states currently have such compensation statutes.\n\nModifications made to an expungement mechanism allow judges to seal the criminal records of reformed offenders to make it easier for them to find jobs and housing. Businesses screening services are required to delete expunged records.\n\nUNSESSION\n\nDayton launched a drive to get rid of outdated and duplicative laws and regulations and make state government work faster, cheaper and simpler.\n\nAs of Friday, 925 of his 1,007 proposals have become law.\n\nChristopher Magan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "twincities", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Twin Cities", "description": "Sometimes, the best lobbyists in the world are mom and dad.
