In the memo, inspector general J. Russell George said securing taxpayer and employee data was the IRS\u2019s top management challenge.\n\nMore recently, the Government Accountability Office issued a report in March that identified dozens of weaknesses in the IRS\u2019s computer security. Until those weaknesses are fixed, \u201cfinancial and taxpayer data will remain unnecessarily vulnerable to inappropriate and undetected use, modification or disclosure,\u201d the GAO said.\n\nCriminals stole the personal information of 104,000 taxpayers from an IRS website from February to mid-May, the agency disclosed last week. The information was stolen as part of an elaborate scheme to claim fraudulent tax refunds, Koskinen told reporters.\n\nIRS investigators believe the thieves were based in Russia, two officials who were briefed on the matter told The Associated Press. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\nKoskinen and George are scheduled to testify before the Senate Finance Committee Tuesday morning. Koskinen also is appearing before the Senate Homeland Security Committee Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cLast week\u2019s devastating announcement that the private information of over 100,000 taxpayers had been compromised sent shock waves through the halls of Congress,\u201d said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Finance Committee. \u201cGiven that the IRS\u2019s own internal watchdog has repeatedly warned that their security system was not up to par, we need to find out exactly what happened, who is behind it, and how we can move forward to ensure it never happens again.\u201d\n\nThe IRS blames budget cuts for hampering the agency\u2019s ability to upgrade its computer systems. In a statement, the IRS said funding for cybersecurity has fallen from $187 million in 2011 to $149 million in 2015, a drop of more than 20 percent.\n\nOverall, the agency\u2019s funding has been cut by more than $1 billion since 2010, to $10.9 billion this year.\n\nKoskinen has said the IRS is still using some computer applications that date to the Kennedy administration. In February, he warned Congress that budget cuts were preventing the IRS from improving safeguards against identity theft.\n\n\u201cThe cuts we are making include delays to critical information technology investments of more than $200 million this year,\u201d Koskinen told the Finance Committee at a hearing. \u201cThis means, among other things, that aging IT systems will not be replaced and new taxpayer protections against identity theft will be delayed.\u201d\n\nThe thieves took the taxpayer information from an IRS website called \u201cGet Transcript,\u201d where taxpayers can get tax returns and other tax filings from previous years.\n\nThe breach doesn\u2019t appear to be a traditional hack. The thieves already had detailed knowledge about each taxpayer, including their Social Security number, date of birth, tax filing status and street address. They presumably stole the information elsewhere, the IRS said.\n\nThe thieves used the information to access the IRS website. Koskinen said old tax returns could help criminals prepare more authentic-looking tax returns in the future, which they could use to claim fraudulent refunds.\n\nThis year, the thieves claimed about 15,000 refunds using information they stole from the website. Koskinen said the refunds totaled as much as $50 million.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Government watchdogs warned the IRS about security flaws in the agency's computer systems years before hackers stole the personal information of thousands of taxpayers from an IRS website.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Government watchdogs warned the IRS about security flaws in the agency\u2019s computer systems years before hackers stole the personal information of thousands of taxpayers from an IRS website.", "title": "John Koskinen, IRS commissioner, to face questions about security weaknesses", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/2/john-koskinen-irs-commissioner-face-questions-abou/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/15/IRS_Health_Overhaul.JPEG-0af2b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/15/IRS_Health_Overhaul.JPEG-0af2b.jpg", "description": "Government watchdogs warned the IRS about security flaws in the agency's computer systems years before hackers stole the personal information of thousands of taxpayers from an IRS website.", "card": "summary", "title": "John Koskinen, IRS commissioner, to face questions about security weak"}, "Author": "Stephen Ohlemacher", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Internal Revenue Service, John Koskinen"}, "article_summary": "Now IRS Commissioner John Koskinen is heading to Capitol Hill to answer questions about why the tax agency didn\u2019t address those weaknesses.\nCriminals stole the personal information of 104,000 taxpayers from an IRS website from February to mid-May, the agency disclosed last week.\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Government watchdogs warned the IRS about security flaws in the agency\u2019s computer systems years before hackers stole the personal information of thousands of taxpayers from an IRS website.\nMore recently, the Government Accountability Office issued a report in March that identified dozens of weaknesses in the IRS\u2019s computer security.\nThe thieves used the information to access the IRS website."}
