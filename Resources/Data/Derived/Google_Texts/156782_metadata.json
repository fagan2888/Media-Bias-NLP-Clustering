Lawmakers eager to have television cameras capture their encounter with the pontiff have been warned against trying to grab a handshake as he makes his way in.\n\nPope Francis arrives in Washington as the race heats up to replace Obama in the November 2016 presidential election.\n\nVice President Biden, who is considering whether to compete for the Democratic nomination, will attend many of the pope's events, and will lead a farewell ceremony in Philadelphia on Sept. 27, the White House said.\n\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - When Pope Francis arrives in Washington next week, the", "title": "White House prepares for pomp, politics of Pope Francis visit", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/17/Biden-lead-farewell-ceremony-Pope-Francis-White-House", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-biden_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/17/Biden-lead-farewell-ceremony-Pope-Francis-White-House", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-biden_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - When Pope Francis arrives in Washington next week, the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But after months of work on the agenda for their meeting, White House officials said on Thursday that they expect Pope Francis may also address issues such as gay marriage or government funding for abortion - policies on which the Catholic Church and White House fundamentally disagree.\nObama and Pope Francis met last March at the Vatican, where they spoke for about an hour.\nObama and Pope Francis share concerns on \"big ticket items\" like climate and poverty, said Kupchan, who told reporters that the White House has worked on new \"initiatives\" to roll out during the visit.\nPope Francis arrives in Washington as the race heats up to replace Obama in the November 2016 presidential election.\nObama and Vice President Joe Biden will greet Pope Francis when he lands at a U.S. military base just outside the city on Tuesday."}
