Milwaukee's newest gallery, the Pitch Project, opens to the public Saturday with "Green Go Home," a social sculpture that riffs on the term "gringo" and that was previously exhibited in Bogota, Colombia, and New York City.

The collaboration by New York artists Rirkrit Tiravanija and Tomas Vu will feature 300 prints of wheat pasted to the gallery walls and an invitation to the audience to engage with the work by drawing on it. A spectrum of imagery and characters will appear in the work, which will include Milwaukee figures such as Father James Groppi and Frank Zeidler.

Also on view in a nearby media gallery will be "Zwischen Raum Zeit," a collection of music videos created by more than 24 contemporary artists from around the world and featuring the music of DAS, the Brooklyn-based German pop duo of Ronnie Bass and Gandalf Gavan. Bass and Gavan have been creating music as a side project to their studio practices since 2009. The limited-edition double album will be available for $12,000.

The Pitch Project, 706 S. 5th St., is next door to and largely funded by Brenner Brewing Co., slated to open in the summer. It is run by Mike Brenner, of the brewery, and artists Sonja Thomsen, Will Pergl and Jason Yi.

A reception from 5 to 9 p.m. Saturday marks the public unveiling of the new space, a building that includes about 20 artists' studios.
