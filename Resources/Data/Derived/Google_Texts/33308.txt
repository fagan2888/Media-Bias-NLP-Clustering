JEFFERSON COUNTY — C-470 was closed for more than an hour Monday evening near West Ken Caryl Avenue as deputies and other law enforcement agencies sorted out a report of a situation, possibly involving guns.

A man and woman — whose names were not released — were arrested on suspicion of menacing and a search for other possible suspects continued after the road reopened at 7 p.m.

Earlier, as traffic backed up, state troopers told drivers that they had to leave the area because of the possibility of shots coming from the nearby ridge, but the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said no one had been shot or shot at. The sheriff’s office said the roads were closed as a precaution.

The office said it was “not taking any chances” in their response.

“We don’t get a second chance to get this right,” Jacki Kelley, an office spokeswoman, said,

C-470 was closed at West Quincy Avenue and Belleview Avenue and at West Ken Caryl Avenue, according to Colorado State Patrol spokesman Nate Reid.

No deputies were pinned down, the sheriff’s office said on Twitter.

The late Monday afternoon closure started a little before 6 p.m., and massive traffic jams were reported by 6:15 p.m. in the area. Staff writer Elizabeth Hernandez contributed to this report.
