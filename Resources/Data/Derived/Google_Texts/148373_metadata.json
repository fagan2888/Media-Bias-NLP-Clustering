It encompasses homosexual activism as well.\n\nPride At Work is a nonprofit organization that represents LGBT union members and their \u201callies,\u201d that \u201corganizes mutual support between the organized Labor Movement and the LGBT Community to further social and economic justice.\u201d\n\nPride at Work is an officially recognized constituency group of the AFL-CIO\n\nThe deeds of the AFL-CIO as an organization are not the sole illustration of how Trumka\u2019s CNS appearance sends a conflicting message with regard to Church principles, but also statements embracing and advocating principles in direct contrast to the faith by the man himself.\n\n\u201cWorking people believe in equality and fairness and that\u2019s why we are happy to stand with millions of Americans and with President Obama in supporting marriage equality,\u201d Trumka said in a statement supporting homosexual \u201cmarriage\u201d.\n\nWhen the federal Defense of Marriage Act and California\u2019s Proposition 8 defending marriage were overturned, he said they never should have been adopted in the first place.\n\n\u201cThe Defense of Marriage Act and California\u2019s Proposition 8 were radical and divisive laws that never should have been,\u201d Trumka said. \u201cNow, we can begin to fully clear the dark legal cloud that has hung over our nation.\u201d\n\nTrumka employs a childhood anecdote to frame his article complete with violence against his grandfather on the part of the profit-focused mining company that \u201cowned everything,\u201d in his Pennsylvania hometown.\n\n\u201cPope Francis speaks for the church I grew up in when he calls for an organized moral response to the injustices of modern capitalism,\u201d stated Trumka, whose salary level is around $300,000 per year according to unionfacts.com.\n\nTrumka has been implicated in encouraging intimidation and deception to advance union goals, according to a report from the National Legal and Policy Center.\n\nTrumka has also been accused of legitimizing violence. During a multi-state coal miners\u2019 strike organized by the United Mine Workers in 1993, Trumka, as union president, ordered more than 17,000 miners to walk off the job, and explicitly told strikers to \"kick the s--- out of\" employees and mine operators defying union demands.\n\nHomes were vandalized, shots were fired at a mine office, and power was cut to one mine, temporarily trapping 93 miners underground.\n\nA non-union contractor, Eddie York, was murdered by a union member, shot in the back of the head as he drove past strikers at a West Virginia work site. Those trying to rescue the victim were attacked by a group of union members. The union member who shot the contractor went to jail, but no one else was disciplined for what took place.\n\nTrumka told Virginian-Pilot in September 1993 regarding the incident, \u201cI\u2019m saying if you strike a match and you put your finger in it, you\u2019re likely to get burned.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "AFL-CIO leader Richard Trumka praised Pope Francis' view of capitalism in the CNS story.", "title": "Catholic News Service gives platform to head of union that gave hundreds of millions to pro-abort politicians", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/FundingMoney-1000pxshutterstock_165014246.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/catholic-news-service-publishes-afl-cio-leader-who-gave-hundreds-of-million", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "AFL-CIO leader Richard Trumka praised Pope Francis' view of capitalism in the CNS story."}, "description": "AFL-CIO leader Richard Trumka praised Pope Francis' view of capitalism in the CNS story.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "article_summary": "When the federal Defense of Marriage Act and California\u2019s Proposition 8 defending marriage were overturned, he said they never should have been adopted in the first place.\n\u201cThe Defense of Marriage Act and California\u2019s Proposition 8 were radical and divisive laws that never should have been,\u201d Trumka said.\n\u201cPope Francis lives and breathes this tradition.\u201d\u201cTogether, the Catholic Church and the labor movement stand for a new moral and political order,\u201d he said.\nThe union chief made his case in a June 22 guest column for Catholic News Service (CNS).\nTrumka, raised Catholic, writes his column for CNS with a Catholic voice, but the union he heads up supports contraception and homosexual \u201cmarriage\u201d, along with abortion."}
