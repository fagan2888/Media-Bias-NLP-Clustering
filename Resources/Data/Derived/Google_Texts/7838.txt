What to do if you want to get an important message through to a generation of young people who only look up from their phones to eat meals and roll their eyes at theirsuper-lame parents? Well, in a “If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em” sort of effort, the White House has decided the best way to communicate to young people about the economy is . . . to use some emoji. According to a report from Buzzfeed News, the White House will today start using emojis in its social-media accounts in updates about the Affordable Care Act and student loans, as part of a larger effort to reach millennials in anticipation of the upcoming November elections. The White House said in a statement, “We're moving forward again and one generation in particular—millennials—will shape our economy for decades to come."

While the dancing woman in the red dress has not been called off the bench just yet (give it time), the graduation cap (to represent “capped loan payments”), and the downward arrow are both going to be in the mix. And in one piece of messaging, the dice emoji and the Popeye-flexed-bicep-muscle emoji strut their stuff. (“All of that means you don’t have to roll the [DICE EMOJI] to stay [FLEXED MUSCLE EMOJI].”) We give it 10 years, conservatively, before Congress starts to amend the Constitution with emoji.

We can only assume the White House has other tactics in its arsenal to appeal to the millennial demographic, such as having Ariana Grande warble her way through health-care statistics; releasing an update to Kim Kardashian: Hollywood in which home ownership rules are plastered on the walls on the various nightclubs and storefronts; and ending every Vine with a one-second subliminal message about job-training programs.
