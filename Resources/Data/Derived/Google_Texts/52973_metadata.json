The Affordable Care Act is working for millions of Americans who are able to access quality health coverage at a price they can afford, in part because of the efforts of in-person assisters in local communities across the nation. People shopping for and enrolling in coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplaces can get local help in a number of ways, including through Navigators. Navigators provide objective information about health coverage to consumers to help them make the best possible choice. They are knowledgeable about qualified health plans in the Marketplaces, and public programs including Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Grantees will be selected for a three year project period, and a total of up to $67 million is available for the first year of the award.\n\n\u201cNavigators play a vital role in helping Americans enroll in coverage through the Marketplaces and assessing if they qualify for any insurance affordability programs. Navigators have been an important resource for the millions of Americans who enrolled in coverage over the past two years. This funding announcement ensures this important work will continue over the next three years in states with a FFM, including during Marketplace open enrollment periods,\u201d said CMS Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt.\n\nThe funding opportunity announcement is open to eligible individuals, as well as private and public entities, applying to serve as Navigators in states with a FFM. It is open to new and returning HHS Navigator grant applicants, and applications are due by June 15, 2015.\n\nThe 2015 Funding Opportunity Announcement expands the project period from 12 months to 36 months. The multi-year grant award will be funded in 12-month increments and continued funding will be contingent on the grantee continuing to meet all Navigator program requirements and on funding availability. This change is designed to provide greater consistency for Navigator grantee organizations and their staff from year to year, reducing yearly start up time and providing for a more efficient use of grant funds. Navigator grant applicants should describe how they intend to assist consumers who are uninsured or underinsured and consumers who are likely to be eligible for or enrolled in coverage through a Marketplace. Applicants should also describe how they plan to assist persons seeking to re-enroll in coverage through a Marketplace and provide post-enrollment assistance.\n\nTo access the funding opportunity announcement, visit: http://www.grants.gov, and search for CFDA # 93.332.\n\nFor more information about Navigators, visit: http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Programs-and-Initiatives/Health-Insurance-Marketplaces/assistance.html\n\nGet CMS news at cms.gov/newsroom, sign up for CMS news via email and follow CMS on Twitter @CMSgov.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "blog.aids.gov \u2014 HIV Policy & Programs.
