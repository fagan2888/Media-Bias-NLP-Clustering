Nuru-Jeter said poor Blacks live in relatively isolated inner-city neighborhoods, while poor white Americans gain advantages in living near areas with better resources and higher incomes.\n\n\u201cWhen low-income whites can reside in close proximity to higher-income whites then they reap the benefits of living in a higher-income area and everything that goes along with that,\u201d Nuru-Jeter said.\n\nEconomic segregation is much higher in the Black community, she said. Higher-income black people are more likely to move away from low-income Black people. Poor Black communities often struggle with myriad issues: higher crime rates, fewer grocery stores, more liquor stores and less green space such as parks.\n\n\u201cIn terms of opportunity to lead the healthy life, the environment doesn\u2019t really support that,\u201d Nuru-Jeter said.\n\nThe mortality rate in the study considers all types of deaths, including homicide, cardiovascular disease, infant mortality and so on.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crude measure of population health, but a very reliable and sensitive indicator of the well-being of the population,\u201d Nuru-Jeter said.\n\n\u201cWe were interested in population health as opposed to the health of individual people. As income inequality in the area increases, what does that say about how well the population in general is doing?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a recent Gallup poll revealed more discouraging news as it relates to Black health. It said African-Americans are more likely to be obese and have high blood pressure, adding that more than a third of Black Americans surveyed among the 272,000 by Gallup are obese.\n\nThose conditions\u2014obesity and high blood pressure\u2014contribute to other health issues that can lead to death.\n\nBlack Americans were more likely to be obese than whites, Asians and Hispanics, the survey said. Almost half of Black Americans 45 to 64 years old were also being treated for high blood pressure. For those 65 and older, 70 percent were receiving such treatment. Black Americans are two times as likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.\n\nInsurance, or lack of it, also plays a role in the teetering health among Blacks. A 2011 census showed that the uninsured rate for Blacks was 20.89 percent, to 11.7 percent for whites. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act has helped bump up the numbers, but according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Blacks are still uninsured at a 17.3 percent rate.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "A study led by a California-Berkeley associate professor shows a harsh reality: Poor Black people are more prone to die or have significant health concerns than other poor Americans.
