What\u2019s your plan?\n\nI have a story about just such a situation, and, oddly enough, a dress made out of birdseed figures prominently in it. But before I get into that, consider how prevalent this situation is\u2014how often you\u2019ve had to go to your change-weary employees and ask them to dig deep yet again.\n\nMotivating people is difficult under the best of circumstances: As Gallup\u2019s latest State of the American Workplace survey showed, 70% of U.S. employees aren\u2019t engaged at work, a statistic that has not budged much in a decade. Regardless of your industry, if you poll your team, you\u2019ll likely find that they\u2019re feeling overtaxed, and that their \u201cjoy quotient\u201d at work is seriously down. But it gets even harder when employees have already faced a series of crises, as is the case with so many workers today (those lucky enough to still have jobs). Just as they\u2019re getting used to doing more with less, you have to motivate them to throw themselves heart and soul into a critically important new initiative.\n\nI keep thinking of the health-care IT professionals I\u2019ve worked with for much of my career and how they must be dreading the long, rough road that lies ahead for them. After years of cutbacks, the latest incarnation of health-care reform is putting intense new financial pressures on hospitals throughout the U.S. These organizations must make new investments, projected to be in the tens of billions of dollars, to implement electronic health records\u2014and they have to find ways to save money at the same time. A lot of this will fall on the IT people.\n\nA few years ago, I was in charge of strategic planning and IT when Massachusetts General Hospital was implementing the requirements of Massachusetts\u2019 health-care reform, which became the model for the U.S. Affordable Care Act. After years of belt-tightening, there was little fat in the IT budget to cut, but new spending cuts were coming. If we waited for the annual budget cycle to come around, layoffs in the IT department would be inevitable. So it was imperative that we make thoughtful changes to preserve service levels, avoid layoffs, and maintain employee morale during the hard times that were surely ahead.\n\nWith time to plan, we knew we needed to engage the staff in thinking creatively about how best to reorganize IT operations to optimize available resources. It was clear from the rich literature on motivation and from my own experience that employees would need five things:\n\nA solid understanding of the relevance of their work to the hospital\u2019s mission.\n\nA chance to use their skills and expertise to make a positive contribution.\n\nMore control over their work environment and their future.\n\nOpportunities to develop new friendships and interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\nNew tools and the support necessary for their efforts to succeed.\n\nMy role was to be the catalyst that sparked the team\u2019s creativity. At the first of two retreats, I confessed to being inspired by watching Project Runway with my teenage daughter. In case you don\u2019t watch reality TV (really?), aspiring fashion designers on the show face challenges and someone is eliminated each week until the winner is crowned. In one episode, the designers had to make a couture creation solely out of materials they could get in a pet store. When I saw the incredible dress someone had made out of birdseed, I thought: There\u2019s no limit to peoples\u2019 creativity. Why couldn\u2019t the IT staff design a beautiful future with the considerable resources it still had?\n\nThe IT Department traditionally worked in closed teams according to project or division. At that first retreat, we broke down those silos and created four teams, mixing people from all levels and corners of the organization. We described the challenge before them: continue to provide current (or improved) service levels, support all new health-reform-related initiatives, and propose budget cuts.\n\nWe invited two renowned physicians who were leading patient-care-redesign efforts to present their initiatives and talk about how IT was critical to the hospital\u2019s mission. Next, an IT expert who had accomplished similar objectives in another industry presented tips and tools for our teams to consider. Finally, IT leaders stated that they were committed to implementing the best ideas. Thus armed, each team was assigned a mentor (\u00e0 la Project Runway\u2019s Tim Gunn) and given six weeks to find novel solutions.\n\nAt the second retreat, the groups presented their ideas. This was their opportunity to use the insights they\u2019d gained from the front lines to show the suits how they could deliver patient-centered service more cost-effectively. Just as important, the group was highly energized. Although participation was voluntary, every person offered to serve on an implementation task force. This was extraordinary, considering how overburdened the staff had seemed at the outset of the endeavor. New friendships were formed and team members were excited to see their ideas put into action.\n\n\n\nThe immediate benefits were considerable. We met the first objective of avoiding layoffs and ill-advised cuts in the next budget cycle. Staff members were gratified to have had a say in how spending cuts would be made, particularly since they knew they\u2019d have to live with the consequences of the choices.\n\nI recently caught up with Keith Jennings, the current CIO, to see if some of the longer-term initiatives had achieved the intended results. The most promising idea\u2014our birdseed-dress equivalent\u2014had been to create a centralized testing and training resource to serve all software installations, so that those functions wouldn\u2019t have to be replicated for every application. It had an outcome we could not have predicted at the time, because the scale at the hospital was insufficient to realize significant efficiencies in the two-year period we had set for the project. However, now that Partners Healthcare, of which the hospital is a member institution, is implementing electronic health records across the entire system, it\u2019s possible to achieve economies on a much larger scale. Though it has taken longer than we\u2019d expected, the groundwork that group laid six years ago helped set the stage for greater savings than we could have imagined when we focused on Massachusetts General alone.\n\nSo here\u2019s your plan. It\u2019s pretty simple, actually: Energize your exhausted employees by showing them how essential their work is to the organization\u2019s mission, giving them a structured opportunity to contribute, supporting their efforts to innovate, and committing to implementing their best ideas. Don\u2019t underestimate the value of giving people the chance to develop initiatives that improve the quality of their work lives and to address problems that have been vexing them for years.\n\nIt takes time for managers to learn what\u2019s on the minds of their team members, but the return on that investment may well mean getting a stronger product and a more enduring commitment to achieving great results over the long term.", "article_metadata": {"page-category-name": "Change management", "msapplication-config": "none", "shopper-attributes": "state:guest", "description": "Start by showing them how essential their work is to the organization\u2019s mission.", "og": {"site_name": "Harvard Business Review", "description": "Start by showing them how essential their work is to the organization\u2019s mission.", "title": "Tips for Energizing Your Exhausted Employees", "url": "https://hbr.org/2013/11/tips-for-energizing-your-exhausted-employees", "image": "https://hbr.org/resources/images/hbr_opengraph_940x490.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2013/11/20131127_3.jpg", "site": "@harvardbiz", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@harvardbiz"}, "ox-group": 537063787, "item-name": "Tips for Energizing Your Exhausted Employees", "page-id": 300, "article-content-type": "Digital Article", "rr-placements": "item_page.articles,item_page.top_right,item_page.bottom,item_page.red_strip,item_page.subscribe_now,item_page.topbar_subscribe,item_page.mag_cover,item_page.subscribe,item_page.article_slider,item_page.exit_popup_slider", "page-category-id": 1575, "item-id": "tag:blogs.harvardbusiness.org,2007-03-31:999.24693", "sid": "54729CC9765112AA286E41CA814A23E4", "uid": "6bdaf80931dc3130a932d0a05140ee3c", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HBR", "published_time": "2013-11-26T16:00:57Z", "author": "Allison Rimm", "section": "Change management", "modified_time": "2014-08-07T19:15:11Z", "tag": "Change management"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1,width=device-width", "page-type": "ITEM"}, "article_summary": "Next, an IT expert who had accomplished similar objectives in another industry presented tips and tools for our teams to consider.\nAfter years of belt-tightening, there was little fat in the IT budget to cut, but new spending cuts were coming.\nAfter years of cutbacks, the latest incarnation of health-care reform is putting intense new financial pressures on hospitals throughout the U.S.\nBut it gets even harder when employees have already faced a series of crises, as is the case with so many workers today (those lucky enough to still have jobs).\nBut before I get into that, consider how prevalent this situation is\u2014how often you\u2019ve had to go to your change-weary employees and ask them to dig deep yet again."}
