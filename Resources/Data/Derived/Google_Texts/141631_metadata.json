As they push the boundaries on the largest salt water habitats in the world, they are also setting a new standard for the entire aquatic park industry.\n\nOn top of the elements that will benefit SeaWorld\u2019s whales and the general public, SeaWorld is also donating $10 million dollars in matching funds to help the Southern Resident Killer Whales that are endangered and known as the most toxic animals in the ocean, due to pollution in the the Pacific Northwest. SeaWorld will also be adding an advisory board of non-theme park scientists, to consult and advise the company on charting the course for animal care in the parks.\n\nMore on this story as it develops.\n\nUPDATE: SeaWorld Texas will be getting\n\nNew Sea Lion Show\n\nNew Sea Lion Habitat\n\nNew Dolphin Coastal Habitat\n\nNew Restaurant\n\nUpdate 2: On a conference call with SeaWorld CEO Jim Atchison, he confirmed that construction would be concurrent and that tentatively you would see San Diego open in 2018, Orlando in 2019 and San Antonio in 2020. He also confirmed new enrichment activities for the whales that would include tactile exploration, and underwater windows for the trainers to engage with the whales in new ways.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A New Day at SeaWorld - Massive Expansion at all 3 Parks", "generator": "WordPress 3.5.1"}, "article_summary": "SeaWorld announced project \u201cBlue World,\u201d which is the most aggressive expansion plan in the history of Seaworld Parks.\nThe past few days have been rough for SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment.\nFacing a shareholder sell off and mounting pressure online from activists, SeaWorld made an important announcement today that will change the shape of all SeaWorld parks, and standards and expectations in the marine park industry as well.\nSeaWorld will also be adding an advisory board of non-theme park scientists, to consult and advise the company on charting the course for animal care in the parks.\nKiller Whale facilities will be expanded in San Diego, Orlando and San Antonio, doubling the size of the habitats."}
