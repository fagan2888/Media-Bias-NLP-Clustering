And we know what happens if they overestimate their income\u2013they\u2019ll be refunded the subsidy to which their lower income entitled them.\n\nBut the poorest Americans don\u2019t qualify for subsidies on the exchanges. If they make less than the poverty line \u2013about $20,000 for a family of three\u2013they\u2019re steered to Medicaid. (In states with expanded programs, they\u2019re apparently sent to Medicaid if they make less than 138% of poverty, according to the Kaiser subsidy calculator). So what if someone is near the income boundary between the two programs\u2013and what if this person overestimates their income, and thinks they qualify for a subsidized policy on the exchange, but it turns out they didn\u2019t make what they thought they\u2019d make? Maybe they didn\u2019t get some work they usually got in the past, or their wages got cut, or they got laid off. According to the income they actually earned, they should have been sent to Medicaid. They didn\u2019t just get too much or too little subsidy. They used the wrong program.\n\nWhat\u2019s the IRS going to do to them? Demand a refund of the subsidy, not because they\u2019re too rich to get it but because they\u2019re too poor? That\u2019s perverse and probably futile\u2013is the government really going to claw back a $9,700 subsidy from someone who makes less than half that in a year less than $20,000 a year?** And while our hypothetical bad income-guesser got a big subsidy, they didn\u2019t cost the government the Medicaid benefits they maybe could legally have claimed. So should the government then give them a refund? Or just do nothing and let them enjoy a year of subsidized private health insurance to which they weren\u2019t legally entitled (amnesty!)? What if they now estimate that next year they\u2019ll really earn what they thought they\u2019d earn this year? Do you let them again claim a subsidy that the government won\u2019t be able to get back?\n\nI don\u2019t know the answer. But it\u2019s an additional example, if any was needed, of the complications created by Obamacare\u2019s absurdly stratified-by-income structure. The President may decry the lack of economic mobility in America\u2013but he better hope there\u2019s not much mobility up and down around the $15,000-$25,000 level, or else lots of people will be discovering that they\u2019re in the wrong health care program. Obamacare\u2019s designers seem to have assumed we really are a corporatist society, with different classes assigned stable economic levels for life.\n\nThere\u2019s also the incentive to cheat. At the middle-income level\u2013around $45,000 for an individual\u2013 this incentive is straightforward: If you lowball your income you not only pay less in taxes but can qualify for a big subsidy (which cuts off abruptly above 400% of the poverty line).\n\nBut the lower-income incentives are more confusing. If you\u2019re near the lower $10-15,000 boundary, do you want to overstate your income because you think Obamacare\u2019s exchanges (with a big subsidy) are better than what Medicaid offers? (The exchanges have a better choice of doctors, perhaps?) Or do you understate your income because Medicaid is better than a cheapo exchange plan? The answer will presumably be different if you live in a state that doesn\u2019t even offer expanded Medicaid to you** if you\u2019re too poor to qualify for an exchange subsidy.\n\nAnother reason to just fold Medicaid and let the poor use the exchanges, with subsidies, Beebe style.\n\n[Thanks to alert reader M for the tip]\n\nUpdate: Neo-NeoCon has been thinking about this \u2026\n\n_____\n\n**\u2013Thanks to JustOneMinute for pointing out a large error in my original calculation. This one is based on Kaiser\u2019s estimate of a $9718 subsidy for a single parent family of four in Florida making 101% of poverty ($19,725).\n\n***\u2013Perhaps because you are a childless adult, or because your state has a Medicaid eligibility cutoff below 100% of poverty.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mickey Kaus", "description": "A mess at the bottom of Obamacare: We know what happens when people who claim subsidies on the Obamacare exchanges underestimate their income--the IRS will grab", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A mess at the bottom of Obamacare: We know what happens when people who claim subsidies on the Obamacare exchanges underestimate their income--the IRS will grab the unwarranted part of the subsidy bac", "title": "Falling through Obamacare\u2019s floor?", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/07/falling-through-obamacares-floor/", "image": {"width": 90, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/themes/thedc/images/the-dc.png", "height": 90}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/07/falling-through-obamacares-floor/", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "description": "A mess at the bottom of Obamacare: We know what happens when people who claim subsidies on the Obamacare exchanges underestimate their income--the IRS...", "card": "summary", "title": "Falling through Obamacare\u2019s floor?
