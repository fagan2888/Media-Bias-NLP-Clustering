REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman\n\n3976385\n\nColorado\u2019s state run healthcare exchange will spend an additional $4.2 million in marketing and advertising to boost its dismal enrollment figures.\n\nThis comes on top of $21 million the state already spent to encourage people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOnly about 6,000 people have used the Connect for Health Colorado website to sign up for private health insurance since Oct. 1, according to the latest figures. Officials are hoping the new media blitz \u2014 involving ads on practically all media from TV to online \u2014 will increase those numbers.\n\nThe marketing campaign is called \u201cMade in Colorado\u201d and will feature locals talking to one another about the benefits of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe designed our Marketplace to reflect what is important in our state \u2014 an open, competitive environment with lots of choice,\u201d said CEO Patty Fontneau in an announcement on the group\u2019s website. \u201cAs we communicate and educate about the new health insurance options, we wanted to have Coloradans speaking to fellow Coloradans.\u201d\n\nThe ads are far more benign than the controversial \u201cbrosurance\u201d ads that most recently featured a young woman gushing about how easy it is to get birth control under her healthcare plan and hoping that bedding a man is just as easy.\n\nThose ads were financed by another group, the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative.\n\nRepublican Rep. Cory Gardner, a vocal critic of Obamacare, has slammed the Colorado exchange as a \u201cdisaster\u201d in the early weeks of its rollout, calling the initial $21 million spent on marketing a waste of money. Only 226 people signed up in the first week.\n\n\u201cLook, if you spent $21 million on a bake sale and sold 10 dozen muffins, that would be a complete disaster,\u201d Gardner said in early October.\n\nWhile the numbers have improved, they are still far from the goal of signing up 136,000 people in the first year. Colorado has an estimated 350,000 people who are uninsured.\n\n\u201cIt touches our community constantly, the young, creative community,\u201d said Jasper Gray, a director with the Denver-based film and production company that shot the television spots. \u201cI see it time and time again, people who get sick or hurt don\u2019t have insurance, and then can\u2019t get it because then they have a pre-existing condition. Our whole community is one that needs to think carefully about health insurance and should benefit from these changes.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the new ads, Connect for Health Colorado is also holding educational and outreach events around the state.\n\nFollow Greg on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
