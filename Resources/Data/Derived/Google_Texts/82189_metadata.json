Tom Fallis, now 36 is accused of killing his 28-year-old wife at their Evans home on Jan. 1, 2012. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAshley Fallis\u2019 death was initially ruled a suicide.\n\nThe case was reopened in April 2014 after new evidence was discovered. The Weld County Grand Jury indicted Fallis in November 2014.\n\nAshley Fallis\u2019 family had long advocated for the case to be reopened.\n\nA 115-person jury pool will be called, Weld County District Court Judge Thomas Quammen said during a hearing on Friday. Potential jurors will fill out written questionnaires Monday morning before some will be called back for additional questioning.\n\nQuammen did not know how long jury selection will take.\n\nWeld County prosecutors argue that Tom Fallis shot his wife in the head after a New Year\u2019s Eve party at their home.\n\nBut defense attorneys argue she killed herself. Fallis\u2019 attorneys plan to present a suicide note that was written six months before her death.\n\nDuring a hearing on Friday, Quammen found that prosecutors failed to properly disclose information about a key witness in the case and the information was later improperly destroyed by the detective in the case.\n\nIn 2014, Nick Glover, a neighbor of the Fallises\u2019, told investigators that, outside his window, he heard Tom Fallis confess to killing his wife in 2012.\n\nBut the statement that defense attorneys say prosecutors \u201cburied\u201d and then destroyed was from a witness who said, days after Ashley Fallis\u2019 death, Glover told him that she had killed herself.\n\n\u201cThat is a key piece of information,\u201d Quammen said.\n\nThe judge denied defense attorneys\u2019 requests to have the charge dismissed and their request to prohibit the prosecution from presenting testimony from Glover.\n\nBut the judge did decided that the jury should be made aware of the prosecutors\u2019 actions. Quammen will write a summary of the incident which will eventually be read to the jury.\n\nThe judge previously ruled that Fallises\u2019 children will be allowed to testify during the trial, according to the Greeley Tribune.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to last three weeks.\n\nJordan Steffen: 303-954-1794, jsteffen@denverpost.com or @jsteffendp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Weld County: Jury selection starts Monday for former corrections officer accused of killing wife", "title": "Weld County: Jury selection starts Monday for former corrections officer accused of killing wife", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/13/weld-county-jury-selection-starts-monday-for-former-corrections-officer-accused-of-killing-wife/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__Ashley_Fallisp1.jpg", "height": 261}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__Ashley_Fallisp1.jpg?w=1400", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-13T11:50:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T20:33:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "GREELEY \u2014 Jury selection will begin on Monday in the trial of a former Weld County corrections officer accused of shooting and killing his wife in 2012.\nWeld County prosecutors argue that Tom Fallis shot his wife in the head after a New Year\u2019s Eve party at their home.\nFallis\u2019 attorneys plan to present a suicide note that was written six months before her death.\nA 115-person jury pool will be called, Weld County District Court Judge Thomas Quammen said during a hearing on Friday.\nTom Fallis, now 36 is accused of killing his 28-year-old wife at their Evans home on Jan. 1, 2012."}
