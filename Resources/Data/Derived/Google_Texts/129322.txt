The family of a Kansas woman who was seriously injured in a car crash that killed her 1-month-old daughter says a GoFundMe page set up in the woman's name appears to be an attempt at fraud.

University of Kansas Hospital released a statement Friday on behalf of 22-year-old Breonna Emery's family, which says it has filed a complaint with the state attorney general's office. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the fund has raised more than $13,000 from more than 400 donors.

Emery was driving west on US-24 west of Perry on Monday when she drove onto the gravel shoulder, overcorrected and slid into the path of an eastbound pickup truck.

The collision killed 1-month-old Kaysein Harris, who was in her safety seat, and injured a 3-year-old passenger.
