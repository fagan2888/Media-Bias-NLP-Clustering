Vermillion, SD

It seems there is no middle ground in South Dakota; you are either a Yote or a Jack. Today is the day when that choice really matters.

The Dakota Dome played host to the South Dakota Showdown, and the fans were excited. While they haven't played every season, this football tradition dates way back to 1889. Whether the fans are wearing red or blue, they all enjoy this rivalry game.

“It's a great rivalry to have come back now that they're both D-1. It's perfect way to celebrate, and perfect to bring my family together because we have generations of SDSU Alumni.

It's just really exciting. I always remember those games growing up as a kid, getting to go to the State U games, and then being a part of those as a Coyote is really fun too. I just think it's really good for the state to renew the rivalry,” USD Alum Annie Roche said.

The game brings people together, even if they're wearing different colors.
