Above him hangs a wall-sized portrait depicting the famous biblical scene of the Last Supper in delicate detail. The electricity just went out again, a common occurrence in Syria over the past three and a half years of civil war. Jabar, seemingly so accustomed to the lights flickering out, doesn\u2019t even acknowledge that the room has suddenly plunged into darkness.\n\nThe small barracks lie on the southern frontline against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in al-Hasakah, Syria. The building, an abandoned house, is now the home of the 30 men in The Martyr Obdar Company \u2013 named after a fallen soldier \u2013 of the Assyrian Military Council, a militia representing the ethnic Assyrian Christian population of Syria. Yet Jabar is neither Assyrian nor Christian \u2014 he is a Syrian Arab Muslim, who has picked up arms with the Christians of al-Hasakah, to fight with them against ISIS.\n\nMintPress News moves the interview outside into the afternoon light, where young Assyrian Christians are sitting on the ground, cleaning the barrels of M-6 machine guns, and standing guard from rooftops and outlying trenches. Jabar nods his head to graffiti etched in red on the wall of one of their barracks.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our acronym, MFS [Assyrian Military Council], who we fight under,\u201d he says, tightening the black scarf knotted in fighter-fashion around his head.\n\nJabar\u2019s youthful looks make it clear that he is one of the younger members of the company, but his awareness of the political and cultural history of his homeland belies his years.\n\n\u201cMy goal and our goal is to finish the religious problems here, and not let ISIS take over here and occupy our land. We want to protect our people here like the Kurds, Arabs and Christians.\u201d\n\nA peaceful coexistence\n\nA Dwekh Nawsha militia member sits on top of a tombstone inside a 200-year-old monastery in the Christian village of Bakufa, 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) north of Mosul, Iraq, Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2014.

Why then, Jabar asks, should he have to choose to join the Kurdish YPG (and majority Muslim force) fighters in battle, rather than the Christian fighters?\n\nJabar explains:\n\n\u201cWe want to finish sectarianism. ISIS doesn\u2019t want us to be together, yet we have been living all of these years together, Muslim and Christian, and nothing happened, everything was fine, but now ISIS \u2013 they don\u2019t want that.\u201d\n\nAs far as Jabar is concerned, the fight against ISIS is not along religious lines \u2013 the fight is about allowing people of all walks of life to live in his country under an inclusive democracy.\n\nIn the northern half of al-Hasakah province (termed Rojava by the majority Kurdish population), the defense of the region from the extremists of ISIS and the Nusra Front (Jabhat al-Nusra), an al-Qaida-linked group fighting in Syria, has taken an inter-faith path. Although Jabar is mainly an anomaly at the grassroots level, his anti-sectarian vision is being echoed at the top of the political and military arenas.\n\nThe Kurdish YPG forces, made up almost exclusively of Muslim Kurds \u2013 although some Muslim Arabs are also fighters \u2013 now coordinate and fight against ISIS alongside the Assyrian Military Council. Where extremist militant organizations like ISIS and the Nusra Front have attempted to divide Syria and Iraq along sectarian lines, in Rojava their attempts have not just been nullified, but have seemingly spurred on the formation of new partnerships, as well as a new inclusive vision for the region \u2013 a vision that is in essence the opposite of what ISIS has pushed for.\n\n\u201cAnd now we fight for all the kinds of people here,\u201d Mahmoud Hussein, a Muslim YPG fighter who is based a few kilometers north of the MFS compound, tells MintPress. \u201cChristian, Muslim, Arab, Kurdish, from all the people who live here, we don\u2019t have any religious lines, we are together, we fight together to protect all of our land, so that anyone can have a life here, whoever you are.\u201d\n\nBuilding an inclusive democracy\n\nBack at the Assyrian Military Council\u2019s barracks, the leader of the company, Johan Coser, tells MintPress that while he is firmly committed to the right of Assyrians to be represented as an ethnic populace and the protection of their religion, Christianity, he stressed he doesn\u2019t believe the struggle of the Assyrians has anything to do with religion. He admits that he is not religious, just a man who wants to help protect the Assyrians of Syria and build a democracy in the Rojava region for all who wish for it.\n\nMatai Nashro, who hails from the Syrian border town of Qamishli, around 40 kilometers to the north, nods in agreement as he listens in from above. Manning the roof of the barracks, he looks southward, the mist and fog obscuring the horizon \u2013 ISIS militants lay in wait about a mile away.\n\nDespite being embroiled in the long and deadly Syrian civil war, Nashro continues to appear determined, relishing the fight against ISIS \u2014 a group that has pledged to banish his religion from Iraq and Syria and kill anyone, whether Muslim, Christian, Kurd, Arab or Assyrian, who does not abide by the group\u2019s draconian laws.\n\n\u201cWe have been to the frontlines, the very last line of defense, and we do this often,\u201d Nashro says as clouds gathered overhead, rain slightly falling as winter begins to descend on Syria and its battlefields. \u201cEverytime we come back, we know more than ever how strong we can fight. We have killed them [ISIS] in this war and we will continue to do this, so that this place can be safe.\u201d\n\nDirectly below Nashro, the wall is etched with the words \u201cBeth Nahrain\u201d in Arabic \u2013 the historical term Assyrians use for Mesopotamia, which means \u201chouse of two rivers.\u201d\n\nNashro\u2019s barracks are located in a previously ransacked Christian village in the province. The village church, around 100 meters away, has the words \u201cIslamic State\u201d scratched into its walls. The roof and interior have been completely destroyed, blown up by the militants when they came under attack from the advancing \u2014 and cooperating \u2014 Assyrian and Kurdish fighting forces. ISIS fled as the joint force took over the village, but has now regrouped just about a mile away \u2013 their snipers a constant threat in the no-man\u2019s land that begins in front of Nashro\u2019s barracks.\n\nRedur Xelil, the spokesperson for the Kurdish YPG, told MintPress that it is the sort of joint force that reclaimed the village that the Martyr Obdar Company of the Assyrian Military Council are now based in, which is helping to stabilize the Rojava region in contrast to other areas of Syria, militarily and politically.\n\n\u201cThere are other people who live on this land, who have the right to share this land and to fight with us,\u201d Xelil says. \u201cThese people [Assyrian Military Council] are doing the same as what we are doing, they are a strong army, fighting for our land, our country and our people.\u201d\n\nThe cooperation between the YPG and the Assyrian Military Council will continue, Xelil stressed \u2013 and not just through the armed fight against ISIS. Cooperation between all groups in the region is a prerequisite for the creation of a fair and democratic region, Xelil asserts, and it is a belief that is being strengthened \u2013 not weakened \u2013 by the presence of ISIS.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cISIS doesn\u2019t want us to be together, yet we have been living all of these years together, Muslim and Christian, and nothing happened, everything was fine, but now ISIS \u2013 they don\u2019t want that,\u201d one member of the militia fighting for an inclusive democracy tells MintPress.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Matthew Vickery & Sheren Khalel", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "\u201cISIS doesn\u2019t want us to be together, yet we have been living all of these years together, Muslim and Christian, and nothing happened, everything was fine, but now ISIS \u2013 they don\u2019t want that,\u201d one member of the militia fighting for an inclusive democracy tells MintPress.", "title": "VIDEO: Fight Against ISIS In Syrian Province Crosses Religious And Ethnic Lines", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/video-fight-isis-syrian-province-crosses-religious-ethnic-lines/200208/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP533935863942.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-01T00:51:32-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cISIS doesn\u2019t want us to be together, yet we have been living all of these years together, Muslim and Christian, and nothing happened, everything was fine, but now ISIS \u2013 they don\u2019t want that,\u201d one member of the militia fighting for an inclusive democracy tells MintPress.", "title": "VIDEO: Fight Against ISIS In Syrian Province Crosses Religious And Ethnic Lines", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP533935863942.jpg", "creator": "@MMVickery", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Foreign Affairs", "tag": "Syria", "published_time": "2014-12-27T05:00:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-01T00:51:32-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "The small barracks lie on the southern frontline against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in al-Hasakah, Syria.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\u201cThat\u2019s our acronym, MFS [Assyrian Military Council], who we fight under,\u201d he says, tightening the black scarf knotted in fighter-fashion around his head.\nYet Jabar is neither Assyrian nor Christian \u2014 he is a Syrian Arab Muslim, who has picked up arms with the Christians of al-Hasakah, to fight with them against ISIS.\nThe Kurdish YPG forces, made up almost exclusively of Muslim Kurds \u2013 although some Muslim Arabs are also fighters \u2013 now coordinate and fight against ISIS alongside the Assyrian Military Council.\nAL-HASAKAH PROVINCE, Syria \u2014 Saed Jabar sits cross-legged on the floor of a small dark room."}
