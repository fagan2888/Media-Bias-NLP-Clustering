You can leave if you choose. I told you what I think about Texas. I wouldn\u2019t live there for all the tea in China. And that\u2019s how I feel. For all intents and purposes I know what my state did, which in many respects is close to being just as crazy, and that is they did not expand Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThe hearing in the rules committee was marking up a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which was approximately the 56th vote taken by the Republican-led House to repeal the bill. The discussion got heated as the parties talked about states implementing parts of the law including Medicaid expansion.\n\nBurgess later asked that Hastings apologize for what he said about his home state. Hastings was unequivocal in his refusal to back off his earlier statement.\n\n\u201cYou will wait until hell freezes over (in response to being told they would wait for an apology) for me to say anything in an apology,\u201d Hastings said. \u201cI would apologize to you if I was directing my comments at you. I was commenting about the state you happened to be a resident of. I will not apologize.\u201d\n\nTuesday all 25 Texas House Republicans demanded Hastings apologize to the citizens of Texas, according to the Houston Chronicle. Hastings has not issued an apology and has not indicated he will do so.\n\n\"I'm regretting that certain of their citizenry was offended, but what I would ask them to do is to take a line from the movie \"Frozen\" and let it go,\" Hastings told NBC 6.\n\nThe exchange was covered on \"The Daily Show\" in which host Jon Stewart pointed out to Hastings, \u201cYou\u2019re from Florida and you\u2019re calling Texas crazy?\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida Representative Alcee Hastings left no doubt this week about how he felt about the state of Texas when he called it a \u201ccrazy state\u201d during a meeting of the House Rules Committee.", "title": "Representative Alcee Hastings Calls Texas a &quot;Crazy State&quot;", "og": {"site_name": "NBC 6 South Florida", "description": "Florida Representative Alcee Hastings left no doubt this week about how he felt about the state of Texas when he called it a \u201ccrazy state\u201d during a meeting of the House Rules Committee.", "title": "WATCH: Fla.
