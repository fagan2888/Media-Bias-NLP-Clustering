Yes. Is it over? No. Is it likely to rage from here? I think highly doubtful.\u201d\n\nMr. Cooperman, the CEO of Omega, which has about $10 billion under management, said the market is about fairly valued at current levels. The S&P 500 trades at 15.4 times next year\u2019s earnings.\n\n\u201cIf the economy\u2019s growing at 2%-2.5% and profits are growing, say, 5%, inflation is 1.5%, short rates are zero and the 10-year government [bond] is currently 2.70%, there\u2019s no basis for the market to have a 30% year again like it did last year,\u201d Mr. Cooperman said. \u201cI think the market is in a zone of fair valuation.\u201d\n\nHe sees the S&P 500 moving up to the mid-1900s by the end of the year as long as the economy can keep growing at its current pace. The S&P 500 recently dropped 0.3% to 1872. It has rallied 177% off the March 2009 bottom.\n\n\u201cI think it will continue to age because most bear markets relate to a recession and it does not look like a recession is in the cards anytime soon,\u201d Mr. Cooperman said.\n\nIn addition Mr. Cooperman, whose firm owns about 2% of eBay sided with billionaire investor Carl Icahn\u2018s mission to get the ecommerce company to spin off payments unit PayPal.\n\n\u201cI give Carl a lot of credit for taking the time and showing the energy, and in this case, we happen to agree with him,\u201d Mr. Cooperman said in the interview. \u201cI think they should spin out a portion of PayPal.\u201d\n\nWatch the interview:", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Hedge-fun manager Leon Cooperman, the founder of  Omega Advisors, said the five-year bull market in stocks hasn't peaked, but isn't likely \"to rage\" from current levels.", "title": "Leon Cooperman: Aging Bull Market Isn\u2019t Over", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/10/leon-cooperman-aging-bull-market-isnt-over/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-QX586_wow120_G_20111208090243.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Leon Cooperman: Aging Bull Market Isn\u2019t Over", "description": "Hedge-fun manager Leon Cooperman, the founder of  Omega Advisors, said the five-year bull market in stocks hasn't peaked, but isn't likely \"to rage\" from current levels.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Steven Russolillo", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Hedge-fun manager Leon Cooperman, the founder of  Omega Advisors, said the five-year bull market in stocks hasn't peaked, but isn't likely \"to rage\" from current levels.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-03-10T17:43:39-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/10/leon-cooperman-aging-bull-market-isnt-over/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-17761", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Hedge-fun manager Leon Cooperman, the founder of  Omega Advisors, said the five-year bull market in stocks hasn't peaked, but isn't likely \"to rage\" from current levels.", "title": "Leon Cooperman: Aging Bull Market Isn\u2019t Over", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/10/leon-cooperman-aging-bull-market-isnt-over/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-QX586_wow120_G_20111208090243.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-17761", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-10T18:41:33-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb4a2\"", "article_summary": "Leon Cooperman Bloomberg NewsHedge-fun manager Leon Cooperman, the founder of Omega Advisors, said the five-year bull market in stocks hasn\u2019t peaked, but isn\u2019t likely \u201cto rage\u201d from current levels.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a very classical\u201d Mr. Cooperman said Monday in an interview on CNBC.\nThe S&P 500 trades at 15.4 times next year\u2019s earnings.\nThe S&P 500 recently dropped 0.3% to 1872.\n\u201cI give Carl a lot of credit for taking the time and showing the energy, and in this case, we happen to agree with him,\u201d Mr. Cooperman said in the interview."}
