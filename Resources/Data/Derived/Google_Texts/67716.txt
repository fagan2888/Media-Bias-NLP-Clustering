Whether they’re looking for a dining option or planning to purchase flowers or fill some baskets, it looks like consumers will spend more on Easter than they have recently.

Spending at retailers will be at the highest level — $17.2 billion or $146 per person — in the 13 years the National Retail Federation has been conducting a seasonal survey. Last year, consumers spent $16.4 billion or $140.62 per person.

Following Christmas sales that were less than desirable, it’s something that has retailers excited.

“Retailers are beginning one of their busiest times of year and are more than ready as consumers shop for spring essentials,” NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said in the report. “Shoppers will find promotions on a number of items on their lists, from Easter baskets to sports equipment, home goods, garden tools and more.”

Consumers will spend $5.5 billion on food, $3 billion on clothing, $2.7 billion on gifts, $2.4 billion on candy and $1.2 billion on flowers nationwide.

Thyme of Grace reopening

After shutting down for a few months, the Thyme of Grace restaurant will reopen Monday.
