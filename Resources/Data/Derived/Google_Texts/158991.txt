Kevin Hart can be overwhelming: He has none of Chris Rock’s nuance or modulation. But he found a way to bring a smart, unpredictable angle to the #OscarsSoWhite debate as he introduced the performance of “Earned It,” the best song nominee by The Weeknd.

He led into it with a classic zinger. “I only came tonight because I thought for sure I’d get a seat in the front row,” alluding to how much more likely he’d be to get camera time during a ceremony that many high-profile black actors and filmmakers were avoiding because of the dearth of diversity in this year’s nominees.

“Let’s not let this negative issue of diversity beat us,” he said. “Let’s do why we do and work hard.” Hart talked passionately about the ambition and effort that drives people even when they feel they’re being overlooked.
