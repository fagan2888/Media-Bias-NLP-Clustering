Ted Yoho\u2019s primary challenger claims Yoho is \u201cfirst in line\u201d at \u201cfeeding at the special interest trough,\u201d but offers up two misleading examples:\n\nThe ad accuses Yoho of taking \u201ca nearly $20,000 junket paid for by a special interest group.\u201d But the ad doesn\u2019t mention that the \u201cjunket\u201d was a trip to Israel or that Yoho is a member of the House Foreign Affairs\u2019 subcommittees on the Middle East and terrorism.\n\nIt also says, \u201cYoho takes an Obamacare subsidy for himself.\u201d The \u201csubsidy,\u201d as we have said before, is nothing new. The government, like most large employers, has long paid part of health care premiums for its employees, including members of Congress.\n\nThe ad is the work of Florida Conservatives United \u2014 a group formed in July by Robert Rush, who is the father of Yoho\u2019s challenger, Jake Rush, in the Aug. 26 Republican primary. Robert Rush and his sister, Marian Rush, each donated $100,000 to the super PAC. As of Aug. 6, the PAC had no other donors. Marian Rush works at her brother\u2019s law firm.\n\n\u2018Junket\u2019 \u2026 to Israel\n\nYoho won election to Florida\u2019s 3rd Congressional District in 2012 with the support of tea party groups. He barely upset 12-term congressman Cliff Stearns in the Republican primary and then coasted to victory in the general election.\n\nThe last-minute attack ad from the Rush family PAC accuses Yoho of being a hypocrite. The ad \u2014 complete with snorting pigs, stacks of dollar bills and floating dollar signs \u2014 quotes him as saying during the 2012 campaign: \u201cCareer politicians are like pigs feeding at the trough.\u201d\n\nThe ad goes on to say, \u201cNow, he\u2019s first in line at the trough, accepting a nearly $20,000 junket paid for by a special interest group.\u201d A jet plane, stacks of dollar bills and a globe are shown to illustrate the excess.\n\nBut the ad leaves out key details, notably the location of the trip and the reason for it.\n\nThe trip was to Tel Aviv, Israel, and cost $19,186 for Yoho and his wife, according to Legistorm, a nonpartisan website that tracks congressional travel. It was paid for by the American Israel Education Foundation, an arm of the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group known as the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).\n\nYoho is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and sits on two subcommittees: Middle East and North Africa, and Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade.\n\nLegistorm describes the trip this way, based on travel documents that it compiled from public records: \u201cRepublican members of Congress educational trip including meetings with top Israeli officials, seminars on history and foreign policy, and tours of multiple strategic and historical sites, including Israel\u2019s border with the Gaza Strip.\u201d\n\nThe Gaza Strip, of course, is now the site of a war between Israel and Hamas, and Yoho sits on a key House subcommittee that deals with trouble in the Middle East. During the visit, the 29-member congressional delegation met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saeb Erekat, the chief negotiator for the Palestinian Authority, according to the Gainesville Sun.\n\nOf course, these trips mix business and pleasure, and Yoho told the Gainesville paper that it was \u201cawesome\u201d to visit the historic and religious sites. But to suggest it was a pleasure \u201cjunket\u201d with no educational or diplomatic value is misleading.\n\n\u2018Obamacare Subsidy\u2019 Yet Again\n\nThe ad also raps Yoho, an opponent of the Affordable Care Act, for being a hypocrite on Obamacare. It says, \u201cCandidate Yoho opposed Obamacare, but while families suffer under Obamacare, Congressman Yoho takes an Obamacare subsidy for himself.\u201d It shows a doctored image of Yoho wearing an \u201cI like Obamacare\u201d button.\n\nBut there is no \u201cObamacare subsidy.\u201d Members of Congress get the same employer contribution from the federal government to buy health insurance on the exchange created by the ACA as they did when they were buying health insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits program.\n\nWe have debunked this line of attack so many times that we will just repeat what we said only last week about this gross distortions of the facts:\n\nFactCheck.org, Aug. 20: The Office of Personnel Management pays an average of 72 percent (but no more than 75 percent) of the private health insurance premiums for federal workers under the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, which until this year also covered members of Congress and their staffs. But to avoid another bogus criticism \u2014 that the Democrats\u2019 2010 health care bill would somehow have \u201cexempted\u201d members of Congress \u2014 the health care law requires House and Senate members and employees to purchase their health insurance through the ACA\u2019s new insurance exchanges, rather than through the FEHB. The Office of Personnel Management proposed to continue the same employer payments when congressional members and aides moved from the FEHB to the new exchanges. \u201cThe amount of the employer contribution toward their Exchange premiums is no more than would otherwise be made toward coverage under the FEHB Program,\u201d OPM stated.\n\nSome voters in the 3rd Congressional District may still view the trip to Israel as a \u201cjunket\u201d or the employer-contribution for health care as an \u201cObamacare subsidy\u201d even after learning the details that we lay out here. They are entitled to their opinions. But opinions should be based on facts, and the super PAC ad conveniently leaves them out of this ad.\n\n\u2014 Eugene Kiely", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "But opinions should be based on facts, and the super PAC ad conveniently leaves them out of this ad.\nIt also says, \u201cYoho takes an Obamacare subsidy for himself.\u201d The \u201csubsidy,\u201d as we have said before, is nothing new.\n\u2018Obamacare Subsidy\u2019 Yet AgainThe ad also raps Yoho, an opponent of the Affordable Care Act, for being a hypocrite on Obamacare.\nIt says, \u201cCandidate Yoho opposed Obamacare, but while families suffer under Obamacare, Congressman Yoho takes an Obamacare subsidy for himself.\u201d It shows a doctored image of Yoho wearing an \u201cI like Obamacare\u201d button.\nThe last-minute attack ad from the Rush family PAC accuses Yoho of being a hypocrite."}
