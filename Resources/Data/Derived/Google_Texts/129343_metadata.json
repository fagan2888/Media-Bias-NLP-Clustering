Papp was released and reunited with husband, Dr. Denes Papp, at about 4:15 p.m.\n\n\"Initially it wasn't really scary,\" Papp said. \"First of all, I didn't really know what was going on.\"\n\nShe and other passengers, however, became concerned after two CDC officials boarded the plane.\n\n\"Then I was (scared) when two CDC officers came on board with the masks on and we realized it could be related to some sort of infectious disease,\" she said.\n\nPapp said the flight crew seemed to have as much information as the passengers about the situation.\n\n\"The flight crew was very polite and tried to be helpful during the ordeal but they seemed to have as little information as the passengers did,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother passenger, Motohito Mukai, who resides in New Jersey, said he wasn\u2019t alarmed even after seeing the CDC officials in their masks. The worst of the ordeal, he said, was the hours on the tarmac and coming through customs.\n\n\"I am not scared, (it\u2019s) just the waiting, waiting, waiting,\u201d he said.\n\nJohan Gerinck, who lives in Brussels but works for Johnson and Johnson, said CDC officials had given passengers a list of symptoms that they needed to report immediately.\n\n\"They gave us a paper with all of the symptoms (and said) in case we got any of the symptoms, we should contact them,\" Gerinck said.\n\nPapp said she will be much more careful from now on whenever she travels.\n\n\"I was thinking about next time I travel, I will take hand sanitizers with me,\" she said. \"From now on I definitely will be more cautious.
