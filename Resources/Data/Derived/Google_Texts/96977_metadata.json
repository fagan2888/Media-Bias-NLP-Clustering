The others skied out on their own.\n\nThirteen rescuers, including a mountain medical team, responded. When the avalanche hit, one of the skiers dialed 911 and notified a Grand County dispatcher.\n\nSudden wet heavy spring snow on a weak base, combined with strong wind, created conditions where avalanches were likely.\n\nAccording to a Colorado Avalanche Information Center bulletin, state transportation crews triggered a dozen or so shallow snow slabs Sunday morning as part of their efforts to control avalanches. Clearing skies and warming temperatures Monday are expected to reduce snow stability. Sunshine in May rapidly can weaken fresh snow.\n\nThe snowfall in Colorado\u2019s high mountains from the Sangre de Cristos northward ranged from eight inches to more than a foot.\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, bfinley@denverpost.com or twitter.com/finleybruce", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Skiers off Berthoud Pass survive avalanche", "title": "Skiers off Berthoud Pass survive avalanche", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/10/skiers-off-berthoud-pass-survive-avalanche/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-10T18:48:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-10T18:48:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc0e\"", "article_summary": "A skier savoring the big spring snow off Berthoud Pass just above timberline Sunday got caught in an avalanche and suffered an injury but survived.\nSudden wet heavy spring snow on a weak base, combined with strong wind, created conditions where avalanches were likely.\nThe avalanche struck one of the men, who suffered a knee injury, Grand County Emergency Medical Service commander Troy Nelson said.\nWhen the avalanche hit, one of the skiers dialed 911 and notified a Grand County dispatcher.\nGrand County rescuers reached two men and a woman at the scene of the avalanche \u2014 about 100 feet wide and 40 feet long \u2014 at about 11,500 feet elevation in the Currant Creek area."}
