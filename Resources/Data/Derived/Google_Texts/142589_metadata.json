Jim Rubens is jumping into the race to defeat Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen Wednesday. Before he even reaches the starting blocks, Democrats are questioning his ability to reach women voters.\n\nThe reason? A 2009 post on his website that connects the rise of working women with what he says is a rise in mass shootings and other violence perpetrated by men.\n\n\u201cThe collaborative, flexible, amorphously-hierarchical American economy is shutting out ordinary men who were once the nation\u2019s breadwinners in living-wage labor and manufacturing jobs,\u201d Rubens wrote. \u201cBecause status success is more vital to the male psychology, males are falling over the edge in increasing numbers.\u201d\n\nA \u201ccollaborative\u201d and \u201cflexible\u201d economy is one that has opened the door to more women working, Rubens wrote. And the nature of the changing economy has had a detrimental effect on men, including an increase in violence.\n\n\u201cThe collapsing number of male jobs in the increasingly female-centric economy just adds to the already harsher impact of OverSuccess on males,\u201d he wrote, referring to the title of his 2008 book.\n\nIt\u2019s a view Rubens still holds today, and he seemed surprised in an interview Wednesday that anyone would care about it.\n\n\u201cThe point of this, if you read the whole thing, is that manufacturing jobs, which have been the basis for higher-wage working men during the post-World War II era have been in decline,\u201d he said. \u201cMen are more sensitive than women to external indicators of status, which is one of the points in my book \u2014 which you might want to read so you can understand the whole point of this \u2014 and it\u2019s very important to all people, women and men, to have jobs, functions, and roles in life that are fulfilling and productive and engaging.\u201d\n\nThe loss of manufacturing jobs that men often held in favor of \u201ccollaborative\u201d jobs that favor women, Rubens said, \u201chas increased stress in males.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tiny fraction of males that become stressed for whatever reason and engage in acts of extreme violence,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look through individual psychology of mass shooters over the past 10-20 years, you can see that in the profile. Often its a person who has been subjected to extreme stress in the form of social rejection, job loss and associated mental health issues.\u201d\n\nTweaking the tax code to add manufacturing jobs would be one way to reduce this \u201cstress\u201d on men, Rubens said.\n\nOn paper, Rubens is something of a radical when it comes to Republican politics. He favors a carbon tax, is pro-choice, and supports same-sex marriage rights. But Democrats, who were pushing Rubens\u2019 website on reporters in advance of his official announcement Wednesday, think his musings on a perceived rise in violence like serial killings and mass shootings perpetrated by men will make him a tough sell to women.\n\n\u201cI am a moderate on social issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not seeking to change the Roe v. Wade law as some Republicans have campaigned on in the past, and I am encouraging Republicans to focus on fiscal issues.\u201d\n\nRubens says he\u2019s a strong supporter of women going to work, and cites the fact that he has a female business partner. He said what men \u2014 and society \u2014 need are an increase in the kinds of manufacturing jobs that have gone away. Rubens says that would help decrease violence by men.\n\n\u201cIf you read the \u2026 posting, I don\u2019t see anything that causes anyone to conclude I\u2019m seeking to in any way make a claim that it\u2019s not great that women have come up in the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife is my business partner so I know that it\u2019s fantastic that the economy has made a fulsome role for women as I was pointing out in the posting. We need to get manufacturing jobs back.\u201d\n\nAdding those jobs \u201cwill help the problem identified in that posting,\u201d he said. He also called for mental health reforms, \u201cdecreasing the cost and increasing the quality\u201d of care. Rubens said Shaheen\u2019s vote for Obamacare was a vote that added to the mental health care problem, as well as added the kind of stress to men that leads to violence.\n\n\u201c[Obamacare] is contributing to a conversion of full-time jobs to part-time jobs. This is causing serious threats to working families,\u201d he said. \u201cThe source of this sudden interest in a post I wrote five years ago, I know where that\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s coming from my opponent, Jeanne Shaheen, who is the cause, personally, as the 60th vote of Obamacare, of this stress on working families.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2613865, "userid": 568833}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Former Republican state Sen.
