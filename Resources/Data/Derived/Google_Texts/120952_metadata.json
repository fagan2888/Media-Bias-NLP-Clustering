So part of the way that the narrow network plans reduced costs was by shifting the site of care towards primary care, and away from more expensive settings. We examined several measures of hospital quality and found no evidence that narrow network enrollment was associated with a shift towards lower quality hospitals.\"\n\nNarrow Provider Networks Set to Spread\n\nMcKnight conducted the research with Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an architect of Massachusetts' healthcare reform effort, and a technical advisor to the Obama administration on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe study was funded in part by the National Institute on Aging and the National Bureau of Economic Research.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Research on Massachusetts government workers finds no evidence that narrow network enrollment is associated with a shift towards lower quality hospitals.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe24e5\"", "article_summary": "Narrow Networks Cut Costs, Not Quality, Economists SayResearch on Massachusetts government workers finds no evidence that narrow network enrollment is associated with a shift towards lower quality hospitals.\nWe examined several measures of hospital quality and found no evidence that narrow network enrollment was associated with a shift towards lower quality hospitals.\"\nA pair of Massachusetts economists has conducted research that casts narrow healthcare provider networks in a favorable light.\n\"Interestingly, enrollment in a narrow network plan led to an increase in primary care visits.\nSo part of the way that the narrow network plans reduced costs was by shifting the site of care towards primary care, and away from more expensive settings."}
