The government of predecessor Janez Jansa \u2014 formed after an early vote in 2011 \u2014 collapsed last year when he faced corruption allegations.\n\nAnalysts have predicted another coalition government and more uncertainty after Sunday's balloting.\n\nThe party of newcomer Miro Cerar \u2014 a law expert and the son of Slovenian Olympic medalist Miroslav Cerar \u2014 is tipped to win the most votes, around 30 percent. The 50-year-old parliamentary consultant only formed the party in June, but swiftly gained popularity because of his untainted public record.\n\nCerar said upon casting his ballot that \"people have lost trust in political parties.\"\n\n\"They know the crisis is still strong,\" he added. \"The only possibility for ending it is to have new people, unburdened by past stories, enter politics.\"\n\nCerar is challenged by Jansa's conservative Slovene Democratic Party. Jansa was jailed last month for corruption in an arms deal, but has sought to portray himself as the victim of leftist political opponents and a staged bribery trial.\n\nThe Social Democrats and the Pensioners' party are trailing behind.\n\nCerar has opposed the privatization of some of Slovenia's state-run companies, which is part of an EU-backed anti-crisis package. The outgoing government froze the sale process of Slovenia's main airport and Telekom Slovenia until a new Cabinet is formed.\n\nSlovenia plunged into financial turmoil during the eurozone debt crisis. Once the most prosperous of the eastern European countries, the Alpine nation has narrowly avoided international bailout.\n\nDuring just over a year in office, Bratusek's center-left government stabilized Slovenia's ailing banks at the center of the crisis.\n\nSlovenia has 1.7 million voters.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/WORLD", "dcterms.abstract": "Slovenes voted
