But Jenkins\u2019 \u201call in\u201d approach on such contentious issues is unusual heading into an election year.\n\nRepublican Ron Natinsky has already announced his candidacy. The local GOP has already started blasting away at Jenkins. And some of the early returns on the voter ID law and Obamacare have provided Jenkins\u2019 opponents with fodder.\n\nThe county judge said his approach boils down to \u201creal people.\u201d\n\nJoining Jenkins\u2019 mother, wife and daughter at the filing were community volunteer Edna Pemberton and 19-year-old Luis Veloz. They \u2014 along with county Democratic Party Chair Darlene Ewing \u2014 shared their stories of why Obama\u2019s health care overhaul was important.\n\nUsing those examples, Jenkins said he was concerned about numbers beyond polls. That included what he described as tens of thousands county residents affected negatively by the voter ID law and the hundreds of thousands who might now have access to health insurance.\n\n\u201cMy opponents say \u2018Judge Jenkins either can\u2019t read polls\u2019 or \u2018He doesn\u2019t understand math,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re focused on polls, and we\u2019re focused on people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMS9kYWxsYXMtY291bnR5LWp1ZGdlLWNsYXktamVua2lucy1maWxlcy1mb3ItcmUtZWxlY3Rpb24uaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Tom Benning", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins filed on Tuesday for re-election, bringing along more than just family and friends for the occasion.
