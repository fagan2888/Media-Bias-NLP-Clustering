She could face up to three years in prison if convicted.\n\nMr. Nappen said his client wasn\u2019t aware it was against the law to drive through New Jersey with her .380 Bersa Thunder loaded with hollow-point bullets. She had bought the gun through a licensed dealer roughly a week before her arrest because she had been robbed twice earlier that year, the NBC affiliate reported.\n\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Firearm Owners Association, Pennsylvania concealed carry permits are honored in 30 other states, but that doesn\u2019t include New Jersey.\n\nMr. Nappen told the station he\u2019s seen at least a dozen cases similar to Ms. Allen\u2019s in the past year. He advocates for a federal law mandating concealed carry license reciprocity among states.\n\n\u201cPeople believe that your gun license should be treated like your driver\u2019s license. Right now there\u2019s a national law being proposed that would mandate that all states recognize other states licenses,\u201d he told the station. \u201cIt\u2019s still pending, but it\u2019s needed for people like this. I\u2019m calling that bill Shaneen\u2019s law.\u201d\n\nA court date for Ms. Allen has been set for August 5. Her lawyer said he plans to request a dismissal of all charges.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Pennsylvania mother with a concealed carry permit is now facing up to three years in prison because she notified police of her loaded handgun during a traffic stop in New Jersey.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Pennsylvania mother with a concealed carry permit is now facing up to three years in prison because she notified police of her loaded handgun during a traffic stop in New Jersey.", "title": "Pa. mother with concealed carry permit faces 3 years for N.J. traffic stop", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/20/pa-mother-concealed-carry-permit-faces-3-years-nj-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/20/shaneen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/20/shaneen.jpg", "description": "A Pennsylvania mother with a concealed carry permit is now facing up to three years in prison because she notified police of her loaded handgun during a traffic stop in New Jersey.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Pa. mother with concealed carry permit faces 3 years for N.J. traffic"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Shaneen Allen, Evan Nappen"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc778\"", "article_summary": "According to the Pennsylvania Firearm Owners Association, Pennsylvania concealed carry permits are honored in 30 other states, but that doesn\u2019t include New Jersey.\nA Pennsylvania mother with a concealed carry permit is now facing up to three years in prison because she notified police of her loaded handgun during a traffic stop in New Jersey.\nHe advocates for a federal law mandating concealed carry license reciprocity among states.\nMr. Nappen told the station he\u2019s seen at least a dozen cases similar to Ms. Allen\u2019s in the past year.\n\u201cShe voluntarily and honestly told the officer that she had her licensed handgun and gave him her license to carry,\u201d Ms. Allen\u2019s attorney, Evan Nappen, told the station."}
