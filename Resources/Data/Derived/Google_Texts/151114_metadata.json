But his critique is hard to follow \u2014 its object has been a moving target.\n\nIn a post last week, Frase used Sean Wilentz\u2019s recent New Republic hit piece on Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, and Glenn Greenwald as a jumping-off point to condemn \u201csome on the Left\u201d who believe \u201cdefending the possibility of government requires rejecting any alliance with libertarians who might criticize particularly noxious aspects of the existing state.\u201d\n\nBut in a follow-up post, he clarified that he wasn\u2019t advocating a literal \u201calliance\u201d with libertarians. Rather, he explains:\n\nI lump in left critics of Glenn Greenwald or Edward Snowden\u2019s \u2018libertarianism\u2019 with obvious partisan hack like Sean Wilentz [because] their arguments all point to the same thing: not a clarification of the Left\u2019s politics, but merely a stigmatization of anything that attacks the security state, as if that\u2019s somehow incompatible with the values of the Left.\n\nBut that explanation doesn\u2019t compute either. Of the two \u201cleft critics\u201d Frase offered as examples \u2014 Mark Ames and David Golumbia \u2014 neither appears to be engaged in a campaign of blanket \u201cstigmatization of anything that attacks the security state.\u201d Ames has praised 1970s CIA whistleblower (and actual defector) Phillip Agee \u2014 whose own politics were firmly on the Left, Ames notes, unlike today\u2019s leakers \u2014 for helping to spark a number of valuable restrictions on the security state. Ames compares him favorably to Assange and Snowden.\n\nDavid Golumbia recently wrote (in an online comment) that private intelligence contractors like Booz Allen Hamilton are \u201cevery bit as serious a problem for freedom as is surveillance directly conducted by governments, and by dint of being formally outside of oversight, may be even more worrisome.\u201d That may or may not get the issue just right, but it doesn\u2019t sound like a knee-jerk defense of the NSA to me.\n\nFrase quotes \u201clibertarian-ish\u201d blogger Will Wilkinson making a point similar to his own \u2014 that \u201cit\u2019s crazily illogical to reason that the actually existing state is justified on liberal terms just because the libertarian critique of the state is false.\u201d But the only named person to whom Wilkinson attributes that fallacy is \u2026 Sean Wilentz.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m not convinced there actually are any left-wing apologists for rampant NSA spying.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Frase is merely chasing phantoms. He is gesturing, somewhat wildly, at an old and knotty problem for the Left: the question of the state, its nature, and its uses. This insightful passage provides a hint of Frase\u2019s real concerns:\n\nAnd yet there is the persistent temptation to invoke the genie of state repression despite the Left\u2019s documented inability to make it do its bidding. That can take the form of \u201chumanitarian\u201d warmongering or what Elizabeth Bernstein has described as \u201ccarceral feminism\u201d: \u201ca vision of social justice as criminal justice\u201d that attempts to deploy the repressive power of the state to protect women who are portrayed as helpless victims.\n\nThe issues Frase is pointing to are real. The problem, though, is that somehow in talking about the Left and the state, he has gotten himself mixed up talking about libertarianism. Libertarianism, to put it mildly, is not helpful for the Left. As a political philosophy that revolves obsessively around the secondary question of \u201cthe role of government,\u201d it\u2019s an irrelevant monomania at best. At worst, it\u2019s a rhetorical decoy that uses procedural anti-statism as cover for a series of private tyrannies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A hard-to-follow essay took aim at the whistle-blower and journalist for having voiced some libertarian views", "title": "The latest weak attempt to discredit Snowden and Greenwald", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A hard-to-follow essay took aim at the whistle-blower and journalist for having voiced some libertarian views", "title": "The latest weak attempt to discredit Snowden and Greenwald", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/01/snowden_and_assange_may_raise_important_questions_about_the_state_but_that_doesnt_legitimize_the_lefts_need_for_libertarianism_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/greenwald_snowden.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A hard-to-follow essay took aim at the whistle-blower and journalist for having voiced some libertarian views", "title": "The latest weak attempt to discredit Snowden and Greenwald", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/greenwald_snowden.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Seth Ackerman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, cyberlibertarianism, Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald, Jacobin, Julian Assange, Libertarianism, Politics, The Left, the state", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: cyberlibertarianism, Edward Snowden, Glenn Greenwald, Jacobin, Julian Assange, Libertarianism, Politics, The Left, the state, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on JacobinA certain strand of left-wing anti-libertarianism has aroused the ire of my colleague Peter Frase.\nThe problem, though, is that somehow in talking about the Left and the state, he has gotten himself mixed up talking about libertarianism.\nHe is gesturing, somewhat wildly, at an old and knotty problem for the Left: the question of the state, its nature, and its uses.\nAt worst, it\u2019s a rhetorical decoy that uses procedural anti-statism as cover for a series of private tyrannies.\nAs a political philosophy that revolves obsessively around the secondary question of \u201cthe role of government,\u201d it\u2019s an irrelevant monomania at best."}
