The government has apologized for its past atrocities, handed over 170 million New Zealand dollars ($128 million) and agreed the tribe should manage a sprawling, rugged national park it calls home.\n\nLast year\u2019s settlement is one of dozens the government has signed with Maori tribes in a comprehensive, multi-billion dollar process described in a U.N. report as imperfect but nevertheless \u201cone of the most important examples in the world of an effort to address historical and ongoing grievances of indigenous peoples.\u201d\n\nThe payouts have transformed some of the tribes into major economic players in a nation where Maori make up 15 percent of the country\u2019s 4.5 million people. They have also contributed to a broader cultural renaissance and improved prospects for Maori.\n\nTamiti Kruger, who led the negotiations for the Tuhoe tribe, or \u201ciwi,\u201d said the settlement provoked great emotion, especially for older tribal members.\n\n\u201cThey could not believe that they would be alive in a time when they would witness the return of their homeland,\u201d he said.\n\nThe settlements are the result of legal claims brought by tribes against the government for breaches of the nation\u2019s founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nThe 1840 agreement effectively handed Britain sovereignty of New Zealand while guaranteeing Maori certain rights over traditional land and fisheries. Versions in Maori and English stated different things, and the treaty\u2019s implications, including whether Maori ever willingly ceded sovereignty, continue to be debated.\n\nSoon after the treaty was signed, conflicts between Maori and white settlers over who owned land escalated into a war that killed hundreds of Maori warriors and British troops.\n\nThe government began settling claims a quarter century ago, apologizing for its past actions. Some whites argued the nation would go broke, and some Maori said it wasn\u2019t fair the government, a party to the negotiations, also got to dictate the terms, something the U.N. report cited as a flaw.\n\nBut a broad consensus has grown among lawmakers and Maori leaders that the process is working. Te Ururoa Flavell, New Zealand\u2019s Maori development minister, said the settlements have not only righted wrongs, but have also lifted Maori confidence.\n\nWith the finish line in sight, the pace of settlements has picked up. The government has signed 72 agreements and hopes to sign the final one by 2017.\n\nThe settlements appear to be improving the economic and social standing of Maori, who still lag behind white New Zealanders on many social measures. Maori have higher-than-average incarceration rates and a 12 percent unemployment rate, compared to a 4 percent rate for white New Zealanders. But the number of Maori who earned at least a bachelor\u2019s degree rose 56 percent between 2006 and 2013.\n\n\u201cAll of the stats that we see are that Maori, in pretty much every measure, from longevity to participation in schools, are improving,\u201d said Prime Minister John Key. \u201cAnd where the settlements have been, and where those iwi have had those resources, I think you can point to a faster improvement.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Zealand confronts violent past, gives new hope to Maori", "author": "Nick Perry", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New Zealand confronts violent past, gives new hope to Maori", "title": "New Zealand confronts violent past, gives new hope to Maori", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/15/new_zealand_confronts_violent_past_gives_new_hope_to_maori/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/new-zealand-maori-settlements.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Zealand confronts violent past, gives new hope to Maori", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/new-zealand-maori-settlements.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "New Zealand confronts violent past, gives new hope to Maori", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "New Zealand confronts violent past, gives new hope to Maori", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The 1840 agreement effectively handed Britain sovereignty of New Zealand while guaranteeing Maori certain rights over traditional land and fisheries.\nTe Ururoa Flavell, New Zealand\u2019s Maori development minister, said the settlements have not only righted wrongs, but have also lifted Maori confidence.\nMaori have higher-than-average incarceration rates and a 12 percent unemployment rate, compared to a 4 percent rate for white New Zealanders.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsWAITANGI, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 Their land was confiscated, their homes burned down and many of their people killed.\nThe government has apologized for its past atrocities, handed over 170 million New Zealand dollars ($128 million) and agreed the tribe should manage a sprawling, rugged national park it calls home."}
