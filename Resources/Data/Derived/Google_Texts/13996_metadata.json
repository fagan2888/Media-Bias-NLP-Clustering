This often repeated argument was one of the principal justifications for the Obama Heath Care Law. However, looking at the report\u2019s underlying methodology demonstrates the U.S. is, in fact, getting value for its money.\n\nWhat is the basis for the Commonwealth Fund conclusion that we get poorer health care even though we spend more? The report compared health care in 11 nations, based on \u201cpatients\u2019 and physicians\u2019 survey results on care experiences and ratings on various dimensions of care. \u2026 It also includes information on health care outcomes featured in The Commonwealth Fund\u2019s most recent (2011) national health system scorecard, and from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\u201d\n\nOne major way in which the study authors ranked quality was through a set of surveys. What is surprising is that although the authors note that Americans tend to be far more optimistic and more demanding than European counterparts, they brush the importance aside. They wrote,\n\n\u201cOne definition of \u2018quality\u2019 care is health services that meet or exceed consumer expectations. Even if the expectations of U.S. patients were higher than patients in other countries, the U.S. health care system should be held to the standard of meeting its consumers\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nThis standard of measuring quality is totally subjective. In effect, if US health care delivers better outcomes than systems abroad, but foreigners expect less of their health care system than Americans, the US health care system is deemed inferior. A worse foreign system is deemed superior just because its participants are resigned to the poorer outcomes! It is not a cancer outcome, or a wait time indicator, or any other measure that would just look at raw data.\n\nIncredibly, the Commonwealth Fund report never independently addresses any outcomes like cancer survival. It pays no attention, for example to the fact that Americans have better survival rates than Europeans for common cancers. [1] Studies show that breast cancer mortality is 52 percent higher in Germany than in the United States, and is 88 percent higher in the United Kingdom. Prostate cancer mortality is 457 percent higher in Norway, and 604 percent higher in the U.K.\n\nWhen the study actually looks at objectively measurable outcomes, such as life-expectancy, even these measures tend to be unbalanced. The Commonwealth study purports to look at the following measure of life-expectancy in tandem: mortality amenable to medical care, infant mortality, and healthy life expectancy at age 60.\n\nAt first glance, this metric shows the U.S. having the lowest life-expectancy among several first-world nations. However, life expectancy is not dependent exclusively on health care. If one adjusts for two simple factors, deaths from homicide, which are much higher in the U.S. than in other nations, and transportation accidents, the U.S. actually rises to the top! Documentation for these claims can be found here: www.nrlc.org/USHealthCarebetter.pdf\n\nFurther, not all countries define birth (and consequently infant mortality) the same way. For example, in the United States, arrivals of all live infants are counted as births. But many European nations have more restrictive definitions. For example, France and the Netherlands report live births only if the infant weighs at least 500 grams \u2014 a little more than a pound \u2014 or were born at 22 weeks\u2019 gestation or later. They show lower infant mortality than the US because they move the goal posts; deaths among premature infants are not counted, as they are in the U.S.\n\nSadly, although inaccurate for the time period it covered, the Commonwealth Fund report may be prophetic. As a consequence of Obamacare, America\u2019s hitherto high standard of health care may be declining. Although the data for the 2014 report was collected before the bulk of Obamacare\u2019s provisions took effect, there is reason to believe that due to the health law\u2019s mechanisms of reducing health care spending there will be a very real decline in healthcare available to Americans.\n\nAccording to the most recent CBO\u2019s report \u201cUpdated Estimates of the Effects of the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act, from April 2014,\u201d Obamacare will drive U.S. health care spending $104 billion below what had been projected over the next decade. These \u201csavings\u201d will come at tremendous cost in human lives.\n\nThe CBO report goes on to describe the reality \u2014 that while insurance premiums are being held down, there is solid and growing evidence that these plans restrict access to life-saving medical treatment for ourselves, our family members, and our loved ones.\n\nCBO writes, \u201cThe plans being offered through exchanges in 2014 appear to have, in general, lower payment rates for providers, narrower networks of providers, and tighter management of their subscribers\u2019 use of health care than employment-based plans do. Those features allow insurers that offer plans through the exchanges to charge lower premiums (although they also make plans somewhat less attractive to potential enrollees).\u201d\n\nLast year, when hundreds of thousands of Americans lost plans they liked, the administration claimed that the new exchange plans would be better than the old plans. This could not be farther from the truth for tens of thousands.\n\nAs millions of Americans are attempting to start using their new Obamacare exchange health insurance plans, stories about denial of treatment keep piling up. You can read more on this at nrlc.cc/QpXbrk. The newly issued CBO report confirms that exchange plans are restrictive. What\u2019s worse, this is by design.\n\nRarely reported in the mainstream media is an Obamacare provision under which exchange bureaucrats must exclude health insurers who offer policies deemed to allow \u201cexcessive or unjustified\u201d health care spending by their policyholders.\n\nUnder the Federal health law, state insurance commissioners are to recommend to their state exchanges the exclusion of \u201cparticular health insurance issuers \u2026 based on a pattern or practice of excessive or unjustified premium increases.\u201d The exchanges not only exclude policies in an exchange when government authorities do not agree with their premiums, but the exchanges must also even exclude insurers whose plans outside the exchange offer consumers the ability to reduce the danger of treatment denial by paying what those government authorities consider an \u201cexcessive or unjustified\u201d amount.\n\nThis means that insurers who hope to be able to gain customers within the exchanges have a strong disincentive to offer any adequately funded plans that do not drastically limit access to care. So even if you contact insurers directly, outside the exchange, you are likely to find it hard or impossible to find an adequate individual plan. (See documentation at www.nrlc.org/medethics/healthcarerationing.)\n\nWhen the government limits what can be charged for health insurance, it restricts what people are allowed to pay for medical treatment. While everyone would prefer to pay less\u2013or nothing\u2013for health care (or anything else), government price controls prevent access to lifesaving medical treatment that costs more to supply than the prices set by the government.\n\nWhile Obamacare continues to roll out in 2014, it is important to continue to educate friends and neighbors about the dangers the law poses in restricting what Americans can spend to save their own lives and the lives of their families. Is also key to point out that when Americans are allowed to spend more, they really do get more for their money.
