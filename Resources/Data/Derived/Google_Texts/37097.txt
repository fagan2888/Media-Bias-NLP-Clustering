Derby Liquor is offering a $500 reward for the identification and arrest of the people who shoplifted from the store in late December.

Steve Hornbeck and his wife own Derby Liquor in Derby, Kansas. Hornbeck says on December 30, 2015, three people entered his store, stealing an estimated $1,000 in liquor and cash. Hornbeck says his register did not balance out after that day.

The three people, two men and one large woman with a walker entered the store around 8:30 p.m., driving a GM car, possibly a Chevrolet Malibu or Oldsmobile Cutlass.

In the video Hornbeck released to KAKE News, he points out where the woman shoves a bottle of liquor into her bra.

"I couldn't believe the audacity of these people.....the nerve, just coming in here, acting like another day at the office for them," Hornbeck said.

At one point, one of the men tried to use a credit card, which the machine reader denied. Hornbeck says the man took the opportunity to take alcohol to his car while saying he would come back with another credit card. The next credit card was also denied.

The three people got away and the clerk did call 911.

Derby Liquor is updating their security video system and they have other plans to make sure they stop shoplifters if they ever come back.
