Another issue is the stigma associated with the mentally ill. Doctors can make more money and have less personal interaction with patients if they specialize in something else.\n\nRelated: Sheriff says mental health care in chaos\n\nAt issue is there are just not enough psychiatrists to go around and that\u2019s a major problem. In the last three years, the Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office was called to 32,988 cases involving a mentally ill person, according to information supplied by the jail. The majority of the time, police are forced to involuntarily hospitalize people under the state\u2019s Baker Act.\n\nThe medical community will soon have more locally produced psychiatrists from a residency program that began in July.\n\nJacksonville\u2019s first hospital-based psychiatric residency program at UF Health Jacksonville plans to produce three graduates a year.\n\nResidency programs are advanced training for doctors after they graduate from medical school. Newly minted residency graduates are usually in their 30s and are settled in an area, said Steven Cuffe, chairman of the psychiatry department at UF\u2019s College of Medicine in Jacksonville.\n\nThe residents have completed about 75 percent of their first year. Three new first-year residents will join the program July 1.\n\nJason Altmire, senior vice president of public policy and community engagement at Florida Blue, cited a Washington Post investigation that found 89 million Americans live in places where they don\u2019t have access to a mental-health professional.\n\nAnother access issue involves insurance coverage.\n\nAltmire, also a three-term former U.S. congressman, co-sponsored the 2008 Mental Health and Addiction Parity Act that requires insurance policies to treat mental illness the same as physical maladies. The problem was it only applied if insurance plans provided coverage for mental-health services, he said.\n\nMany plans opted out of including those services.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare, fixed that. It made mental-health services one of 10 \u201cessential health benefits\u201d that must be covered.\n\nOne issue with the \u201cessential health benefits\u201d is large group plans and plans that were grandfathered aren\u2019t required to provide mental health coverage, Altmire said.\n\nHe said there\u2019s another concern with the acts. In 2010, about 50 percent of psychiatrists didn\u2019t accept insurance, according to the Journal of American Medicine Association.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also brings millions of people into the health-care system but doesn\u2019t provide for more doctors to treat those patients, Altmire said.\n\nAltmire spoke about the topic and insurance-related mental health issues recently at the Jacksonville Community Council Inc.\u2019s inquiry into mental health. The organization has held weekly meetings about how mental illness is treated in Northeast Florida since the beginning of February.\n\nPrior to last summer, Jacksonville was one of the largest cities without a residency program, Cuffe said. \u201cIf you are a big city and you don\u2019t have a residency program, then generally the number of psychiatrists isn\u2019t enough to take care of the needs of the population,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are only four hospital-based psychiatric residency programs in Florida \u2014 including Jacksonville\u2019s. The others are Miami, Gainesville and Tampa.\n\nAbout 90 percent of psychiatric residents who graduated from UF\u2019s program stay in the state, Tandon said.\n\nTracking the exact number of practicing psychiatrists is difficult.\n\nTandon said at best there\u2019s about 1,800 practicing psychiatrists for a population of about 19.3 million. He said the number is probably closer to 1,500. The Florida Department of Health wasn\u2019t able to provide a breakdown of psychiatrists in the Jacksonville area or statewide.\n\n\u201cThis is all ball park,\u201d Tandon said.\n\nAbout 40,000 to 45,000 psychiatrists practice in the United States, he said. Florida\u2019s rate of psychiatrists per 100,000 residents is about 75 percent of the national average.\n\nCuffe said after doctors complete medical school, they are often anywhere from $100,000 to $200,000 or more in debt, and psychiatry is among the lowest-paying medical specialties.\n\nThat could be a factor, Cuffe said. He also said the stigma associated with mental illness has spilled over into the medical community as fewer doctors pursue psychiatric resident programs.\n\nBen Burris graduated from Texas A&M\u2019s College of Medicine before joining two other doctors as the first psychiatric residents in Jacksonville. Arthur Higgins, a graduate of St. George\u2019s University School of Medicine, and Neelam Sampley, a graduate of the Medical University of Lublin, are the other two residents.\n\nBurris said he didn\u2019t know what he wanted to specialize in when he started medical school. \u201cBut it became clear that I was interested in specialties with the brain,\u201d he said. \u201cThe complexity and the mystery of some aspects of the brain drew me in.\u201d\n\nCuffe said wanting to spend time with the patient is an important trait in a psychiatrist. \u201cI must say you must have to really enjoy talking and getting to know patients,\u201d he said.\n\nBurris has that needed trait.\n\n\u201cYou are exploring the world of emotions and behavior, which I find fascinating,\u201d he said.\n\nThe residency program is at UF Health Jacksonville but residents will also train at Baptist Health, Wolfson Children\u2019s Hospital, Gateway Community Services and Renaissance Behavior Health.\n\nDerek Gilliam: (904) 359-4619", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is a shortage of psychiatrists in the United States, and it\u2019s worse in Florida.Part of the state\u2019s problem is too few residency slots, said Rajiv Tandon, vice chairman of psychiatry at the University of Florida\u2019s College of Medicine in Gainesville.There\u2019s about 135 residency positions across the state, with about 25 percent of those graduating in any given year, Tandon said.", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "Jacksonville's first hospital-based psychiatric residency program at UF Health Jacksonville plans to pump out three graduates a year helping combat that shortage locally.", "title": "UF professor: Lack of psychiatrists is a problem", "url": "http://jacksonville.com/news/health-and-fitness/2014-03-19/story/uf-professor-lack-psychiatrists-problem", "image": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/Florida%20Daily%20Life%20%281%29-L.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#426ab2", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon70x70tiny1.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8iconLarge1.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/wide310x150.png", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/Win8icon.png", "keywords": "Health and Fitness, Metro, News", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon150x150square1.png", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"msm-image150": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense150x111/13182584.jpg", "msm-image319": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense319x185/13182584.jpg", "articleid": 604002, "publishtime": "2014-03-19T19:57:33Z", "msm-image320": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/cxense320/13182584.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Jacksonville\u2019s first hospital-based psychiatric residency program at UF Health Jacksonville plans to produce three graduates a year.\nAltmire spoke about the topic and insurance-related mental health issues recently at the Jacksonville Community Council Inc.\u2019s inquiry into mental health.\nRelated: Sheriff says mental health care in chaosAt issue is there are just not enough psychiatrists to go around and that\u2019s a major problem.\nThe medical community will soon have more locally produced psychiatrists from a residency program that began in July.\nThe residency program is at UF Health Jacksonville but residents will also train at Baptist Health, Wolfson Children\u2019s Hospital, Gateway Community Services and Renaissance Behavior Health."}
