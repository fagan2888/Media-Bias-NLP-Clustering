WASHINGTON, May 20 (UPI) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney accused President Barack Obama of "ignoring the law" and skating up to the edge of violating the constitution.

"I really feel as though Barack Obama is ignoring the law in many cases, and going far beyond what was ever intended. I mean he, all by himself, sort of routinely changes the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, if it suits his will," said Cheney on the Hugh Hewitt show. "I think much of what's been done does in fact skate up to the edge of violating the constitution in terms of the way he's interpreted his executive power."

Cheney did take care to mention that he is a "big advocate of the strong executive office," but thinks the president has exceeded that limit.

Cheney and former President Bush faced similar charges from critics over the administration's use of torture on terrorism suspects and actions in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, former Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, attempted to impeach Cheney for what he said were constitutional violations in 2007.
