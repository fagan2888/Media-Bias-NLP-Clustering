What has turned Washington into a wonky remake of Freaky Friday? The reauthorization of the Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank, a government-run enterprise that grants loans and insurance at below-market rates to facilitate large trade deals.\n\nDefenders of Ex-Im argue that the financing it offers, which they say would be difficult to obtain on the private market, helps open new markets to U.S. products and create jobs. That was the main point of White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest yesterday, who cited Ronald Reagan\u2019s past support for the bank. \u201cIt helps us meet our export goals,\u201d Earnest said, \u201cat no cost to taxpayers.\u201d Indeed, interest on the loans finances the bank\u2019s activities, which made $1 billion while supporting around $37 billion in export sales last year.\n\nBut pre-Internet liberals might want to get out their back issues of the Nation and Mother Jones at this point to jog their memory, for they will see article after article condemning the 80-year-old institution as a slush fund that allows the government to fund a series of nasty activities. Here\u2019s one from 1981 (\u201cThe Ex-Im helps sell nuclear reactors to dictatorships like the Philippines\u201d). Here\u2019s another from 1992, about the Reagan administration using Ex-Im to funnel loans to Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq during their war with Iran. Even more recently, in 2011, Mother Jones reported on how Ex-Im loan guarantees helped build one of the largest coal plants in the world, in South Africa. (Ex-Im subsequently announced it would stop facilitating coal plant production \u2013 but only in December of last year.)\n\nEx-Im wasn\u2019t just a minor annoyance, but a lefty cause c\u00e9l\u00e9bre. Here\u2019s Sen. Bernie Sanders, back when he served in the House, eviscerating Ex-Im on the floor in 2002, when it came up for reauthorization then. Sanders asked why American taxpayers would provide \u201chuge subsidies and loans to the largest multinational corporations in the world, who pay their CEOs huge salaries \u2026 and companies take this money from the taxpayers and say, thank you very much, and oh by the way, we are laying you off because we are going to China and hiring somebody at 20 cents an hour.\u201d\n\nSanders crafted bipartisan legislation to reform Ex-Im to better protect manufacturing workers, but the bill\u2019s markup got canceled at the last minute. \u201cMy suspicion is that the moneyed interests who like the Export-Import Bank as it is right now sent down the word from the top that that markup never take place,\u201d he told his House colleagues.\n\nBack then, liberals highlighted how Enron, the failed energy giant, benefited from $675 million in Ex-Im loans. In 2002, Sanders also pointed out that Ex-Im gave an $18 million loan to a Chinese steel mill, which was later on accused of dumping steel into U.S. markets and hurting U.S. workers. And it was common just a decade or so ago for lefties to call Ex-Im the \u201cBank of Boeing,\u201d because close to 60 percent of all Ex-Im loans facilitated their aircraft sales. Sanders in particular pointed out that Ex-Im aid for a Boeing sale to the Chinese military ended up displacing workers, as some manufacturing for the aircraft moved from Wichita to China. \u201cThe Export-Import Bank is helping General Electric ship jobs to Mexico \u2026 helping AT&T ship jobs to China. And on and on it goes,\u201d Sanders concluded.\n\nAnd Sanders certainly did not believe that financing for multinational trade deals would dry up without Ex-Im. He questioned the head of the bank in 2004, asking, \u201cGeneral Electric, which itself is one of the largest financial institutions in America, cannot get loans anyplace else but from the taxpayers and the workers of America? Are you going to tell me with a straight face that GE is a struggling small business, a minority business in the barrio of New York, and they just cannot find financing?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nowadays, Democrats are defending Ex-Im, and the right is calling it \"corporate welfare.\" It wasn't always that way", "author": "David Dayen", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Nowadays, Democrats are defending Ex-Im, and the right is calling it \"corporate welfare.\" It wasn't always that way", "title": "Wingnuts and liberals\u2019 bizarre role reversal: Why Export-Import Bank politics are so perverse", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/25/wingnuts_and_liberals_bizarre_role_reversal_why_export_import_bank_politics_are_so_perverse/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/mccarthy_sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nowadays, Democrats are defending Ex-Im, and the right is calling it \"corporate welfare.\" It wasn't always that way", "creator": "@ddayen", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/mccarthy_sanders.jpg", "title": "Wingnuts and liberals\u2019 bizarre role reversal: Why Export-Import Bank politics are so perverse", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Wingnuts and liberals\u2019 bizarre role reversal: Why Export-Import Bank politics are so perverse", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Bernie Sanders, Editor's Picks, Export-Import Bank, hypocrisy, Kevin McCarthy, Mother Jones, Ronald Reagan, The Left, The Nation, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0179\"", "article_summary": "The reauthorization of the Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank, a government-run enterprise that grants loans and insurance at below-market rates to facilitate large trade deals.\n\u201cThe Export-Import Bank is helping General Electric ship jobs to Mexico \u2026 helping AT&T ship jobs to China.\nBack then, liberals highlighted how Enron, the failed energy giant, benefited from $675 million in Ex-Im loans.\n\u201cMy suspicion is that the moneyed interests who like the Export-Import Bank as it is right now sent down the word from the top that that markup never take place,\u201d he told his House colleagues.\nAnd it was common just a decade or so ago for lefties to call Ex-Im the \u201cBank of Boeing,\u201d because close to 60 percent of all Ex-Im loans facilitated their aircraft sales."}
