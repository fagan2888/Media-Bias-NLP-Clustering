At some point during the week, she scribbled some notes on an umbrella that she was able to push out of the car and open for people to see.\n\nPHOTOS: View more images of Kristin Hopkins standing on her new prosthetic leg\n\nHikers eventually found the car May 4 about 140 feet off U.S. 285 at Red Hill Pass, northwest of Fairplay. Rescuers didn\u2019t realize initially that Hopkins was still alive inside.\n\nHer organs were shutting down, and her temperature was 77 degrees, but Hopkins survived, although doctors had to amputate her feet.\n\nOn Friday, therapists at Hallmark Nursing Center in Denver showed her how to put on her prosthesis and helped her try on her shoes on the rubber foot.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine putting a red shoe on that foot, but it will happen,\u201d she said, with her parents nearby.\n\nNow, about seven weeks after being rescued, Hopkins has made leaps in her recovery and expects to go home in about a week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cNervous, too. That means I\u2019m on my own.\u201d\n\nTherapists will work with Hopkins to get her comfortable first on the parallel bars, then moving her to use a walker and finally a cane.\n\nWhen she first leaves, Hopkins will move in with her parents, but their wheelchair-inaccessible home is providing more motivation.\n\nAs she puts it, \u201cI have to be on my feet.\u201d\n\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yeseniarobles", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Woman trapped in car for week stands on a new prosthetic leg", "title": "Woman trapped in car for week stands on a new prosthetic leg", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/20/woman-trapped-in-car-for-week-stands-on-a-new-prosthetic-leg/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620__kristin-hopkins-prosthetic-legp1.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140620__kristin-hopkins-prosthetic-legp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-20T13:12:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:10:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe43cc\"", "article_summary": "Kristin Hopkins got to stand on a new prosthetic leg Friday, more than a month after both her feet were amputated.\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine putting a red shoe on that foot, but it will happen,\u201d she said, with her parents nearby.\nHopkins doesn\u2019t recall driving on that road far from her home in Douglas County, and she can\u2019t imagine where she might have been going.\nBut the feeling was frustrating, she said, as only one of the two prosthetic legs was available Friday.\nWhen she first leaves, Hopkins will move in with her parents, but their wheelchair-inaccessible home is providing more motivation."}
