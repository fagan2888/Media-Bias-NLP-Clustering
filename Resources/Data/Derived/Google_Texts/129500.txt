The last thing the 2016 presidential election needs is a renewal of the Donald Trump-Rosie O’Donnell feud, but we may now have just that.

O’Donnell made a surprise appearance at “Disaster the Musical” on Broadway on Thursday and went for Trump’s jugular in a song parody based on a tune from Grease, “There Are Worse Things I Can Do.”

Last night, Rosie O’Donnell joined us for a VERY special #DisasterRelief performance with her own Donald J. Trump version of “There Are Worse Things I Could Do” from Grease! #PrepareForDisaster Posted by Disaster – On Broadway on Friday, April 8, 2016

Very much in her element, O’Donnell was well received and hit the Republican front-runner on a number of controversial issues that have come up in the campaign for the White House.

“I could build a giant wall, Mexico pays for it all,” she sang. “And repeal Obamacare, do that weird thing with my hair. It’s a comb over, it’s true, that’s a thing I’d never do.”

She even got a dig in over her adversary’s alleged tiny hands.

“Get endorsements from the Klan, brag about my tiny hands,” she continued. “Ban all Muslims coming in, and have bright-orange skin, that’s a shade I eschew.”

And being Rosie, she had to wrap it up with a little vulgarity.

“Tell Ted Cruz I’ll spill the beans, we still don’t know what the f*** he means!” she added.

Trump has yet to respond to the slight, but it’s unlikely his silence will continue for very long… or will it?
