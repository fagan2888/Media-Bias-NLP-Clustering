The new team has extended a three-year contract offer to Tebow to become its signal caller when it takes the field in 2014. The New England Patriots released the former University of Florida Heisman Trophy winner on August 31 after he failed to make the NFL team\u2019s 53-man roster.\n\nIn an interview, Simmons made his feelings clear about Tebow\u2019s Christian values:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a religious passion, as well he should, we\u2019re in America.He\u2019s proud to be a Christian, what\u2019s wrong with that? And yet, with sports media and pop culture media, they make fun of his religion. Really? In America? If he was wearing a burqa, they wouldn\u2019t dare say anything. But if you\u2019re a Christian, you get to be picked on? What the hell? The guy\u2019s got family values. I never saw the media picking on Michael Vick for torturing dogs. Or this other football player, who\u2019s alleged to have killed, committed murder. That\u2019s \u2018cool.\u2019 But a guy who guy who\u2019s religious and has got family values isn\u2019t \u2018cool?\u2019 He\u2019s cool to me.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 I think religion is good for mankind. Without the Ten Commandments \u2014 Jews gave you that \u2014 Without that, there\u2019d be chaos\u2026\u201d\n\nThe KISS bassist also said in the radio.com interview that he and team execs will be meeting in person with Tebow soon about the arena gig and noted that the quarterback would receive the respect \u201cthat he didn\u2019t receive in the NFL.\u201d\n\nBack in June, Patriots owner Robert Kraft also expressed admiration for Tebow\u2019s faith-based background. \u201cFor me personally, having Tim Tebow on this team he\u2019s someone who believes in spirituality, he\u2019s very competitive and works hard and has a great attitude and he\u2019s a winner. So having him as part of our franchise is great but he has to compete just like anyone else. We\u2019re blessed to have a lot of people like that, but the fact that spirituality is so important to him is very appealing to me.\u201d\n\nTebow \u2014 who currently does not have a job with any NFL team \u2014 is probably well aware that playing in the Arena Football League worked out for Kurt Warner, who went on to win a Super Bowl with the St. Louis Rams.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tim Tebow's fervent religious beliefs have received strong support from rocker (and reality TV star) Gene Simmons.
