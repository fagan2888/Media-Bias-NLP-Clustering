It\u2019s still used, however, because it remains an effective way to demonstrate conclusively that liberal bias in fact exists, the protestations of some of America\u2019s leading publications notwithstanding. It\u2019s a useful way to demonstrate hypocrisy at play. No matter what the issue, one side gets battered while the other side does not, sauce only for the goose and not for the gander.\n\nTake the expansion of Medicaid, the latest political football to emerge after the United States Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nAs enacted, the health care law required states to enlarge their Medicaid programs in order to meet the needs of the so-called working poor, who might otherwise be burdened by the act\u2019s mandate that every American obtain some form of health insurance or pay a fine. In deference to the notion of federalism, the court held that the federal government could not order the individual states to expand Medicaid as they implemented the law. Any expansion would have to be undertaken voluntarily.\n\nAs it now stands, Republicans are mostly opposed to the idea while Democrats \u2013 who are using the issue to portray the GOP as insensitive to the concerns of the needy \u2013 are generally for it, with the merits of doing and not doing so usually omitted in coverage designed to tug at the heartstrings of the voters.\n\nIt\u2019s a lackadaisical attitude that works to the benefit of Democrats like John Foust, who is running against Republican Barbara Comstock for the open seat in Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on the Democratic Party]\n\n\n\n\u201cBarbara Comstock would stop Virginians from receiving our own tax dollars back from Washington for the sake of her right-wing agenda,\u201d says a posting on Foust's campaign website.\n\n\u201cComstock\u2019s decision to once again go along with extremists in Richmond has real consequences for us: increasing healthcare costs for everyone, costing our state more money, and jeopardizing support for important priorities that we care about,\u201d Foust said in a statement tied to his opponent\u2019s opposition to Medicaid expansion.\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good, but what Foust neglects to mention anywhere \u2013 and he\u2019s made himself quite a presence in the northern Virginia district where the contest is playing out \u2013 is that his wife, a practicing OB-GYN in a toney area of upper northwest D.C., doesn\u2019t accept Medicaid patients in her practice. Neither do any of the partners in her practice. who include the wife of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who, one may presume, supports the president\u2019s view that the expansion of Medicaid would be a good thing for America.\n\nWhat makes the hypocrisy more sensational is that Foust uses his wife, who practices under her maiden name, as a campaign surrogate and spokesman on health care issue. She\u2019s out on the trail, urging people to vote for her husband because he supports the expansion of Medicaid when she herself won\u2019t take any patients who use it, according to facts first reported by the Washington Free Beacon.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on the 2014 Congressional Elections]\n\nIf the situations were reversed, if Foust opposed the Medicaid expansion and Comstock attacked him for it (and Comstock\u2019s husband were a physician who did not accept patients on Medicaid), the story would be on television again and again and again. But because Foust is the Democrat and has a chance of winning, the Washington media corps has been largely silent, lest they disrupt his chance to claim the seat for the party of the Affordable Care Act and Obama.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "peter-roff/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Media Are Letting Democrat John Foust Get Away With Medicaid Hypocrisy", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The media are letting a Democratic candidate get away with serious health care hypocrisy.", "title": "Media Medicaid Malpractice", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-roff/2014/07/21/media-are-letting-democrat-john-foust-get-away-with-medicaid-hypocrisy", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/2d/68/b79c50dd4d9e8a2cf4c8aff700d0/140721-johnfoust-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The media are letting a Democratic candidate get away with serious health care hypocrisy.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Media Are Letting Democrat John Foust Get Away With Medicaid Hypocrisy"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "July 21, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Peter Roff,politics,Medicaid,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,Democratic Party,2014 Congressional elections,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The media are letting a Democratic candidate get away with serious health care hypocrisy."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33ae\"", "article_summary": "What makes the hypocrisy more sensational is that Foust uses his wife, who practices under her maiden name, as a campaign surrogate and spokesman on health care issue.\nComparing the way the media treat candidates, once partisan affiliation is overlaid atop a given issue, is a tired, old saw in conservative commentary.\nTake the expansion of Medicaid, the latest political football to emerge after the United States Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\nIn deference to the notion of federalism, the court held that the federal government could not order the individual states to expand Medicaid as they implemented the law.\nIt\u2019s a useful way to demonstrate hypocrisy at play."}
