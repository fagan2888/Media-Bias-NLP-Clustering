It was a nationwide licensing scheme.\n\nBy law, roughly one-quarter of all American workers must have a license to do their job, a fivefold increase from the 1950s, according to a recent White House report. The study, \u201cOccupational Licensing: A Framework for Policymakers,\u201d was produced by the Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Economic Policy, the Council of Economic Advisers, and the Department of Labor.\n\nLoving says the unexpected IRS regulations threatened the core of her business, since she wasn\u2019t able to hire employees and expand.\n\n\u201cI worked in corporate America for 12 years as an accountant,\u201d Loving says. \u201cI did everything I was supposed to. I went to school. I have two degrees. Started a career. And that did not protect me.\u201d\n\nAt the time, she estimates, the new regulations cost her several hundred dollars to a thousand dollars per employee.\n\n\u201cA lot of tax preparers are seasonal, and they only do a handful of returns per year,\u201d Alban says. \u201cIt quickly becomes not worth it to prepare [a return] if you then also have to pay $116 to take an exam, $63 to get a [personal tax identification number], however much the continuing education costs. All of those costs add up.\u201d\n\nWith the help of Alban, and the Institute for Justice\u2019s Clinic on Entrepreneurship at the University of Chicago, Loving and two other tax preparers sued the IRS. Last year, she won the case, Loving v. Commissioner.\n\n\u201cThe IRS invented out of whole cloth these regulations, and did not actually have the statutory authority to implement them,\u201d Alban says. \u201cBoth the U.S. District Court here in D.C. and the D.C. Circuit agreed with us, and the IRS decided not to appeal to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nIt was a victory for Loving, a small business owner who calls America \u201cthe land of opportunity.\u201d\n\nDespite that victory, though, Loving still fights to operate her business free of intrusive regulations.\n\nAn amendment proposed by the Senate Finance Committee, led by Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, would alter Title 31 of the U.S. Code to give the IRS the authority to regulate tax preparers.\n\nThe bipartisan bill, which also takes steps to protect taxpayers against identity theft, went through a committee markup Wednesday.\n\nLoving, saying her livelihood is threatened, testified against the proposal Tuesday in front of the Senate committee.\n\nWhen Loving finished sharing her story, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, thanked her for \u201cparticularly powerful testimony\u201d and for \u201cstanding up to the power of government and the power of big money and lobbying.\u201d\n\nLoving wonders why that power is arrayed against her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still growing a business, I\u2019m only 5 years old,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd for someone to try to put you out of business when you\u2019re just getting started. \u2026 Why now?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "I did everything I was supposed to.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "I did everything I was supposed to.\"", "title": "Meet the Single Mom Who Took On the IRS", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IRS1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-13T09:22:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1VHGhiK"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "I did everything I was supposed to.\"", "title": "Meet the Single Mom Who Took On the IRS", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IRS1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "regulation", "published_time": "2015-10-09T11:03:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-13T09:22:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Regulation, tax preparation, tax preparers, Chicago, IRS, overregulation, Sabina Loving, red tape, Orrin Hatch, Ted Cruz"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17e5\"", "article_summary": "The IRS argued that the 127-year-old law, enacted before the nation had an income tax, allowed them to extend current rules to tax preparers.\nCritics, arguing that tax preparers already were strictly regulated, called it overstepping.\n\u201cA lot of tax preparers are seasonal, and they only do a handful of returns per year,\u201d Alban says.\n\u201cI opened my business in 2010, I incorporated in 2010, and in 2011, they started the whole licensing conversation,\u201d Loving says.\nLoving says the unexpected IRS regulations threatened the core of her business, since she wasn\u2019t able to hire employees and expand."}
