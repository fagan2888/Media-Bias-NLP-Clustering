And Accenture predicts there will be 3,000 by 2017 as patients say they prefer to see doctors without having to wait days to schedule an appointment.\n\nWait Times for Doctors Decrease, Even as More Americans Enter Health Care System: Infographic from Vitals (Graphic courtesy of vitals.com)\n\nWait times differed dramatically by specialty. Psychologists have the shortest wait time on average (11 minutes, 33 seconds), whereas pain management specialists have the longest (24 minutes, 52 seconds).\n\nLocation also affects wait times. Patients in New Hampshire \u2014 the luckiest \u2014 wait 15 minutes, 4 seconds, while Alabama patients wait the longest, with an average of 23 minutes, 25 seconds.\n\nThis is the sixth annual wait time report from Vitals, which calculated data based on patient reports. The numbers have see-sawed over the last five years, but all remained at about 20 minutes.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "MEREDITH ENGEL", "twitter": {"description": "The average wait time at a doctor's office dropped a full minute from last year.", "title": "Doctors\u2019 office wait times get shorter: study", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/doctors-office-wait-times-shorter-study-article-1.2161945", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2161944.1427304616!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/178548599.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "doctor's office wait time, doctor's office wait time study, vitals.com wait time,", "parsely-author": "Meredith Engel", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "doctor's office wait time, doctor's office wait time study, vitals.com wait time,", "nydn_tags": "obamacare, health studies", "news_keywords": "doctor's office wait time, doctor's office wait time study, vitals.com wait time,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/doctors-office-wait-times-shorter-study-article-1.2161945", "parsely-title": "Doctors\u2019 office wait times get shorter: study", "sailthru.date": "2015-03-25T13:31:43-0400", "sailthru.title": "Doctors\u2019 office wait times get shorter: study", "nydn_section": "Health", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-03-25T17:31:43", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2161944.1427304616!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/178548599.jpg", "description": "The average wait time at a doctor's office dropped a full minute from last year.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "The average wait time at a doctor's office dropped a full minute from last year.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Health", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "The average wait time at a doctor's office dropped a full minute from last year.", "title": "Doctors\u2019 office wait times get shorter: study", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/doctors-office-wait-times-shorter-study-article-1.2161945", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2161944.1427304616!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/178548599.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "obamacare, health studies", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2161944.1427304616!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/178548599.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "MEREDITH ENGEL", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "Wait Times for Doctors Decrease, Even as More Americans Enter Health Care System: Infographic from Vitals (Graphic courtesy of vitals.com)Wait times differed dramatically by specialty.\nThe average wait time at a doctor's office dropped a full minute from last year \u2014 and you can thank Obamacare for it, according to a new study.\nPatients in New Hampshire \u2014 the luckiest \u2014 wait 15 minutes, 4 seconds, while Alabama patients wait the longest, with an average of 23 minutes, 25 seconds.\nLocation also affects wait times.\nPsychologists have the shortest wait time on average (11 minutes, 33 seconds), whereas pain management specialists have the longest (24 minutes, 52 seconds)."}
