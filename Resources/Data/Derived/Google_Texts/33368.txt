A review of campaign financial disclosure and company documents reveals that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) may have committed ethics violations during his 2012 run.

TIME Magazine published the report Friday, showing that Cruz failed to publicly disclose his relationship with a Caribbean-based private equity firm founded by his college roommate. The senator eventually noted the financial ties in 2013, but failed to meet Senate regulations that call for the identity and location of the company, according to TIME's review.

“It was an omission that was inadvertent,” Cruz told TIME Thursday, adding that he is working to make any necessary corrections.

The Cruz case emerges after an eventful three-week period which saw him at the forefront of the 2013 government shutdown. After unsuccessfully leading the tea party charge to defund Obamacare, which included a 21-hour speech on the Senate floor, Cruz decided not to block the Oct. 16 deal that reopened the government and raised the nation's debt ceiling.

Polls show that the government shutdown may have affected Cruz's favorability among American voters. According to HuffPost Pollster's compilation of 13 publicly available surveys, a Sept. 21 reading saw 26 percent view Cruz unfavorably, compared to 25.9 percent seeing him favorably. By the tail end of the shutdown, an Oct. 13 reading saw a six percent shift in the unfavorable direction.
