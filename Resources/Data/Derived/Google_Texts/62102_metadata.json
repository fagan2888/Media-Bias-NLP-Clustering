Now, Washington state is rolling out a new pilot program that would allow new parents to take their babies to work with them.\n\nUnder the new law, known as the \u201cInfant-at-Work Program Policy,\u201d new parents (both mothers and fathers) at the Traffic Safety Commission will be able to bring their babies to the office. There\u2019s an age limit: Babies must be at least 6 weeks old and can come in until they\u2019re 6 months old, which is typically when they start to crawl or become \u201cmobile.\u201d\n\nAllowing parents to bring their kids to work would in theory encourage them to come back to work sooner, and would boost retention of employees. Keeping parents close to their babies at a young age also \u201csupports critical bonding, healthy infant brain development, and parental well-being,\u201d the program officials state. \u201cIt also enables exclusive breastfeeding, which improves lifelong health.\u201d\n\nThe question is: Will it work? Babies \u2014 little nuggets wrapped up in a mess of crying, changing diapers, and awful smells \u2014 might become a distraction for both the parent and co-workers. The office would need to adjust a lot of things to make it work, like giving the parent a spare room to change diapers or soothe a shrieking infant, allowing mothers to breastfeed during meetings, or giving the parent the flexibility to go home early if their infant is sick or uncooperative.\n\nThe notion poses a lot of challenges. It sounds difficult, and even impossible \u2014 but past experiments conducted by progressive companies in the U.S. have been successful. According to Bloomberg, there are more than 180 companies in the U.S. that allow babies to come into work with their parents every day, and many of them have proven that their family-bearing employees are much happier that way. It reduces the stress of worrying about the baby at home or at day care, and gives the parents more leeway to bond and care for their child.\n\n\u201cMore than 80 babies have graced our offices, with both moms and dads participating,\u201d Gay Gaddis, a female entrepreneur who pioneered bring-your-baby-to-work at her company, wrote in Forbes. \u201cThe program has been recognized by the White House and has become ingrained in our agency\u2019s culture. More rewarding is that the program has enabled [us] to retain and attract amazing people \u2014 the lifeblood of the creative and technology sides of our business.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s all about flexibility and patience, as well as the willingness to make it work no matter what. \u201cEighteen years ago, I stopped asking whether women could have it all and started developing programs that truly supported men and women as they worked toward their versions of \u2018leaning in\u2019\u201d Gaddis wrote.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "new, parents, can, now, bring, their, baby, work, every, day, thanks, new, washington, state, law", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new program in Washington state aims to help parents bond longer with their children after birth, allowing them to bring their babies to work.", "title": "It's Now Bring Your Child To Work Day \u2014 Every Day \u2014 In Washington", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-parents-can-now-bring-their-baby-work-every-day-thanks-new-washington-state-law-347646", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/12/baby-bottle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new program in Washington state aims to help parents bond longer with their children after birth, allowing them to bring their babies to work.", "title": "It's Now Bring Your Child To Work Day \u2014 Every Day \u2014 In Washington", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-parents-can-now-bring-their-baby-work-every-day-thanks-new-washington-state-law-347646", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/12/baby-bottle.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/12/baby-bottle.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-12T18:01:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-12T18:17:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new program in Washington state aims to help parents bond longer with their children after birth, allowing them to bring their babies to work."}, "article_summary": "If the company handles it properly, allowing parents to bring babies to work might not be as distracting as it seems.\nNow, Washington state is rolling out a new pilot program that would allow new parents to take their babies to work with them.\nKeeping parents close to their babies at a young age also \u201csupports critical bonding, healthy infant brain development, and parental well-being,\u201d the program officials state.\nUnder the new law, known as the \u201cInfant-at-Work Program Policy,\u201d new parents (both mothers and fathers) at the Traffic Safety Commission will be able to bring their babies to the office.\nIt reduces the stress of worrying about the baby at home or at day care, and gives the parents more leeway to bond and care for their child."}
