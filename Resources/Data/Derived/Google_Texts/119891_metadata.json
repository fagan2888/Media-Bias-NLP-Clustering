His office had no immediate comment Monday.\n\nLawrence Grayson, a spokesman for the bank, said the bank was pleased with the 2nd Circuit\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe three-judge panel, in a ruling written by Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley, said trial evidence came up short.\n\nThe appeals court said the claims arose in 2012 after a former employee of Countrywide sued the company, alleging that a division of Countrywide Home Loans that had specialized in subprime loans acted fraudulently after it transformed itself into a prime origination division after the subprime market collapsed in 2007. The United States later joined the lawsuit.\n\nAfter a jury found the bank and an employee liable, the trial judge imposed a $1.27 billion penalty against the bank and a $1 million penalty against an executive who oversaw the creation of a loan origination process called the \u201cHigh Speed Swim Lane\u201d beginning in August 2007. The program nicknamed the \u201cHustle\u201d lasted until May 2008.\n\nAutos\n\nToyota recalls\n\nmore air bags\n\nToyota Motor Corp. is recalling nearly 1.6 million vehicles in the U.S. to replace potentially faulty front passenger air bag inflators made by Takata Corp. of Japan.\n\nThe action expands what was already the biggest automotive recall in U.S. history. The U.S. government announced this month that 17 automakers \u2014 including Toyota \u2014 are adding 35 million to 40 million Takata inflators to the 28.8 million that have already been recalled after multiple investigations showed more vehicles could be affected.\n\nThe latest recall includes Toyota, Scion and Lexus models from the 2006-2011 model years.\n\nThe government said the inflators must be replaced before they are 6 years old, when the risk of rupture increases.\n\nThe first phase of the expansion covers vehicles from the 2011 model year or older that are registered in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands (Saipan), and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nVermont\n\nVasectomies\n\nwithout copays\n\nVermont is poised to become the first state to require public and private health insurance to cover vasectomies without copays and deductibles under a bill Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin signed into law Monday.\n\nThe legislation inserts mandates from the federal Affordable Care Act but goes beyond them to include additional birth control methods, such as vasectomies.\n\nShumlin, surrounded by lawmakers who supported the bill and officials with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, lamented moves elsewhere in the country to curtail birth control.\n\n\u201cAt a time when our country is headed in the wrong direction, I\u2019m proud to say Vermont continues to head in the right direction,\u201d Shumlin said.\n\nRegional Planned Parenthood President Meagan Gallagher added, \u201cThe ability to plan, prevent and space pregnancies directly benefits women, men, children and society through increased educational and economic opportunities for women, healthier babies, more stable families, and, as a result, a reduced taxpayer burden.\u201d\n\nChronicle News Services", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "sailthru.author": "Chronicle News Services", "description": "Bank of America Corp. was not liable for fraud and subject to a penalty of more than $1.2 billion for its actions before the economy collapsed in 2008 despite a jury\u2019s finding to the contrary, a federal appeals court ruled Monday.
