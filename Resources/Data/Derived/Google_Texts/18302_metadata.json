The stocks with the highest concentrations of hedge fund ownership have become some of the market\u2019s biggest losers. That underperformance has a lot to do with the kinds of companies that hedge funds prefer to own (think fast-growing, but volatile). You can read more about them in Fortune\u2019s feature, \u201cWhen Hedge Funds Are Toxic for Stocks.\u201d\n\nBut the trend also points to an opportunity for individual investors. The stocks least owned by hedge funds just turned in their strongest six-month returns since 2008. More important, these stocks have some features in common that long-term investors cherish. They tend to be larger companies by market value, and compared to the hedge-fund favorites, they have less debt, grow earnings more slowly but consistently, and pay bigger dividends. Here, we found six stocks that fit that mold, and should be worth owning regardless of what the \u201chedge-fund hotels\u201d do down the line.\n\n1 / Oracle\n\nWith the second-lowest hedge fund ownership in the S&P 500 (0.6% of its shares, just behind CMS Energy cms ), Oracle orcl has been ignored by the activists and their ilk\u2014and several top money managers would just as soon have it stay that way. Oracle is trading at 14 times its next 12 months of earnings\u2014a fraction of the valuation of many of its Silicon Valley peers. (The S&P 500 Information Technology Sector Index has a forward P/E of 16.) Investors have worried that Oracle will have a hard time catching up with Salesforce\u2019s crm cloud business, says Bob Olstein, whose Olstein Funds manage about $900 million. Yet Oracle\u2019s cloud revenue has grown 41% annually for the past five years, almost twice as fast as rival Salesforce\u2019s cloud (and total) revenue has grown.\n\nOracle\u2019s sales skipped a beat last year as it more aggressively transitioned from selling licenses of its database software to selling subscriptions to its Internet-based cloud product. But that changes later this year, says Dan Davidowitz, who oversees $9 billion as the chief investment officer of Polen Capital: As Oracle\u2019s cloud business begins to hit its stride, its earnings will grow at least 10% annually over the next five years, he predicts. Oracle\u2019s Fortune 500 business customers tend to stick with what they\u2019ve got for a while: \u201cNobody leaves Oracle, ever,\u201d Davidowitz says. While Amazon amzn launched a competing service earlier this year, Oracle\u2019s corporate offerings are more robust, says Olstein: \u201cAmazon is basically a storage company up in the cloud. [Oracle] is solving your problems.\u201d Oh, and Oracle offers something Amazon doesn\u2019t: a dividend, yielding 1.5%.\n\n2 / UnitedHealth Group\n\nThough it\u2019s the biggest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth\u2019s unh insurance business isn\u2019t what excites investors about the stock (investors other than hedge fund managers, who own about 1%). The company\u2019s short foray into the Affordable Care Act\u2019s public marketplace was largely a mistake; UnitedHealth says it will drop most of its Obamacare plans, which have cost it millions in losses. But investors are treating United\u2019s cutting bait as a victory: Those 800,000 customers represented less than 2% of the insurer\u2019s 47.7 million members, and while the company may lose revenue, it will reap an extra 5% to 6% in earnings growth \u201cjust by pulling back,\u201d says Laton Spahr, manager of the $2 billion Oppenheimer Value Fund. Overall, Wall Street estimates that UnitedHealth\u2019s earnings will grow 33% this year, nearly five times what it expects for the S&P 500.\n\nBut the \u201cjewel within the company,\u201d according to Mark Henneman, manager of the top-performing Mairs & Power Growth Fund, is its health care analytics unit, Optum. With Optum\u2019s database of medical treatments, prices, and success metrics, UnitedHealth is using the unit internally to reduce costs and also selling its services to other companies and organizations. Optum enjoys higher margins than insurance too: Its consulting unit, OptumInsight, makes up less than 4% of the company\u2019s overall revenue but about 12% of its operating profits. Five to seven years from now, Spahr believes, UnitedHealth will be more a technology company than an insurance company. In the meantime, investors can collect its dividend, which has grown an average of 32% annually for the past five years.\n\n3 / 3M\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to surmise why hedge funds have largely ignored 3M mmm : It\u2019s the opposite of a momentum stock. It grows slowly, though steadily (averaging more than 6% earnings-per-share growth for the last decade), and has been managed so methodically from one CEO to the next that it has paid out a dividend every year for the past 99\u2014and increased that dividend annually for the past 58. \u201cIt\u2019s part of what we think makes up a quality business and therefore makes it so we can remain patient with them,\u201d says Eric Schoenstein, manager of the $5 billion Jensen Quality Growth Fund, which invests only in companies that have returned at least 15% on equity every year for the past decade.\n\nHedge funds aren\u2019t exactly known for their patience, which 3M has required a bit more of lately. Less than half of the company\u2019s revenue\u2014on everything from Post-its to odds and ends such as Ace bandages, road signs, and LCD touchscreens\u2014comes from the U.S., and the strong dollar shaved 3% off its revenue in the first quarter alone. But 3M\u2019s geographic and product diversification should work in its investors\u2019 favor over the long term, and already the currency headwind is abating, Schoenstein says, adding, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about a company that\u2019s selling thousands of different products in about 200 countries.\u201d\n\nThough 3M\u2019s stock has risen recently as investors have turned from momentum companies to less volatile stalwarts\u2014it\u2019s up 12% year to date\u2014its P/E valuation is only slightly higher than the market average, and it has a nearly 3% dividend yield. Wall Street expects its earnings to grow 7% to 9% annually over the next few years.\n\n4 / United Technologies\n\nUnited Technologies\u2019 utx refusal in February to entertain Honeywell\u2019s hon takeover proposal might seem like the kind of move to attract an activist hedge fund manager. But as Edward Jones\u2019s Kate Warne points out, the aerospace manufacturer and defense contractor, less than 2% of which is owned by hedge funds, has already been doing things that hedge funds frequently recommend.\n\nLast year the company sold its Sikorsky Aircraft helicopter business, which makes Black Hawk military choppers, for $9 billion in cash. It used the money to buy back stock, making up for the earnings hit it took by divesting the subsidiary. Still, the stock trades at about 15 times expected 2016 earnings, compared with 17 for the S&P 500. That\u2019s why Honeywell came knocking, Warne believes, and why United Technologies rebuffed the offer as too low. The company has plenty of room to grow on its own, with brand-name products\u2014including Otis elevators (the world\u2019s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, has 57 of them) and Pratt & Whitney plane engines\u2014as well as cameras and sensors for unmanned aircraft (a.k.a. drones). Warne expects United Technologies\u2019 earnings to grow an average of 9% over the next few years, and it is aggressively returning capital to shareholders. It has a dividend yield of nearly 3%, and last October it announced a plan to buy back a total of $12 billion in shares by the end of 2017. Analysts expect the stock to return 10% to 20% in the next year, including dividends.\n\n5 / Ecolab\n\nTrading at 26 times earnings, Ecolab ecl isn\u2019t cheap, but the quality of its business, combined with the fact that the stock has been beaten up lately, has created a window to buy it when it\u2019s poised to bounce back. Ecolab makes cleaning supplies and industrial chemicals for restaurants and hotels and also provides oilfield services\u2014a business that has suffered recently because of low energy prices. But Ecolab\u2019s chemistry technology, which allows customers to use less water and energy and recycle their waste better, has been especially attractive at a time when beleaguered oil and gas producers are looking to maximize efficiency any way they can. (It\u2019s also easier on the environment.) \u201cWe think their oil and gas business will remain under pressure for a while, but it will be a tailwind too,\u201d says Henneman.\n\nRather than cut back on its energy investments as its competitors have, Ecolab has used the industry\u2019s distress as an opportunity to scoop up market share from rivals, including Halliburton HAL and Baker Hughes bhi , which have been struggling even more, Henneman says. While Ecolab\u2019s revenue is expected to decline slightly this year and its earnings are expected to inch up 2%, much of that is a result of currency headwinds: Excluding the foreign-exchange issues, Henneman expects its earnings to grow 11% to 12% over the next few years, as free cash flow increases and margins improve further. Plus, Ecolab has paid a dividend since 1978 and has increased it annually since 1993, averaging 17% growth for the past three years.\n\n6 / ADP\n\nPolen Capital\u2019s Davidowitz calls ADP adp one of his \u201csafeties,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s sacrificing growth, he says: He expects ADP to grow its earnings per share (EPS) 10% to 13% annually over the next five years. Handling payroll and other human resources functions for employers, ADP is benefiting from the way the Affordable Care Act has complicated those tasks. As more employers decide that\u2019s too big a job to handle internally, ADP is \u201cconstantly adding new customers and constantly adding more employees from their existing customers,\u201d Davidowitz says.\n\nADP is another company making moves that hedge funds sometimes demand, without their being involved. (Hedge funds own 1% of ADP.) For example, the company spun out its slower-growing car-dealership-software business, CDK Global, in 2014, allowing ADP to better focus on its core businesses, Davidowitz says.\n\nOne of ADP\u2019s biggest challenges in recent years may also be starting to abate: low interest rates. As ADP collects the taxes withheld from employees\u2019 paychecks, it also ends up sitting on a substantial sum of money, which it invests, creating a second revenue stream for the company\u2014similar to the way Warren Buffett invests insurance premiums collected by Berkshire Hathaway brk.a . But ADP, which invests the float in fixed-income securities, has made a relative pittance on it for the past several years. \u201cEven with that headwind, they\u2019ve managed double-digit earnings growth,\u201d Davidowitz says; if and when rates rise, the stock could have an even stronger run.\n\nMore from the Fortune Midyear Investor\u2019s Guide:\n\n\u2022 When Hedge Funds Are Toxic for Stocks\n\n\u2022 Why Starbucks Is a Hedge-Fund-Proof Stock\n\n\u2022 3 \u2018Hedge-Fund Favorite\u2019 Stocks to Avoid\n\nA version of this article appears in the June 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline \u201cSeven Stocks to Buy Right Now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hedge funds, stocks, stocks to buy now, 3M, MMM, Oracle, ORCL, ADP, UnitedHealth, United Technologies, Ecolab", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Fortune", "title": "6 Stocks You Should Own Because Hedge Funds Don\u2019t", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/mid-06-01-16-illo1.png?w=820&h=570&crop=1", "url": "http://fortune.com/stocks-to-buy-hedge-funds/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Fortune 500 Daily & Breaking Business News", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 859381007513473}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "bitly-verification": "d31810b12dd9", "application-name": "Fortune", "keywords": "hedge funds, stocks, stocks to buy now, 3m, mmm, oracle, orcl, adp, unitedhealth, united technologies, ecolab", "article": {"author": "http://fortune.com/author/jen-wieczner/"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fortune.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dab01945b542bffb69b4f700d7a35f8f?s=16", "description": "These six companies\u2014in tech, healthcare and more\u2014have low hedge-fund ownership, and that's good for investors looking for stocks to buy now."}, "article_summary": "But as Edward Jones\u2019s Kate Warne points out, the aerospace manufacturer and defense contractor, less than 2% of which is owned by hedge funds, has already been doing things that hedge funds frequently recommend.\nThe stocks least owned by hedge funds just turned in their strongest six-month returns since 2008.\nThat underperformance has a lot to do with the kinds of companies that hedge funds prefer to own (think fast-growing, but volatile).\nHedge funds aren\u2019t exactly known for their patience, which 3M has required a bit more of lately.\n3 / 3MIt\u2019s not hard to surmise why hedge funds have largely ignored 3M mmm : It\u2019s the opposite of a momentum stock."}
