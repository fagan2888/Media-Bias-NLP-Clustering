Fishing derby draws dads to Volkening Lake in Schaumburg

hello

What's Father's Day without a little fishing?

Families didn't have to find out. The Schaumburg Park District held a fishing derby Saturday at Volkening Lake under picture-perfect skies.

Prizes were given for the shortest fish, the longest fish, the most fish caught and the most unique fish caught.
