Lou Barletta (R-PA) said that President Barack Obama\u2019s executive amnesty will only encourage employers to replace American workers with illegal immigrants who will be exempt from Obamacare mandates.\n\nOn the House floor, Barletta, who has introduced the Defense of Legal Workers Act (H.R. 5761), which prevents the federal government from issuing work permits to illegal immigrants, mentioned that the \u201ctoxic intersection\u201d of Obamacare and Obama\u2019s executive amnesty gives employers a $3,000 per worker incentive to hire illegal immigrants who have just received work permits. Under federal law, since illegal immigrants who receive work permits cannot receive Obamacare, employers will not have to pay $3,000 in \u201cpenalties\u201d for each illegal immigrant employee not provided health insurance.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThat will drive companies to hire illegal immigrants instead of legal American workers,\u201d Barletta said, noting that employers will want to get rid of American workers for cheaper illegal immigrant replacements. He said the country has been put in this position is because the \u201cYes we can\u201d campaigner is governing by the philosophy of \u201cBecause I want to.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the week, Barletta grilled Homeland Security Security Jeh Johnson about the impact of Obama\u2019s executive amnesty on American workers.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to illegal immigration, the conversation is always focused on how to help the illegal immigrants, who have broken our laws,\u201d Barletta said earlier in the week. \u201cNo one ever wants to talk about how granting them amnesty will affect legal American workers. It\u2019s about time someone stood up for the millions of people who are looking for work, but who will now find millions of new competitors for jobs that are already scarce.\u201d\n\nRegarding the incentive that employers will have to hire illegal immigrants over American workers when Obama\u2019s executive amnesty is enacted, Barletta said, \u201cwhat I can\u2019t figure out is if that\u2019s an unintended consequence or a planned feature of the president\u2019s policies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lou Barletta: Exec Amnesty Incentivizes Employers to Get Rid of American Workers for Cheaper Illegal Immigrants", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Lou Barletta: Exec Amnesty Incentivizes Employers to Get Rid of American Workers for Cheaper Illegal Immigrants", "title": "Lou Barletta: Exec Amnesty Incentivizes Employers to Get Rid of American Workers for Cheaper Illegal Immigrants - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Immigration/immigration-act-now-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/04/lou-barletta-exec-amnesty-incentivizes-employers-to-get-rid-of-american-workers-for-cheaper-illegal-immigrants/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lou Barletta: Exec Amnesty Incentivizes Employers to Get Rid of American Workers for Cheaper Illegal Immigrants", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Immigration/immigration-act-now-ap.jpg", "title": "Lou Barletta: Exec Amnesty Incentivizes Employers to Get Rid of American Workers for Cheaper Illegal Immigrants - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Illegal Immigrants, Jeh Johnson, Lou Barletta,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Lou Barletta", "published_time": "2014-12-04T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcac1d\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cThat will drive companies to hire illegal immigrants instead of legal American workers,\u201d Barletta said, noting that employers will want to get rid of American workers for cheaper illegal immigrant replacements.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Thursday, Rep.
