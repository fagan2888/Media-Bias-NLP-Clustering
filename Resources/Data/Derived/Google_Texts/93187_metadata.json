Using the name \"laurie bouzan,\" one user wrote: \"Verizon/Boston Fox 25 can't reach deal and no service to customers. Corporate greediness on Thanksgiving Day!\"\n\nVerizon said that Cox removed WFXT TV, the local affiliate of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's Fox TV network, and the WFXT Movies station from its FiOS TV network because it refused to accept an agreement \"that contained rates that are not in our customers' best interests.\"\n\nVerizon said it was working with Cox to renew their agreement and restore the affected channels.\n\nThe company was playing a 30-second video loop on Fox channels in which a woman said: \"We are working hard to get this channel back at a reasonable price. Cox-owned WFXT wants millions more in fees, which will ultimately mean higher costs for our customers. Don't you think you are paying enough for TV?\"\n\nFox and Cox Media Group were not immediately available for comment.\n\nIn a statement online, Verizon said that it is \"diligently negotiating with Cox for a retransmission deal that will be fair and reasonable for our customers.\"\n\nRecently, CBS Corp and satellite operator Dish Network Corp avoided a blackout of CBS TV shows and its heavily watched Thanksgiving Day NFL game as the two sides agreed to extend a deadline into next week to try to hash out the details of a new contract.
