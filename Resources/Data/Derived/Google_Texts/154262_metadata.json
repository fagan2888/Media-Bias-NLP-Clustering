We know this means we need to admit that summer is really over \u2014 not that it's felt a whole lot like summer around here lately \u2014 but we are still always glad for move-in day at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point.\n\nWell, maybe not for the day, when things tend to get a bit congested around the campus. But certainly for the return of Stevens Point's student population, and for the thousands of families who entrust their children's education to our city's university.\n\nAnyone who went away to college can remember the bittersweet emotions of move-in day; and more than a few parents here on Thursday fought back tears when confronted with the fact that their kids had become young adults. So it is every year \u2014 and every year it's touching.\n\nStory: UWSP welcomes students to tobacco-free campus\n\nStory: Locals offer advice to UWSP freshmen\n\nStevens Point Journal Media captured some great images of students and families moving in; we talked with those who are returning and those just starting college; and we heard from residents about their tips and advice for grads. Move-in day is a big day for a lot of people, and a big day for Stevens Point.\n\nA new goose problem\n\nBuy Photo The cardboard dogs set up in Pfiffner Pioneer Park in Stevens Point are intended to deter geese away from the grass, but these ducks did not mind approaching them. (Photo: Sari Lesk/Stevens Point Journal Media)\n\nIt seemed like a foolproof plan.\n\nPfiffner Pioneer Park had a goose problem. Geese don't like dogs. The city decided to fashion dog cutouts whose silhouettes would guard the park. The geese, not known as the keenest observers in the animal kingdom, would see the dog cutouts, mistake them for real dogs and proceed to do their business elsewhere. Pfiffner Park would be safe again for humans and for animals not prone to be scared off by cardboard cutouts.\n\nThe plan came crashing down, unfortunately, when some scofflaw, presumed to be human but possibly in league with goose elements, absconded with the silhouettes.\n\nStory:Police on hunt for hot dogs\n\nThis is a problem, but we at Stevens Point Journal Media believe we have the solution. The city should create a cardboard cutout of a police officer, which it can perch next to the dogs. Anyone who would want to steal a dog-cutout will see the police-cutout and fear they'll be arrested, and the park will once again be safe for all.\n\nHave you seen YOU?\n\nOur latest YOU magazine is available both in print and online.
