Prior to the expansion, single men without dependent children were not eligible unless they were blind, chronically disabled and unable to work, or over the age of 65.\n\nMore than 275,000 Ohioans are now eligible for Medicaid after the age and disability requirements have been removed, as well as the need to be responsible for a dependent minor.\n\nAn estimated 17,000 Butler County residents are now eligible for Medicaid, said Jerome Kearns, director of Butler County Job and Family Services. He said the county office has approved 126 cases under the new rules.\n\nCelia Carmichael, 59, of Middletown, said she\u2019s waiting to find out whether or not she\u2019s been approved after being without any medical coverage for the past four years. Carmichael said she has delayed visits to her doctors by up to 12 months.\n\n\u201cI need a mammogram and a good check up,\u201d Carmichael said. \u201cNothing\u2019s going right for me.\u201d\n\nCarmichael, who is jobless right now, said she\u2019s been searching for steady employment. She previously worked six years as a security guard at AK Steel but could never afford the health insurance available to her.\n\nCarmichael said after applying for an insurance plan through the federal marketplace, she was told she would need to pay $475 a month with a $4,000 deductible.\n\n\u201cI have no money, no income. How could I pay for that?\u201d Carmichael said. \u201cI can\u2019t find a job; I\u2019m having a terrible time.\u201d\n\nSince Oct. 1, the state has received about 17,000 applications for Medicaid through the new website, benefits.ohio.gov, said Sam Rossi, spokesman for Ohio\u2019s Department of Medicaid. More than 50,000 unique visits have been made to the website.\n\nRossi said the applications are both from those 275,000 newly eligible, as well as from a pool of 231,000 residents who were previously eligible and just now applying after the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandated health coverage in 2014.\n\nRossi said an additional 25,000 Medicaid applications were submitted by Ohio residents through the online federal marketplace, healthcare.gov, but were never forwarded to the state benefits office due to website malfunctions. He said anyone that submitted an application through the federal website is encouraged to reapply at benefits.ohio.gov.\n\nJennifer and Jon Turner, of Hamilton, said their family of four submitted an online application for Medicaid on Dec. 9. They are still waiting for confirmation on whether they are eligible and being approved.\n\n\u201cEvery day since then we have been checking our mailbox and answering machine waiting for a determination,\u201d Jennifer Turner said. \u201c\u2026 We were relying on having our coverage back on Jan. 1.\u201d\n\nJennifer Turner said her family had been on a temporary Transitional Medicaid program that expired at the end of October. Since then, the family has had to cutback and watch all their spending in order to afford the prescriptions needed for three members of the family.\n\nAt the nonprofit Community Behavioral Health in Hamilton and Middletown, case managers have been helping new and existing clients with the Medicaid application process, said Laura Sheehan, vice president of Community Behavioral Health.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a lack of knowledge among some people and confusion with how they\u2019re eligible and what they can get,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cThis will be tremendous for our community. People will be able to get care they couldn\u2019t previously because they couldn\u2019t pay for it.\u201d\n\nSheehan said after the expansion, Community Behavioral Health reassigned a traditional case manager to take on the Medicaid-specific needs of clients. She said a second Medicaid case manager may be added this month to keep up with demand.\n\n\u201cSome people were lined up waiting for the application date because they know what the changes mean for them,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cThey\u2019re very excited to have access \u2026 and a door has opened for them.\u201d\n\nThere are more than 2.4 million Ohioans currently on Medicaid, Rossi said. Health coverage under the joint state-federal insurance program can include hospital and emergency room, pregnancy, prescriptions, preventive health, alcohol and drug addiction, dental and mental health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hundreds of thousands of Ohioans are awaiting the fate of their applications for health coverage under the state\u2019s expansion of Medicaid.", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/waiting-game-for-medicaid-applicants/ncbFW/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/53/5b/JN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of Ohioans are awaiting the fate of their applications for health coverage under the state\u2019s expansion of Medicaid.", "title": "Waiting game for Medicaid applicants"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hundreds of thousands of Ohioans are awaiting the fate of their applications for health coverage under the state\u2019s expansion of Medicaid.", "site": "@journalnews", "card": "summary", "title": "Waiting game for Medicaid applicants"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "journal-news", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/waiting-game-for-medicaid-applicants/ncbFW/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2224620/news/news/waiting-game-for-medicaid-applicants/ncbFW/", "keywords": "HJNhomepage", "google-site-verification": "4Q9_13tOch6eLcVYCHatUepAlnmJQbgHMCB16qdjcy0", "news_keywords": "HJNhomepage"}, "article_summary": "By Hannah PoturalskiStaff WriterHundreds of thousands of Ohioans are awaiting the fate of their applications for health coverage under the state\u2019s expansion of Medicaid.\nHealth coverage under the joint state-federal insurance program can include hospital and emergency room, pregnancy, prescriptions, preventive health, alcohol and drug addiction, dental and mental health.\nAn estimated 17,000 Butler County residents are now eligible for Medicaid, said Jerome Kearns, director of Butler County Job and Family Services.\nJennifer and Jon Turner, of Hamilton, said their family of four submitted an online application for Medicaid on Dec. 9.\n\u201cSome people were lined up waiting for the application date because they know what the changes mean for them,\u201d Sheehan said."}
