PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — Advocates have been pressing insurance companies to pay for medicines taken by autistic subscribers, and currently people in 43 states are now benefiting according to Judith Ursitti, Director of State Government Affairs for Autism Speaks. She says if you’re left with the bill, there are options.

“You can look at the marketplace plans under Obamacare in your state too, if you go to healthcare.gov. Most of those do require coverage for pharmacy care for autism spectrum disorder,” said Ursitti.

An alternative is to challenge the insurance company’s refusal to pay by filing a complaint with your state’s Department of Insurance.
