(AP) \u2014 Vermont is poised to become the first state to require public and private health insurance to cover vasectomies without copays and deductibles under a bill Democratic Gov. Peter Shumlin signed into law Monday.\n\nThe legislation inserts into state law mandates from the federal Affordable Care Act but goes beyond them to include additional birth control methods, such as vasectomies.\n\nShumlin, surrounded by lawmakers who supported the bill and officials with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, lamented moves elsewhere in the country to curtail birth control.\n\n\u201cAt a time when our country is headed in the wrong direction, I\u2019m proud to say Vermont continues to head in the right direction,\u201d Shumlin said.\n\nThe regional Planned Parenthood president, Meagan Gallagher, added, \u201cThe ability to plan, prevent and space pregnancies directly benefits women, men, children and society through increased educational and economic opportunities for women, healthier babies, more stable families, and, as a result, a reduced taxpayer burden.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, took a less positive view.\n\n\u201cWe opposed the provision, in part because the bill failed to address the underlying prices charged for the services which is the what contributes to higher deductibles and co-pays for consumers,\u201d spokeswoman Clare Krusing said in an email.\n\nMaryland\u2019s governor signed similar legislation earlier this month, but it doesn\u2019t take effect until 2018. Key provisions of Vermont\u2019s bill take effect in October. Maryland\u2019s bill does one thing Vermont\u2019s bill doesn\u2019t: It provides coverage of emergency contraceptives like the Plan B morning-after pill.\n\nCalifornia preceded Vermont and Maryland with state guarantees for birth control coverage, but California did not include vasectomies, said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst with the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which follows reproductive health issues and laws.\n\nVermont\u2019s and Maryland\u2019s laws provide a patient with oral contraceptives for minimum periods of time with just one visit to a doctor. In Vermont it\u2019s 12 months, and in Maryland it\u2019s six, Nash said.\n\nVermont is increasing reimbursement rates to health providers to encourage them to provide patients with long-acting reversible contraceptives, like the intrauterine device.\n\nVasectomies may be new ground, but Rep. Chris Pearson, a Vermont Progressive Party member from Burlington, said coverage for them makes sense to him. He said he had a vasectomy more than two years ago after he and his wife had a second child.\n\n\u201cTwo\u2019s enough, and that had been our goal,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was healthy and wonderful, and we said, \u2018All right, let\u2019s take care of this.'\u201d\n\nHe said he thinks vasectomies are \u201ca really good solution for families.\u201d\n\nBackers of the law say many states have been slow to enforce the birth control requirements of the Affordable Care Act, requiring insurance companies, for example, to cover more expensive birth control methods like the IUD.\n\nThey note, too, that if a new administration and Congress repeal the ACA, the state laws would remain in effect.\n\nWhat others are clicking on:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The legislation inserts into state law mandates from the federal Affordable Care Act but goes beyond them to include additional birth contro\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=380703612", "og": {"site_name": "NBC4i.com", "description": "The legislation inserts into state law mandates from the federal Affordable Care Act but goes beyond them to include additional birth control methods, such as vasectomies.", "title": "Vermont bill mandates coverage for vasectomies, other birth control", "url": "http://nbc4i.com/2016/05/23/virginia-bill-mandates-coverage-for-vasectomies-other-birth-control/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_99112901069.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The legislation inserts into state law mandates from the federal Affordable Care Act but goes beyond them to include additional birth control methods, such as vasectomies.", "title": "Vermont bill mandates coverage for vasectomies, other birth control", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/ap_99112901069.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@nbc4i", "site": "nbc4i", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "birth control, health care, vasectomies Health, National, News", "msapplication-tooltip": "Columbus, Ohio News, Weather and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_09ba3f0df1447f40e98674ba9d62c747", "fb": {"pages": 38342932750}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nbc4i.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6f1d97944cdcea2214c0f42e5738057f?s=16", "application-name": "NBC4i.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NBC4Columbus", "published_time": "2016-05-23T21:57:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T23:25:42+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "Y7Un57nax7y1Nq_Ap5-4MFnKkuvSsOsEzQ67vpVKTFQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The legislation inserts into state law mandates from the federal Affordable Care Act but goes beyond them to include additional birth control methods, such as vasectomies.\nShumlin, surrounded by lawmakers who supported the bill and officials with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, lamented moves elsewhere in the country to curtail birth control.\nMaryland\u2019s bill does one thing Vermont\u2019s bill doesn\u2019t: It provides coverage of emergency contraceptives like the Plan B morning-after pill.\nCalifornia preceded Vermont and Maryland with state guarantees for birth control coverage, but California did not include vasectomies, said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst with the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which follows reproductive health issues and laws.\nAP PhotoMONTPELIER, Vt.
