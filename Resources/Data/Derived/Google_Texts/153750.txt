Abortion giant Planned Parenthood has released its annual report for 2013-2014. The report summarizes the organization’s political and social activities over the last year, highlighting its involvement in promoting the Affordable Care Act and its opposition to the Supreme Court case in which Hobby Lobby won the right to not cover abortion-causing drugs in its insurance plan.

In the report, Planned Parenthood also broke down its services by number and kind. Planned Parenthood primarily highlights its performance of STI/STD testing, and the provision of a range of contraceptives (this year, they specifically highlighted long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs). Together, STD testing and contraceptives account for over 8 million “services” at Planned Parenthood in 2013. In total, Planned Parenthood counts 10,590,433 “services” provided in 2013.

The report states that the organization committed 327,653 abortions in 2013. This is an increase of nearly 500 abortions compared with 2012 and marks the seventh straight year over 300,000. The number of abortions continued to hover around 3% of total services according to Planned Parenthood’s accounting method. Pro-life groups have been critical of the manner in which Planned Parenthood counts services and have created the following video in response which points out that abortions constitute 94% of Planned Parenthood’s pregnancy services.

While abortion numbers continue to climb at Planned Parenthood, according to the Susan B. Anthony List, the group’s cancer prevention services are down 17% since 2012. Also down is taxpayer funding, which dropped by 2% since 2012; however, the group still receives over $1.4 million per day and reports $127 million in excess revenue for fiscal year 2012.

The Susan B. Anthony List condensed several key pieces of information from the report, which can be found in a printable fact sheet here.
